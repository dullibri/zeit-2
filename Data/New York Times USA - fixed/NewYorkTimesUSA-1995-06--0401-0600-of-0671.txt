HEADLINE: Claire Sterling, 76, Dies; Writer on Crime and Terror

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Claire Sterling, an American author and correspondent based in Italy, who was known for her writings on terrorism, assassination and crime, died yesterday in a hospital in Arezzo, Italy. She was 76 and lived in outside of Cortona, near Arezzo.
She had cancer of the colon, her husband said. 
 Mrs. Sterling was based in Italy for more than 30 years and traveled widely. Her most recent book, "Thieves' World: The Threat of the New Global Network of Organized Crime" (1994, Simon & Schuster), was praised by Stephen Handelman, of the Harriman Institute of Advanced Soviet Studies at Columbia University, as making "a significant contribution to post-cold-war debate" by affirming "that the growing interdependence among nation-states and financial institutions has made it easier for crime syndicates to cooperate across national boundaries."
In an earlier book, "Octopus: the Long Reach of the International Sicilian Mafia" (1990), she examined the Sicilian Mafia and charged gangster-chieftains based in Palermo with creating a multinational empire with the United States as its longtime main target.
In her 1984 book "The Time of the Assassins," Mrs. Sterling examined the attempt by a Turk, Mehmet Ali Agca, to kill Pope John Paul II in 1981. She contended that Mr. Agca had "come to Rome as a professional hit man, hired by a Bulgarian spy ring." She presented what she called "massive proof that the Soviet Union and its surrogates have provided the weapons, training and sanctuary for a worldwide terror network aimed at the destabilization of Western democratic society."
Mrs. Sterling's contention about a Bulgarian role in the attack was disputed, but writing in 1991, she maintained that Italian courts in 1988 had "expressed their moral certainty that Bulgaria's secret service was behind the papal shooting."
She also attracted wide attention with her 1981 book "The Terror Network," which traced connections among terrorist groups around the globe. William Abrahams, who edited the book for Holt, Rinehart & Winston, said that while she was writing it, the Italian Government posted a guard at her house to protect her.
A decade later, the New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis reported that William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence in the Reagan Administration, had held up a copy of "The Terror Network" before a group of official intelligence experts and had "said contemptuously that he had learned more from it than from all of them."
Mrs. Sterling's first book was "The Masaryk Case" (1969), about Jan Masaryk, the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister who was reported to have leaped to his death in 1948 from a window of his Prague apartment. She concluded that he had been killed by Soviet or Czechoslovak Stalinists to keep him from defecting to the West.
In her decades abroad, she also wrote articles for The New York Times, Atlantic Monthly, The Reporter magazine, Life, Reader's Digest, Harper's, The New Republic, The Washington Post, International Herald Tribune and The Financial Times.
Mrs. Sterling was born Claire Neikind in Queens, received a bachelor's degree in economics from Brooklyn College, and worked for a time as a union organizer among electrical workers.
In 1945 she received a master's degree from the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, which awarded her a Pulitzer Traveling Scholarship.
She went on to work in Rome for what she described in a 1981 interview as "a fly-by-night American news agency." She learned Italian, and when the agency went out of business, she returned to the United States and joined the staff of The Reporter magazine, which began publication in early 1949.
Mrs. Sterling recalled that when she applied for the Reporter job, Max Ascoli, the magazine's Italian-born publisher and editor, said, "If anybody's going to write about Italy around here, it's me." So because of her union experience, she became the labor editor.
In 1951, she married Tom Sterling, a writer. She remembered that "Max Ascoli's wedding present to me was a six-month assignment in Rome."
Mrs. Sterling's six-month assignment lasted 17 years, ending only when The Reporter ceased publication in 1968. By then, the Sterlings were accustomed to life in Italy, where Mr. Sterling had written some of his more than a dozen books. So Mrs. Sterling, keeping Italy as her base, began writing her Masaryk book.
She is survived by her husband; a son, Luke, of Cortona; a daughter, Abigail Vazquez of San Francisco; two grandchildren, and a sister, Ethel Braun of Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Fiscal Triage At Hospitals: Doing Less With Fewer

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
Thousands of hospital employees have lost their jobs this year, and tens of thousands more have had their working conditions change drastically as hospitals deal with a drop in revenues caused by lower reimbursements from Medicaid, Medicare and insurance companies.
The cuts this year have been made at institutions across the city, from prestigious, world-renowned medical centers to small local hospitals. Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn, for one, laid off 95 employees. Flushing Hospital Medical Center in Queens cut 60. Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx cut its personnel budget by 5 percent. New York Hospital let 126 people go -- 89 at its Manhattan location and 37 at its psychiatric center in White Plains. In addition, 22 psychiatrists and 4 psychologists on contract at the White Plains site were told that their positions were being eliminated. 
 The layoffs and reorganizations -- the largest the industry has seen in decades -- are expected to accelerate now, health care professionals said, as the city's 75 public and private hospitals absorb the latest round of budget deals from City Hall and Albany.
The displacement has shaken the lives of people throughout the hospitals -- file clerks and pharmacists, laundry workers and dietitians, nurses and social workers. Even doctors, whose jobs have traditionally been spared from cost-cutting realities, have been laid off now.
Pearl Bailey is one of the casualties of the current budget season. When she gets up in the morning, she chooses a professional-looking outfit from her closet -- a simple skirt, a matching sweater, a pair of hose and some comfortable shoes. She does her hair, fixes her makeup and leaves her apartment in Howard Beach, Queens, with the flow of rush-hour commuters heading off to work.
But instead of boarding the No. 15 bus and transferring to the No. 4 subway that for 15 years took her to her job as a lab technician at Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital on the Upper East Side, Mrs. Bailey does errands in her neighborhood, goes to a computer class and wonders if she will ever find her way back into the health care industry.
"I love my job -- loved my job," said Mrs. Bailey, who was laid off recently from the hospital. "I loved greeting the patients. I loved being very precise in drawing the blood and analyzing it. I even loved the lab coat I wore. I could see the layoff coming and the people at the hospital, they were all very nice to me. But after 15 years and all my time there, I felt like I was being thrown away, like garbage."
For the lucky, the staff cuts have meant new assignments to unfamiliar tasks and the gnawing tension that their job security is tenuous. And health care professionals all over the city say that those people left working in hospitals are being asked to shoulder an intolerable workload, one that could prove dangerous to patients and staff.
"We are already seeing increased rates of bedsores because we don't have the staff to turn the patients as often as we should," said Anne Bove, a critical-care nurse and instructor at Bellevue Hospital Center. "People are not getting their medications on time. Nurses just can't possibly get them out in the set time intervals because there are so many patients they are looking after. And what does this do to the staff? It leaves them feeling tense and inadequate."
And for people like Mrs. Bailey, who is 48, there are financial worries, a drop in self-esteem, loneliness and the fear that it will be a long time before they work in a hospital again.
"My job was me, it was who I was," said Mrs. Bailey, adrift in her apartment on a recent afternoon. "Now the few people still left in my old department have to chip in and do my work and I, I wish I were them."
The flood of layoffs has been particularly distressing, representatives of hospitals and employees said, because health care had been promoted lately as a ripe field expected to be a source, not a sieve, for jobs.
"The health care community was growing steadily and was expected to continue to grow," said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a trade group representing 167 hospitals and nursing homes in the New York region. "But now we are seeing major dislocation."
Linda Ruiz has worked in health care for only three years and already she has lost jobs twice because of downsizing brought on by the vicissitudes of managed care and government cutbacks.
Ms. Ruiz said she thought she was beginning a new career in the health care field three years ago, when she decided to work as an assistant in a chiropractor's office. She had graduated from the Fashion Institute of Technology and had looked forward to a career in fashion, but she found that new international trade agreements had left the industry in a flux and newcomers, like herself, on the outside. "Health care was supposed to be a growing field," said Ms. Ruiz, who is 33. "It seemed a smart way to go. Not anymore. I can tell you that very personally."
The chiropractor let her go a year after she started working for him when health maintenance organizations and managed care companies cut his reimbursement rates and he was forced to cut his staff. She then got a job as a medical records clerk at Peninsula Hospital, a small, private community hospital in Far Rockaway, an ideal seven-minute drive from her apartment in Rockaway Park.
In February, after two years, Ms. Ruiz was laid off.
"The axe was at my neck for a while," she said. "But when it fell, it still hurt. I thought I had found a new career."
The blow to her self-image was harder that she had expected. She feels as though she has failed to get a foothold in any field. The help-wanted ads offer no relief and she can no longer face visiting friends at the hospital.
She is now taking a computer course paid for by her union, Local 1199 of the hospital workers' union, hoping to improve her skills and eventually, somehow, to find a new hospital job.
Financially, Ms. Ruiz is barely making ends meet with no margin for the unexpected, like breakdowns in her 18-year-old car. For six months, she will get about half of her $23,000 annual salary -- about $220 a week -- in unemployment compensation. The union gives her an additional $150 stipend every two weeks.
Keith Hanson is among the fortunate. He was not one of the 445 people who lost their jobs this year at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. But each day when he finishes his shift as a nurse on the AIDS unit, he said he breathes a sigh of relief for one disaster or another that was barely averted.
"There are just fewer and fewer people working with patients who are sicker and sicker," said Mr. Hanson, who works a 7 P.M. to 8 A.M. shift three days a week. "It's a prescription for problems. Look, when I first started nine years ago, they guaranteed us a 4-to-1 patient-to-nurse ratio. Now on average I have seven patients a night and because of managed care, the people who come to the hospital these days are in an emergency situation or in much worse shape than when I started."
There used to be more specialty staff to share the work, Mr. Hanson said. A special team of nurses was responsible for starting intravenous lines, freeing the bedside nurses for other chores. Now that team has been disbanded and the work absorbed by the dwindling number of regular nurses.
"Every night something happens," Mr. Hanson said. "I get to someone who is already gasping because he needs to be suctioned. Someone else is about to fall out of the bed because he needs to get to the commode and I couldn't answer the call bell fast enough because I was in with someone else or in the middle of fixing I.V. bags. We are barely in control of this unit. We are running from emergency to emergency."
Elliot Bardavid, a social worker at the Rusk Institute of the New York University Medical Center, said his colleagues were in a perpetual state of anxiety, worrying about patients and fearing for their own jobs.
"There's no relief," said Mr. Bardavid, a social worker for 18 years. "It's a very disheartening and frightening environment."
It is a situation that is unlikely to change soon. In fact, many health care workers warn it is likely to get worse as new cuts in Medicaid and Medicare financing and pressure from managed care force hospitals to pare their staffs even more to stay afloat.
"Whoever hasn't had layoffs will have them," said Dr. Herbert Pardes, vice president for health sciences at Columbia University and dean of the university's College of Physicians and Surgeons. "We're asking psychiatrists to take on more patients, maybe 20 percent to a third more clinical responsibility. We have to for financial reasons. And there's a danger in this. If this thing is driven so hard by money, what kind of care or sensitivity is there for the patients? And what kind of reward is there for workers feeling overburdened and misused? On the one hand, we could be more efficient. But you could go to excess with these cutbacks and I believe the balance is in danger of tipping in the wrong direction."
For Mr. Hanson, the AIDS nurse at St. Luke's-Roosevelt, the anxiety of working in a hospital that he believes is understaffed has already proved too much to bear. So he is leaving the hospital this month to begin work in a hospice in lower Manhattan that takes in people dying of AIDS.
"I am going to a place that is more nurse-friendly and more patient-friendly," said Mr. Hanson, who is at once relieved and regretful about his decision. "At this point in the hospital, talking to people, ministering to people is out of the question. The nursing part of nursing -- holding hands, care issues -- are impossible given these conditions. I spend most of my time interceding in acute medical emergencies. We don't have any time to provide emotional support. This isn't the same hospital I came to. I doubt any hospital is."

HEADLINE: On Sunday;
Being a Man And a Father Is Being There

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
BY biology and familial connections Geoffrey Canada is the father of four. By mutual affection and choice he fathers many others.
Mr. Canada is a man of many faces. He is president of the Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families, a group based in Harlem that aids poor children. He is on tour for his first book, "Fist Stick Knife Gun: A Personal History of Violence" (Beacon Press). He is a black belt in tae kwon do. He is a Harvard graduate. 
 Mostly, though, the 43-year-old Mr. Canada is a father to children in a poor neighborhood where social pressures conspire against paternal involvement. So in his 12 years at Rheedlen, Mr. Canada has been there to talk long into many a night and to wipe away many a tear.
"You have to make a commitment to stick with them for years," he said of his work. Rheedlen provides tutoring, classes for parents and many other supportive programs.
Over the years, Mr. Canada's children have faced pressure to drop out of school, drug-addicted parents or being hunted by people who wanted to kill them. He is proud that many have bloomed and prospered, going on to professional schools and jobs and avoiding premature parenthood.
"GEOFF'S been like a real father to me," said Alex Echavarria, 23, a friend for 11 years. "He kept me off the streets. He'd come around the block, knocking on doors, trying to find out why we missed karate class or why we did whatever."
Mr. Canada grew up poor in the South Bronx, mostly without his father because his parents were divorced. He knows that the streets are far more cynical and ruthless than when he was young, but he knows that the hunger to belong to something larger than oneself persists.
What distinguishes Mr. Canada, who is black, from a cacophony of voices calling for better schools and social programs -- which he also supports -- is his insistence that a paramount issue is the increasing disconnection of black men from families. Not only are most black children now born out of wedlock, but too many have no real relationship with their fathers.
"These kids don't see themselves as part of a historical movement but the end result of one," Mr. Canada said, comparing this generation with the hopeful one that desegregated schools and won voting rights. "They believe this is how things are and will be forever. They're just out here, surviving. They accept that there are no jobs, they accept that schools are bad, they accept that most of their friends don't have fathers."
Mr. Canada was lucky enough to come of age at a time when the nation was invested in sending smart children from the ghetto to places like Bowdoin College in Maine, which he attended before the Harvard Graduate School of Education. He was compassionate enough to come back home as the idealism of the civil rights era soured.
When he and his brother were young there was still dishonor in not having a father, even in the roughest neighborhoods.
"We used to go to church and when we walked down the block the guys would say things to my mother like, 'Hey, cutie,' and our faces would be hot with shame," he said. "I wanted a father very much for that role of protector of my mother."
MR. CANADA is sophisticated enough to know that the dearth of fathers is not some isolated phenomenon. It is connected to the lack of jobs in poor communities and the inability of men there to play the traditional role of provider.
"The jobs left, but the definition of what it meant to be a man didn't," Mr. Canada said. "Men say: 'I can't afford to feed my family. What does that mean?' Most of the culture is built on men working. Even successful men will find their ego and self-worth falter and suffer if they don't have that role."
His argument is that while black adults work on the economic piece, men and women of good will also have to insist that poor boys and girls refrain from exploitative sexual relationships, and redefine manhood to include nurturing as well as providing. The millions of strong, hard-working black fathers can do so, he says, by being role models and by reinforcing positive behavior.
So what makes Mr. Canada especially happy these days are simple things, like seeing young men caring for children and talking with teen-age boys who believe in love. These young black men who are usurping the code of the streets are as revolutionary as those who press other political and social concerns. For that, Mr. Canada is proud. And for his role, his many admirers send him Father's Day greetings.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN THE SCHOOLS: THE BUDGET;
School Chiefs See New Cuts Finally Hitting Classrooms

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
The budget approved by the City Council includes such large cuts to the Board of Education that after five years of belt-tightening, the reductions will for the first time broadly affect classrooms, students and teachers, according to district superintendents.
The $31.1 billion spending plan adopted by the Council on Thursday includes a reduction of nearly $500 million for the public school system. To help absorb the cuts, Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines, in one of his last acts before his resignation was announced last week, told the 32 community school districts and the high schools that they would have to spend a total of $125 million less in the next fiscal year than they did this year. 
 And that inevitably means that classes will get larger next fall, the number of teachers will drop and the quality of education will likely decline, eight district superintendents said in interviews last week.
"We're making profound decisions here that really will have an impact on the lives of little children," said Dr. Arthur Greenberg, superintendent of District 25, which covers Flushing, Whitestone and College Point in Queens. "I know it sounds dramatic, but I really think it's true. I don't have answers to the dilemma, but I know it's a terrible dilemma."
Many guidance counselors, assistant principals and teachers' aides are also likely to have their jobs eliminated, the superintendents said. It is uncertain whether these jobs or the teachers' positions can be cut by relying only on attrition and early retirement, or whether layoffs will also be necessary.
Some superintendents even said they were considering shortening the school day to save money.
Officials at the Board of Education decide broad budget policies, but it is up to each of the 32 community districts, which oversee elementary and junior high schools, and the high school division to decide specific spending cuts.
"It really is nightmarish," said William Casey, Superintendent of District 15 in Brooklyn, which includes parts of Carroll Gardens, Park Slope and Sunset Park. "I expect that we will see higher class size."
In District 3 on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, officials have devised a plan to save about $1.4 million, the amount they estimate they will lose in the next fiscal year. The plan calls for eliminating 18 teachers, 7 assistant principals and 31 school aides.
If district officials decide to carry out the proposal, said James E. Mazza, the superintendent, the average size of classes in the district's middle schools would increase to 30, on average, from 28.
Mr. Cortines acknowledged in his statement on Friday that the spending cuts would affect classrooms directly. "We are hopeful that our districts and high schools will find ways to shield core instructional programs," Mr. Cortines said. "But with a cut of this magnitude, reductions in direct services to children are unavoidable."
The Chancellor had informed a committee of superintendents of the $125 million reduction in a private meeting Thursday, just hours before his resignation letter was made public.
The city budget calls for the Board of Education to spend $7.28 billion in the next fiscal year -- a reduction of $470 million, or 6 percent, from the $7.75 billion being spent in the current fiscal year.
To maintain current services, board officials said, they would have to spend more than $7.75 billion in the next fiscal year, which begins July 1, because of inflation, higher enrollment and contractual obligations. Board officials said they have to close a gap of nearly $900 million between the projected spending and the budget as adopted by the City Council.
The officials plan to confront the gap in a number of ways, including administrative cuts at the central board and concessions that they hope to extract from the teachers' union.
The $125 million reduction ordered from the districts and high schools will also help close the gap. The amount of each district's reduction is determined proportionately, by its number of students. Many superintendents said the new round of cuts would be even more difficult because budget pressures over the last five years have already forced them to whittled away at many services and jobs.
After-school programs have been eliminated in most districts; art and music classes have been curtailed or eliminated, as have support workers like guidance counselors, assistant principals and school aides.
In District 15 in Brooklyn, 25 percent of the district staff has already been eliminated, Mr. Casey, the superintendent, said.
Now, he said, the jobs of teachers, guidance counselors, assistant principals and teachers' aides are all under consideration. "These are critical people, not administrative bloat, as the Mayor would have it," Mr. Casey said.
In District 23, in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville section of Brooklyn, officials estimated that the district would receive about $1.3 million less in the next fiscal year than it did this year, a cut of about 4 percent.
"This is not good at all," said Michael Vega, the district superintendent.
One way of cutting $1.3 million, Mr. Vega said, would be to eliminate 62 teachers, the equivalent of more than three teachers for each of the district's 18 schools. If 62 teachers were let go, the size of classes would increase to 37 to 40 students, from the current range of 28 to 32 students, he said.
Another option would be to eliminate all assistant principals, Mr. Vega said. But that would not save $1.3 million, and so the size of an average class would still increase by four or five students.
A third possibility, which Mr. Vega said he favored, would be to shorten the school day.

In Detroit, a Red Wings Renaissance

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 17

 BODY:
Around a 2.9-mile loop of downtown Detroit there circles a shuttle train called the People Mover. Perched on a monorail above the city streets, the system opened eight years ago to promote business and to make the district more user-friendly.
For part of the route, the People Mover takes travelers through an urban ghost town of abandoned hotels, vacant stores and nearly empty streets. For the rest of the circuit, tourists see gleaming, modern hotels and office buildings on a sparkling waterfront that is especially bustling and festive during the summer months. 
 As with a drinking glass that is either half empty or half full, the pessimist and the optimist might ask: Is downtown Detroit half dead or half alive? Does the Motor City have any real direction these days or is the town just going around in circles, spinning its wheels?
A clue to those answers might be found at the Joe Louis Arena station, on the banks of the Detroit River. Leave the People Mover and walk down long ramps to a sports arena named after the Brown Bomber, once the heavyweight boxing champion of the world and one of the best-known sons of the city.
On the car-crowded streets here tonight were 20,000 hockey fans, many of whom made long drives from distant suburbs or from Canada, which lies just across the water. Amid the bright lights and television trucks, the people were filing into "The Joe" for the first game of the Stanley Cup finals between their Red Wings and the visiting Devils.
Most of the people were white, a fact not superfluous here. Part of the received wisdom of metropolitan Detroit is that it is one of the most racially polarized regions in the nation, that white people have abandoned the central city, a trend that accelerated after major rioting in 1967. Many believe whites are afraid to spend their money downtown. Isaiah McKinnon is one citizen who has heard it all and seen much of it and lived through it.
He happens to be black. He happens to be a hockey fan. He also happens to be the chief of police. When the Wings won their last Cup in 1955, McKinnon said he was "the only person of African-American descent sitting in the stands at Olympia." Now 52 years old, he recalls with fondness the era when he saw Gordie Howe playing against Maurice Richard. As a patrolman in 1966, McKinnon rushed Red Wings defenseman Doug Barkley to Ford Hospital on the night Barkley's career ended when a stick poked him in the eye.
These nights, McKinnon combines his business with pleasure.
"I do a lot of walking around the arena," McKinnon said, "and I'll have 150 people come up to me some nights and say things like, 'We love the city of Detroit. We were born here. We grew up here. And we want to come back.' "
Moreover, McKinnon said the fans thank him for providing an environment in which they feel secure. He said the recent success of the team "is noticeable in terms of uplifting spirit" and in the thriving restaurant business on hockey nights.
"It's almost an ecstatic feeling," he said.
One booming business isn't going to change long-term economic trends; one successful team, even a possible Stanley Cup champion, won't reverse decades of negative image, some of it self-inflicted. But if the Red Wings win the Cup this season -- with celebratory octopuses flying from the stands onto the ice in Detroit's bizarre tradition -- it will be their first championship since an era when the city was at its post-war peak. In that sense, things will have come full circle.
Back then, the Wings were a perennial powerhouse and the automobile business was flush. Nearly two million people lived within the city limits then, about double the population today.
American car manufacturers were virtually unchallenged in the world, and one of the major problems facing the city was a housing shortage. Today, one of the big nuisances is abandoned houses, some of which are torched by arsonists on the annual "Devil's Night."
Although it is only coincidence, the resurgence of the Red Wings has come at a time of renewed vigor in the auto business. William T. Wilson, a vice president and economist for Comerica Inc., one of the big local banks, said the value of a winning hockey team is "intrinsic, rather than trinsic" to the overall economic health of the region.
But he also stressed that metropolitan Detroit's bottom line may be healthier now than it has been for more than 20 years. The region includes about 4.5 million people in southeastern Michigan. The Red Wings, who wear a winged wheel on their shirts, are a symbol of an economy that is soaring.
"The Big Three have a ton of cash," Wilson said. "Michigan unemployment rates are the lowest in 23 or 24 years."
Wilson said that Detroit was "commercially devastated" by recessions and population loss in the 1970's and 1980's but that Mayor Dennis Archer, in office for 18 months, "has reached out to the business community and reached out to the suburbs."
"There has been a 180-degree turn in attitude toward business and the suburbs," Wilson said, adding the cautious note that some people are "still a bit cynical" about future relations.
Even before the Archer administration, a major suburban player working in downtown Detroit was Mike Ilitch, the owner of the Red Wings. As a young man in the 1950's, Ilitch sold aluminum awnings in the growing suburbs and sensed a new restaurant market.
He built his Little Caesars pizza business the way Henry Ford built his auto empire and Berry Gordy made music at Motown. In 1982, Ilitch bought the Wings for $8 million. According to Financial World magazine, the franchise, the most valuable in the National Hockey League, is now worth $124 million.
Working with the former mayor Coleman A. Young, Ilitch gained operating control of Joe Louis Arena as well as Cobo Arena and Cobo Hall, which are alongside the hockey arena. He restored downtown's Fox Theater to its former grandeur for shows and concerts and has added a Second City comedy club to his growing entertainment district.
Adding to the sports wing of his empire, Ilitch bought the Tigers baseball team three years ago. He wants a new baseball stadium downtown to replace Tiger Stadium, a couple of miles to the west, and possibly a new hockey arena to seat 25,000 customers.
But Ilitch has been frustrated by opposition to public funding for new stadiums. Some of it comes from a local organization called the Tiger Stadium Fan Club.
Frank Rashid, one of the founders, said the members have mixed feelings about the success of the Red Wings because the positive vibrations might encourage political support for Ilitch's new infrastructures.
"Mike Ilitch is not a civic hero," said Rashid, an English professor at Marygrove College. "He's a good businessman. He made a good deal with the city. The city made a good deal with him." Rashid said the success of the Red Wings "is not good for our cause."
"But we do cheer for our team," he said. "I'm a Detroiter and a Detroit sports fan. Of course I'm happy about the Red Wings." He added that he's also happy about rising property values in his Detroit neighborhood.
"There's a new mood," he said. "There's a lot of optimism."
One real estate development proposal is to turn some downtown land near the People Mover's Greek Town stop into an Indian reservation. That would allow Michigan tribes to run gambling casinos. Some of the proceeds might help fund new stadium construction.
At a news conference last week, Ilitch said: "Maybe things are starting to jell for us. Maybe it's all going to come together. Maybe over the next 18 months or two years, we could have some nice things happening for Detroit."
Although Ilitch regularly attends games at Joe Louis, he doesn't take the People Mover. He drives his black Mercedes into the arena and parks it on a lower concourse before retreating to a guarded private box.
Most of the conversation below him tonight was centered on the game. The fans, sophisticated from 40 years of "Hockey Night in Canada" over the airwaves, filled the air with cheers. Among their favorites: Detroit-born Mark Howe, son of Gordie Howe, who led the champions of the 1950's.
With Junior A teams, major college and minor pro clubs and leagues interwoven throughout the city and the region and about two dozen local athletes on N.H.L. teams, Detroiters are among the world's best-connected hockey consumers. John Ziegler, the former league president, is from the area, as is Bob Goodenow, the executive director of the N.H.L. Players Association.
Tonight's televised images, from inside and outside the building, carried over the Fox network to other American cities, would suggest something other than the standard Detroit stereotypes of "Murder City" or Rust Belt ruin -- that there is a healthy, positive beat in the heart of the city.
Dick Purtan, a local radio personality for 30 years and a hockey fan for longer than that, said success in hockey this spring "may help turn the city's image around in the eyes of outsiders.
"I think there's a rebirth," he said. "It's about time."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Too Much Of a Good Thing

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: BELFAST, Northern Ireland

 BODY:
Whenever you ask British officials about the Clinton Administration's decision to grant I.R.A. leader Gerry Adams a visa last year you get this pained expression and then some version of the question: "How would you Americans like it if we gave a reception at 10 Downing Street for Timothy McVeigh and a few of his pals?" The discussion usually descends from there into a venomous diatribe about how President Clinton, in his quest for Irish-American votes, fell prey to a Kennedy-clan conspiracy. At that point, if you're smart, you'll mumble something about the weather in London being unusually rainy this year and shift the conversation to European Union agricultural policy.
Yes, the Brits were deeply upset with Mr. Clinton's Northern Ireland diplomacy. Yes, that diplomacy was motivated largely by a Clinton desire to gain favor with the 40 million Irish-American voters. And yet, Mr. Clinton's decision to give Mr. Adams a visa in return for his commitment to a cease-fire may also have been the President's most original and successful foray into foreign affairs. After all, it has helped engineer the longest truce in Northern Ireland in 25 years. 
 What are the lessons here? The first is a simple reminder that more often than not diplomatic breakthroughs happen when key players do the right thing for the wrong reasons in the right place at the right time. Maybe Mr. Clinton was motivated by the wrong reasons, but his timing was exquisite.
My sense from interviews here is that the British were so emotionally scarred by their years in Belfast that they had lost sight of just how deeply the Catholic and Protestant communities wanted to end the fighting and just how much that popular sentiment had been communicated in subtle and not-so-subtle ways to the hard men conducting the street war.
By offering Mr. Adams a visa and American legitimation, in return for an I.R.A. cease-fire, Mr. Clinton gave Mr. Adams the political cover he needed to persuade his own hard-liners to yield to the public's desire to move from the barricades to the bargaining table. In effect, Mr. Clinton has "Larry Kinged" Mr. Adams, which the Oxford English Dictionary defines as "a verb meaning to transform a fighter into a respectable world figure by giving him the opportunity for repeated interviews on CNN." Britain was unable or unwilling to give Mr. Adams that kind of opportunity and therefore could not nurture this historic moment to halt the fighting.
But there is another lesson. When domestic politics drives foreign policy, the danger is an Administration will not know when to stop. This is particularly true in an age when the absence of an overriding Soviet threat makes it much easier for Washington to snub traditional allies, like Britain, in pursuit of domestic politics.
Last March, American officials tried to build on their cease-fire success by persuading Mr. Adams to begin talks with Britain on giving up I.R.A. weapons. In return, the Administration said it would grant Mr. Adams the opportunity to fund-raise for the I.R.A. in America. But Mr. Adams would only make a fuzzy commitment on decommissioning weapons -- one that did not impress London and one Washington would never have let Yasir Arafat get away with. So what happened? Mr. Clinton, spurred on by I.R.A. supporters, gave Mr. Adams the fund-raising concession anyway, and a White House visit, arguing this would help Mr. Adams come around. It hasn't. The cease-fire is holding, but the peace talks are now stuck on this weapons issue. Mr. Clinton squandered an opportunity to force another breakthrough.
It's not the first time the Administration has shown it doesn't know where to draw the line between politics and diplomacy. Last April, Mr. Clinton announced his decision to impose a full economic embargo on Iran. It was the right thing to do. But to maximize the political payoff, Mr. Clinton could not resist making the announcement at a World Jewish Congress dinner, while wearing a yarmulke. It left the impression with the Iranians, the Muslim world and the allies that the U.S. embargo was not a fundamental American and global interest, but was just pandering to a single U.S. interest group and therefore not to be taken seriously.
Every Administration introduces crass domestic politics into foreign policy. But you have to know when to stop. In diplomacy, the road to success is often paved with bad intentions. But so is the road to ruin. Wisdom is knowing where the fork is.

HEADLINE: Cigarette Recall Is Good News for Lawyers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Regarding your article on the recall of eight billion cigarettes at a cost to Philip Morris of over $100 million ("Tobacco: Now Will You Stop Smoking?," Diary, June 4), one segment of our economy will certainly profit. With Philip Morris accusing Hoechst Celanese of supplying contaminated filter fibers, lawyers for both sides should reap a financial harvest. 
 Whether Philip Morris prevails or loses in this case, which promises to drag on for years, there will be no dearth of legal bills. Even some expert witnesses on chemicals may join the economic boom as one side attempts to show that the glycerol triacetate used in the cellulose acetate polymer as a plasticizer is the guilty party in the adverse reactions of smokers to these cigarettes. Whether fees paid to the lawyers and chemists contribute to the gross national product is another question, but hopefully if the brouhaha causes some smokers to stop, the economy will be well rewarded by lower medical bills in the future.

HEADLINE: Affirmative Action Never Ended Racism;
Gingrich on Wages

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In their joint meeting in Claremont, N.H., President Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich clarified their stands on the minimum wage (front page, June 12). 
 President Clinton would raise it to $5.25 an hour, or about the poverty level for someone working full time. Speaker Gingrich would not raise it from its present $4.25, because "if you raise the cost of the first job for the poorest person, for example, in the inner city, that what you tend to do is increase black, male teen-ager unemployment, which is exactly the thing you don't want to do."
Although economists can be found on both sides of the question, the moral issue is clear: Any full-time job should pay at least enough for the worker to afford a life of dignity. The only exceptions are (1) the worker is doing a favor for the employer; (2) the worker is pursuing a hobby, or (3) the worker is being punished or enslaved.
Incidentally, Mr. Gingrich's statement is an example of the continuing need for affirmative action. That a prominent political leader should assume that teen-age blacks will be the worst paid only emphasizes the need.

HEADLINE: A Penny Saved Is a Penny to Spend

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES; WILLIAM GRIMES is a culture reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
TO spend or not to spend, that is the question every traveler to Europe must face. Whether 'tis nobler to scrimp and pinch, trading three-star for two-star, first-class for coach, awesome for adequate, or to unleash the mighty power of plastic and in so doing pile up a mountain of debt.
Each year, my wife and I scale the mountain. 
 Our private road to credit-card hell is paved with good intentions. We would never dream of flying first-class. We stay in modest hotels. In France we gravitate toward bistros rather than Michelin monsters, and in England we eat lunch in pubs. None of this really counts, though, because it entails no real sacrifice. For us, it's normal behavior.
The problem lies in the thousand and one tiny decisions that tilt the scale of pleasure one way or the other. The better theater seats for an extra 7. The 50-franc glass of Champagne before dinner. The 4 P.M. pit stop at a patisserie for a cup of coffee and a Rococo pastry. The $100 for an enchanting but not strictly necessary Provencal tablecloth and set of napkins, so that later we might recreate the atmosphere of Arles in our very own backyard in Queens.
Then there are the incidentals. The generous tip to convince the Parisian waiter that Americans are nice and the French should like us. The large donations at museums and churches to prove that Americans appreciate Europe's cultural heritage.
It all adds up. So much so that two weeks after the Grand Tour, the postman has trouble squeezing our Visa bill through the front-door mail slot. It's a dramatic moment. Stunned silence gives way to mutual recrimination and the wailing and gnashing of teeth. The figure cannot be right. Surely a decimal point has been deployed incorrectly.
From the depths of misery, however, we rally. Yes, we spent precisely 250 percent more than planned. But so what? We had a good time. Humankind can be divided into two subspecies: spenders and savers. In the long run, spenders can't save, and savers can't spend. The spenders, like myself, actually enjoy pulling out a wallet and peeling 20's off a fat roll of bills. The act represents freedom, power, and all the pleasurable aspects of adulthood rolled into one flamboyant gesture. Travel encourages this impulse. On tour, I mentally assume the guise of a Restoration exquisite being transported through the streets in a sedan chair and idly tossing gold coins to the populace.
The savers, on the other hand, get their pleasure from thinking about all the things they are not spending money on. They're the ones who press their noses to the plate glass at Harrods and recite the prices out loud, expressing fresh surprise and outrage at every figure. This is a form of anti-shopping that, as far as I can make out, provides some sort of convoluted Puritan satisfaction to its practitioners. Others would call this Yankee ingenuity.
Actually, my wife and I apply our own version of this approach. Let's use Paris as an example. By not taking the Concorde, we save $4,000 on a round-trip ticket. By not staying at the Crillon, we save $1,800 for three days. Eating at La Caffetiere rather than Taillevent yields savings of about $250. Looked at from the right angle, these small economies provide us with working capital of more than $6,000, which my wife can apply to a locust-like ravaging of the Agnes B. store.
This year, sad to say, the dollar's pathetic performance has forced us into a temporary alliance with the savers. We rented a small flat in London to shave some badly needed bucks off the price of lodgings. Fringe theater is starting to look exciting. So are strolls through the park and architectural walking tours. We are actually beginning to enjoy the thought of all the money we'll save by eating breakfast and maybe a dinner or two in our own digs. This line of thinking is so productive, in fact, that I am now convinced that we can actually turn a profit by traveling to Europe. This year, Pierre gets a 10-franc tip.

HEADLINE: THE CAPITALIST;
Separating Rich People From Their Money

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEWIS 

 BODY:
"It's remarkable. It's absolutely above board, thoroughly honest. It may sound a little bit too good to be true, but it's absolutely wonderful." . . . . . . . . MAY 2, 1995.

"We're not naive dupes, I don't think." . . . MAY 15.

"Oh, my God, I cannot believe it." . . . . . MAY 16.

JOHN C. WHITEHEAD, FORMER CO-CHAIRMAN OF GOLDMAN SACHS, SPEAKING TO STEVE STECKLOW OF THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, AS IT DAWNS ON HIM THAT HE HAS LOST CLOSE TO $1 MILLION IN THE FOUNDATION FOR NEW ERA PHILANTHROPY CHARITY FRAUD. 
 THE RICH PROBABLY ARE DIFFERENT from you and me, if for no other reason than they spend their lives being treated differently by you and me. Especially in America, where public goods are scarce and private wealth vast, a rich person is a walking pinata. He strolls through life stuffed with surpluses while the rest of us bash away at him with little sticks. Princeton University is now attempting to add $1 billion to its endowment, $500 million of it from just 100 rich alumni. Harvard wants $1.5 billion for its endowment and capital fund. Every time a rich person looks up there's another species to be saved, another disease to be cured, another election to be won. It's enough to make him impervious to us all -- or so you'd think. But then along comes New Era, and busts the pinata wide open.
Like most financial schemes this one wasn't very complicated. John G. Bennett Jr., the head of New Era, offered charities and rich philanthropists a special deal. Give him your money for six months and, with the aid of secret donors, he'd give you back twice the original amount. There were no secret donors, however. Over the last five years Bennett ran what became a $100 million Ponzi scheme -- paying out old suckers with money he raised from new suckers. (Keeping a few million dollars for himself, naturally.) The suckers included a pewload of evangelical churches, along with a cross section of the Wall Street rich -- Geoffrey Boisi, William Simon, Julian Robertson. "The wealthy are really a con man's dream," a former F.B.I. agent told The Journal, summing up the widespread view that rich people are especially gullible.
This may or may not be true. After all, there's no point in conning poor people, except for their votes, so who knows what they'd believe if given the chance? And if conning very rich people was all that easy, you'd think more people would get into the business. Anyway, it seems to me much more plausible that the rich are actually very difficult to steal from, and that Mr. Bennett required a special talent to pull it off. Thus, whatever else it is, the New Era scandal is instructional. It teaches us how to swing more accurately at the pinata.
THE MOST OBVIOUS RULE IS TO START AT THE top and work down. Mr. Bennett began by winning the confidence of John Templeton and Julian Robertson, two of Wall Street's richest men. He knew that the one person whom a rich person will follow blindly into a financial deal is an even richer person, in part because the richest people usually do get the best deals. (Within the Rich-American economy New Era looked perfectly normal, which is why it worked.) Also, rich people love to drop the names of people who are richer than they are. A managing director at Morgan Stanley will pay good money for the chance to say: "Julian and I are involved in this terrific foundation in Pennsylvania." And he did.

Rule #2. You never really con a rich person. You merely suggest, and let him con himself. Rich people need to feel that it was their idea in the first place. Bennett didn't really push his scheme so much as let it be known it existed -- through a former Reagan White House official who frequented the Links Club in Manhattan, a rich people's haunt. They then came to him.

Rule #3. Ask not what a rich person can do for you but what you can do for a rich person. Like everybody else, rich people want most badly what they can't have. The trick is finding something they can't have. Immortality, for instance. Bennett understood that rich people desperately want to rid themselves graciously of all the poor people asking them for money. Rich people are forever being made to feel cheap; everyone thinks they are twice as rich as they actually are, and should give away twice as much as they do. In joining Bennett's scheme a rich person was twice as rich as he was.

Rule #4. Find his children and you can forget the rules. Mr. Bennett met John Templeton Sr. through John Templeton Jr., and you can, too. Obviously, some rich people love their children, much as normal human beings do. But their love gets complicated. Many rich parents feel guilty about the amount of time they have spent playing with their money instead of with their children; rich children, for their part, have a talent for feeling unloved. Both parties believe deep down that the best way to solve personal problems -- indeed all problems -- is to throw money at them. What they're looking to buy here is a highly specialized service -- one part kidnapping and one part therapy.
YOU SHOULD NOT EXPERIENCE GUILT in providing it. The best schools do. (We'll take your kids if you build us a new gym.) The finest Wall Street firms do, too. (We'll hire your kids if you do put your money with us.) You may not have an admissions requirement to waive or a job to offer but at the very least you can befriend the child and give him something to believe in, while at the same time listening to his complaints about his parents.
If you pull it off you'll soon find yourself sitting on the front porch of the rich person's ranch. Beginners in this situation tend to chicken out at the last minute and ask for a mere few thousand dollars. But if you have done your job properly the rich person is emotionally involved in your putative cause, and willing to give millions. Which brings us to Rule #5. Bennett understood that rich people somehow are less rational with their millions than with their thousands. So ask for the millions. After all, it's not like they can't afford it.

What's New

BYLINE: By MAX FRANKEL 

 BODY:
THERE IS CONTROVERSY ABOUT THE nature of news. People think the media are too negative or too cynical or too opinionated. That the loudest of these complaints come from the most negative, cynical and opinionated talkers on radio does not disprove them. They are in fact chronic complaints and not now the most serious heard about the news business.
The public, as measured by opinion polls, does not so much object to "bad" news as it wants a balanced diet, with more "good" news. The public, as measured by its reading habits, wants considerably less news of every kind. And the public, as measured by television ratings, favors trashy gossip about the rich and famous, "magazine" exposes of skulduggery and hourly updates about a certain murder trial. 
 The response inside the news business has been mounting anxiety. Editors and reporters beat their breasts and confess to elitism; they have been persuaded that their education and income leave them "disconnected" from ordinary readers. Broadcasters fear that the proliferation of cable channels, portable cameras and interactive services is eroding the authority of responsible network news. Newspaper executives, similarly frightened by technology, denounce their own editors for being hooked on "old-fashioned" news and impervious to the "data gathering" and "packaging" skills that are required of modern "content providers."
Producers and customers alike are fussing about the true nature of news. Yet for all the hand-wringing, there is remarkably little discussion anywhere of what constitutes news, what it should be and how its definition is being altered.
In most newsrooms, the nature of news, like language itself, is taken for granted. When the editors of The Times design their front page, they work like chefs preparing a sauce -- no recipes needed. This is a good yarn, they'll agree, in ranking the day's events, utterances and reportorial discoveries. And that is the best story of the day. Asked why, they'll tell you a yarn is good if it's important or interesting or, better yet, both. Pressed to define important, they'll say it's news that's likely to have a psychic or material effect on world affairs, American society or local life. As for interesting, why that can be the birth of a panda in Beijing or a bear's rampage in Times Square -- you know, off-beat, wacky, cute, arresting.
Their instincts are superb but their definitions are hardly illuminating. The biggest news can be predictable (the inauguration of a President) or surprising (the bribing of a Vice President). It can be good news (a stock market surge) or bad news (a train crash). It can be yesterday's big event (a tax cut) or a glacial trend (global warming).
Since no one can precisely define the nature of news, virtually anyone can claim to be a journalist. Cynics often remark that freedom of the press exists only for people who own one, but no diplomas, certifications or registrations are needed to practice the craft. Newsletters peddling guns or stocks have the same standing in law as The Times or ABC News. The merchants of reckless gossip on "American Journal" can claim the same interest in news as The Wall Street Journal. The news business is a cacophony, if not exactly a democracy.
However amorphous the idea of news, serious journalists are not hard to define. Deep down, they think of packaging news not as a business but as a public service. They want to provide the information and analysis that a citizen would -- or should -- want to have to make political choices, to prevent abuses of power and to enhance the quality of life. But it's public service with a show-biz flavor. To make the news tastier, the best editors also look for gripping narrative, tales of human heroism and depravity that illuminate life, and then they'll sprinkle in some entertaining spice. To help pay the bills, they will also give generous space to features that sell papers (TV listings and sports stats) or advertising (whole sections about food or automobiles).
Only occasionally will editors stop to examine their basic habits. A. M. Rosenthal of The Times remembers the day he decided to stop covering Sunday sermons and to cover religions instead. I remember leading a discussion after the collapse of the Soviet Union about how important news would now shift from diplomatic and military concerns to international economics and trade. But being thoughtful about the news is not yet being smart about the news business. In sorting through the current complaints and anxieties, newsmongers need to think about some seismic shifts in their environment.
Who's first? The great scoops that used to send newsboys running through the streets shouting "Extra" don't count for much anymore. Most scoops don't last long enough for anyone to run three blocks. One reporter's news of a highly visible event, like an explosion in Oklahoma City, or an easily verified plan, like a Cabinet appointment, is easily matched by phone, fax and computer by a hundred other reporters. Even broadcasters rarely beat the competition by more than a few minutes. Nowadays, real scoops that really cannot be easily matched are reports that require extensive (and expensive) investigation and analysis. In the modern news business, brains beat out legs and elbows.
What's my line? Contrary to what they say, most people don't want their news "straight down the middle." They are really looking to have their opinions confirmed and reinforced. And major news operations now serve such large audiences that they cannot stray very far from center on any issue. So feisty "niche" magazines and arrogant talk shows will continue to take the place of what were once partisan papers.
When's it playing? Lists of things to do and places to go and apartments for sale and trades in stocks will soon cease to be news on paper. They are much more efficiently compiled and kept fresh by computers, which can customize every need, spit out relevant background material and even execute a transaction.
Where's the fun? As the last of America's evening papers die out, it should be obvious that the tired consumer seeking mainly diversion at the end of the day finds it more readily on television. All news is, in a sense, entertaining, but television shows are clearly better than even television newscasts at providing the frothy, passive entertainment once available only in the comics and columns advising the lovelorn. News teams that try to compete in this league are doomed.
Why, why, how and why? It's the last of the five W's they teach in journalism class that will surely define the craft in the foreseeable future. Readers and audiences that want primarily to be entertained, serviced and pandered to will not need traditional news outlets. Those that seek to ease the anxieties of modern life with news will want to understand the forces that shape their lives: why systems fail, why prices go up, how power is amassed, why someone won't do something. More than ever, they will want news that enlightens and liberates, news that only well-educated and well-supported journalists can provide.
Whether many enterprises can succeed at that trade remains very much to be seen.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Should I Have Left An Hour Earlier?

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
FOR all its allure, the American dream has always come with strings attached. The catch is that hard work and long hours on the job are part and parcel of getting ahead and making money. Family life often pays the price, of course -- a bargain that makes many Americans queasy.
Bob Israel, co-owner of a motion-picture ad agency in Los Angeles, knows the feeling well. 
 "At some point during the day, I look at my watch, and I'm faced with, 'Do I go home now and spend a little more time with my kids before they go to bed, or do I complete the work that I'm staring at?' " Mr. Israel said. "It really is a daily struggle. It sometimes causes conflict, and certainly presents conflict in my heart."
Still, Mr. Israel usually stays at his desk, in the belief that long hours are necessary to take home a fatter paycheck.
Now along comes a study from the Wharton School that claws at his reasoning -- and that of everyone else who buys into conventional wisdom on the work-family conflict. It found that people who placed high importance on finding the right spouse and creating a good family life actually ended up earning more money than those who were willing to sacrifice home life for their careers. "I'm sorry to hear that, because I didn't go home early," Mr. Israel said. "I'm not going to let my wife read this article."
A healthy family life, of course, does not always depend on the amount of time people spend at home instead of the office. But Wharton's conclusion is enough to make many people who work long hours wonder about their choice. Asked about the study, three dozen people around the country spoke emotionally about the choices they have made to juggle their lives at work and outside the office.
To some, the study's conclusions sounded a lot like voodoo socioeconomics. They argued that their jobs wouldn't let them cut back. Others asserted that they worked hard to satisfy themselves, not for material gain, and wouldn't change a thing. Still others confessed to strong workaholic tendencies, but insisted that they had found ways to cope, like slacking off on household chores or delaying marriage and family. Finally, a few said they had learned the Wharton study's lesson the hard way, with their own lives, and were changing their habits.
What follows is a sampling from that broad spectrum.
<HBN>Rat Race, With Regrets
 Many Americans are on a nonstop treadmill -- the rat race is real, it dictates their schedules.
Scott A. Smith described the evenings and weekends he worked as a salesman for the New York Life Insurance Company a few years back and complained, "If you don't put in those hours you'll get eaten alive." Now with a Denver financial planning firm, he feels guilty if he leaves at 6 P.M. "We joke around here that we work half days -- 12 hours," said Mr. Smith, 36, who is raising two small children with his wife, a magazine executive.
Peter Rosenthal, the senior executive vice president at Rubenstein Associates, a New York public relations firm, said the Wharton study might be valid in some industries, but not others.
"It's a nonstarter in service businesses like law and investment banking -- or public relations," he said. "I don't know anybody who is really successful that gained their success in 40-hour workweeks." Mr. Rosenthal typically puts in 70-hour weeks, away from his working wife and their 2-year-old son.
Gabriel Escamillo, a vice president of Enviro-Drill, a Phoenix-based drilling company, also believed he had little choice about his hours. As he talked, it was clear he felt pangs about the sacrifice.
With a high school education, Mr. Escamillo started out 27 years ago as a driller. For the next 20 years, he spent half his time away from home, on the job in other states. When in Phoenix, he worked 10 to 15 hours a day "to pay the bills, and to allow my wife to stay at home."
Mr. Escamillo said he was also competing with college graduates for management jobs, so the long hours were designed in part to catch the attention of his supervisors. Eventually, he was promoted.
"I regret that I was not as close to my children as my wife was," said Mr. Escamillo, 51. "But I am not going to condemn myself. I did what I had to do." Now, Mr. Escamillo said, he sometimes slips out of work early to catch the soccer games and school events of his two grandsons.
 
Hard Driving, And Proud of It
 Corporate demands are one thing; personal expectations weigh even more heavily on some people. Plenty of folks seem motivated to work long and hard primarily because they have personalized the American work ethic.
"I'm a very driven person. I don't know another way to attack this thing called life," said Gwenael Hagen, a 34-year-old marketing manager for Microsoft in Denver.
Though he never keeps track, Mr. Hagen thinks he averages 55 hours a week on the job. He has never considered working less than he does, he said, and he is willing to take on extra at Microsoft, which he joined six months ago. Divorced and with an 8-year-old son, Mr. Hagen recently remarried. After a Friday ceremony, he and his wife returned to work the following Tuesday, saving their honeymoon for next year.
Mr. Hagen constantly weighs whether he is giving enough time to his son, whom he sees twice a week and one weekend a month. And he believes the Wharton study's findings. But he likes his own balance, his own work schedule. "I don't want to find another way," he said.
Mr. Hagen has a kindred spirit in Catherine A. Lehmann. "What drives me is what's next. As soon as something's completed, I like to see what the next opportunity is," said Ms. Lehmann, a 33-year-old senior corporate relations manager for Allstate Insurance in Northbrook, Ill. She averages 12-to -14-hour workdays.
Married to a securities lawyer who works similar hours and childless, Ms. Lehmann said, "Probably, I wouldn't be as successful if I didn't work as hard. I do think there's a trade-off." But, she added, "I rarely come in on the weekend -- so that's the balance for me."
William C. Dudley, an international economist at Goldman, Sachs in New York who works about 60 hours a week, also said the study's thesis would have no bearing on his life. "I carry my job around with me all the time," he said. "I wouldn't do anything differently. I like what I'm doing, so I guess there's less conflict between work and play."
It helps that Mr. Dudley, 42, has no children and that his wife, Ann Darby, keeps the same kind of schedule as a vice president at J. P. Morgan. "My hours are nothing remarkable in this business," she said. Unlike her husband, Ms. Darby said she did feel she had sacrificed family life. "But I've always been an overachiever. I definitely made the choice. No one forced me to. It's a personality flaw.
"I certainly don't think my marriage suffered," she added. "The one thing that may have gotten lost, which some people might find too big a cost, and I guess the jury's still out for me, is children." At 39, Ms. Darby could still change that.
 
Long Hours, But Family Too
 "I'm a little surprised by the outcome of the study," said Michael J. Durham, an airline industry executive in Fort Worth. "In general, corporate America is inordinately demanding of people who wish to rise high up in the hierarchy of large public companies."
As he tells it, Mr. Durham wanted both a high-powered career and a family life. So he devised a strategy to cope: get to the office early but get home before it is too late, even if that means doing work there.
In 1979, Mr. Durham joined American Airlines as a single, 28-year-old with an M.B.A. degree. Right from the start, "11- , 12-hour days were sort of the norm," he said. "And I worked in the corporate finance department, so we were forever on the road, either arranging financings or closing financings or negotiating financings or talking to people about new financings. And then, of course, the hours were much longer because you basically worked the whole time that you were on the road.
"I've kept those hours up, yes, pretty much forever," Mr. Durham said. "If anything, the amount of work has increased. The biggest difference is not so much the hours in the office, but it's the amount of time outside the office and the amount of paperwork I have when I get home."
Now 44 and chief executive of the Sabre Group, the computer reservations unit of AMR , American's parent, Mr. Durham has a well-known workaholic boss in Robert Crandall, AMR's chief executive.
"The culture here is to work hard, to work long hours," Mr. Durham said. "This is not the U.S. Postal Service. Bob has created an atmosphere of urgency and challenge here and the kind of people who have been successful thrive in that kind of environment.
"There are clearly sacrifices. They're one of the more difficult aspects of the job because I'm married now and I have two kids, 8 1/2 and 6."
Partly because his wife does not work outside the home, Mr. Durham characterized his family life as a good one that provided many psychic rewards. "There are many long days at the office that you're supported only by the thought of having your kids run and smash into you when you walk into the house," he said. "You get out of the car and hear, 'Daddy, Daddy, you're home.' "
Besides working at home, Mr. Durham gets into the office a bit earlier nowadays, often before 7:30 A.M., and works until 6 or 7 P.M.
Kendall Bodden, a middle manager at Storagetek in Louisville, Colo., takes that early bird strategy even further.
"Unfortunately, there's the mentality that if you're here eight hours a day, you're a slacker," he said. He goes to work between 3 A.M. and 5 A.M. so he can spend evenings with his wife and 10-month-old son and still work days that last anywhere from 10 to 14 hours. At 38, he has also scaled back his sleep, getting by on five hours a night if necessary.
 
 
Finding a Plateau To Build a Home
 Cori Zywotow-Rice traveled a different career route. She delayed marriage and family for years while she worked flat out. After a stint as a radio reporter, she took a public relations job in Miami for the Dade County government. The post landed her at the police department during a corruption scandal.
"That job was 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I was on the beeper, and it was cops and robbers," she said. "I was single, I was totally committed to my job."
Later, in 1989, she joined the Miami-based Burger King Corporation, where she has worked her way up to vice president of worldwide communications. Along the way, she was married, and she had a daughter three years ago.
"There's no way you can do everything," Ms. Zywotow said. "There are a couple of things that can make things easier. Choosing an employer that is sensitive to family values and understands there must be balance in your life, having a boss who believes in balance and a spouse who believes in balance."
By employing a nanny and living four minutes from the office, Ms. Zywotow said she maintains her career commitment, but not the crazy hours. "I look back, and I'm very happy that I spent my 20's working, because I'm very fulfilled at 39 with an outstanding career and a wonderful family.
"You can have a happy home life and a successful executive career," she has concluded. "There are sacrifices -- dry cleaning in the trunk for a month and splitting up grocery shopping. I have no regrets. I have a job that takes me to Singapore and London and New York. I had a very strong family life growing up and have a very strong family life now."
 
Learning to Accept New Priorities
 Perhaps none of those interviewed had thought as deeply about the issues raised in the Wharton study as Howard D. Palevsky. At 48, he is president and chief executive of Collagen in Palo Alto, Calif. Starting out with an M.B.A. and a working wife in the early 1970's, he "just worked really hard, 50 to 60 hours a week. The deal I had worked out at home was, 'I don't expect any dinner, I just can't tell you when I'll be home.' " That continued after Mr. Palevsky and his wife had children and had acquired a cook and a housekeeper. "So, yes, I did sacrifice home life," he said.
"What I probably sacrificed more was the relationship with my spouse. So you have time for work, time for kids, time for spouse -- pick two, you know. Well, I'm separated now, so that's no fun," he said, calling from an event-packed trip to Washington and Baltimore that lasted less than 48 hours.
"But I have children, and I spend an enormous amount of time with them," he added, proudly reporting that he would be back home the next day "to coach a Little League game at 5. I rearranged everything to get home to the game."
Looking back, Mr. Palevsky said, "I don't think you have to do it the way I did it. But I didn't know that. I would have gone home from work earlier if I knew better."
As a boss, Mr. Palevsky said he had already applied the Wharton study's lesson. "I am riveted on results. I don't think Collagen workers have to put in long hours to get ahead. The business of, 'Gee, I saw him there in the morning and I saw him there at night, therefore he's a great employee' -- I don't do things that way," he said.
"There are a lot of people who work long hours that are not very productive. There are a lot of people who work long hours because they've got nothing else to do, who have no life. I've been fooled by that in the past.
"Now if I hadn't become C.E.O. and had at least a small degree of success, would I feel the same way?" Mr. Palevsky continued. "I don't know. I can afford to be generous and thoughtful. If I was banging away, screwing up, more than I do, maybe I wouldn't be as thoughtful."
Still, Mr. Palevsky believes his views "are common today in my age group."
Kenneth E. Glover, the 42-year-old co-chief executive of W. R. Lazard, Laidlaw & Mead, a New York money-management firm, agrees. And he has recently mended his ways.
"I've always had positions where it wasn't a 9-to-5 job," Mr. Glover said. He started out working in local government in Maryland, then at a Chicago bank, then at Drexel Burnham Lambert, the defunct Wall Street firm, in the go-go 1980's, then as senior vice president of corporate and government affairs at RJR Nabisco Holdings. At each stop, he often worked 12-hour days and at least one day each weekend.
"I thought this was what you had to do to be successful," he said.
Marrying in 1988 and having children, forced Mr. Glover to think about his life. But he was still working long hours at Lazard in 1994 when its founder died of an accidental drug overdose. To save the firm, Mr. Glover worked doubly hard.
But in hindsight, he said he need not have put in all that time his whole career. "If I didn't work those hours, I think I would have been as successful, because I'm not so sure I always worked effectively," Mr. Glover said. "I would absolutely not do it again the same way."
Mr. Glover is as good as his word. In May, he began what is likely to be a two-month vacation from Lazard to spend time with his wife and children, aged 5 and 16 months. And when he returns to work, Mr. Glover plans to negotiate a deal that will allow him to use his home office two days a week.
David Lloyd struck his balance, tilted toward family over career, years ago. At the time, his son Davey, now 19, was in second grade. As a school assignment, Davey drew a picture of his family. "There were four of us, but in the picture there were only three figures," Mr. Lloyd said -- his wife, his daughter and Davey. "My wife asked him, 'Where's Dad?' " Mr. Lloyd continued, "and he said, 'Dad's at work.' "
As a result, he got off the fast track at U S West Communications , avoiding jobs that demanded extra hours and a lot of travel. Mr. Lloyd, who now manages a technical writing team in the company's public policy department in Denver, also gave up his dreams of owning a big house and a Porsche.
And Mr. Lloyd, now 42, still believes that decision cost him. He thinks that he would have made more money if he had stayed his original course, though he has no regrets about rearranging his priorities.
 
A Family Payoff From Work Life
 Obviously, making these choices is rarely simple. Consider the case of Richard C. Breeden, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission who also worked in the Bush White House and at two New York law firms. All were jobs demanding long hours and plenty of commitment, though Mr. Breeden said he strove to get to critical family events.
Now a partner at Coopers & Lybrand, the big accounting and consulting firm, Mr. Breeden related a conversation he had recently with his oldest son, 14, who had asked him if he would ever return to government.
"I said, 'Oh, boy, no. We're all done with that, thank goodness, and isn't it nice I'm now around and we take vacations together and so on,' " Mr. Breeden said. "And he looked kind of disappointed. So I said, 'Do you think that's good or bad?' "
"Well, I liked seeing you on TV," the boy said.
As Mr. Breeden sees it, the conversation showed that "you have to balance your professional need to be challenged and involved in something interesting and demanding with the fact that you also need to be home often enough and when it really counts.
"But if I was just doing 9-to-5 stuff, if I was bored to tears, I don't know whether I could be as interesting to my kids and as good a parent as I hope I am."
 
 
 
ASSESSING THE VALUE OF FAMILY
 IMAGINE an American life style where people worked fewer hours and spent more time en famille. Strivers would revamp their work habits, regularly leaving a redrafting of business proposals until the next morning, cutting off meetings at 5 o'clock and forgoing evening phone calls to demanding clients. Rush hour traffic would probably be worse, of course, and Little League games, soccer matches and Indian Princess meetings would be much more crowded. Maybe movie studios would produce more family fare.
It could happen, if the thesis advanced by a new study gains currency. In their research, Peter Capelli, a management professor at the Wharton School; Jill Constantine, an assistant professor of economics at Williams College, and Clint Chadwick, a Ph.D. candidate at Wharton, set out to determine whether people pay a price in workplace success for stressing family interests.
Unlike other studies on the subject, however, they looked at data from the same people at two points in time. They started with responses given by high school seniors across the nation in 1972 to a series of "life interest" questions and compared them with the respondents' earnings in 1986.
They found that men who had placed high importance on both finding the right spouse and having a good family life earned more than others, after controlling for educational differences, tenure with current employer and total job experience. For women, the same correlation existed, but it was weaker.
At the same time, the researchers found that placing importance on success in work, having money and finding steady work had no effect on earnings.
But if Americans buy this thesis and reorder their lives, what would happen to American productivity? It would not suffer in the least, Mr. Capelli said. He believes that time invested in family life makes workers more productive, not less, and enhances corporate performance. On the other hand, having a poor family life makes greater demands on an employee's time, with "enormous" negative consequences in the workplace, Mr. Capelli said.
Building a good family life is particularly important early in careers. "That's where the serious mistakes, like bad marriages, get made," Mr. Capelli explained. "People who didn't make time for their families spend a lot of time putting Band-Aids on family problems" later on.
Mr. Capelli, who is co-director of Wharton's Center for Human Resources, would like to see a rethinking of the assumed trade-off between work and family. He believes that people should think about the time invested in a good family life the way they now think about time spent on exercise: it takes time that might be spent at the office, but it also pays dividends for the employee and the employer.
"The alternative to a good family life is not no family life," he said. "It's a bad family life." But Mr. Capelli probably has a lot of convincing to do before his thinking is accepted. Traffic engineers, Little League coaches and Hollywood can relax.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
The Executive Dining Room Slims Down

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER 

 BODY:
IN the 1980's, scores of corporations around the country built opulent, architecturally significant executive dining rooms that mirrored the heady business climate.
Today, many of those rooms are used to store office furniture. 
 That is just one way the 1990's have changed corporate eating habits. In a nod toward workplace democracy, for example, the doors to some corporate dining rooms have been opened to rank-and-file employees. At the same time, the fare has turned from more sumptuous to salubrious, -- with wine a rarity, at least at lunch. Of more than two dozen dining room managers interviewed nationwide, three-quarters said they served a more "health conscious" diet than they did a decade ago.
And while the 1980's were marked by a penchant for showcase architecture, the 1990's reveal a growing corporate shyness. In fact, six companies, including American Express, Bank of Boston and Sony, declined interviews for this article because of concerns they could be perceived as having extravagant dining rooms. And I.B.M. -- recently criticized for hiring a chef at $87,500 a year plus a $30,000 bonus -- declined to allow photographs of its executive dining areas.
Still, for all the changes, corporate dining retains much of its expected elegance; executives are hardly eating tuna sandwiches on their computer tables. As the following nationwide sampler shows, this state of affairs makes for an odd combination, in the 1990's company dining place, of familiar refinements and self-conscious restraint -- St. Julien and Snapple:
At Putnam Investments in downtown Boston the tone of corporate dining comes right from the top, specifically from the company's president, Lawrence J. Lasser.
"When we planned the dining rooms here I wanted them to reflect everything that the company stands for -- professionalism, quality and a no-nonsense attitude," Mr. Lasser said. "I specifically do not want people to come here and say, 'Wow, that was the best lunch I've ever had.' " Putnam has a series of small private dining rooms done in soothing beiges and creams as well as conference rooms that can do double duty when there is overflow. The cheerful main dining room, seating 65, is a decidedly democratic affair, with linen-covered tables pushed together to form long rows cafeteria-style. On an average day more than 100 senior managers take advantage of the health-conscious free buffet turned out by a staff of 13.
"You meet people in here that you might never meet anywhere else around the building," said Gordon H. Silver, Putnam's chief administrative officer, while lunching on cous-cous and poached halibut with a summer vegetable sauce. The buffet that day also included grilled chicken breast, a variety of salads, broccoli-and-white bean soup, assorted fruit desserts and homemade breads and cookies. Wine is served only at evening functions.
Until two and a half years ago, the three executive dining rooms at the sprawling headquarters of Kraft Foods in White Plains were reserved for high-level employees. But then Kraft, which is owned by Philip Morris, decided to open the rooms to all employees for special-occasion lunches and receptions.
On a recent Thursday afternoon, a man who was celebrating 10 years with Kraft had invited 11 co-workers to the colonial-style room for quesadillas with andouille sausage, gazpacho, grilled tuna with roasted red peppers and a cilantro-lime butter and strawberry shortcake.
"The executives were not using these rooms as much as they used to, and we thought it would be a good idea to make them available to everyone," said Nancy H. Redmond, the company's director of corporate affairs.
The largest private room, which seats about 20, has Oriental rugs, a marble fireplace, chandeliers and (like all three) formal service. Employees are allowed one glass of wine at lunch; on this day it was a Beringer chardonnay.
Executives still have preferential access to the private dining rooms, but, Mrs. Redmond said, conflicts are rare. Besides, the 1,500 employees have a strikingly modern cafeteria on the ground level with bent wood chairs, beige carpeting, Oriental lanterns, a little outdoor terrace and leafy views. "We've found it to be a win-win situation," said Mrs. Redmond, referring to the newly democratized executive dining rooms. "The employees enjoy it, and if you want to look at it from a productivity angle, it is much better having them in the building than getting in their cars and driving somewhere for a celebration lunch."
"When people order carry-out food they usually get something that is not very good for you," said Reba White Williams, director of special projects at Alliance Capital Management, an investment firm in midtown Manhattan. Mrs. Williams, the wife of Dave H. Williams, Alliance's chairman, feels so strongly about the evils of fast food that some years ago she began a free lunch program at the company. Daily, the more than 400 Alliance employees can partake of a buffet that includes healthy fare like black bean soup, vegetable tacos, turkey cassoulet, skewered vegetables, vegetable frittata, Japanese style noodle salad with ginger-garlic dressing, chicken with spinach and broccoli, and chick-peas in yogurt sauce.
On the 33d floor the formal executive dining rooms -- lined with prints by Stewart Davis, Thomas Hart Benton and other works from the Williams's extensive collection of American prints -- have a similar philosophy.
"When Dave and I were on Wall Street, we saw so many of our friends having heart attacks in the 40's," Mrs. Williams observed over a lunch of spaghetti squash primavera followed by grilled red snapper with white beans and lemon-drizzled spinach.
"We make sure that this food is tasty and interesting, not just bland," Mr. Williams added. Red meat is taboo at Alliance, as are other dishes perceived to be laden with saturated fat. Between 50 and 100 of the company's top executives dine in daily -- which saves the company money on expense accounts, Mrs. Williams noted.
Of course, this decade's fashions have not wholly overtaken corporate dining. At the merchant banking house of Rothschild in Manhattan, the atmosphere in the three dining rooms on the 51st floor is discreet and formal. But the menu prepared by Gerard Drouet, formerly the chef and co-owner of La Petite Marmite, a top French restaurant in New York, is lusty compared to the leafy fare often found elsewhere.
"I change every day," he said on a recent weekday in which he turned out an appetizer of soft shell crabs a la meuniere, rack of lamb with fresh herbs, roasted potatoes, assorted vegetables and strawberry tart.
"I mix it up," he added. "One day maybe fish with beurre noire, or roasted pork loin. You get to know what they like."
For the following day he planned a menu that ended with an assiette of fresh fruit and berries with homemade ice cream.
"Here, taste this," he said, offering a visitor a spoonful of stunningly rich vanilla ice cream. "They love it at lunch."
Corporate ego is as powerful a force in the 1990's as ever. At Disney Studios in Burbank, Calif., the handsome rotunda dining room was designed by Michael Graves in 1991. The dome-shaped room, seating about 100, is done in a sandy desert hue with faint flecks of gold. On the upper wall is a splashy abstract mural reminiscent of various fabric swatches. On clement days diners spill out onto a wraparound outdoor balcony. The California-style menu is heavy on grilled fish, poultry and salads.
The prevailing motif in this handsome setting? Mickey Mouse. The engaging little mouse is everywhere, including on the plates on which Disney executives dine.

SACRED PLEASURE
Sex, Myth, and the Politics of the Body.
By Riane Eisler.
495 pp. San Francisco:
HarperSanFrancisco. $25. 
BRIAN HEAP, who's a storyteller in Jamaica, was recently holding a workshop for young people. He read them a news item about bullying. The first time, he put on a raucous dance-hall tape and roared; the adolescents -- including the girls -- raised their fists and roared for the bully. Then he put on some piano music and read sympathetically, softly. They became subdued and one or two cried.
Riane Eisler is convinced that human nature is not fixed, and that it matters very much indeed what it is exposed to. Stories nourish or train attitudes and feelings and, as the Jamaican workshop shows, how they're told can make all the difference. At the moment, the catalogue of errors is long, the list of griefs appalls, from Bosnia to Oklahoma City.
We are living at a crisis point, Ms. Eisler argues, a period of "great system disequilibrium" when "small changes can come together to form the nuclei of a fundamentally transformed system." Her hugely successful 1987 book, "The Chalice and the Blade," introduced themes elaborated in "Sacred Pleasure": the replacement of neolithic values of cooperation and survival by a masculine cult of violence and supremacy, and the need now to develop a "partnership" way of life to replace the "dominator" model, which finds excitement in pain, exalts the warrior over the peacemaker and locates power in money, tyranny and the subjection of women. "Sacred Pleasure" is longer and baggier, and occasionally loses sharpness of focus in great cloud banks of citations and acknowledgments. But Ms. Eisler is a wise counselor, and she has gathered up fascinating evidence to support her utopianism and to argue that change is urgent, possible and even imminent, however savage the foreground image.
If we live by the stories we tell one another, vulgar Darwinism, which attributes the superiority of Homo sapiens to hunter-and-warrior might, has contributed to the fallacies of the dominator myth (remember "2001," when the ape first stands up and simultaneously reaches for a weapon). Czeslaw Milosz recently called animal films on television "obscene" -- "because what they show offends our human, moral understanding . . . for the thesis of these programs is: 'You, see that's how it is in Nature; therefore, it is natural; and we, too, are a part of Nature, we belong to the evolutionary chain, and we have to accept the world as it is.' "
Ms. Eisler refuses to, and she draws the most lively corroboration for her defiance from the activities of an endangered species, the bonobo, wrongly known as the pygmy chimp. Bonobo females show a distinct preference for the less aggressive males; females and males collaborate; they use tools to dig and forage for (vegetable) food; they share it out once they have it, sometimes as a prelude or a sequel to sex; and females' high standing in the troop does not mean they dominate or un-man the males. Bonobo society is based on pleasure and exchange, not coercion and fear.
Furthermore, bonobos make love looking into each other's eyes, and do so, often, for fun. Ms. Eisler is careful not to extrapolate to humans too directly, but her point is that the key to egalitarian society is sexual harmony between equals: "I believe that far from being a 'baser instinct' or 'lower drive,' our human sexuality is part of what we might call a higher drive -- an indispensable part of what makes our species human."
But sexual fulfillment or the biology of love -- "sacred pleasure" -- has had powerful enemies. Sweeping through millenniums, Ms. Eisler speaks out alike against cavemen and mullahs, the Pope and pornography and post-modernists, and against the sisters who make a cult of bondage and are trapped in "the dominator sexual counter-revolution." She's decisive that prostitution belongs in a cash economy that can only subjugate women, and she squares up to Roman Catholics and fundamentalists and the new right on family values, abortion and contraception ("what is immoral is not to educate young people about sex," she writes). It's ironic that Ms. Eisler is sticking to some of the values of Women's Lib, and that they now sound almost old-fashioned, wholesome and solid against the new babel of sexual politics -- masquerade and gender slippage on one side, date rape and censorship on the other.
But "Sacred Pleasure," in spite of its length, scants some crucial questions: Ms. Eisler identifies love with sexual activity throughout, overlooking the claims of friends, of children, of family; she does not consider the possibility, let alone the desirability, of being alone, as many people are, by choice or not. Nor does she consider the issues of chastity, of companionship. The book is short on practical approaches, too, though she does call strongly for social measures for child care. (A promised forthcoming volume on "Partnership Economics" might answer some of these questions.) And on principle, exemplifying partnership, not domination, she doesn't use hard words or talk tough; the resulting text is a little bland and doughy, which sacred pleasure should never be.

HEADLINE: The Short Shelf Life Of Generation X

BYLINE: By JOHN MARCHESE 

 BODY:
IF you were going to tell a tale of how modern versions of myths are created, exploited, debunked and killed in an increasingly short and frenzied cycle, the story might begin like this:
 "Back when it all started, there was that word -- twentysomething." The speaker, in a recent telephone conversation, was Douglas Coupland, and it all started in the summer of 1991, when people began noticing his first novel, "Generation X," an odd-size day-glo paperback published by St. Martin's Press. At the same time, the rough-edged rock called grunge was making itself heard outside its incubator in Seattle, and "Slackers," Richard Linklater's low-budget first film, was released. 
 There seemed to be a common thread running through these three isolated phenomena. The subtitle of Mr. Coupland's book, "Tales for an Accelerated Culture," now seems like a miracle of self-fulfilling prophecy.
 "It was only four years ago," Mr. Coupland said, "but it seems like forever."
 Forever surely isn't what it used to be. The book's title, of course, quickly became the common label for the 48 million people born in the United States in the decade after 1961. The novel, chronicling the aimless lives of three slackers, had a first printing of 10,000 copies but has sold nearly 400,000. But the title was infinitely more influential, taking on a life of its own, becoming a pop-culture Frankenstein's monster.
 Now, in a short essay in the June issue of Details magazine (which has prospered as the gospel according to X), Mr. Coupland voices disdain for how "X got hypermarketed right from the start," and writes, "And now I'm here to say that X is over."
 Any self-respecting Generation Xer, whose commonly accepted attributes include a preternatural savvy and cynicism about marketing, might notice that Mr. Coupland's death knell for Generation X coincides with the promotion of his latest book, "Microserfs" (HarperCollins), which chronicles the hermetic and asocial lives of young people who write and debug computer code for the Microsoft Corporation. But there are signs that, if nothing else, Generation X has aged prematurely.
 In May, one of the loudest Generation X political organizations, Lead . . . or Leave, left, closing its headquarters in Washington. Its founders, Jon Cowan and Rob Nelson, said they were ready to move to other pursuits. Also, David Lauren's magazine for Xers, Swing, has not exactly caught on, and the gush of Generation X movies like "Reality Bites" and "Singles" has slowed to a trickle. Marketing aimed at Xers has largely failed to hit its wary targets.
 It seems that Generation X, which Douglas H. Rushkoff, the editor of "The GenX Reader," once called "a marketing experiment that got out of control," is doomed to a shorter life as a collective entity than that other well-known generation, the one that is in its fourth decade as a phenomenon.
 "I agree that it's over," said James Fitzgerald, an executive editor at St. Martin's Press who signed Mr. Coupland for his first book. "Everything gobbles itself up in the media now. At least this got four years."
 Any eulogy for Generation X must include its peculiar biography. Since the accelerated culture has made it all a blur, it is hard to decipher what led to what. Some observers say ground zero of the X explosion was a July 1990 cover story in Time magazine by David M. Gross and Sophfronia Scott, devoted to what was then still stuck with the ungainly name the Twentysomething Generation. Even before that, though, in 1988, Jefferson Morley wrote a story for The Washington City Paper, a weekly, in which he delineated the differences between children of the 1960's and people like himself who'd grown up in the 70's.
 Around that time, a few other articles appeared that noted the political disenchantment of young people who believed that their elders had taken all the good stuff -- from Social Security to well-paying jobs -- and left them empty-handed. Mr. Coupland wrote one himself for a magazine in his hometown, Vancouver, British Columbia.
 "In actual fact, this generation had been around for 30 years," said Karen Ritchie, the 50-year-old managing director of General Motors Mediaworks and author of the recent book "Marketing to Generation X" (Lexington Books). "But nobody noticed, which sort of shows the self-absorption of our generation."
 Then, when X marked a generation, a cultural fission occurred, with all the attendant heat and light.
 After the burst of analyses of Generation X in publications, ranging from newsweeklies to marketing trade magazines, nearly a dozen books on the subject were published, including a parody of the whole idea, "Generation Ecch!" Generation X movies came in a torrent in 1993, along with television shows like Fox's "Melrose Place" and MTV's "The Real World."
 By the time the notion of a Generation X was two years old, New York magazine was able to devote a long article to what it called "Generation X hucksters," self-appointed experts who were trying to get rich and famous by analyzing and explaining the generation to older people who had political power or made media-buying decisions.
 The term mutated quickly, changing from a label for an ennui-ridden, underachieving slacker set to include just about everyone. Early this year, when Philadelphia magazine did a cover story on successful twentysomethings in that city, it called them "Generation X-ceptional," picturing the multimillionaire hockey player Eric Lindros and Sarah Dunn, who has moved quickly from writing "The Slacker Handbook" to writing for the decidedly baby-boom situation comedy "Murphy Brown."
S TILL, if the idea of a culturally coherent generation of 20-year-olds is passe, selling to this huge group is not. Ms. Ritchie predicts there will be lots more marketing directed at Generation X, whether it is called that or not. But she warns, "The longer we patronize Generation X with stereotyped portrayals that ignore their economic clout and marketing savvy, the higher the price we will pay in long-term market share."
 It turns out that Mr. Coupland's notion for Generation X was based on marketing to begin with. In his Details article, he concedes that he borrowed the X label not from the name of Billy Idol's late-70's punk rock band, as many have supposed, but from Paul Fussell, the English professor and essayist whose 1983 book "Class" devoted a chapter to an X group of people who remained unaffected by the normal lures of status objects.
 If Mr. Coupland had looked around a little more, he could have found a more direct source to borrow from. After World War II, the war photographer Robert Capa led a project to document the lives of people who were 20 in 1950. These young people, Mr. Capa believed, were entering a world different from their parents' and feeling uneasy, disaffected and bored, surprisingly like Mr. Coupland's characters. He called them Generation X.
 In Mr. Capa's case, the term didn't catch on. But it is evidence that perhaps generations have more in common than not, and maybe today's 20-year-olds aren't so exceptional. Now, even Mr. Coupland agrees.
 "This whole idea of generations -- " he said over the phone from his New York hotel room recently, his voice showing signs of impatience at having to talk about something that wasn't in his new book. But then he quoted one of his computer-nerd characters from "Microserfs."
 "Bears don't expect the little bears to wear different fur and eat different berries," he said. "What makes us think we have to be different?"

HEADLINE: Glimmer of Hope in U.S.-Japan Auto Talks

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 18

 BODY:
With the imposition of tariffs on Japanese luxury cars 10 days away, a glimmer of hope for a settlement of the automobile trade dispute between the United States and Japan has begun to emerge, some Government and industry officials from both nations say. Still, the two sides are sufficiently far apart that it will be hard to reach agreement before June 28, when the tariffs take effect.
"I have been for the first time in 20 months a little more optimistic," an American official, explaining that there is now "a will on both sides" to reach an agreement, even if it means departing somewhat from hard-line positions. "We can step down from the religious pedestal and try to fashion a solution by giving and taking." 
 Indeed, Japan's Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama, indicated at the outset of the economic summit meeting last week in Halifax, Nova Scotia, that he hoped to resolve the auto trade dispute within two weeks.
Yet some American officials continued over the weekend to take a bleak view. A senior Administration official said bluntly: "None of us sees any reason to be optimistic. Things are as they were." And a senior Japanese trade official was quoted as saying in Halifax that he saw "not even a 1 percent chance of a deal."
The chance for an agreement rests on sub-Cabinet-level meetings that will be held Thursday and Friday in Geneva. Both sides are exploring what positions to take, and many of the remarks now being made by officials from both nations inevitably reflect posturing in advance of those meetings.
Whether Japanese car companies would go along with import goals remained unclear. Japan's leading financial newspaper, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, reported today that the Toyota Motor Corporation was considering such a plan for increased production in the United States and increased American local content.
A Toyota executive said the company had "no concrete plans" to expand North American production. Besides, he said, Toyota could take such a step to avoid sanctions without consulting other Japanese auto companies, some of which are not in a position to take such steps.
Taizo Yokoyama, a managing director at Mitsubishi Motors, said his company was not formulating a voluntary plan and had not been told of any compromise proposal.
The question now is whether both sides think they have demonstrated toughness and can now negotiate. "What I have detected is renewed energy on all sides to find a meaningful solution," Andrew Card, president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, said today. "In the last few weeks the work was on the right level of rhetoric to use, and now it is on how to solve the problem."

HEADLINE: Taking In the Sites;
Mapping Out Specific Destinations to Faraway Places

BYLINE: By WALTER R. BARANGER 

 BODY:
Armchair travelers have long used the Internet to roam the planet vicariously, but genuine road warriors can find information within minutes that once took days to amass.
Some travel-related World Wide Web sites are commercial or government ventures intended to drum up business, but many are owned by adoring groups of Anglophiles, Francophiles and assorted other philes motivated by a desire to share their passion. The Paris Pages, for example, are maintained by a climate scientist in San Diego who uses computer resources donated by I.B.M., and a comprehensive guide to London is posted at the University of Central London by a researcher who also maintains smaller pages devoted to Iceland and Ecuador. 
 After deciding on a destination, travelers can consult the United States State Department circulars for the latest advisories and maps. Some less intrepid souls might have second thoughts after seeing such friendly, if not reassuring, advice as "the volcano on the island of Fogo in the Republic of Cape Verde erupted and continues to spew lava, ash, rocks and smoke from its crater," or "conditions are stable under a military government except in remote border areas where longstanding insurgencies persist."
Another useful Internet stop is a currency converter. The Koblas Currency Converter lists 54 kinds of money, but travelers to countries suffering rampant inflation might find the weekly updates are not frequent enough. A Canadian site, Xenon Laboratories Universal Currency Converter, handles fewer countries but updates the rates daily and provides a handy calculator.
Travel arrangements are nearly impossible to make on the Internet, but many agents and a few airlines have Web sites. Southwest Airlines carries its fun-to-fly image onto the Web with a site that hides considerable substance behind a pithy home page. The route map is clear and concise, and clicking on a city yields information like airport parking fees. The on-line flight schedule and fare finder, both almost singular among airline Web sites, are also easy to use, but sometimes fail to properly link a fare with its corresponding list of available flights. Better to look up scheduled flights first, then find the available fares.
American Airlines and its parent, the AMR Corporation, have a site with a polished look and well-organized content. Navigating the maze of pages is generally easy, and deeper exploration will yield a gem called Globetrotter Guide. The guide, which is offered by AMR's Sabre computer reservations subsidiary, provides information for more than 25 nations, including trivia like customary banking hours and airport taxi fares.
Neither American nor Southwest offers reservations on the Web.
Web travelers can also sample the Subway Navigator, which is based in France but covers transit systems worldwide. Pick a city's subway system -- say, Kiev's -- and the Subway Navigator calculates a route between any two points. Stations are listed alphabetically and several systems have colorful maps. The route descriptions are so specific that even first-time visitors can follow them. The New York City page even shows connections between the Long Island Rail Road and the city's subway. Rail fans from around the world help maintain the Web site.
A comprehensive list of travel-related Web sites can be found at Yahoo, which contains thousands of links indexed by subject.

HEADLINE: One Deal Off. One Deal On. Well, That's Entertainment.

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT and BERNARD WEINRAUB 

 BODY:
Two weeks into his Hollywood career, Edgar Bronfman Jr., president of the Seagram Company and acting head of MCA Inc., has endured a crash course in the entertainment business, and found the journey as turbulent as any of the rides he now owns at MCA's Universal Studios theme parks.
At this point, it is hard to tell whether Mr. Bronfman is in over his head or is the shrewdest negotiator in town. 
 In a business where image is all important, it did not look very good two weeks ago when he broke off his widely reported negotiations with the superagent Michael Ovitz to come in and run MCA. But last week, when Mr. Bronfman reached a coveted distribution agreement with the new studio Dreamworks SKG, he was indeed looking like a movie mogul.
David Geffen, one of Dreamworks' three principals, along with the film director Steven Spielberg and the producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, said that "while I think the deal would likely have happened with Ovitz there, it was made very much more quickly with Bronfman."
The workings of all major industries involve a mixture of ego, image and economic muscle, but nowhere is this truer than in the entertainment industry. At stake in Mr. Bronfman's takeover of MCA is the future of an entertainment conglomerate that creates films and television shows that occupy the leisure time of millions of Americans.
It is too soon to know whether the projected $1 billion in revenue from the Dreamworks agreement will prove profitable or paltry, just as it is impossible to know whether Mr. Bronfman was smart or faint-hearted in balking at Mr. Ovitz's demands.
Press accounts at the time said Mr. Ovitz was seeking a compensation package worth $250 million. But people familiar with the negotiations say Mr. Ovitz, Mr. Bronfman's friend and longtime business adviser, wanted much more: a total of at least $360 million made up of $285 million in MCA stock, $50 million in salary over 10 years, $25 million in Seagram stock, plus a bonus of unknown size.
Neither Mr. Bronfman nor Mr. Ovitz would be interviewed for this article.
"By the standards of modern American business, it appears to have been a colossal deal for Mr. Ovitz," said Graef Crystal, an expert on executive compensation and author of "In Search of Excess."
"It sounds as if it would have been history's largest base salary and history's largest stock-option grant, ahead of Steve Ross," Mr. Crystal said, referring to $215 million in stock options the late Mr. Ross received when his Warner Communications merged with Time Inc. in 1990.
In any case, the Ovitz and Dreamworks episodes illustrate the extent to which the 40-year-old Mr. Bronfman, in seeking to use Seagram shareholders' wealth to inject new energy into MCA, will find himself tested by the art of the deal, Hollywood-style.
The last two weeks may also demonstrate that Mr. Bronfman's $5.7 billion purchase of 80 percent of MCA from the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company was probably the easy part. That deal came together in weeks and Seagram formally completed the purchase on June 5, the same day it announced the end of negotiations with Mr. Ovitz.
In contrast, Mr. Bronfman's scuttled courtship with Mr. Ovitz was a protracted affair -- although one whose unraveling became entwined with the successful pursuit of the Dreamworks deal.
That Mr. Bronfman would turn to Mr. Ovitz made sense in many ways. When Mr. Bronfman briefly worked in Hollywood in movie production while in his 20's, he made a number of highly visible friends whom he kept after joining Seagram, the family liquor and spirits business. Later Mr. Bronfman welcomed Mr. Ovitz, head of the leading talent house, Creative Artists Agency, to that group. It was Mr. Ovitz, informants say, who counseled Mr. Bronfman during the acquisition of MCA.
The two men began talking early in April, after the MCA agreement, about the possibility of Mr. Ovitz's running MCA. But these were only general conversations because Mr. Bronfman's first order of business was working out a graceful way to change the relationship of MCA's longtime chairman, Lew R. Wasserman, and its president, Sidney J. Sheinberg, to the company. These were men he could not afford to offend.
Mr. Wasserman, 82, is a highly respected Hollywood elder, while Mr. Sheinberg, 60, is a close friend and mentor to Mr. Spielberg, whose films for MCA have generated the bulk of the studio's profit in recent years. Mr. Geffen has remained close to MCA since selling his Geffen Records label to the company in 1989, a deal that made him extraordinarily wealthy.
In time, Mr. Bronfman arranged for Mr. Wasserman to stay on as chairman emeritus of MCA, and Mr. Sheinberg is expected to receive a lucrative production deal at Universal Studios.
It was not until mid-May that Mr. Bronfman began to seriously consider the terms Mr. Ovitz had proposed, several people close to the talks said. They added that Mr. Ovitz wanted a 4 percent equity stake in MCA, with an estimated value of $285 million, on top of the $50 million in salary, the bonus and the Seagram shares.
Executives familiar with the talks said Mr. Ovitz demanded a high price because he knew he would have to sell his 56 percent stake in Creative Artists Agency, and his departure would inevitably reduce the value of that stake. Federal rules prevent movie studios from being involved in the talent-agency business.
For several weeks, the talks continued in New York and Los Angeles, though they focused more on the future of MCA than the specifics of Mr. Ovitz's proposal, according to those familiar with the discussions. But things were not going all that smoothly. During that time, Mr. Ovitz varied his demands. For example, he sought to bring an ever-growing number of people from Creative Artists to MCA.
By May 31, when Edgar Bronfman Jr. flew to Montreal for a Seagram board meeting and the company's annual meeting, he and Mr. Ovitz had yet to come to terms. The board was informed that discussions were continuing and that no preliminary agreement had been reached, according to one person with knowledge of the talks.
By then, too, there were objections from his father, Edgar M. Bronfman, Seagram's chairman, and his uncle, Charles Bronfman, the co-chairman of the board.
Bronfman family trust funds control 31 percent of Seagram's stock.
Charles Bronfman, in particular, had been skeptical of his nephew's investment in MCA and questioned him extensively about the deal during board room meetings, according to executives close to the discussions. He had little patience with Mr. Ovitz's demands.
On June 1, the day after the board meeting, Mr. Bronfman and his lawyers at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett proposed the basis of an alternative deal to Mr. Ovitz in Los Angeles and to his adviser Ronald L. Olson, of the Los Angeles law firm of Munger, Tolles & Olson, who was in New York. Mr. Ovitz had wanted his $285 million in MCA equity in the form of restricted shares -- special stock that he would receive at basically no cost to himself.
Suppose, Mr. Bronfman said, that Seagram asked him to invest about $75 million of his own money in MCA -- perhaps through a low-interest loan from Seagram. The remaining $210 million would come in the form of stock options -- which are the right, but not the obligation, to buy stock, generally at the market price. Because MCA is a unit of Seagram and has no publicly traded shares, Mr. Ovitz's $75 million investment would have bought him 1 percent of the company outright. He would also receive stock options that would have given him 3 percent more of the company at the end of the 10-year agreement.
With this counteroffer, Mr. Bronfman effectively rejected the idea of giving Mr. Ovitz a stake in MCA for nothing.
Several people believe that if the two sides had come to terms earlier, Mr. Ovitz might have attained somewhat more of his original demands.
The new proposal evidently did not sit well with Mr. Ovitz, and by Thursday evening Mr. Bronfman was telling some associates that it was still tough to predict if an agreement could be reached.
One of his confidants was Mr. Geffen. Meeting in the Fifth Avenue apartment Mr. Geffen uses when he is not in Beverly Hills, Mr. Bronfman disclosed that the negotiations had taken a difficult turn. He said he hoped that Mr. Geffen and Dreamworks would still be willing to discuss a distribution deal with MCA before talking to other studios, even if Mr. Ovitz did not come aboard.
Mr. Geffen, as well as his Dreamworks associate Mr. Katzenberg, have long had chilly relations with Mr. Ovitz, according to industry experts. The third Dreamworks partner, Mr. Spielberg, is represented by Mr. Ovitz.
Yes, Mr. Geffen told Mr. Bronfman, Dreamworks would still be willing to talk.
Although the negotiations between Mr. Bronfman and Mr. Ovitz seemed to be souring by Friday morning, Mr. Bronfman had not totally given up. He told one associate that perhaps the two sides could still come to terms. But by now, the prospect of an agreement with Dreamworks might have made it easier for him to take a tough stand with Mr. Ovitz.
Late into Friday evening, and throughout the weekend, Mr. Olson was in New York with Seagram's lawyers, though those efforts were "the death rattle" of the deal, as one person familiar with the negotiations described them.
Even the revised proposal would still have been among the top two most generous deals in corporate history, Mr. Crystal, the corporate compensation expert, said. Industry executives say Mr. Ovitz may have been getting cold feet about the deal partly because he was giving up a position as perhaps the most powerful man Hollywood for a job that would have made him a Seagram's employee.
"There was no magic bullet," an executive close to the talks said. "It dawned on everybody for different reasons that the gap was no closer to closing than when they first started. So they concluded that it was just not going to work."
The collapse of the deal was seen as a setback to the calculated agenda of Mr. Bronfman, who had to admit that he had no backup plan and said he would oversee MCA himself for a while. But the speed of the Dreamworks deal with MCA -- it was forged in just 90 minutes between Mr. Bronfman, Mr. Geffen, his friend of 20 years, and Thomas P. Pollock, the Universal Studios president -- contrasted vividly with the tortured talks with Mr. Ovitz. Wall Street analysts said it was positive for Mr. Bronfman.
Over the long term, though, the outcome may have been more damaging to Mr. Ovitz, the superagent. The consensus in Hollywood now is that his priorities seem blurred, raising questions about how much loyalty he may retain from his troops and his clients in the future.
Although some agents at Creative Artists are now restless, no one is expected to leave before early next year, when C.A.A. agents pick up their annual bonuses.
The final act of the Ovitz-Bronfman drama was in many ways anticlimactic. Mr. Ovtiz picked up the phone to call Mr. Bronfman and inform him that he was no longer interested. Mr. Bronfman, according to friends, was waiting for the call.

HEADLINE: Poles Dismayed by Unchecked Crime

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WARSAW, June 18

 BODY:
Like many Poles, Andrzej Tomaszewski had high hopes that after Communism the new justice system would transform the police from predators to protectors and give citizens swift access to impartial judges. Like many Poles, he has been jolted into a disappointing reality.
For Mr. Tomaszewski, the last straw came when his station wagon was stolen from a downtown parking lot. As has become the practice here, he decided to take the law into his own hands and put an ad in a newspaper offering a reward for the return of his car. 
 A week later he got a phone call and then met with two acknowledged thieves in a coffee shop. After some haggling they settled on a $1,500 ransom and told him where his car was.
"Crime is a personal and private problem, not a problem for the police because they have no money, no resources," said Mr. Tomaszewski, who runs a travel agency. The police, he grumbled, are polite but ineffective, and judges have yet to win a general reputation for efficiency.
Like many Eastern Europeans, Poles are disillusioned by rising street crime and seemingly insoluble civil disputes born of the capitalist opportunity to make a killing -- or lose a bundle -- in the buccaneer economy.
The frustrations are underscored in recent surveys showing that the police, who were held in high regard after an almost clean sweep of their ranks in 1990, have slipped in popularity. In response to the huge numbers of unsolved crimes and increased violence, most Poles now believe that the death penalty should be restored.
"I would give Poland a 2 out of 10 on the question of a civil society: genuine rule of law and speedy procedures," said Mark Brzezinski, an American lawyer who has taught at Warsaw University Law School. "They do have the procedures on the books, but they are not realistic when you consider the numbers of cases and the training of the judiciary."
The police and court officials say they are hamstrung by skimpy budgets, eager but inexperienced police officers and judges, and the highly inflated expectations of a more open society. Retraining -- from police officers to police dogs -- is a monumental task.
Last year there were 147 murders in Warsaw, compared with 418 in Washington. But in Warsaw the rate is rising while in Washington it has dropped. Surveys show most Poles are afraid to go out on the streets at night.
Inspector Arnold Superczynski, Warsaw's police chief, offered an explanation of the new wariness. Before 1989 the police were silent about the murder rate. "Since then we've been telling the press about murder," he said. "That's why there is a feeling of cataclysm around here."
At the 6 P.M. shift change, the police station at Belevardska 16 resembles a campus fraternity house as groups of muscular young men in svelte black paratrooper-style uniforms stride through the swinging doors to take up patrol duty.
It is clear from the fresh faces that the front lines of Warsaw's anticrime squads are inexperienced troops. The ranks of the Communist police -- known as the militia -- were purged, and now nearly 50 percent of the city's police officers have less than three years' experience. One-third are under 25.
Sgt. Adam Habrevicz, 29, is one of the senior patrol officers and is considered such a veteran that he trains recruits.
"People trust us more than in the militia days," Sergeant Habrevicz said as he and his partner, Robert Ciechaniewicz, 22, nosed their blue and white police sedan toward the Praga neighborhood, one of this capital's high-crime districts.
But trust has led to a new problem: "Now people call the police more and more to involve them in their family affairs."
Indeed, the early stops on a recent evening were domestic squabbles.
At the first, a mother and daughter were being beaten by the husband. "He was furious that five cats had soiled the furniture while they were away on vacation," the sergeant said with a shrug after emerging from the first dispute. The man was unhappy that the police had answered the call, and threatened to call the police chief to complain, the sergeant said.
But this was mild compared with the past, Sergeant Habrevicz said, adding: "Then, if you went to a house, someone would say to you darkly, 'You won't be working tomorrow,' meaning they had political connections."
Curbs on police powers have a lot to do with the increased respect, Sergeant Habrevicz said. Under the Communists, the police could round up 50 people and "pacify" a neighborhood to seize one suspect. Now arrest papers must be signed by the prisoner as well as the police officer, and the prisoner has the right to inform his family or workplace of his arrest.
Complaints of unlawful arrest can be taken to the courts. In the police cells, there is a limit of two people in each lockup instead of five, and each person must be given a mattress.
But there are other kinds of curbs -- fiscal ones -- that obstruct the rule of law.
At the dilapidated neighborhood police building in Mokotow, the four detectives have only two cars and fuel is rationed.
Like the police precincts, Warsaw's lower courts are staffed by people who are strikingly young for a society accustomed to crusty public faces. Some of the city's judges are not long out of law school.
"It's a calling," said Monika Yaniec, a 34-year-old judge in the criminal courts. "We started off with idealistic ideas. That's why we're here."
But both she and her boss, Maciej Schulz, 32, the administrative judge responsible for 67 judges in the city's criminal, civil and family courts, complained that they were overwhelmed with the volume of cases.
In the criminal section of his court, Mr. Schulz said, there should be 20 judges but there are only 14 because 6 judges have quit over pay -- $580 a month compared with the $2,000 minimum that former judges can earn a month as lawyers in the private sector.
The labor courts have been swamped with cases stemming from sweeping layoffs in the last five years and the family courts are backlogged with alimony cases caused by unemployed men unable to meet their obligations, he said.
The Communist criminal code is still operative, and that frustrates both the police and citizens.
Under the old law, joy riding is not a crime, even if it is not your car, so that is the defense of many thieves. And possession of narcotics is not illegal if they are for personal use, an easy case for criminals to make.
Poland's pains with making the transition to a civil society are compounded, some lawyers say, by a lack of knowledge among Poles about the basics of the rule of law.
The ignorance has been fostered by the failure of successive Governments in the last five years to agree on a constitution, which would decide which is supreme, the courts or the legislature.
At the moment, Parliament has the power, with a two-thirds vote, to overturn rulings by the nation's highest court, the Constitutional Tribunal. In April, for example, Parliament overturned a decision by the court that declared last year's income tax rates illegal.
"Parliament basically said: Go to hell with the highest court," said Grzegorz Domanski, a Warsaw University law professor. "In the minds of the average Pole, it was like an announcement that everything in this country is political. The idea that I am a citizen, I'm aware of my liberties and I will not allow anyone to violate them and I know where to find justice -- this is phantasmagoria in the eyes of the average Pole."

HEADLINE: Congressional Memo;
Usually United, Republicans Find Trouble in Numbers on Issue of Tax Cut

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 18

 BODY:
As the House and Senate try for a third week to combine their separate budget-balancing proposals, the presumption is that Republicans are haggling over how much to cut taxes: $350 billion, as the House wants, the Senate's $170 billion bid, or some other figure. That is true, but those numbers are not their real problem.
The troubling numbers are 51 and 218 -- that is, the minimum of senators and representatives needed to approve a compromise budget blueprint. The Republicans do not seem to have them in hand yet, largely because their party, so united on virtually every other fiscal matter, is all over the map on taxes. And there is no reason to believe the task gets easier with time. 
 President Clinton added to the stew last week by offering his own balanced-budget with a smaller $111 billion tax cut, a proposal that is dead in the water now but could spring to life should Congress and the White House deadlock on the issue later this fall.
Not much other than taxes stands in the way of a Republican compromise. The two budget-balancing blueprints take different routes to eliminate the deficit by 2002, differing over how much to restrain spending in areas like the military, public works and welfare. But practically speaking, they are Tweedledee and Tweedledum: Neither would spend much, and where they disagree, Republicans are mostly willing to split the difference.
The seven-year blueprint is supposed to serve the House and Senate committees when they begin drafting a detailed budget for the 1996 fiscal year this summer.
Most experts believe an agreeable tax strategy will eventually turn up. The two leaders of Congress's budget committees, Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio and Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, have been predicting quick agreement on the tax issue and the rest of the budget ever since the House and Senate approved their separate blueprints last month.
Mr. Domenici predicted it again today. Appearing on the NBC interview program "Meet the Press," he said, "We'll get there."
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, said today that the House and Senate negotiators were "fairly close" to a tax-cut accord and offered estimates of "somewhere between $230 and $260 billion."
But Mr. Dole, appearing on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," also said that "numbers don't mean a great deal."
The Republicans' problem is in fact not one of mathematics, but of politics. If most Republicans in both the House and Senate favor some sort of tax cut, and they do, the party fractures over the questions of how much, when, and how to pay for it.
The trick facing the negotiators is to cobble together enough of those shards to make a majority in both chambers.
By no means will it be easy. This spring, House Republicans voted in lockstep for Speaker Newt Gingrich's seven-year, $350 billion package of tax cuts -- including a $500-per-child credit for working families making less than $250,000, a capital gains tax cut, and breaks for retirees and people saving for retirement.
In the Senate, Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican, proposed a nearly identical package last month, but it was swamped by a vote of 69 to 31. Most Republicans outside the South opposed it. One who did not, Mr. Dole, clearly supported it only as a show of solidarity with the new right.
In large part, the tax dispute reflects the ideological sparring already going on between Mr. Dole's establishment forces and Mr. Gingrich's new-right troops. It roughly cleaves the Republican old guard from the young Turks, the South from the snow belt, the supply-siders from mainstream economic thinkers and tax doves from deficit hawks.
The Republican legislators generally aligned with Mr. Dole favor smaller tax cuts than the Gingrich crowd, and a handful want none at all. They generally are older, politically moderate Northerners and Midwesterners who are fiscally conservative and remember what big tax cuts did to the Federal deficit in the 1980's.
They include but 20 or 30 moderates in the House, none with great influence, and maybe 20 of the 54 Republicans in the Senate. But their leaders are the cream of the Senate budget strategists: Mr. Domenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee; Bob Packwood of Oregon, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa.
Their opponents, eager for hefty tax cuts, are generally younger, more Southern and more often fiscally conservative in the sense of a Jack Kemp or a Ronald Reagan. Many are supply-siders, who say that tax cuts pay for themselves by freeing cash for tax-paying private investments. They also see lower taxes as "pro-family." They dislike deficits but detest government, and they say tax cuts deprive government of its financial lifeblood.
They include most of the Republicans in the House, and they dominate the House budget strategy team. One is Mr. Kasich, the freshman class role model. Another is Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Their Senate ranks include Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority whip, and Mr. Gramm.
Measured in tax-cut dollars, the two sides are separated by about $180 billion over seven years. But the bigger problem for negotiators is the ideological gap: the Dole faction does not want tax cuts to be in the way of reducing the deficit, while the Gingrich crowd feels the opposite. And Republican majorities in both houses of Congress are so small that if neither gave ground, a compromise budget blueprint could not pass at all.
In the House, many ardent tax-cut advocates have indicated they might settle for a package as small as $230 billion. But they and the rest of the House generally insist that any cuts take effect immediately, even if all the money needed to pay for them is not in hand.
In the Senate, where Republicans have only three votes to spare, Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming gathered Mr. Packwood and 10 other Republicans to warn Mr. Domenici that they could scuttle any tax cuts that were not explicitly paid for in advance. That means waiting until the budget is headed toward fiscal balance and the economy has rewarded such prudence by lowering interest rates. That may not happen for years, if ever.
The force that could push these opposites together is old-fashioned power politics. One power, Mr. Gingrich, believes that only a tax cut can unite the amalgam of business interests, Christian conservatives and working-class voters who put the Republicans in charge. Another, Mr. Dole, needs those same groups if his own Presidential campaign is to stay on course.
Thomas Mann, an observer of Congress at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said: "The suburban middle-class vote has remained in the Republican Party because they want lower taxes, or so it is believed. But the polls show voters want deficit reduction, and a lot of this is poll driven."
"The question," he added, "is what is the Republican priority: lower taxes or reducing the deficit?"

HEADLINE: As Aid Shrinks and Deficit Grows, Los Angeles County Faces Painful Cuts

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 16

 BODY:
After years of sunny expansion and quick fixes for gnawing financial problems, Los Angeles County has suddenly caught a bad case of the fiscal malaise of the 1990's: the prospect of a suddenly huge budget deficit and reductions in state aid are forcing local politicians to consider dramatic cuts in the nation's largest county government.
The problems have been mounting for years, particularly after the passage of Proposition 13, the 1978 ballot measure that put a rigid cap on property taxes in California. Even so, news that the county government now faces a deficit totaling perhaps $1 billion of the nearly $14 billion annual budget has caught many people here by surprise. 
 But beyond the cries of dismay and promises of a fight, most experts are warning that county services, particularly those to the poor, will have to be slashed. One of the largest hospitals in the country, the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center, may be closed, welfare payments are likely to be reduced and new taxes may have to be enacted. Already there is talk of a 25-cent tax on each alcoholic drink sold.
The county government is currently the largest employer in Southern California, with about 85,000 employees. Some are predicting more than 10,000 people could end up losing their jobs. A chief reason the county government is so large is that, as in most states, it administers a large number of health and welfare programs mandated by the Federal Government. The county has a population of nearly 9 million, including about 3.5 million in the city of Los Angeles.
The troubles of Los Angeles are unrelated to the woes of its neighbor, Orange County, which became the largest municipal government ever to file for bankruptcy when it suffered huge losses on its investments in the bond market last year.
But in some ways the problems of Los Angeles are deeper, experts say, because they involve intractable issues like the growing cost of providing services to the poor at a time when Federal and state aid are declining. In fact, the problems are a direct outgrowth of the sudden urge to reduce spending at the state and Federal levels, since more than two-thirds of the county's budget comes from those governments.
To a large extent, the county's difficulties are a case study in today's budget politics. Many members of the new Republican majority in Congress have pushed for local governments to take more responsibility for providing welfare services formerly paid for by Washington, but Los Angeles's predicament raises the question of whether the local governments have the wherewithal to do so.
"This is certainly going to affect the quality of life and our ability to meet the needs of the poor people of the county," said Sally Reed, the county's chief administrative officer, who will present her proposed budget on Monday. "There will be significant reductions in the health area and the welfare area."
She added: "It's traumatic. It's the hardest thing I've ever done. But we're going to change the way in which we expect people to survive."
Two events have placed these concerns in the headlines. One is the presentation of Ms. Reed's budget. Community organizers are already digging in for a pitched battle over keeping hospitals open and maintaining services for the inner-city poor.
The other event is the expected sale of $1.5 billion in short-term county notes. The rating agencies are scheduled to announce their ratings of the notes on Monday, and they are expected to be sold on Wednesday.
Normally, such a note sale is routine, but this time it is the subject of growing anxiety. The county currently has the highest rating for such short-term securities, but the treasurer, Larry J. Monteilh, said he was already preparing to pay more than $1 million for a letter of credit, a kind of insurance policy on securities, in the event that the agencies lower the rating and frighten investors. It would be the first time the county had been forced to acquire a letter of credit for this kind of note offering, Mr. Monteilh said.
"We think the deficit numbers are fairly large, but it is a big county," said Peter Bianchini, an analyst with Standard & Poor's who is evaluating the county. "Their situation is no surprise, but it is troubling."
There are two fundamental factors at work. One is a result of Proposition 13.
Since property taxes were the principal source of county revenue, the measure created a crisis. Ultimately, it was resolved by the state government agreeing to allot additional revenues to the counties. That made up for a substantial portion of the shortfall.
However, the state itself fell on hard times several years ago, in part because of a steep recession. So, starting three years ago, the State Legislature eliminated the funds it had been providing the counties to cover the losses from Proposition 13. For Los Angeles County, that will mean the loss of nearly $1 billion in the coming fiscal year, which begins July 1.
The Legislature's action was a warning shot to county governments across the state. Yet over the past several years Los Angeles County's supervisors have resorted to what most here admit were one-time fixes rather than fundamental changes. The county borrowed heavily, rather than lay off employees or reduce services.
"The county failed to face up to the crisis imposed on them by the state's actions," said Zev Yaro slavsky, a county supervisor elected late last year. "Instead of making the tough cuts, they borrowed from their future revenues to pay today's bills. And they did it big time."
Indeed, the county is budgeting $439 million in the coming fiscal year just to meet interest payments; that marks an increase of more than $100 million from the current fiscal year.
Some have charged Ms. Reed with exaggerating the depth of the problems just to frighten residents into accepting big budget reductions. She rejected the charge but acknowledged that tough political decisions would have to be made. It still is not clear that county or state politicians are prepared to take those measures.
Antonio Villaraigosa, a member of the State Assembly from the district that includes downtown Los Angeles, said, "I am frankly aware of the fact that the State Legislature is abdicating its responsibility to the county by not providing them with sufficient revenue, but at the same time I think it is absolutely outrageous that Sally Reed would think of closing down the U.S.C. hospital."
He said he would propose, among other things, cutting Ms. Reed's salary and other administrative expenses before closing down the medical center.

HEADLINE: A Rivalry in Rabble-Rousing As Letter Writers Keep Count

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE 

 BODY:
Louis Jay Herman has an opinion on everything. And he is eager to prove it.
With little encouragement Mr. Herman, who lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, pulls out his master list detailing the 859 letters he has written to The New York Times since 1987. Another list synopsizes the 123 letters that have made it into print -- including the one bashing Pete Rose, another defending Italian Fascists against charges of anti-Semitism, a third making his argument against the need to floss daily. On a third list, he tracks the success of others whose great passion is writing letters to editors. 
 "I keep a close watch on my various rivals," said Mr. Herman, who has built a second career commenting on the times after retiring as a United Nations translator. "I want to know if I'm still No. 1. I am."
He and his rivals see newspapers and magazines as an intellectual casino of fleeting fame -- they write scores of letters to various publications hoping that a few will make it into print, putting their names on the lips of thousands of people whom they could not possibly buttonhole on the street.
In the past, frequent letter writers have been portrayed as blowhards, gadflies and rabble-rousers. In the 1950's, a staple of Steve Allen's "Tonight" show was a skit in which he read, with bulging eyes and clenched fists, actual letters culled from the papers.
But now, amid the flood of callers to talk shows and the flamers on Internet, people who write letters to the editor seem almost quaint, like contemplative souls committed to reason in a world where "in your face" is de rigueur.
"I don't even listen to talk radio," said George Jochnowitz, who writes five to seven letters a month to various publications. "I write because the process forces me to sit down and think about how I really feel about an issue, to focus, revise and clarify my views. A lot of time I'm just letting off steam, but I like to think it's well-thought-out steam."
Most big newspapers and magazines print only a tiny fraction of the letters they receive. The Times, for example, gets roughly 1,500 letters a week and runs 60; Time magazine receives about 1,500 and prints 35; The Nation gets about 100 and runs about 5, and National Review usually runs about 10 letters out of 150 in each biweekly issue.
Serious letter writers increase their odds by following some basic rules: keep it short, avoid profanity, always refer to an article that has appeared in the publication. Those who work hardest at it, like Mr. Herman, say their success rate hovers at 8 to 12 percent.
Still, they keep churning them out, because like all gamblers they are philosophers at heart: they understand they must sit through a lot of losing hands to score big.
They are also romantics, trapped in a relationship of imagined slights and seldom-requited love. They write to people without names ("Dear Editor") who never respond, and they say they are mystified as to why one letter is published and another lands in the waste basket.
But when a letter is printed, said Hugo S. Cunningham, an unemployed 42-year-old Bostonian, it is heartwarming -- a serendipitous smile from the one admired. "It's like out of all of the people who wrote in, they thought you had something important to say," said Mr. Cunningham, who has written more than 400 letters to magazines and newspapers in the last decade.
Mr. Jochnowitz, who is 57 and a professor of linguistics at the College of Staten Island, like most letter writers, fires off commentaries to a broad range of periodicals.
Conservative, liberal, neo-con, domestic and international -- it does not matter as long as they spell his name right. In the last 10 years his letters have been printed in Commentary, The New York Review of Books, China Today, The Daily News, The Staten Island Advance and The Times.
Letter writing became a passion when he returned from a teaching stint in China in 1984. "I had always known that Mao's China was not a paradise," he said. "But now the cruelty and repression was happening to people I knew, people who were my friends. I felt I had an obligation to share what I knew."
Once he got into the swing of things, Mr. Jochnowitz found there were innumerable topics he wanted to address, though Mao and Marx remain his most common subjects.
He often starts his letters with a question: "Why do good people so often believe in bad causes?" Or, "Will no one ever say a word against Shakespeare?"
Mr. Jochnowitz has still not received any answers.

Going Out of Business

 BODY:
The number of business failures in the region fell last year, a confirmation of continuing economic growth in the area. Connecticut had the nation's largest drop in failures from 1993 to 1994, 48 percent. The number of firms closing up shop last year fell 20 percent in New York State, 23 percent in New Jersey and 17 percent in the nation as a whole. Analysts say business failure data is a good measure of the health of the business sector because it is one of the few economic statistics that can be broken down by region or industry, or both. It is often a lagging indicator of economic conditions, however, and many experts feel the region's economy is currently slowing.

HEADLINE: DANCE REVIEW;
Denver Ensemble Reaches Back For a Look at Black Themes

BYLINE: By JACK ANDERSON 

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.C., June 18

 BODY:
The American Dance Festival is always up to date. Every year it brings to the campus of Duke University here an array of premieres that attest to the diversity of modern dance. Yet even as it shows where modern dance is and hints at where it may be going, it is also concerned with where it has been.
On Saturday night at Page Auditorium, the Cleo Parker Robinson Dance Ensemble, a company from Denver, showed some of the ways in which choreographers have treated black American themes by offering works from the 1930's, 40's and 50's. 
 The most amazing of them was "How Long Brethren?," which Helen Tamiris choreographed in 1937 to a recorded score (for voices and instrumental ensemble) that Genevieve Pitot arranged from black protest songs. The dance was almost awesomely austere. Each of its scenes made use of only a few carefully chosen steps and poses, yet the piece had tremendous impact. And it was lovingly staged by Dianne McIntyre, aided by three members of the original cast: Pauline Tish, Ida Little Arbeit and Sasha Pressman.
Tamiris, who lived from 1905 to 1966, thought dance could express contemporary issues, and she was one of America's first white choreographers to depict aspects of black life. With its images of oppression and defiance, "How Long Brethren?" is very much a product of the socially conscious 1930's. But the monumental choreography for a cast of 16 women makes it more than a period piece.
The weightedness of the steps is especially remarkable. Bodies often bend low as if to suggest weariness. The dancers never merely walk, they trudge.
Two scenes are particularly impressive for their economy and power. In one, the way in which seven women twitch lightly while standing on boxes suggests that they are the victims of lynchings in their death throes. Tamiris here conveys a sense of horror through extreme understatement.
The finale is equally evocative. Dancers are packed so tightly in huddles that all sense of personal identity is lost. Hope, too, seems lost. But a soloist moves among the women like an idealist egotistically exhorting them to rebel. Karah Abiog danced this role with fervor, and the scene became a lament against injustice and a statement of faith in liberation.
Like her better-known contemporaries Martha Graham and Doris Humphrey, Tamiris was among the modern-dance innovators of the 1920's and 30's. Her works have been neglected in recent years. If "How Long Brethren?" is typical of their quality, more of them should be revived.
Katherine Dunham, who was born in 1912, is one of the pioneers of American black dance. An anthropologist trained at the University of Chicago, she knows how to do choreographic research. She also knows how to entertain.
She took an amused look at a 1920's Prohibition speak-easy in "Barrelhouse Blues," a comic sketch that dates from 1943. Ms. Robinson and Germaul Barnes played two young flappers who cavorted to a score by Jess Stacy. They managed to make their hip wiggles an erotic enticement.
Seated on a bar stool watching them was an older woman, portrayed by Stephanie Carden. She gazed on their antics with a worldly and slightly cynical expression that implied she had experienced the pain as well as the joy of love and now harbored no romantic illusions.
Donald McKayle conjured a romantic dream world in "Nocturne," which he choreographed in 1952 to pieces by Louis Hardin, a blind street musician who called himself Moondog. Mr. McKayle, who was born in 1930, has become an unusually versatile choreographer. "Nocturne" found him in a lyrical mood. Movements looked light and effortless, and the piece ended with a whole ensemble of embracing lovers.
Yet just as Moondog put quirky melodies into formal contrapuntal structures, Mr. McKayle also organized movement in tight, formal patterns. The illusion of ease is the result of artistic discipline.
In addition to glancing over dance history, the company presented "Wisdom of the Baobab Tree," which Ms. Robinson choreographed last year to a score by Jay Hoggard. Marceline Freeman was cast as an ancestral spirit, and she summoned an African community into ceremonial dances.
The choreography, though energetic, was vague and repetitive. Recorded voices chanted phrases that included "Ritual!" and "God Is Love." But the dancers seldom seemed involved in any specific sort of ritual, and the work as a whole was sentimental rather than inspiring.

Only a few weeks ago, it looked as if the sad saga of the tens of thousands of Vietnamese stuck in squalid detention camps across Southeast Asia was finally heading toward a tolerable conclusion. Those who did not qualify as political refugees were headed back, under U.N. monitoring, to a Vietnam that was, if no paradise, at least less impoverished and repressive than the one they fled.
Then House Republicans attached an amendment to the foreign aid bill that calls for reconsidering the asylum claims of those already found ineligible and cutting off funding to monitor and assist returned refugees in Vietnam. This clumsy political gesture touched off riots in the detention camps against any further repatriations and halted the return flow. 
 Reinterviewing may sound like a generous offer, and many who voted for the provision sincerely wanted to help the Vietnamese in detention camps. But the more likely result is further suffering.
The amendment, which the Senate has not acted on and which President Clinton opposes, may never become law. And it is not at all clear whether Congress can compel the executive branch to grant political asylum to people who do not qualify.
The story of the Vietnamese boat people began nearly 20 years ago, in the years following Hanoi's triumph over South Vietnam. Millions of Vietnamese set sail in small boats fleeing ethnic and political persecution and economic misery. Many died at sea or fell victim to local pirates.
Those who made it to nearby shores were received with hostility and herded into makeshift camps to await possible acceptance elsewhere. Eventually, more than a million were admitted to the United States and tens of thousands were accepted by other countries.
Some 40,000 remain in Southeast Asian camps, more than half in Hong Kong. All have been formally found ineligible for asylum under international law, which requires well-founded fear of persecution. Procedural questions have been raised about a small number of screenings, and these might usefully be reviewed. But the House's call for a wholesale reopening will only hold out false hopes and prevent agreement to voluntary return. Meanwhile, cutting off monitoring and assistance funds can only hurt those who have already returned.
The Senate, if it truly cares about the fate of these Vietnamese, should avoid repeating the House's mistake.

HEADLINE: Don't Forget Our Foreign Aid Also Helps People

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Foreign Aid Has Its Uses" (Op-Ed, June 12): Brent Scowcroft makes a case for foreign aid as leverage for furthering foreign policy aims. What about that very small portion of foreign aid that goes to support programs in developing countries where the people may simply need help? 
 I am concerned that in the frenzy to cut the budget, Americans will forget that we're a nation of compassionate people who want to help those who just need a boost up to achieve those blessings of food, health and education that we all wish for each other.
As a private citizen I saw American foreign aid dollars at work in Bangladesh. It's good work, the kind the Republicans and Democrats alike can applaud -- helping people help themselves at the grass-roots level.
During my visit I toured the Women's Self-Help Clinic, which operates in Badda, a poor district in Dhaka, the capital. ("Poor" in Dhaka means your children are malnourished, never attend school and often subsist on the proceeds of begging.) The clinic serves the women of a square-mile area where 400,000 people live. Remarkable for a Muslim country, it is administered almost entirely by women.
The Women's Self-Help Clinic exists because of Danish, Dutch and American money, some from governments and some from private donations, and not least by the clinic's own efforts to sell what it can produce. This is true multinational cooperation of the most constructive kind.
The United States Agency for International Development supports the family planning activity of the Badda Self-Help Clinic and family planning programs all over Asia. And that support has achieved remarkable success. In Bangladesh the total fertility rate has fallen from about seven children per woman to about five.
This figure comes from a report by Ronald Freedman, published by the East-West Center's Program on Population. He writes, "When I first began studying Asia's fertility and family planning efforts 33 years ago, neither I nor other serious observers expected such rapid fertility declines to occur on that continent -- certainly not in populations with such large, poor, and illiterate strata."
Emerging trouble spots in the world are those countries whose societies fail because of overpopulation, illiteracy, famine. The resulting civil wars and floods of refugees call forth billions of dollars of emergency aid and even troop occupations that might be avoided through programs that address those social ills.
Don't believe we can't afford to help. We can't afford not to.

HEADLINE: Container Tax Repeal Means Jobs for New York

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your June 12 news article on lobbying in Albany for repeal of the soft drink container tax makes interesting reading but fails to emphasize significant points justifying the industry's position and that of Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature. 
 The container tax stripped the soft drink industry of almost all profits during the 1990's. Employment dropped by 40 percent and the number of bottlers was reduced from 109 to 47 over the past 10 years as a result of the combined effects of this tax and the 22 percent decline in the price per ounce of colas.
This tax was anticompetitive since it unfairly penalized only the carbonated beverage part of the soft drink industry.
The tax was originally imposed to help pay for a proposed environmental bond issue that the voters subsequently rejected, yet the tax was left standing. The bond issue didn't have anything to do with the soft drink and beer industries, since these industries already collected and recycled their packaging at no cost to taxpayers in New York under the returnable container law.
The result of the tax cut will be the creation of hundreds of new jobs over the next few years. In fact, one of my clients, the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York, plans to hire more than 600 new employees in 1995.
What the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, saw was bad law and bad economics, both of which were hurting the state and its citizens. He chose to insist that it be corrected, and that is the mark of real leadership -- bipartisan leadership shared with Governor Pataki and supported by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.
When the Legislature passes a bad bill, it is the hallmark of strong leadership to stand tall and to change it.

HEADLINE: Anti-Jobs Policy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Clinton Administration is ready to blame the Federal Reserve Board if the economy shows more signs of dipping into recession (Business Day, June 13). The Fed has been raising interest rates to slow down the economy, but the Administration now hints the rates should be lowered. 
 Sadly, the Administration is silent about the bipartisan policy, accepted by the Fed as well, that the unemployment rate must be kept at 6 percent or higher to control inflation by depressing wages. This antijobs policy is more important than the casual political talk in both parties about the need to create jobs and put those on welfare back to work.

HEADLINE: Don't Forget Our Foreign Aid Also Helps People;
Shaping the World

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Foreign Aid Has Its Uses" (Op-Ed, June 12), Brent Scowcroft makes a strong case against the devastating cuts in our foreign aid budget proposed by the Republican leadership in Congress. 
 General Scowcroft and I agree that foreign aid is a crucial instrument of foreign policy in regions of strategic importance to the United States, like the Middle East. However, I disagree that promoting sustainable economic development and democracy overseas "are not top priorities."
Support for the Middle East peace process is a priority for America today, but foreign aid is as much about the world of the year 2020, 2050 and beyond. What could be a higher national priority than building a world for our children that is less hostile to American interests?
The alarming increase in the number of the world's people who are born into poverty, pollution of the environment, the spread of deadly viruses and the amassing of weapons by undemocratic governments may not imperil us immediately, but solving these problems is no less important to our security in the long term. With the cold war behind us, exerting leadership to combat these global threats should be a priority of our foreign policy.
Cutting foreign aid may seem like an easy choice, since none of the proponents of these cuts will be in office 50 years hence. But there can hardly be a better example of "penny-wise, pound foolish." Even worse, it comes at a time when our opportunity to shape the world of future generations has never been greater.

HEADLINE: Stocks Keep Setting Highs; Nasdaq Jumps

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Led by technology companies and bank issues, the stock market rose to record levels yesterday as the Nasdaq composite index posted its biggest one-day leap in 14 months. Sharply rising bond prices gave equities an additional lift.
The Dow Jones industrial average hit a record 4,553.68 yesterday, up 42.89 points. The broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 5.39 points, to 545.22, also a record. But the top performer for the day was the Nasdaq composite, rich with technology stocks, which rose 13.44 points, to a record level of 922.09. 
 So far this year, the Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500 have each risen nearly 19 percent and the Nasdaq almost 23 percent. These are bigger gains than these indexes posted in all of 1993 and 1994 combined.
Meanwhile, the dollar held steady in advance of a speech tonight by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, as well as the release, scheduled for tomorrow, of the Fed's so-called beige book report on the economy.
The financial markets have received mixed signals from the Fed and Mr. Greenspan as to whether the central bank will cut interest rates, which could help stocks and bonds, but send the dollar plunging as foreign investors shift to currencies paying higher interest rates.
After rising for three sessions, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.57 percent yesterday from 6.62 percent.
The bond market is factoring in a large cut in interest rates to 5 percent from 6 percent over the next six months, said William Gross, managing director of the Pacific Investment Management Company, one of the nation's biggest bond buyers.
"It bothers me a little bit," Mr. Gross said about the bond market's assumptions, but he continues to buy bonds. He avoids shorter-term bonds, like the two-year and three-year, but is still confident about 30-year bonds.
Still, stocks in New York yesterday continued to rise even when bond prices retreated in the last hour of trading, indicating that stock traders were particularly optimistic despite uncertainty about Fed policy.
One reason for this buoyancy wasthe $5.4 billion bid by the First Union Corporation for First Fidelity Bancorp, prompting takeover speculation in other bank stocks. Another was that several high-technology companies reported earnings or gave presentations to securities analysts and others in New York.
Of the top 10 movers in the top Nasdaq 100 stocks, nine were technology issues. The Intel Corporation, the big semiconductor manufacturer, led the index, rising 3 5/8 a share, to 61 3/4, on continuing indications of strong demand for computers during the normally slow summer months. Intel, a favorite among institutional investors, was also the most active stock at nearly 16 million shares.
The Microsoft Corporation, another institutional favorite, also rose 2153/16 a share, to 8913/16 , and the Oracle Corporation, a leading software company, rose 1 a share, to 38 5/8.
Part of the reason technology stocks were so prominent on Wall Street yesterday was New York visits by executives of high-tech businesses. Some of the biggest technology companies are making presentations at a technology conference sponsored by Bear, Stearns & Company in New York. Other companies are also in town for an industry trade show called PC Expo.
For example, Micron Technology Inc., after reporting record earnings and 53 percent gross margins last week, said yesterday at the conference that it might increase its profit margins further in the next several quarters. Micron shares rose 3, to 53.
"These conferences are just a fabulous lovefest," said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment strategist for Gruntal & Company.
The other news event that helped lift stocks was First Union's acquisition bid, the biggest of its kind. With interest rates relatively low, the financial-services industry is posting record profits. Deregulation also provides incentives for banks and other institutions to merge, so when a big merger is announced, stock traders speculate on other mergers, lifting bank stocks as a group.
Twenty of the 22 stocks in the S.& P. regional banks group rose, led by First Fidelity, which agreed to merge with First Union. First Fidelity shares rose 10 1/4, to 59. Shares in First Union fell 1 3/4, to 45 7/8.
The dollar fell to 84.63 Japanese yen from 84.76 yen in New York trading and fell to 1.3970 German marks from 1.4002. The dollar has been stable for nearly three weeks, at more than 84 yen and around 1.4 marks.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.22 points, to 292.18, on volume of 323 million shares, slightly below this year's average daily trading volume of 332 million shares. Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners, 1,343 to 950. The American Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.81 point, to 496.21.
Among advancers was Lannet Data Communications Ltd., an Israeli maker of computer local area networks, which agreed to be acquired by Madge N.V., a Dutch company, for $300 million. Lannet shares rose 4 1/8, to 23 1/2. The Milwaukee Insurance Group rose 6 3/4, to 20 1/4, after Unitrin Inc. announced plans to buy the insurer for $94 million.
Among declining stocks was that of the Sunbeam Corporation, the household products company, which dropped 5, to 13 3/8, after it lowered estimates for second-quarter and full-year results. And Esmor Correction Services Inc., a manager of jails, fell 2 a share, to 17 1/2, after a riot by illegal aliens broke out in a detention center it operated in Elizabeth, N.J., for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Local officials criticized Esmor's operation.

HEADLINE: The Battle To Protect A Shipyard From Cuts

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: KITTERY, Me., June 17

 BODY:
In the basement of his house here, surrounded by pictures of submarines, William D. McDonough, a retired Navy captain, has been waging what may be his final battle: the fight to save the 195-year-old Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.
As the military tries to streamline operations in the post-cold war era, an independent commission in Washington will begin voting Thursday on a list of military installations to be closed, a list that includes Portsmouth, the country's oldest public shipyard. 
 Sprawling across an island on the Piscataqua River between Maine and New Hampshire, the shipyard started building submarines during World War I and continued until 1971 and now overhauls and refuels them. The panel's recommendations must go to President Clinton by July 1, and then to Congress for approval.
"Our naval yard has been a major player in the national security of the U.S. ever since we declared our independence," said Captain McDonough, who was the shipyard's commander for five years until 1979. "We are the submarine yard. We have been in the forefront of every significant development in submarining -- the hull shape, the deep diving, the sound isolation. We were the first Government yard to build a nuclear submarine, the first government yard to overhaul a nuclear submarine, the first government yard to refuel a nuclear submarine."
The shipyard, which does classified work and is not open to the public, also has a central role in the town's economy, although Kittery is doing a booming business on a mile-long stip of outlet stores offering goods like discounted Waterford crystal and Ralph Lauren sheets. Of the 30,000 people who live in Portsmouth, N.H., and Kittery, 4,100 work here. The civilian payroll amounts to $221 million a year.
Portsmouth was one of 31 military installations the independent Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission added in May to a list of 146 bases already under review to be closed, reduced or consolidated. The Pentagon recommended the closing of two other big naval shipyards, Long Beach and the Ship Repair Facility on the island of Guam, but wants Portsmouth, which overhauls and refuels Los Angeles-class attack nuclear submarines, to stay open.
Eighty-five percent of the installations on the list will be cut, said John Earnhardt, spokesman for the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, which is headed by Alan J. Dixon, a former Senator from Illinois.
Just as proposed base closings elsewhere have inspired grass-roots lobbying efforts, the battle to save the shipyard has brought together community leaders and citizens from Maine and New Hampshire, as well as the governors and Congressional delegations of both states.
The base here has an advantage in the New Hampshire Presidential primary: the White House strongly signaled to the Pentagon that it preferred that Portsmouth stay open.
But a computer analysis showed that over 20 years the Government would save $2.3 billion by closing Portsmouth, the base closure commission says. Most of the work now done at Portsmouth would be shifted to the naval shipyard in Norfolk, Va.
In an unusual gesture that seemed to indicate how difficult the decision on Portsmouth will be, all eight members of the commission toured the shipyard the day before the hearing.
In the fight to keep Portsmouth open, Captain McDonough helped organize 1,000 area residents into a caravan of 22 buses for a trip to Boston on June 3, when the base closure commission held a hearing at the John F. Kennedy Library.
Eileen Foley, the Mayor of Portsmouth, made the trip to Boston. Mrs. Foley, who is 77, was one of 25,000 civilians employed at the shipyard during World War II. "There were three shifts," she said. "It was continuous madness. Everybody worked all the time. It was a patriotic thing. You felt like you were the woman behind the man behind the boats."
Portsmouth built more than 70 submarines during World War II, more than any other shipyard. With its deep harbor and heritage of master shipbuilders, the shipyard has recorded a long list of firsts.
In 1690, long before it was established as a United States Naval Shipyard, builders there completed the H.M.S. Falkland for the British Royal Navy, the first warship built in North America. In 1776, the 18-gun sloop U.S.S. Ranger was built for John Paul Jones, the Revolutionary War hero. In 1917 Portsmouth built the first American submarine.
Threatened base closures are a part of life at Portsmouth since the 1960's. "We have gone through these periodic threats since immediately after the Civil War," said Captain McDonough, who heads the nonprofit Seacoast Shipyard Association here, which was formed to fight past threats. "It's nothing new to us."
Paul Parent has worked at the shipyard 21 years. "I've been through this since I started," said Mr. Parent, who is a rigger, a job that requires him to crawl into confined spaces in submarines to remove components for overhauling. "They were always going to close the Navy yard. We are the best in the business. Nobody can take that away from us.

U.S. Threatens Aviation Curbs Against Japan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration broadened its confrontation with Japan today, threatening to bar Japanese airlines from some of their most profitable cargo routes to the United States in retaliation for Tokyo's refusal to allow Federal Express to expand its operations there.
The threatened sanctions, which would go into effect next month, are separate from the Administration's June 28 deadline for imposing 100 percent tariffs on 13 models of Japanese luxury cars unless Japan agrees to open its markets wider to American autos and auto parts. 
 The aviation case has far lower stakes than the dispute over autos. But White House officials said they intended to send a message to Tokyo: that the Administration was willing to use direct confrontation, across the board, as a tool to prod Japan's entrenched bureaucracy.
The new dispute also underlines a striking reversal of roles, one in which Japan is seeking a solution it says is unacceptable in the heated confrontation over automotive trade. And Washington, while opposing a specific market-share target for air carriers, is advocating just such goals in auto trade. [Page D1.]
The action in the airline dispute came at the end of a day of conflicting signals and countersignals on auto trade. Last-ditch negotiating sessions are scheduled Thursday and Friday in Geneva, and all weekend, Japanese officials floated the possibility that their car makers might agree to increase their use of American parts. But almost all the proposals, at least those the Japanese discussed publicly, were focused on increases in the "local content" of cars made in Japanese factories in the United States.
If the Administration settled for that, it would be backing away from a primary objective in the car talks. All along, it has sought to force the purchase of more American parts for cars made in Japan, where the intricate network of relationships between manufacturers and their suppliers is particularly tight and highly resistant to outsiders' entry.
American officials said that some of the new Japanese proposals represented a step forward. Nonetheless, the gulf between these offers and the minimum American requirements remained enormous.
"So far, we are hearing generalities," a senior Administration official said in the thick of the auto talks. "Where they are resisting is the tight, measurable parameters we need to demonstrate a few years from now whether they are meeting the goals we agree on. And that is the hardest thing for them to agree to."
In Brussels, Yoshihiro Sakamoto, vice minister of international trade and industry and the chief Japanese negotiator, told reporters that "pessimism would represent my honest feeling at the moment." He accused the United States of inflexibility, saying, "There are no signs whatsoever that would imply that the U.S. side will present new proposals which would form a compromise."
Such statements, by either side, are common in the last week or so of any trade negotiation. But they may well go beyond posturing in this case because Japan and the United States both know that the automotive market is such a visible and important business for each country that any bargain struck in the next week will form the basis for agreements for years to come in other industries.
"This is not about automobiles," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said in Halifax, Nova Scotia, during the weekend, where he attended the summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations. "It is about access to the Japanese market."
The White House today repeated President Clinton's pledge to proceed with the $5.9 billion in car sanctions a week from Wednesday if no agreement is reached.
But it is a prospect that leaves some officials nervous. The State Department and some in the Pentagon have expressed concern that the actual imposition of sanctions would harm the broader Japanese-American relationship, especially if it overlaps with a particularly sensitive period, the 50th anniversary in August of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Japanese surrender a few days later.
The timing helps explain why Secretary of State Warren Christopher met twice in Halifax with his Japanese counterpart, Yohei Kono. American officials said Mr. Christopher was trying to get the Japanese Foreign Ministry, which usually favors a softer line than the trade bureaucrats, more involved.
Still, the economic officials in Washington who argue that diplomacy has too often been placed ahead of economic interests remain dominant. They argue that sanctions are the best way to convince Tokyo that a new era has arrived.
The threatened aviation curbs are an example. That dispute began when Japan refused to approve Federal Express flights from its new cargo hub in the former Subic Bay Naval Station in the Philippines.
Under a 1952 aviation agreement with Japan, approval of the Federal Express Corporation's rights to land cargo in Japan from Subic should be automatic, the Americans say. Japan has withheld that approval, declaring that the aviation agreement -- signed during the American occupation -- is one-sided and needs to be renegotiated.
"We have tried to resolve this dispute through negotiations," Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena said this afternoon. "But the Japanese Government's failure to approve Federal Express's services, which are clearly provided for by the bilateral agreement, leaves us no other course of action."
Invoking a provision of the Federal Aviation Act, Mr. Pena proposed sanctions that would prohibit Japan's two largest cargo carriers, Japan Airlines and Nippon Cargo Airlines, from delivering freight to the United States that was picked up elsewhere in Asia and routed through Japan. He said Washington would consider barring flights originating in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand; the final decision would be made after hearings scheduled to end on July 14.
American and other foreign carriers fly out of each of those five countries, so the ban would have a minimum effect on the American economy. But the symbolic effect of blocking Japanese companies from routes worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year would be great.
The key question facing American negotiators in the auto talks is whether Japan's ambitious Minister of International Trade and Industry, Ryutaro Hashimoto, has changed his political calculations about the usefulness of saying no to Washington. Mr. Hashimoto is considered a leading candidate to become Prime Minister, late this year or in a subsequent reshuffling of governments.
But in Halifax, Mr. Hashimoto was accommodating and seemingly eager to get talks started again. On Friday he asked Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, to help arrange a meeting of their deputies before the Geneva negotiations. That gave the Americans their first faint glimmer of optimism.
Yet the differences are wide, and the pronouncements on both sides so sharp, that it may be too late for Mr. Hashimoto to find a way out. Similarly, Mr. Clinton would open himself to criticism, from his own party and from Republicans, if he appeared to back away from a confrontation that the White House has committed so much political capital to winning.

HEADLINE: Cuba Tells U.S. It Will Not Extradite Fugitive Financier

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19

 BODY:
The Cuban Government told American diplomats today that it does not plan to extradite Robert L. Vesco to the United States even though Cuba hinted after arresting him in Havana two weeks ago that it would hand him over, Administration officials said today.
State Department officials said they were disappointed by the decision, which came after the Clinton Administration told Cuban officials that it wanted Mr. Vesco returned so that he could be tried on embezzlement and narcotics charges. 
 "The Cubans are telling us, 'no deal,' " said one Administration official.
Many American diplomats were surprised by Cuba's decision to arrest Mr. Vesco on espionage charges after he lived a life of luxury in Cuba for a dozen years. Several officials suggested that Cuba had hinted that it might extradite Mr. Vesco as a way to develop good will with the United States at a time when it is eager to have the 32-year-old economic embargo against the Cuban Government eased.
But some officials said they always doubted Cuba would turn over Mr. Vesco, a financier who fled the United States in the early 1970's during an embezzlement investigation, since he is reputed to have information linking many Cuban officials to criminal activity.
Joseph Sullivan, the head of the American Interests Section in Havana, which serves as a liaison office between the Cuban and American Governments in the absence of diplomatic relations, met with Cuban officials late today in what American officials described as a last-ditch effort to persuade Cuba to extradite Mr. Vesco.
CNN reported today that the Cuban President, Fidel Castro, had said in a private dinner on Sunday with the network's executives and journalists that it would be "immoral" to extradite Mr. Vesco and make him a "pawn of U.S.-Cuba relations." Mr. Castro was quoted as saying that Cuba would conduct its own investigation of Mr. Vesco.
American diplomats say Mr. Vesco must have done something to run afoul of Mr. Castro or his brother, Raul, the head of the Cuban military, because for years Mr. Vesco had been free to conduct his business dealings with their unofficial blessing.
Rafael Dausa, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Mr. Vesco has been charged with being "a provocateur or agent for foreign special services," although he refused to specify which country's special services Mr. Vesco was believed to be serving.
In recent interviews, American diplomats, intelligence experts and law enforcement officials said that during his years in Cuba, Mr. Vesco has been heavily involved in drug trafficking, money laundering and smuggling American goods into Cuba.
Administration officials said Cuba declined to turn over Mr. Vesco even though they had complied with Cuba's request to provide information about the numerous indictments Mr. Vesco faces in the United States. They include a 1976 indictment handed down by a Federal grand jury in New York for siphoning off more than $200 million from a Geneva-based mutual fund and a 1973 federal indictment in Washington for making an illegal $200,000 contribution to the re-election campaign of President Richard M. Nixon.
In addition, a Federal grand jury in Jacksonville, Fla., indicted Mr. Vesco in 1989 for conspiring with Carlos Lehder Rivas, a Colombian drug cartel leader, to smuggle narcotics. Ten days ago, prosecutors in Tallahassee, Fla., unsealed a 1984 indictment that charges Mr. Vesco with cocaine trafficking.
One senior State Department official said that after Mr. Vesco was arrested, an official in the Cuban Foreign Ministry told the American liaison office in Havana: "We have him. Are you interested in him?" The Clinton Administration read this as an offer to hand over Mr. Vesco if the United States were to reciprocate in some unspecified way. The State Department has said repeatedly, however, that the Administration would not make any reciprocal gestures in exchange for Mr. Vesco's extradicton.
A senior Administration official said that even though Cuba had strongly suggested two weeks ago that it might extradite Mr. Vesco, it emphasized today that it was not making -- and had never made -- any formal offer to do so.
Within the Administration, officials speculated that there were two reasons why Havana had decided not to extradite Mr. Vesco: he knew too much that could incriminate senior Cuban officials, and the Clinton Administration did not offer enough to make it worthwhile for Mr. Castro to hand over America's most wanted financial criminal.
American law enforcement officials acknowledge some ambivalence about the prospect of having Mr. Vesco returned. While it would be a coup to have such a well-known criminal sent back, they fear that it would be hard to prosecute him for financial fraud because some witnesses have died and the evidence has grown old.

HEADLINE: Public Housing Efficiency Plan, Step 1: Get New Refrigerators

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
The New York Power Authority has persuaded housing officials to throw away most of the 180,000 refrigerators in New York City's public housing units over the next nine years -- even if they are working fine. The authority will recruit manufacturers to build more efficient ones, and will provide them free to the New York City Housing Authority.
This, power officials say, is the way to make money in the energy business these days. 
 The key to the deal, to be signed today, is energy efficiency. Refrigerators use more electricity than anything else in an apartment, and the models now in use by the Housing Authority, some of which are 20 years old, are the kitchen equivalent of gas guzzlers. The Housing Authority believes that new models will save money on electric bills, while the Power Authority hopes that innovations like the free-fridge deal will help it keep customers and carve out a niche for itself amid growing competition.
Appliance manufacturers have made tremendous strides in refrigerator efficiency in the last few years, but so far only in the larger, more expensive models used in big suburban kitchens.
The reason is that homeowners buy refrigerators and also pay the electric bills, so they may consider efficiency when shopping. In apartments, tenants usually pay electric bills, so landlords tend to shop for the cheapest models. "The landlords have no motivation to buy the efficient one," said an energy expert who has pushed the new plan, Ashok Guptah of the Natural Resources Defense Council.
But in New York public housing, the Housing Authority buys the refrigerators and also pays the electric bills. The Power Authority, which took over serving the Housing Authority from Consolidated Edison in 1976, supplies the electricity. It believes that it can induce manufacturers to serve a huge, ready-made market -- public housing -- by adapting new technologies to make an apartment-sized, 14-cubic-foot refrigerator. The Power Authority hopes to line up several other housing authorities that it supplies -- and maybe some others out of state -- to sweeten the incentive for appliance makers.
"We think that between New York and a few other big cities, we have a market for 50,000 refrigerators a year, which is enough to get manufacturers excited about building them," said S. David Freeman, president and chief executive of the Power Authority.
Once the machines have been developed, Power Authority officials say, they may be adopted by landlords of other subsidized housing, like Mitchell-Lama developments or buildings for the elderly. And they may be sold at retail for co-op owners.
Mr. Guptah said that the new refrigerators could be developed using existing technology. His group helped organize a consortium of 24 utilities two years ago that paid a $30 million prize to the developer of a 22-cubic-foot "super-efficient" refrigerator.
If all the Housing Authority refrigerators are replaced with power-stingy models, the authority will save $5 million from its annual electric bill, now $79 million. For the first few years the savings will go to pay back the Power Authority for the new refrigerators; after that they will accrue to the Housing Authority, which will undoubtedly find another use for the money.
"The budget cuts are coming sooner or later on the Federal level," said John P. Hamill, a spokesman for the authority. "We don't have to wait till it happens."
Of the high-tech refrigerators, he said: "It's the future. We might as well get with it now."
The refrigerator deal is part of a contract to be signed today that extends an electricity supply agreement between the Power Authority and the Housing Authority until 2004.
The contract, combined with a contract signed by New York City in March, could also help assure the future of the Power Authority. The Authority has seen its costs soar because of Indian Point 3, a nuclear plant it owns in Buchanan, N.Y., that has been shut for 28 months. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said yesterday, though, that it believed the plant was ready to re-open.
Mr. Freeman, who organized a "bounty" program for old refrigerators at the last utility he ran, in Sacramento, Calif., has pledged that the authority will find its niche by being a leader in efficiency, which in electricity goes hand in hand with environmentalism.
The Power Authority estimates that Housing Authority refrigerators typically gobble 900 to 1,200 kilowatt-hours per year. A Federal standard implemented for new refrigerators in 1993 -- a kind of gas mileage rule for a kitchen appliance -- is 625 kilowatt-hours per year. The most economical models now on the market use 500.
But this is only the beginning; the Federal Government is expected to lower the limit in 1998 to 440 kilowatt-hours per year. And the Power Authority wants to go lower than that, 355 kilowatt-hours by 1999.
At 9 cents a kilowatt-hour, that puts the typical saving at $45 a year -- and the refrigerator will probably cost about $310, according to Scott Brown, an engineer with the Power Authority.
In the best case, replacing a 1,200-kilowatt-hour-a-year model with one that uses 355 kilowatt-hours would save about 1.5 barrels of oil at a generating station, and all of the related pollution.
The Authority has set aside $40 million for the program and asked manufacturers to submit plans to build the refrigerators.
When the refrigerator program is under way, the Power Authority plans to start replacing the 50,000 tenant-owned air conditioners with new models that will be owned by the Housing Authority. Those, too, should pay for themselves through increased efficiency, engineers believe. They are also considering replacing all the laundry machines with models that use less water, which would also save energy.
In the deal to be announced today, the Housing Authority will receive a rate freeze through 2001. And beginning in 2002, it will have the right to shop for power supplies on the open market, which will have the effect of putting a cap on what the Power Authority can charge. New York City signed a similar deal in March.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Official Seeks To Close a Major Hospital

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 19

 BODY:
Facing a budget deficit of more than $1 billion, the chief administrative officer of Los Angeles County touched off a storm today by proposing broad cuts that include closing of one of the largest hospitals in the nation, the Los Angeles County-University of California Medical Center.
Saying this may be the last chance to bring the county's spending into line, the administrative officer, Sally R. Reed, warned that profligate spending and short-term fixes had brought Los Angeles face to face with bankruptcy. 
 Her proposals, which will be formally presented to the five-member board of supervisors on Tuesday, also include laying off 10,000 county employees, and closing 30 parks and 12 libraries. The proposals lay out across-the-board reductions of up to 20 percent in most departments, including children's services, the coroner, the district attorney, the sheriff and the courts. If enacted, the cuts would total about $1.2 billion.
"If we act this year, I'm hopeful we will be able to avoid insolvency," Ms. Reed told reporters today in presenting the $11.1 billion budget. "I believe this is our last chance to get our house in order.
"Closing the medical center will save us $310 million," she said, noting that the hospital needs $1 billion in repairs because of last year's earthquake and because of improvements required by updates in the building code. If closing the hospital is not approved by the supervisors, Ms. Reed's proposal offers a "Plan B" that would close four of six smaller hospitals operated by the county.
The board of supervisors is scheduled to open hearings on the budget on July 5.
Zev Yaroslavsky, a county supervisor, who is considered a swing vote on the board, praised Ms. Reed's proposal as "a starting point" but said, "I don't think we're going to close down the biggest hospital in this country." He said, "I don't think it would be approved."
Ms. Reed's proposals drew immediate fire from unions, hospital officials and political analysts.
"These are Draconian cuts -- it astounds me -- because in the end it could create larger problems than it solved," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at the Claremont Graduate School.
Harvey Kern, a spokesman for the 2,000-bed hospital, with 9,000 employees, said it was the largest medical center in the nation, with double the admissions of Parkland Hospital in Dallas, which he said was the second largest. Last year, he said, the hospital admitted 60,000 in-patients and served 855,000 out-patients.
The hospital's closing would leave a vast gap in medical coverage here, he said, particularly for the poor, who make up 40 percent of its patients. Half the hospital's patients are covered by Medicaid, which many private hospitals do not accept. "There are 2.9 million uninsured in Los Angeles County, and we are the flagship of the county system," he said.
The hospital has one of only three burn centers in the county, treats half the county's AIDS patients and delivers 10,000 babies a year, many of them to high-risk mothers, Mr. Kern said.
Unions representing county employees also criticized the cuts. Bart Diener, a spokesman for the Service Employees International Union, said, "We are not convinced that the only solution to the crisis is dismantling the health system." He said that the state needed to help the county more.
But economic analysts agreed with Ms. Reed that the county's problems were urgent and that if the hospital was not closed, other dramatic cuts would have to be made.
They said that Los Angeles's fiscal problems dated back to 1978 when Proposition 13, a statewide ballot measure, severely limited property taxes in California. More recently, the state has reallocated revenue from property taxes to education, putting more pressure on county and local governments to finance their own programs.
In addition, Ms. Reed said, the bankrupty of neighboring Orange County -- even though it had different causes -- had frightened investors and made it more difficult to raise money. Orange County's bankruptcy was caused by the failure of high-risk investments of county funds. "All of a sudden, nobody lends you money any more. As long as they lend to us, we stay solvent," Ms. Reed said.
As a sign of slipping confidence, Moody's Investor Service, the ratings agency, announced today that it had placed the county's long-term ratings under review until the county adopts a final budget.
Of the future, Ms. Reed said: "If all the budget propsals are adopted, Los Angeles County will be an organization of approximately 71,000 employees. This is one county employee for every 133 residents.
Los Angeles County covers a vast region with a population of 9 million, including about 3.5 million in Los Angeles.
State Assemblyman Antonio Villaraigosa, who represents the district with the hospital, said he would fight its closure. "Tough choices have to be made," he said. But he added: "What is an alternative? I don't know right now."

HEADLINE: Name-Calling a Talent In 'Mellow' North Korea

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 19

 BODY:
The latest big news is that "the U.S. imperialist war-maniacs" and the "South Korean puppets" are engaging in military maneuvers and plotting to attack North Korea, again.
The last time this happened was the Korean War, a "criminal war against Korea started by the United States," and America is now "shamelessly" planning a Korean War memorial. This is "a foolish attempt to justify its provocation of the war of aggression and its murder of people." 
 That is the way the news looks when it comes from North Korea. As the United States and its allies prepare to give oil and a $4.5 billion nuclear energy system to North Korea, there is little need to worry about being seduced by North Korean flattery.
North Korea and the United States reached agreement last Tuesday on the kind of nuclear reactors that will be given to North Korea, in exchange for its scrapping of its existing nuclear program. It would be harder to use the new kind of reactor for making weapons.
The tone of the North Korean reporting underscores how instinctively hard-line the country remains even as it seeks to build ties with the United States. The harsh attacks also suggest that while North Korea is a formidable negotiator, it has yet to understand the concept of public relations.
North Korean politics are extremely murky, and since the death of Kim Il Sung last July, his son and apparent successor, Kim Jong Il, has not formally been named to fill the vacant positions of President and Communist Party leader. A possible explanation for the North's harsh language is that leaders who are trying to open the country a little bit feel insecure and thus may want to sound as revolutionary as ever.
North Korea's invective against the United States is mild compared with what it says about South Korea and about South Korea's democratically elected President, Kim Young Sam.
Even though South Korea will pay most of the bill for the reactors and may soon supply rice to the North as well, North Korea is constantly engaging in no-adjectives-barred attacks against it.
"The ever-increasing crimes of American soldiers in South Korea are an inevitable result of the abominable flunkeyist treacherous act of the traitor Kim Young Sam serving the United States as he does his grandfather," the Korean Central News Agency said early this month.
The dispatch added, in an official North Korean translation, that Mr. Kim was "a dyed-in-the-wool pro-American stooge who fattens the U.S. munition monopoly plutes."
The invective does not mean that North Korea is adopting a more hard-line position. Some experts who monitor North Korean news outlets say North Korea may have even moderated its blasts against the United States lately -- without softening its attacks against South Korea.
North Korea, for example, has not lately repeated its comment made last month that "the United States is a hotbed of terrorism and the organizer, conductor and supporter of terrorist activities."
"I think the words they are using about the United States are getting a little nicer," said Chong Bong Uk, managing editor of Vantage Point, a South Korea-based newsletter that writes, unaffectionately, about North Korea.
In one sign of a more pragmatic position, North Korea has asked Japan for emergency supplies of rice, a rare and humiliating acknowledgment of its own food shortage. Japan has said it is willing to give at least 300,000 tons of rice, provided that South Korea does not object.
South Korea says North Korea should first accept an offer of South Korean rice, and talks are under way in Beijing between the two Koreas to try to settle the matter. The talks, the first between the two Koreas in a year, may result in deals to ship South Korean rice and Japanese rice alike to North Korea.
"Their tone has softened a bit about Japan recently," apparently because of the request for rice, said Noriyuki Suzuki, who monitors North Korean broadcasts for Radio Press, a Tokyo institute.
North Korea has been particularly irritated lately by American plans to open a Korean War memorial in Washington next month. The North Korean version of history is that the United States started the war by attacking the North, and that the United States has since used quislings to rule South Korea and block Korean reunification.
Workers' Daily, the leading North Korean newspaper, declared this month that the war monument is "an insult to and mockery of the Korean people."
"The United States is engaged in such a despicable act in a bid to justify its war of aggression on Korea and cover up its true color as the initiator of the Korean War," the article said. "It is also intended to instill the idea of aggression in the U.S. society and incite a fever of war against Korea."
Workers' Daily described the Stars and Stripes as "a symbol of aggression." It added that the monument "fully reveals the invariable aggressive and belligerent nature of the United States."
The North Korean newspapers and radio broadcasts do include other international news, like an account of the "first international seminar on illegality of the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo," in Cuba. Another recent article was headlined "Capitalist World Floundering in Economic Stagnation."

Regional Banking Giants on the Line

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
The decision that has long concerned smaller banks across the country -- whether to merge with a larger bank or remain independent -- is becoming a pressing issue for regional giants as well.
The willingness of the First Fidelity Bancorp of Newark, the nation's 25th-largest banking company, to merge into the 9th-ranked First Union Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., is a sharp strategic departure for First Fidelity, whose recent practice has been to buy smaller banks. But if First Fidelity -- whose chairman, Anthony P. Terracciano, is highly regarded in the banking industry -- now thinks it is too small to compete, then many investors and analysts expect other banking companies will come to a similar conclusion. 
 "A lot of banks lack the management and resources to be effective," said Charles M. Vincent, head of equity investment research at the PNC Bank. "At some point these realities will intrude on management thinking" he said, adding that "I expect there will be a lot of other deals not far behind this one."
Thomas Hanley, banking analyst at CS First Boston, said the Northeastern part of the country could be a focal point of the next merger wave, partly because many bankers rejected merger overtures earlier in the 1990's, when they were recovering from heavy loan losses.
For many banking companies under $20 billion in assets, such as the Midlantic Corporation of Edison, N.J., UJB Financial of Princeton, N.J., or the Meridian Bancorp of Reading, Pa., "the First Fidelity deal means they could probably opt to sell sooner rather than later," Mr. Hanley said.
But for larger banks like PNC of Pittsburgh,the Bank of New York or the Bank of Boston -- all of which have grown through acquisitions and have a history of good performance, at least sometimes -- Mr. Hanley said, "They now have to choose between continuing to buy, or whether to merge."
In yesterday's trading, shares of many banking companies in New Jersey and Pennsylvania moved higher on hopes that they might attract a buyer looking to keep pace with the expansion by First Union. UJB, whose chairman, T. Joseph Semrod, has rebuffed earlier suggestions that the company be sold, rose $1.375, to $29.875,while Midlantic gained $1.625, to $38.25. Meridian Bancorp advanced $1.25, to $33, and Corestates Financial of Philadelphia rose $1.125, to $33.75.
Shares of larger companies were also strong, as the Bank of Boston climbed $1.25, to $36.275, while PNC was up 50 cents, to $27.125.
For bankers electing to merge, there are many possibilities. BankAmerica in San Franciso or Nationsbank in Charlotte, N.C., have ambitions to build national companies to match their grandiose names and both were rumored to be suitors of First Fidelity. Another choice for large regionals would be to merge with a bank of equal size.
Whatever strategies bankers follow, the desired result is a bigger and more efficient company spread over a large enough area that it is less threatened by a regional economic downturn. However, this has not always been the result of mergers, many of which have not produced the savings and revenue gains that were originally projected.
"To remain competitive, a lot of big regionals have got to become larger, to reach the critical mass they need to develop and sell new products," Mr. Hanley of CS First Boston said. "Bill Gates of Microsoft compares banks to dinosaurs, and the investments in new technology that banks must make will be daunting to many companies."
The forces pushing banks into mergers are not confined to the Northeast. Mr. Vincent of the PNC Bank said there were several banking companies in the middle of the country that could attract buyers, including Boatmen's Bancshares and Mark Twain Bancshares in St. Louis. Boatmen's rose 50 cents yesterday, to $34.375, while Mark Twain lost 12.5 cents, to $31.875.
John J. Mason a banking analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane, a securities firm in Charlotte, said there were some banks with stellar records of profitability and growth, like the Wachovia Corporation or Suntrust in Atlanta, whose managers could make a plausible case for staying off the merger bandwagon. But many other well-known regional banking companies, including some of the largest, cannot, he said.
"A lot of banks that are big in their region are going to find that they do not have the size to be competitive in negotiations with suppliers and vendors," Mr. Mason said. "They may have thought they had a few years to wait, but they may find out in coming months that they don't have too many options."
The Barnett Banks, based in Jacksonville, Fla., for example is a large regional bank that Mr. Mason said could become a merger target. Barnett closed yesterday at $49.875, up $1.375.
While there are still many mergers to go before the winners emerge in the national banking sweepstakes, Mr. Mason said the alliances made now were important. "Races are not won by those who start last," he said.

Price Climb Is Resumed By Treasury Securities

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities resumed their climb to higher levels yesterday, as market optimism of a Fed easing increased because of recent remarks by Fed officials.
Even as market participants remain divided over whether the economy is running out of steam or not, they expect an interest rate cut soon, traders said. 
 The 30-year bond rose 22/32 of a percentage point, to 11324/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, was 6.57 percent, down from 6.62 percent on Friday. Shorter-maturity bill rates and intermediate-maturity yields on notes also improved.
While some in the market are leaning toward the July 5 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee as the earliest possible date for a rate cut, the general belief is that the Fed will wait until the August meeting to cut interest rates.
Tomorrow the Fed will release its so-called beige book report, which will include the economic overviews from regional bank members of the Federal Reserve system. Investors will be looking for clues in the report that will give them an indication of the central bank's intentions.
Kevin McClintock, manager of fixed-income portfolios at Aeltus Investment Management, said trading volume yesterday was low, with most of the buying centered on speculation of whether the Fed will ease interest rates in July or August. "While I haven't heard much discussion about how much, I have heard it could be 25 or 50 basis points," he said. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
As a result of the speculation, "we've seen very volitile days," Mr. McClintock said. "There's a lot of money to be made or lost in the market, depending on whether the Fed eases or not. For example, a two-year right now yields 5.64 percent; if the Fed eases, we could easily trade at a price to yield 5.25 percent and if they don't we could go back to 6.25 percent fairly easily."
Right now, he says, the market currently seems to be taking any piece of data that is released, even if it has low information content, and studying it to determine where the economy is and what the Fed is likely to do as a result.
For instance, Mr. McClintock thinks the speech today by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, at the Economic Club of New York might draw more attention than normal, given the uncertainty in the market.
"It's been interesting," Mr. McClintock said, "Early last week a number of Fed governors steered the market into believing that unemployment and recession were the greater risks, and therefore imply a Fed easing was at hand. Then they did a reversal, and in the subsequent days they suggested an easing in July was not required."
Mr. McClintock said he had not adjusted anything in his portfolios and had instead chosen to be neutral since January. "We did not believe the slowdown was going to be severe enough and don't see a precusor for a recession," he said. "There is still wide availability of credit, home fixed-rate mortgages are below 8 percent and considered affordable, and we're starting to see some strength in department store sales. While auto sales are off their peaks, they are not declining rapidly."
Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston, saw a good part of yesterday's strength coming from overnight buying. He said the market had seen alot of flip-flopping on Fed policy, and had been assessing the chances of a change. "The burden of proof is on those who think the economy will rebound," he said. "As a result the market should track to lower yields."
The Treasury's regular weekly auction of new three- and six-month bills went quietly with no surprises, Mr. Alexy said. On average the three-year bill rate was 5.46 percent, down from 5.57 percent last week, and the six-month bill was at 5.42 percent, down from 5.56 percent.
In the municipal bond market, prices rose for the first time in four sessions as some investors found tax-exempt issues, which have lagged behind Treasuries, attractive. The average yield to maturity of the Bond Buyer's index of 40 various issues was 6.21 percent, down a basis point.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:
 
 (000 omitted in dollar figures)

Bills	Average Price	98.620	97.260	Discounted Rate	5.46%	5.42%	Coupon Yield	5.63%	5.67%	High Price	98.625	97.270	Discounted Rate	5.44%	5.40%	Coupon Yield	5.61%	5.64%	Low Price	98.620	97.260	Discounted Rate	5.46%	5.42%	Coupon Yield	5.63%	5.67%	Accepted at low price	80%	24%	Total applied for	$45,738,721	$50,216,720	Accepted	$14,252,087	$14,340,983	Noncompetitive	$1,374,409	$1,219,655

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Wait! Isn't This Backward?;
Roles Reversed in U.S.-Japan Dispute on Airlines

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 19

 BODY:
In the automobile trade dispute with the United States, Japan has said it cannot accept Washington's demands, saying they add up to "managed trade." If American cars and car parts do not sell well in Tokyo, Japan says, it is simply because they are not competitive.
But in another long-running trade dispute that erupted today, Japan is seeking precisely such managed trade. It wants to put a limit on the number of flights made by United States airlines to Japan, and beyond. Washington opposes such limits, saying Japanese airlines are simply not competitive, and has now struck back against Japan's latest moves. 
 Trade disputes are routinely presented by both sides as matters of broad principle. But a closer look at these two disputes shows that national interest is often the central issue. The choice of argument depends on who is winning and who is losing.
And the aviation dispute, overshadowed by the automobile issue, came to a boil today when American officials threatened to impose sanctions on Japan for failing to grant new routes between Japan and other Asian nations to the Federal Express Corporation. Japan's inaction, Washington says, violates a treaty on civil aviation.
But Japan says the 43-year-old treaty, signed when Japan did not even have an international airline industry, unfairly favors American carriers by giving them broad access to the Asian market. Japan says it has been trying to renegotiate the treaty for 20 years but has been rebuffed by the United States.
Now it says it will not award the routes to Federal Express until the treaty is renegotiated. And some Japanese officials are threatening to pull Japan out of the treaty entirely.
Officials from the two countries met last week in Washington to try to resolve the issue, and while Japanese officials saw some progress, Americans were disappointed, and have now threatened to bar Japanese airlines from some profitable American cargo routes.
Judging by the hard-nosed attitudes both sides are taking, the aviation and automotive disputes seem similar, reflecting Japan's increasing willingness to say "no" to the United States.
But when it comes to specifics, the two issues are almost opposites. What the United States argues in autos, Japan argues in aviation, and vice versa.
The United States wants Japanese car makers to adopt voluntary plans for buying American-made auto parts, calling the plans necessary to reverse decades of restrictions and discrimination that have hindered American companies.
Similarly, Japanese officials argue that they are justified in trying to place limits on the operation of American air carriers because of a need to end decades of unfair treatment of Japanese airlines.
The Clinton Administration says that much of the world -- not just the United States -- has had trade problems with Japan. But in aviation, Japan points out that the United States has had disputes with many countries, including Germany, France, Britain, Thailand and Chile.
"If you were to take a sweeping look at the aero-political problems affecting the international civil aviation industry worldwide, you might, after analysis, realize that a common denominator in many of these problems was one country -- the United States of America," Koki Nagata, vice president of corporate planning for Japan Airlines, said in a speech last month at an Asian airline industry conference in Singapore. The title of the speech was "The America Problem."
Japan and the United States also have the same counterarguments. Japan insists that American cars do not sell in Japan because they are too expensive, too big and too prone to breakdowns.
But in aviation, American carriers have lower costs and lower fares, because of the strength of the yen and because deregulation in the American domestic market forced the airlines to slim down.
"The dominant position of U.S. carriers is not a result of so-called imbalances in treaty rights," the American Government stated in a position paper. "U.S. carriers' success is the result of market forces at work." For instance, the paper notes, flying from Tokyo to Hong Kong on United Airlines costs 47,000 yen, or about $550, compared with 58,000 yen on Japan Airlines.
In the background of the dispute is the effort of the United States to win "open skies," the deregulation of international air traffic.
But Japan and many other nations argue that with limitations on airport landing slots, civil aviation can never be a completely free market. Asian airlines worry that the profitability of the lucrative Asian market will be destroyed by price wars and that they will be unable to compete with United States carriers, which can better draw on their huge home market for passengers.
"If we accepted open skies, that would be the death of the Japanese carriers," said Chikara Sugimoto, assistant vice president of international affairs for Japan Airlines.
Japanese carriers are already being pummeled by the strong yen and high costs resulting from years of operating in a highly regulated home market. They now carry 32 percent of the passengers entering or leaving Japan, down from 38.5 percent in 1986, according to Robert Rowland, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo.
Japan Airlines, which once ferried pilots and flight attendants to Narita Airport in Tokyo in chauffeured limousines, has lost money for several years. It is hiring Thai flight attendants and Canadian pilots because the strong yen makes it too expensive to hire Japanese ones. All Nippon Airways, mainly a domestic carrier, returned to profitability in the last fiscal year after losses the year before that.
The specific issue in the current dispute is "beyond rights." In the treaty between the United States and Japan, three American airlines were given virtually unlimited rights to fly not only from the United States to Japan but then beyond Japan to other Asian countries. Japanese airlines have limited rights to fly beyond the United States.
The three carriers that now control these rights -- the United Airlines unit of the UAL Corporation; the Northwest Airlines unit of NWA Inc. and Federal Express -- make 156 passenger and cargo flights beyond Japan each week. About 1.3 million passengers take these flights each year. By contrast, Japan Airlines, Japan's main international carrier, makes just two flights beyond the United States each week -- from Los Angeles to Brazil -- carrying 3,000 passengers a year.
Japan says that when the treaty was signed in 1952 it had just been freed from the postwar American occupation and was not in a good bargaining position. Since most of the passengers then were Americans, Japan had to grant beyond rights in exchange for winning the right to fly to the United States. In addition, since planes could not fly so far in those days, the American carriers needed to stop in Japan on their way to other Asian destinations.
But now, Japan says, most passengers flying between the United States and Japan are Japanese. And American carriers can now reach Asian destinations without the need to stop in Japan.
Japanese officials say the treaty states that its "primary objective" is to govern passenger traffic between the United States and Japan and elsewhere in Asia. They interpret that to mean that a majority of the passengers and cargo continuing beyond Japan should have boarded in the United States.
But that is not always the case. On United's flights from Tokyo to Seoul, South Korea, and to Bangkok, Thailand, for instance, more than 80 percent of the passengers get on in Tokyo, according to Japan's Ministry of Transportation.
In effect, Japan says, the American airlines are building a lucrative business connecting Japan and the booming Asian economies, a market that rightfully should belong to Japan and Asian carriers. Mr. Rowland, the analyst, said that United and Northwest get as much as a third of their profits from routes that go through Japan.
Japan says it does not want to take away existing beyond rights but does want to control the spread of new routes beyond Japan in the future. Japan also wants to even out what it says is an imbalance on flights between the United States and Japan, perhaps by controlling capacity growth. American carriers make far more flights between the countries than Japanese carriers do, and the Japanese airlines now have only about 30 percent of the passengers.
Now, Federal Express is applying to fly from Tokyo and from the new Kansai International Airport near Osaka to its new hub in Subic Bay, the Philippines, and also to many other points in Asia.
Japanese officials say Federal Express has been seeking 11 new routes. "That's too much; we can't put up with it," said Ryosei Akazawa, deputy director of the international air transport division at the Ministry of Transportation. More recently, the United States seemed willing to accept seven new routes, Japanese officials said.
The United States contends that the routes Federal Express is requesting mainly involve its shift of flights to Subic Bay instead of Manila. Washington has said it will not renegotiate the treaty until Federal Express's rights are honored.
Washington also argues that in the early 1980's, Japanese carriers had more than half the passengers on flights between the United States and Japan, a sign, the United States says, that the treaty is not to blame for Japan's low market share now.
American officials have indicated that they would be willing to consider granting new rights to Japanese carriers. But they say there is little that Japan really wants.
Mr. Sugimoto of Japan Airlines acknowledged that his company does not really want more flights to the United States right now because it loses money on the ones it now has. Japan Airlines would like to be able to fly to Mexico City from Los Angeles, he said, but other than that flying from Japan to the United States and then beyond does not make much business sense.
Because the United States is such a huge country, what Japanese airlines really want are rights within the United States -- the ability, for instance, to fly from Japan to San Francisco, discharge and pick up passengers, and fly on to Denver. American carriers are able to funnel passengers from American cities to a hub and load up planes bound for Japan. Japanese carriers cannot do that in the United States.
But the United States is not likely to open its domestic market since no nation allows foreign airlines to make such domestic flights.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Edges Lower as Traders See U.S. Interest Rates Dropping

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar edged lower against most leading currencies yesterday in thin trading, reflecting a lack of economic news and fear that United States interest rates could fall if the economy slows further.
"Today's trading followed the pattern of a lot of Mondays recently when there's no data out," said Margaret Kudaraskas, senior foreign exchange analyst at Technical Data, a Boston financial market research concern. "They are pretty directionless."
The dollar initially strengthened against the yen in Tokyo on media reports of a possible compromise that could resolve the automotive trade dispute between Japan and the United states. But the dollar weakened later when the United States said there was no compromise. 
 United States sanctions that will double the price of Japanese luxury cars take effect June 28 if negotiators in Geneva do not reach a deal.
"The market is playing a wait and see about what's coming out of the trade talks," Ms. Kudaraskas said.
The dollar was weaker despite strong rallies in the bond and stock markets in New York. Strength in American stocks and bonds tends to support the dollar by increasing demand for the currency among foreign investors.
But yesterday's rallies stemmed partly from expectations that interest rates in the United States are headed lower, and lower rates hurt the dollar by making bank deposits denominated in the currency less attractive.
In late New York trading yesteday, the dollar fell to 1.3970 German marks from 1.4002 marks on Friday. The dollar fell to 84.63 Japanese yen from 84.76 yen.
Against the mark the dollar stayed within a narrow range, reflecting trader fear of central bank intervention if the dollar, drops too far, said Jeffrey Yu, a senior dealer at the New York branch of the Sanwa Bank.
Marc Chandler, a senior analyst at the Deutsche Bank Securities Corporation, said the dollar got some support from comments by the Belgian Finance Minister, Philippe Maystadt, who said European Union finance ministers believed the goal of a common currency was unreachable by the 1997 target date.
Mr. Chandler said this helped raise demand for French francs, which hurt the mark and indirectly helped to underpin the dollar.
But the dollar was weakened, Ms. Kudaraskas said, by disappointment that the Group of Seven communique issued from Halifax, Nova Scotia, did nothing to bolster the dollar.

HEADLINE: In the Field With the Price Indexers

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del.

 BODY:
Her thick blue binder in hand, Diane Balaguer strides purposefully through the department store in the Concord Mall north of town. She checks the price of a women's pullover (short sleeve, solid color, no design) eyes a Hastings & Smith polo shirt, notes the seasonal absence of men's turtlenecks and then confronts the day's first challenge to statistical perfection.
Ms. Balaguer shakes her head slightly as she regards a rack of Towne raincoats, a style in the London Fog line (tagged at the same $99.90 as the month before). She considers Towne to be of slightly, almost imperceptibly, lesser quality than the Severn line (costing about twice as much) that they replaced this year. It's a matter of things like stitching and buttons. 
 Earlier this spring she had informed specialists in Washington of this not uncommon situation but they overruled her suggestion that she substitute another product. Thus do tiny imprecisions creep unavoidably into the Consumer Price Index, the most widely used inflation measure, one directly affecting the incomes of more than 70 million Americans, Federal income-tax brackets and the cost of school lunches.
"It's not a black-and-white sort of determination," Ms. Balaguer said. "Even though we ask very specific questions to try to get very specific answers, it takes a great deal of judgment."
When the price index is announced monthly by the Labor Department, the figure has the Olympian air common to Government statistics. But a day spent with Ms. Balaguer gives a vivid illustration of the messiness inherent in the immense task of monitoring changes in a $7 trillion economy. In any given month, she and several hundred counterparts around the country check the cost of 90,000 items -- ranging from catfish fillets to time spent in a hospital recovery room.
The Consumer Price Index has come under attack of late by critics who say it is inaccurate, though not because of the work of the pricing agents, pursued in Ms. Balaguer's case with an evident sophistication and zeal for detail.
Some, including Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, contend that the price index overstates inflation by as much as 1.5 percentage points. That results, among other things, in overly generous Social Security payments and other Federal benefits. Others, including its compilers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, acknowledge an overstatement, but a much smaller one. A minority of analysts insist the index errs by understating inflation, especially for the elderly.
Congressional Republicans eager to trim Federal spending and mindful of Mr. Greenspan's criticisms, have incorporated a modest adjustment into their budget calculations that if approved would slow the growth of Federal benefits and slightly increase taxes.
The debate among policy makers, however, seems remote from the workaday world of Ms. Balaguer and her staff of seven permanent part-timers, who each month collect prices in a geographic arc ranging from Princeton, N.J., to Elkton, Md., including Philadelphia.
A trained economist who both supervises data collection and often goes on the road herself, Ms. Balaguer expresses no opinion about the debate over the price index.
The system takes account of the possibility of human error or subversion -- cross-checks of other data collectors' work is standard procedure. "We're taking our best shot," said Patrick C. Jackman, the index's chief day-to-day overseer in Washington. "I don't think we're picking up many bad quotes."
Drawing on an annual Government survey of what people are buying, and at what kinds of outlets, headquarters tells the field staff what items to price. The findings are shipped by courier to Washington, where they are run through the mill to be sure they make sense. Because the bureau promises its respondents confidentiality, it insists that none of the 10 outlets Ms. Balaguer visits be identified by name. But she did disclose not only how prices in May compared with April's, but also explained in detail how to handle such vexations as discontinued products, clearance sales and what to do in those rare cases when she suspects somebody of giving wrong prices.
One of the day's most complicated readings came at a garden shop just across the state line in Pennsylvania where, after finding 3 1/2-inch barrel cactus and 16-inch Boston ferns unchanged in price (at $4 and $25, respectively) Ms. Balaguer found that the requisite flower seeds, black-eyed susans, were no longer being stocked.
After being told this was not just a temporary situation, Ms. Balaguer's solution was to find a substitute seed in the same product line to enter into the system on the spot. With the aid of a table in her binder that produces random numbers and with some rapid-fire pointing at rows of seed packets, the answer emerged in less than a minute. From now on, she declared, "we'll use pampas grass" in the index.
Not every hurdle was so quickly overcome. She spent a sizable chunk of her 20-minute session with a hospital administrator to figure out how to adjust for a confusing reconfiguration of recovery-room charges that effectively halved the price.
"You have to be able to ask questions, to be a sort of Sherlock Holmes," Ms. Balaguer said.
Ms. Balaguer's stop at a beer distributor to check one-liter bottles of Canada Dry seltzer caused some embarrassment when she questioned the assertion of Richard Gropper, a proprietor, that the price was 84 cents. After she observed that this would mean a 9-cent rise from April he realized his mistake, adding that he was glad to help with the index since he periodically used it to adjust the rent of tenants in the doughnut shop next door.
The hardest items to price, Ms. Balaguer said, are electricity and natural gas, information the bureau gets directly from utilities in statistically awkward form. Children's meals and meals in Chinese restaurants also pose problems, even with menus to work from, because they tend to include beverages for which separate prices are required, Ms. Balaguer said.
Housing, which accounts for 41 percent of the urban consumer index, is surveyed by periodically questioning homeowners and renters. For both groups, the question is the same: What is the monthly rental value of the property? When necessary, such as when a house is vacant, she and her staff ask real estate brokers and neighbors to get housing data, Ms. Balaguer said.
Some surveyers might be bothered by one potentially onerous job restriction. But not Ms. Balaguer.
"We never carry purses because we're not allowed to shop while we work," she said. "Actually," she added, noting that she had originally worked in retailing, "I hate to shop."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Prices of Grain and Soybeans Get Lift From the Hot Weather

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Grain and soybean futures prices rocketed to new highs on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday as hot, dry weather settled in over Midwestern growing regions and increased the chances of a disastrous fall harvest.
Temperatures have soared well above average, into the 90's, for the last nine days, and meteorologists said yesterday that there was little relief in sight. The newly planted crops are desperately in need of rain; one reason is that above-normal rainfall this spring left seedlings with shallow roots incapable of finding water much below the surface, Joel Karlin, an analyst at Kemper Securities Inc. in Chicago, said. 
 "Even though we're not at critical growing points, a continuation of this weather will certainly stress the plants and cause some yield reductions," he said.
On other commodity markets, energy futures prices sank and silver futures soared. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities rose 1.39 points, to 236.54, testing the yearly high of 237.96 set on Jan. 20.
Wheat for July delivery rose 12 1/2 cents, to $3.93 a bushel, the highest price for the contract closest to delivery since Jan. 6, when it closed at $3.94 1/2 a bushel; July corn rose 6 1/2 cents, to $2.83 3/4 a bushel, its highest price since a March 30, 1994, close at $2.84; July oats rose 6 1/4 cents, to $1.47 1/4 a bushel; July soybeans soared 18 cents, to $6.07 a bushel, the highest price since a July 18, 1994, close at $6.18.
The National Weather Service said after the close of trading that Midwestern weather would be hot, with below-normal precipitation over the next 6 to 10 days.
Crude oil futures led energy prices lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange, reflecting talk that OPEC is considering suspending export quotas.
Venezuela's oil minister, Erwin Jose Arrieta, was elected president yesterday at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' summer meeting in Vienna. He said the group should not rule out suspending quotas because it would send a message to non-OPEC countries, particularly Norway and Mexico, to stop increasing their output. The current OPEC quota is 24.52 million barrels a day.
July crude fell 62 cents, to $18.22 a barrel, a three-month low. July home heating oil fell 1.29 cents, to 47 cents a gallon; July unleaded gasoline fell 1.22 cents, to 60.28 cents a gallon; July natural gas fell 8 cents, to $1.62 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold futures prices rose to two-month highs, and silver futures prices also soared on the Commodity Exchange of New York on speculation that the Federal Reserve planned to lower interest rates soon to jump-start a slowing economy.
August gold rose $1.50, to $394.20 a troy ounce, its highest price since April 20. July silver rose 8.5 cents, to $5.50 a troy ounce; July platinum rose $2.80, to $443.80 a troy ounce.

Orange County's woes are boon to municipal bond insurer.

BYLINE: By Leslie Wayne 

 BODY:
IF bad news can make for good business at some companies, the financial crisis in Orange County, Calif., is a red-letter event for MBIA Inc., the nation's largest municipal bond insurer. MBIA makes money by selling insurance protection for municipal bonds that could go bad, and its stock has been climbing since Orange County's problems began.
The Orange County situation is helping MBIA in two important ways. For one, the bankruptcy of the wealthy county, once considered one of the nation's sterling credits, is expected to increase investor demand for insured municipal bonds in general. Moreover, MBIA picked up a big-ticket premium of $10 million, or four times the going rate, for insuring the $295 million of "recovery" bonds that the county issued last week. 
 The Orange County deal came after much soul searching within MBIA and after two weeks of on-again, off-again negotiations with the county. Then, just after the dust settled from that high-profile offering, MBIA announced that it would insure $329 million in bonds issued by the Denver Airport, whose credit rating hovers around the junk level. The Denver offering puts an additional $10 million in premiums in MBIA's pocket and represents an aggressive departure for the company, which does not typically insure credits as troubled as Orange County or the Denver Airport.
These two moves have put a spotlight on a company whose stock has risen by about 20 percent since the Orange County bankruptcy filing in December, to close yesterday at $67.75, unchanged for the day on the Big Board. Despite the steep climb, analysts feel that the stock has even more upward potential and predict MBIA will trade in the low $80's within a year.
"This is a top-flight company, and the Orange County deal was just opportunistic," said Joan S. Solotar, a Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette analyst. "Investors have seen huge run-ups in the stocks of other financial services companies and they are only beginning to look at MBIA."
MBIA's fate is tied to the volume of municipal bond offerings. That volume has been falling lately, but analysts expect offerings to pick up again. MBIA has been able to offset the volume decline by increasing its market share, largely because it has more capital with which to snare deals than its two biggest rivals: the Ambac Indemnity Corporation and the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, part of the GE Capital unit of General Electric.
In the first quarter, the volume of municipal bonds issued fell 45 percent, but MBIA's premium volume declined only 16 percent. And analysts praise the company's efforts to offset the fluctations in bond volume by diversifying into such areas as managing municipal assets and insuring asset-backed securities.
"If you look at MBIA over the next five years," said Michael A. Smith, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, "you are looking at a company with a strong likelihood of earnings that will exceed the broad market. The municipal bond business won't disappear, and Orange County has only heightened investor concern about municipal bonds and will increase demand for insured bonds."
In 1994, MBIA earned $6 a share. Most analysts expect that to rise to a range of $6.45 to $6.50 this year and $7.35 to $7.50 in 1996. Another reason that analysts feel its stock could rise is that the company's price-earnings multiple is about 10, compared with the estimated market multiple of 14 for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
The Orange County deal was unusual because MBIA rarely touches bonds from issuers that lack an investment-grade rating. MBIA typically insures bonds with single-A ratings; once a municipality gets MBIA insurance, the bonds receive MBIA's credit rating, which is triple-A. This generally lowers the municipality's borrowing costs, even after paying MBIA's premium.
Carol Manning, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said the Orange County deal presented little risk to MBIA because the recovery bonds had a strong repayment source -- motor vehicle fees -- in spite of the county's financial problems. "The risk is more controlled than it would appear on the surface," Ms. Manning said.
Still, Neil Budnick, an MBIA senior vice president, said the decision to back Orange County "was not a slam-dunk; we spent months of negotiations with the county."
Mr. Budnick, however, said the risks were warranted: "We're not taking a more aggressive stance. The opportunity presented itself to structure a deal the way we liked, and we took advantage of it."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Arianna, Go Home!

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington, if that's how you feel, go home! Love us or leave us!
And take some other immigrants with you -- the kind that, like you, talk about how America should be worried about allowing more immigrants in. For instance, that British-born fellow, I forget his name, who is running around promoting his book about how he fears that in America his little son, the one he tells us has blue eyes and blond hair, will have to grow up among too many dark folk. 
 Arianna, for somebody like me, an immigrant himself, and still remembering what I was taught in civics classes about how America was built by people from all over the world, it is hard to be mean to another American just because she or he is an immigrant too. But that is exactly why I'm picking on you.
I danced at your wedding to a young man from an oil family. Ever since, I have watched with great interest what you were doing in America -- how you helped make him almost senator from California, how some people believe that one day he will run again and this time you will make sure there would be no almosts, how you moved from writing books about art to books about the inner self, I believe, how you are now very close to Newt himself, and how you would get a big job if a Republican is elected President next year.
I did not agree with everything you were saying. But that did not diminish my admiration for your get-up-and-go. And I kept thinking: Only in America -- only in America could a girl born in Greece, an immigrant first to Britain, then to the U.S., a double immigrant you might say, become a nationally known political and literary figure a relatively few years after getting her visa. What a terrific example of the importance of immigration and immigrants.
Now here you are helping the anti-immigrant line. You heard me -- anti-immigrant. The people who promote that line professionally and whose side you take on TV never say they are anti-immigrant, of course not. They just say America should not let any more into the country for 10 or 20 years or at least cut way back -- a third, a half, whatever.
But you are not a political naive. Eliminating or drastically reducing immigration will not just deprive the U.S. of talented people by the millions, and hurt the economy by eliminating the jobs they create. It will also help anti-black, anti-brown, anti-yellow and general anti-foreign nastiness, of which we have good and plenty already.
And please listen to this: If opposition to immigration grows, some day being a former Greek will not be a political asset at all. After all, Greece is in Southern Europe, not what you might call Nordic or Anglo.
Surely you understand you would never have been able to enter America as an immigrant if some of your friends had their way about immigration before you got off the plane. So what are you saying? Pull up the gangplank, Jack, I'm aboard? That is not very good for a healthy inner spirit.
There may be other Greek-Americans who say after me lock the doors, but I have not met any. Greeks not only brought endeavor and brains to this country but they brought kinsmen who did the same.
Talk to Nicholas Gage, who wrote that classic book "Eleni," about hunting for the Greek Communist killers of his mother. His father brought him to America -- and about 100 others from their village. Among them, over the last three decades, they have created about 5,000 jobs.
Arianna, must you pick as your role models the narrowest-minded conservatives? Why not listen to Jack Kemp, Bill Bennett, Rudy Giuliani, Dick Armey, the House majority leader, and other conservatives who understand the importance of immigrants to America?
Now I have cooled down a bit. So, if you talk and listen to people like that I will rescind my expulsion order against you.
Just a few words, no more needed, about that British-born immigrant -- Peter Brimelow is his name, I remember now. His book is much too farbissen, my mother's Yiddish word for embittered, to be of value. Save time and money by reading instead Ira Glasser's seven-paragraph letter in The Times of June 16 about his racism -- a masterpiece of intellectual demolition.
That British immigrant really must go home. Mercy extends just so far.

Baseball Network Faces a Full Count

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
What's going on with The Baseball Network?
Not much, regarding its future. The joint venture of Major League Baseball, ABC and NBC to air network games and sell advertising will not reach the $330 million in 1994-95 revenues needed to merit an automatic two-year renewal. 
 In 1993, the interim commissioner, Bud Selig, called TBN baseball's "destiny." Must be a non-manifest one; it doesn't even know if it will exist past 1995.
Baseball's owners barely touched upon TBN's future at recent meetings, except for some confusing, circuitous discussions. If TBN is baseball's destiny, why haven't owners given it a one-year extension, making 1996 the de facto second year of the deal and wiping out 1994's disaster?
"Nothing is served by talking about this," said Ken Schanzer, TBN's president. Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports, said, "No comment."
"Silence should not be interpreted as inaction," Selig said.
But there are too many closed mouths. Is this all just another example of baseball's penchant for being out of control or are NBC and ABC quietly seeking legal assurance that they will keep getting baseball for nothing through 1996?
"I haven't heard that," said Eddie Einhorn, the co-owner of the White Sox, who helped push the TBN concept. "But I have to be closed-mouthed."
Bill Giles, the owner of the Philadelphia Phillies and a member of baseball's television committee, said a one-year extension has been discussed, but not acted upon. "We won't do anything until after Aug. 15," he said.
Aug. 15 is the first day of an exclusive 45-day period when one partner can ditch the other two and end the deal, or work out a new contract.
But why keep dawdling when so much about baseball is uncertain? Baseball will not resolve its labor and economic woes by the end of the 45-day period. A TBN extension is not directly contingent upon a labor deal, Selig says.
Meanwhile, NBC and ABC have strong economic motives to keep TBN. They may also want to keep baseball away from the ravenous Fox.
But it may not be in baseball's interest to renew TBN. Baseball needs money, and may have had enough of having to sell its own advertising. Owners who went along with the deal in 1993 because they trusted the TV committee may not want to be sheep again. They may want a traditional, up-front deal and may be looking for ways to talk to Fox and/or CBS without breaching the TBN contract.
 
Open Minded
 For all his insight and foresight, NBC's Johnny Miller needs to channel the emotion that chokes him up when he thinks about his 1973 United States Open victory into more personality. When excitement is needed, he is too contained. He needn't slobber, but he needs to show a verve that exceeds describing a clump of fescue grass. When Miller said that Corey Pavin's second shot on the 18th hole was "the shot of a lifetime," he sounded as jazzed up as if he were buying a box of tees.
Other thoughts:
*Pavin's 18th-hole shot was a beaut, but did not require that NBC focus on it, Pavin's reaction to it, and replays for 4 minutes 27 seconds. That segment required that Tom Lehman's and Greg Norman's important 16th-hole putts be shown on tape.
*Where was the blunt-spoken Miller when you needed him to say "choke" when Norman blew yet another chance to win a major tournament? And why didn't anyone have the guts to ask Norman about his aborted launch of the World Tour?
*Six hours is too long a telecast if the leaders don't tee off until 2 P.M. From 12:30 to 1:30 on Sunday, NBC aired little more action than a few Payne Stewart shots.
*Dan Hicks, who interviewed the victorious Pavin, needs question therapy. Of Pavin, he asked: "Do you have a sense of what your name will be placed in in history on this trophy?" How do you answer that probing inquiry?
*To NBC's credit: plenty of tee shots, terrific overhead views of shots in flight, snappy computer graphics of undulating greens and timely updates.
 
SportsChannel: 1 Error
 The once-unwatchable SportsChannel has a new logo, a better signal, a determination to be carried on lower-priced cable tiers, a responsive new management and a desire to take production risks. Great.
Yet it must decide what to do with its Mets' team. Fran Healy and Rusty Staub comprise an enervating, game-slowing duo who do not bring out Ralph Kiner's best. Perhaps the network will see some light when WFAN's Howie Rose fills in for Kiner on July 28, during Hall of Fame induction weekend. Or maybe they have noticed the authoritative nuttiness that Gary Thorne adds to Channel 9 when he fills in for Kiner beside Tim McCarver. Said McCarver, "The Mets haven't played many fun games, but we're having fun."
 
Bargain Devils
 SportsChannel pays the Islanders $12 million a year, but pays the Devils $4.2 million. SportsChannel will pay the Devils a $1 million bonus to win the Stanley Cup. . . . Game 1 of the Devils-Red Wings series Saturday earned a 4.0 overnight Nielsen rating for Fox. Among male octopuses 18-34, it posted a 6.8.
 
Sights and Sounds
 MSG's Jim Kaat stung the Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner, on WFAN yesterday for signing Darryl Strawberry. "It's a lesson: listen to your baseball people," he said. "Now it's back to the Bronx Zoo again." . . . Odd sightings: HBO's and NBC's Jim Lampley hosting a sunglasses infomercial and Tom Roy, NBC's top golf producer, endorsing Titleist in a print ad.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
In Prose and in Verse, Stark Paeans to Hopper

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI 

 BODY:

EDWARD HOPPER AND THE AMERICAN IMAGINATION
Edited by Deborah Lyons, Adam D. Weinberg and Julie Grau
Illustrated. 252 pages. Whitney Museum of American Art in association with W. W. Norton. $39.95
 The paintings are instantly, viscerally recognizable, not only because they've been reproduced so many times, but also because their style -- their angle of looking at the world -- has been assimilated, appropriated or echoed by so many other American artists. 
 To see Edward Hopper's brooding "House by the Railroad" is to be reminded of the infamous Bates mansion in the Hitchcock thriller "Psycho." To see Hopper's lonely diners in "Automat" or "Chop Suey" is to remember the lost, desperate souls in the fiction of Hammett, Chandler and Cain. To see the silent, post-coital couples in "Summer in the City" and "Excursion into Philosophy" is to think of the worn, dislocated people in Raymond Carver's laconic stories.
 The idea, then, of assembling a volume of stories and poems by writers inspired or influenced by Hopper (or simply simpatico with his vision) is a splendid one, intended to coincide with the Hopper show of the same name that opens this week at the Whitney Museum.
As it turns out, "Edward Hopper and the American Imagination" is a highly arbitrary literary collection. Why, one wonders, is there no contribution from Mr. Carver, perhaps the most quintessentially Hopperesque writer to come along in recent years, and instead only a glancing reference to him in a poem by his wife, Tess Gallagher? Why no stories from such Hopper contemporaries as Hemingway and Sherwood Anderson, whose portraits of small-town life might be read as literary analogues of the world Hopper so often depicted? Why no essay by Alfred Kazin, who has written so movingly about the painter's vision of New York City? Why no entries from younger writers like Stuart Dybek, whose short story "Nighthawks" explicitly refers to that famous Hopper canvas, even as it recreates the painting's mood of lyrical desolation?
If the reader accepts the volume for what it is, however, it does afford numerous pleasures. A kind of tribute to Hopper in pictures and words, the book illuminates the influence he has exerted on a broad spectrum of writers and poets, and in doing so, it underscores the qualities of his own work that have endured.
As the art historian Gail Levin points out in an essay in this volume, Hopper's work had strong affinities with Emerson and the transcendentalist tradition. Yet there was also a darker strain of anxiety in his paintings, a brooding disquiet that hinted at the unfulfilled promises of the American Dream, all set down with a new economy of language, the same language that would be employed by writers from Hemingway to Carver, language so spare, so compressed that it often seemed more like a philosophy than a style.
Many of Hopper's paintings are devoid of people, as though something troubling had just happened or was about to occur -- early-morning streets and out-of-the-way roads, the city in summer, the beach in fall. Others focus on those haunted places that people pass through on the way to someplace else: hotel lobbies, railroad stations, gas stations and motel rooms, places, as the poet Ann Lauterbauch writes, where you find "everything in transit," and "the temporal ignites." No doubt this is why his paintings possess such a strong narrative quality: we feel we have stumbled into a story in medias res and caught its inhabitants unawares. It is also why these paintings lend themselves so well to fictional improvisation.
In "Cape Cod Evening," for instance, Ann Beattie imagines the story behind the painting of the same name, speculating that the man and woman were Hopper's neighbors, the woman standing there in the new dress she'd just made, unable to put memories of her failed marriage out of mind, while her taciturn brother looks on, grousing about the stupidity of posing for a picture. In Walter Mosley's "Crimson Shadow," a cheap reproduction of a Hopper painting -- "South Carolina Morning" -- simply hangs on a wall, a silent reminder to the story's hero of all that he has lost since he went to jail.
Other stories in this volume do not directly concern Edward Hopper or his work; rather they feature characters reminiscent of those found in his paintings: isolated, solitary people, framed for us by the geometry of their surroundings, looking out a window or down a road, waiting for something to happen or remembering something that did.
There is Francis Phelan, the guilt-ridden bum from William Kennedy's novel "Ironweed," who believed "he would never attain the balance that allowed so many other men to live peaceful, nonviolent, nonfugitive lives," a relative of sorts of Norman Mailer's penniless drifter in "The Greatest Thing in the World" (1940), who stretches out on a flophouse bed and thinks of "women, and hamburgers, and billiard balls, and ketchup bottles, and shoes and, most of all, of the thrill of breaking a $5 bill."
But Hopper's people are not outsiders simply by class or by circumstance (think of the glamorous theatergoers in "Two on the Aisle," or the perfectly coiffed usherette in "New York Movie"); their sense of dislocation often comes from a more private place. Perhaps that is why we are able to see James Salter's wealthy, middle-aged heroine in "Dusk," who has been left by her husband and her lover, as spiritual kin to Paul Auster's young vagrant in an excerpt from the novel "Moon Palace," who has given up his old life to pursue a meager, solitary existence in the "manmade natural world" of Central Park.
Mr. Auster also describes that park as a world of "nature enhanced," a phrase that perfectly conjures up the world of Hopper's paintings, paintings that elevate the ordinary to the eternal while glossing the real with the surreal, paintings capable of turning light (the stark, puritanical light of New England at noon, the sullen, sensuous light of Manhattan at dusk) into a kind of emotional weather, paintings that articulated Hopper's own idiosyncratic vision of America and helped shape how successive generations of artists would see the world.

HEADLINE: Prized Lab Shifts to More Mundane Tasks

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE 

 BODY:
ON Jan. 10, Dr. Robert W. Wilson, a co-winner of the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics and a former astronomy wizard at AT&T Bell Laboratories, observed his 59th birthday at the South Pole, where he and other exiles from Bell Labs were using a radiotelescope to probe the structure of interstellar gas clouds.
His colleagues at the celebration, for which the South Pole Station cook had used a high-altitude recipe to bake a cake, included Dr. Antony A. Stark, who, like Dr. Wilson, now works for the Smithsonian Astrophysical Laboratory in Cambridge, Mass., and Dr. John Bally of the University of Colorado. All three had been caught in the squeeze created by the laboratory's termination of many of its basic research programs. 
 Dr. Wilson, who elected to take early retirement, Dr. Stark, Dr. Bally and another former Bell scientist working at the South Pole, Dr. Mark Dragovan of the University of Chicago, have all found new opportunities in astrophysical research. By conducting spectroscopic analyses of the microwave radiation emitted by interstellar gas, they are tracking the birth and evolution of stars in some of the Milky Way's stellar nurseries -- information vital to detailed understanding of the galaxy.
But many other scientists released by Bell Labs have had a harder time finding suitable work in the current climate of depressed financial support for basic scientific research.
While scientists see the recent developments at Bell Labs as a metaphor for a general decline in the commitment of American industry to basic scientific research, they also regret what they regard as the crumbling of a giant research establishment, a cluster of laboratories that changed the world with its inventions and discoveries.
By contrast, Dr. Arno A. Penzias, vice president of research at Bell Labs, and other senior Bell executives, regard the changes as vital to the scientific needs of the company and to advances in technology that contribute to the overall progress of science.
Bell Laboratories, formed by the telephone company in 1925, garnered seven Nobel Prizes in its glory days, from 1937 to 1978. (The name was changed to AT&T Bell Laboratories when the telephone company monopoly ended on Jan. 1, 1984.)
Three of the Nobel laureates, John Bardeen, Walter H. Brattain and William B. Shockley, were honored for their invention of the transistor, a device that has revolutionized technology and global society.
In other programs, Bell Labs played important roles in the development of lasers, fiber optics, solar cells, light-emitting diodes, communication satellites, cellular mobile radios, negative feedback principles for controlling processes, code systems for the National Security Agency, control systems for antiballistic missiles and much more. The company says it has been awarded more than 25,000 patents, an average of one a day over its 70-year life.
Bell Labs' achievements were not merely practical. They included one of the greatest scientific discoveries of all time, for which the 1978 Nobel Prize went to two physicists at Bell Labs, Dr. Wilson and Dr. Penzias.
Seeking to identify the source of radio noise that was interfering with microwave radio communications, the two scientists accidentally discovered the faint microwave echo of the Big Bang, the explosive birth of the universe some 15 billion years ago. That historic discovery drastically changed the course of astrophysical research and convinced most astronomers that the Big Bang theory -- and not competing theories -- correctly described the origin of the universe.
Paradoxically, Dr. Penzias, now a senior official of the company rather than a full-time research scientist, has had to preside over the termination of many Bell research programs in fundamental science, including most of the company's research in astrophysics.
Since "divestiture," as the 1984 breakup of the Bell Telephone System is called, the scientific staff of the laboratory has declined by only 10 percent, and the number of staff members with Ph.D. degrees has increased, Dr. Penzias said in an interview. Bell Labs, with an annual investment of $3.5 billion in research and development, now employs 25,000 people in eight states and 21 foreign countries, some 4,000 with doctoral degrees. Roughly 1,500 employees are engaged in "core research," the category that has been chiefly responsible for major achievements in fundamental science.
Still, the glory days of all of America's leading industrial research laboratories, including Bell Labs, seem to be fading. As support for fundamental science in the United States declines, so does the use of its scientists. A study published last week by the RAND Corporation and Stanford University's Institute for Higher Education Research concluded that American universities were now producing some 25 percent more doctorates in science and engineering than the United States economy could absorb.
Dr. Penzias acknowledged that the emphasis at Bell Labs was now on the development of commercially valuable devices and systems, not the pursuit of scientific knowledge per se.
"It's true that the changes have been made to benefit the shareholders and customers, not basic science," Dr. Penzias said, "but that's as it should be, because the world has changed. Science has already won many of its goals, and a lot of today's basic research goes far beyond any commercially interesting objectives.
"Take high-temperature superconductivity," Dr. Penzias continued. "A lot of people talk about developing high-temperature superconductors for magnetically levitating and propelling trains. But when you stop to think about it, the big transportation problems have nothing to do with train wheels and bearings. They have to do with funding, with the acquisition of rights of way for new tracks, and a host of practical issues that don't involve science or technology."
Critics say the commercial profitability criteria Bell Labs now applies to its research will hurt not only "pure" science but will ultimately undercut progress in technological applications. Prospects for basic research at Bell Labs' first cousin, Bell Communications Research Company (Bellcore), seem even more uncertain, because Bellcore has been put up for sale.
When the Bell System was broken up in 1984 to settle a longstanding antitrust suit by the Justice Department, the system's former parent organization, AT&T, retained Bell Labs as its research arm. Soon afterward, seven of the regional telephone companies (or "Baby Bells") split off by the divestiture pooled their resources to create an independent laboratory, Bellcore, which was to conduct applied research and computer software development for their joint benefit.
"I suggested that a separate, smaller research organization was needed for research in systems and software," Dr. Penzias said, "so in 1984 we created Bellcore, giving the new organization 200 or 300 of our own Bell Labs people to help them start up. Initially, Bellcore recruited its 500-member core research staff in our building, as a division of our organization."
One of the scientists who moved from Bell Labs to Bellcore was Dr. Fan Chung, a mathematician who specializes in combinatorics, a field whose practitioners analyze probabilities and calculate the number of ways an event can happen. Dr. Chung headed Bellcore's research in mathematics and information theory. Among her group's tasks was to analyze an epidemic of dangerous telephone failures that swept American cities in June and July of 1991. They found them to have been caused by an error in a computer code written by one of AT&T's subcontractors.
Last year, suspecting that basic research at Bellcore had a bleak future, Dr. Chung left the company to take a teaching post at the University of Pennsylvania. About half of her 20-member Bellcore research staff also left the company.
"Bellcore was really quite wonderful in its early years," she said in an interview. "In a very short time it gained status as a major research institution. It is terribly sad, what's happened to it."
The great advantage industrial research organizations like AT&T Bell Labs and Bellcore have over university departments, she said, is their interdisciplinary character.
"At Bellcore I was in constant touch with chemists, physicists, computer scientists and other experts," she said, "and because the doors between us were always open, we shared each others' perspectives and helped to solve each others' problems. We could think about broad solutions. University departments are more insulated, and it is harder to cross the boundaries between disciplines."
The seven regional telephone companies that own Bellcore decided in April to put the company up for sale, and the future of its research program, which now accounts for less than 10 percent of Bellcore's $1.2 billion budget, will be settled only when and if a buyer is found.
In an article published on June 2 in the journal Science, Bellcore's research director, Dr. Robert Lucky, was quoted as saying: "My whole career was based on research. But we were swept up with the times; basic research is not affordable in this environment." Subsequently, Bellcore's director of public relations, Barbara S. McClurken, said the company's scientists, including Dr. Lucky, had been barred from further comments because of "the currently delicate legal situation."
In a statement approved by Bellcore's management, she said: "If Bellcore's current owners were to sell their interests in Bellcore, we have every expectation that our applied research organization would continue to play a critical role in helping us meet the business and technical objectives of our customers."
At Bell Labs, some fundamental research even in such unworldly fields as astrophysics has survived, because some research techniques are recognized as directly beneficial to practical applications. An example is the work of Dr. J. Anthony Tyson, an astrophysicist who specializes in plotting the distribution of galaxies throughout the depths of space, information that sheds light on the birth and evolution of the universe. Dr. Tyson is permitted by Bell Labs to continue his investigation because it has applications to commercially important problems.
"Tyson's work involves the detection of statistical distortions in the distribution of galaxies," Dr. Penzias said, "and to pursue this field requires sophisticated techniques in pattern recognition and data storage -- things that we care about."
Pattern recognition technology has become important to Bell Labs in many fields, including the rapid scanning of millions of lines of coded computer instructions for errors, obsolete or contradictory instructions, fraud and "viruses" -- destructive instructions inserted by saboteur hackers.
"The change in research priorities," Dr. Penzias said, "is not a nice message for fundamental science. But the opportunities in applied science are greater than ever. Until I got this job as a research director, I had only three patents to my name, but in the last four years I've been awarded eight more. We all have to change to meet the changing needs of our companies and of society."

HEADLINE: U.N. Expert Raises Estimates Of Iraq's Biological Arsenal

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 20

 BODY:
The senior United Nations official monitoring the program for destroying weapons in Iraq told the Security Council today that Baghdad's clandestine biological warfare program is larger than previously assumed and that part of it remains unaccounted for.
Rolf Ekeus, the chairman of the special commission, reported in April that before Iraq was defeated in the Persian Gulf war in 1991, it had acquired 39 tons of a substance called complex growth media, which is required to cultivate germs for biological weapons. The United Nations inspectors could account for only 22 tons, he said, which left a significant discrepancy of 17 tons. 
 But today, Mr. Ekeus said that the earlier estimate of the amount of growth media acquired by Iraq was too low, and that Baghdad had acquired additional components needed to make biological weapons.
"The numbers have increased since we reported in April," Mr. Ekeus said at a briefing this afternoon. He declined to give specific figures, but said the new information is "rich in detail."
Mr. Ekeus said the evidence also showed that Iraq has encountered a "bottleneck" in trying to build a weapon sophisticated enough to deliver deadly germs.
There is no evidence that Iraq tried to acquire more material after its defeat at the hands of the United States and its allies, Mr. Ekeus said. What is missing was acquired before the war, he said, and its whereabouts remain unknown, except by the Iraqis.
Iraq's cooperation in destroying its weapons of mass destruction is a condition for lifting sanctions imposed by the United Nations in 1990 after Iraqi forces occupied Kuwait. The removal of sanctions would let Iraq resume selling oil, its major earner of hard currency, on the world market.
Mr. Ekeus said his commission was generally satisfied with the dismantling of Iraq's ballistic missiles and chemical weapons. "We have confidence that Iraq does not have any significant proscribed capability" with those systems, he said.
Mr. Ekeus said that when he visited Baghdad from May 29 to June 1 the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz, proposed a deal under which the United Nations would close its files on those programs in return for more details about Baghdad's biological weapons program.
But members of the Security Council reacted angrily to the proposal.
"They're trying to do deals all the time," Britain's representative, Sir David Hannay, said of the Iraqis after the meeting. "But we're not buying carpets, we're talking about compliance with Security Council resolutions, and I'm afraid that conditions of that sort will not be acceptable to the Council."
Until now, France and Russia had inclined toward lifting the oil embargo that is the principal economic weapon against Iraq, which has the world's second-largest oil reserves and had been the No. 5 oil exporter before the war.
Madeleine K. Albright, the United States representative, expressed similar outrage. "The Iraqis are acting as if they are in a position to bargain, as if they were in a bazaar, about what they will comply with and not comply with," she said.
Mrs. Albright said Mr. Ekeus reported "that there is more than the 17 tons missing, that he cannot even tell us at this moment how much, and also that there has been some imports of various kinds of equipment, which concerns us a great deal."
Speaking for the United States, she continued, "from our perspective, things have gotten worse rather than better in the biological weapons area."
The new report said that Iraq's failure to account for the missing items led to the earlier conclusion "that there is a a high risk that Iraq purchased them and at least in part used them for proscribed purposes -- the production of agents for biological weapons."

Road to Jordan Cut, Rebels Say

DAMASCUS, Syria, June 20 (Reuter) -- The Iraqi opposition in exile said today that rebels had mounted heavy machine guns on pickup trucks and set up roadblocks on the highway between Baghdad and the western Iraqi town of Ramadi.
In Baghdad, the Government's security apparatus has detained dozens of army officers suspected of disloyalty, said a statement from rebel group, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq. It is a Shiite Muslim group which has its headquarters in Teheran.
It said the rebels, who are from Ramadi, were using the pickups to try to clear forces loyal to President Saddam Hussein off the highway, which is the main road to Jordan.
There was no independent confirmation of the report, the latest of many about unrest near Ramadi, on the Euphrates 60 miles west of Baghdad.

HEADLINE: Builders Start Fewer Homes In a New Sign of Weakness

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
Lower mortgage rates failed to revive the housing market during May, the Commerce Department said today, as builders broke ground on fewer homes and apartments in a fresh sign of economic weakness.
The annual rate of starts on homes and apartments fell 1.3 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.24 million units, in contrast to a revised gain of 1.4 percent in April. 
 Housing starts fell in four of the year's first five months, even though 30-year mortgage rates are more than 1.5 percentage points lower than at the beginning of 1995, when they were more than 9 percent.
Analysts said the most troubling part of May's report was the slump, to a two-year low, in construction of single-family homes. They said the decline indicated that consumers were not confident about taking on long-term financial commitments.
Construction starts on apartments and multiple-unit buildings rose 10.8 percent in May, to a rate of 288,000 units. But starts on single-family homes, viewed as a better measure of consumer sentiment, fell 4.4 percent, to 951,000 units -- the lowest rate since 939,000 units in March 1993.
"That's very disturbing," said David Lereah of the Mortgage Bankers Association. "It underlines that the housing sector is in trouble when you have a 170-basis-point fall in rates and still there is no sign that housing construction is coming back any time soon."
A fall of 170 basis points is equal to 1.7 percentage points. That is the amount by which fixed mortgage rates have fallen in the last six months.
David Seiders, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders, said a large supply of finished but unsold homes was causing builders to be cautious about new projects.
"Inventories of houses, just as in manufacturing, are high but they are not grossly excessive," Mr. Seiders said. He said there were signs of rising consumer interest in June surveys that showed more traffic at model-home sites.
Mr. Seiders predicted that housing starts would be at least 10 percent lower this year than 1994's 1.46 million units. He added, though, that "it's by no means a housing disaster."
The Federal Reserve meets July 5 and 6 to consider whether to change short-term interest rates. It has held rates steady for more than four months after increasing them seven times over a year.
Bob Davis, an economist with America's Community Bankers, said he did not expect rates to be cut in July. He also said the housing market was starting to stabilize.
 In testimony this morning to the Senate Banking Committee, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, indicated no alarm over the decline in housing starts, which he said was within expectations.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
New Speculation on a Rate Cut Creates Weak Day for the Dollar

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar slumped against the German mark and other currencies yesterday after new signs of weakness in the United States economy increased speculation that the Federal Reserve would soon cut interest rates.
Trading was light in advance of a speech last night by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan. Currency dealers awaited Mr. Greenspan's comments for clues to whether the Fed would reduce short-term interest rates. 
 But in Asian trading early today, the dollar was little changed after Mr. Greenspan told an audience in New York last night that he was reluctant to cut rates despite the increased risk of a mild recession.
"We can't judge by his comments" whether the Fed will soon cut rates, said Masahiro Yamaguchi, assistant manager for foreign exchange at Tokai Bank in Tokyo. At midday there, the dollar traded at 84.33 yen, down slightly from 84.45 in New York late yesterday.
The dollar fell in New York after the Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell 1.3 percent in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.24 million units. It was the fourth decline in the last five months.
"The weakness of the economy is definitely an overhang for the dollar," said Hillel Waxman, currency trading manager at Bank Leumi Trust Company in New York.
The dollar was also weighed down by comments from the president of the German central bank, Hans Tietmeyer. Mr. Tietmeyer said he "cannot yet be satisfied" with progress made toward price stability, suggesting that the Germans would not soon reduce their rates. Big wage increases still pose inflation risks, he added.
Steve Flanagan, currency trader at Credit Agricole in New York, said, "Tietmeyer's comments dampened any rate cut hopes in the short term." Lower German rates, or higher American ones, help the dollar by making dollar-denominated investments more attractive.
The American currency fell as low as 1.3870 marks yesterday, the lowest level since May 31, when coordinated dollar-buying by the Federal Reserve and a dozen other central banks buoyed its exchange value. The dollar settled at 1.3907 marks, down from 1.3970 on Monday.
As currency traders in New York awaited Mr. Greenspan's speech yesterday, speculation mounted that the Fed could reduce rates as soon as July 5-6, when its policy group, the Federal Open Market Committee, next meets.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Report of Slowdown in Housing Sends Lumber Prices Plunging

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Lumber prices plunged yesterday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as a report showing fewer housing starts in May pointed to weaker demand for building materials.
On other markets, copper rose while crude oil fell. The Commodity Research Bureau index gained 0.12 point, to 236.66. 
 Housing starts dropped by 1.3 percent last month, the Commerce Department reported, to an annual rate of 1.239 million, the slowest pace in more than two years. The decline surprised analysts, who thought falling mortgage rates would have encouraged builders to begin new projects.
"This housing market is in bad shape," said Gary Leeper, general sales manager at Timber Products Inc., a lumber mill in Springfield, Ore. July lumber fell $8.80, to $218 for 1,000 board feet on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
The number of built but unoccupied homes rose to the highest in five years, the Commerce Department said, raising the prospect that housing starts would suffer until the existing stock of unsold homes was depleted.
Copper prices rose to a five-month high after an unexpected drop in London Metal Exchange inventories showed strong global demand.
The exchange said that its copper stockpiles plunged by 17,675 metric tons, or 8.6 percent, to 186,325 metric tons since its last report on Friday. Copper for July delivery rose 0.7 cent, to $1.402 a pound, on the Commodity Exchange in New York, its highest price since Jan. 25. Copper prices have surged 13 percent in the last month.
Crude oil fell as rising production in Nigeria, the North Sea and possibly from OPEC members later in the year eased concern that inventories are low at the start of the summer driving season, when gasoline demand rises.
The expiring July crude contract fell 21 cents, to $18.01 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a three-month low. The active August contract slipped 6 cents, to $17.97 a barrel. July unleaded gasoline rose 0.56 cent, to 60.84 cents a gallon, while July heating oil rose 0.14 cent, to 47.14 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: Disney Announces Plans For a Wildlife Theme Park

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, June 20

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company today announced plans to build its largest theme park yet, one that would combine rides with real wildlife for what the company's chairman, Michael D. Eisner, called "an entirely new experience for our guests."
The Wild Animal Kingdom is to open in the spring of 1998 as the fourth theme park at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. Five times the size of the Magic Kingdom, it would take up 500 acres of Disney-owned property in Orange County near Orlando and devote nearly a fourth of it to creating a habitat for more than 1,000 animals, some of them endangered. 
 Mr. Eisner would not disclose the cost of the project at a news conference today, but analysts who follow the company estimated an investment of $600 million to $800 million. Company officials said they expected to employ 4,000 people in the construction and open the park with a staff of 3,000.
Disney today also announced other new projects at the Walt Disney World complex, including expanded shopping and dining areas and a new convention hotel. The activity reflects a positive economic outlook for the company after reduced or flat attendance in the last few years at Disney parks, analysts said.
Mr. Eisner said today that Walt Disney World was having "a banner year."
The aborted plans to build a historical theme park in Virginia are seen as another incentive for Disney to proceed now with the animal adventure park. While the Virginia project met with opposition from historians and environmentalists, Wild Animal Kingdom was developed with the assistance of an advisory panel of animal experts who have embraced it as an opportunity to excite the public about wildlife.
"We're all concerned that we've got to broaden the audience and the level of caring," said William Conway, president of the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York and one of the unpaid consultants on the panel. "It worries me that people are more worried about the trials and tribulations of Mickey and Minnie than the trials and tribulations of wildlife."
Disney officials, who visited zoos and other parks around the world before coming up with their design, said the park would be divided in three major sections -- the real, the mythical and the extinct -- to offer visitors encounters with live giraffes and make-believe unicorns, journeys like an African safari and a Jurassic Park-type trip to the dinosaur era.
"Anyone who's seriously concerned about preserving the wild places of the world is going to be very impressed," Joseph Rohde, the park's creative director, said.
Most of the animals would come from zoos, said Rick Barongi, general manager of animal operations. A minority would be refugees from endangered habitats, he said. The park plans to emphasize wildlife protection through research and a "conservation station" that would help visitors connect with wildlife organizations in their communities worldwide, officials said.
Mr. Barongi said the park would open with more than 1,000 birds and mammals but would also offer reptiles, fish and insects.
"Kids love bugs," he said.
Although mostly welcomed, Disney's latest venture was criticized by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which noted that the company's record with animals was not unblemished. Jennifer Allen, a spokeswoman for the group at its Maryland office, said that in a 1989 incident Disney was accused of mistreating several vultures that landed at its Discovery Island zoo at the Walt Disney World complex.
Bill Warren, a Disney spokesman, confirmed that some of the vultures died while being captured by zoo employees "acting clearly against the philosophy of this company." He said there were dismissals and a change in the zoo's top management.
Ms. Allen, calling the new park "a glorified zoo," said conservation should be taught through interactive computers and other methods, not by holding animals in captivity. "They can say all they want, but this park is to make money," she said.
But Mr. Conway pointed to a Congress bent on revising -- and, he said, weakening -- the Endangered Species Act as evidence that there was a dire need to spark the public's interest in wildlife.
"We're at a time when population is growing so rapidly that the only wildlife we'll be able to save is the one we care about," he said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Yankees, Phone Home!;
GTE Role in Venezuela Is Warning on Privatization

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela

 BODY:
In the three years since Venezuela's creaky state telephone company was privatized, the new American managers have increased the number of lines by 50 percent, doubled international circuits and quadrupled the number of working pay phones.
So, Venezuelans have been heaping praise and honor on the country's largest single foreign investment, right? 
 Not exactly. In the same three years, Bruce E. Haddad, president of a consortium led by the GTE Corporation of the United States that runs Venezuela's Cantv phone company, has been arrested once, called to testify before congressional committees 23 times and has faced marches by union workers chanting "Gringos out of Cantv." Last year, Government bureaucrats suddenly refused to allow his company to buy dollars, forcing it to default on millions of dollars in overseas loans.
Through it all, Mr. Haddad -- who is also president of Cantv -- has remained upbeat. "You have to take a long-term view, you have to expect ups and downs," said the 41-year-old Florida native and longtime executive of GTE's telephone company in the Dominican Republic.
Venezuela has one of Latin America's rockiest economic environments, but GTE's experience here serves as a warning to American business about the hazards of operating in a region that is starting to open politically sensitive public utilities to foreign investment.
From Mexico to Brazil to Argentina, Latin American countries are seeking foreign investors to run former government monopolies like power generation and telecommunications. As American companies take up the task, they are sometimes encountering echoes of the nationalist passions that led to widespread seizures of foreign-owned utilities in the 1960's and 1970's.
And with Venezuela's economy heading for the worst performance in Latin America for the second year running, Yankee capitalists have become a convenient scapegoat for a left-wing Government that is widely blamed for economic mismanagement.
At the very least, as GTE has discovered, running a public utility with 2.3 million subscribers can be vastly more complicated, and certainly more politically sensitive, than building cars or selling soap.
Venworld, the GTE-led consortium, paid $1.9 billion for a 35-year-controlling concession of Venezuela's telephone company in 1991. The president at the time, Carlos Andres Perez, was a free-market advocate who welcomed the foreign involvement.
Since then, Venezuela has gone through two coup attempts, four changes of government and seven communications ministers. Rafael Caldera, Venezuela's current president, often follows policies at odds with those of Mr. Perez, his lifelong political rival.
"There are still people in Congress debating whether Cantv should have been privatized to begin with," said Joseph A. Mann, editor of Political Impact, a newsletter here. "The Government should go out of its way to help Cantv. But I think that Caldera firmly believes that the company should be in the hands of the Government."
Last year, without a political godfather, Cantv repeatedly became embroiled in conflicts with Mr. Caldera's new administration. After the Government imposed exchange controls one year ago, the company found itself far down a long list of businesses seeking to buy dollars.
"While 98 percent of our revenues were in local currency, 95 percent of our debt payments were dollar-denominated," Mr. Haddad recalled.
With leftists initially controlling the Government currency board, which must approve foreign-exchange transactions, the American-controlled telephone company was promptly cut off from access to dollars.
"I granted two hours of my time to listen to the petition of the president and vice president of the company," Ivan Pulido Mora, then board coordinator, petulantly told reporters last August in response to questions about Cantv's foreign-exchange requests.
Although telecommunications has been a rare growth sector of Venezuela's troubled economy, the foreign-exchange problem took almost a year to resolve. In May, the company renegotiated its debt to 40 foreign banks, winning a Government guarantee of near-automatic access to dollars to service the debt.
The disruptions -- and Venezuela's general economic slump -- caused Cantv to slash its capital investment plan by 40 percent, to $408 million this year. Even with this reduction, Cantv investments will total $2.4 billion for the first four years of private operation, 10 times the $239 million invested during the last three years of public ownership. In addition to GTE, Cantv's controlling consortium of private investors includes AT&T, Telefonica de Espana, Banco Mercantil and Electricidad de Caracas.
Relations with the Government took another nasty turn last August when Cantv briefly cut off 80 percent of Government ministry telephone lines for nonpayment of Government telephone bills totaling $100 million. Since then, the unpaid debt has stopped growing, partly because officials allowed Cantv to install pay phones in Government buildings for public employees to make personal calls, cutting down on the monthly bills.
"We now have people in Government that we can deal with," Mr. Haddad said, noting that the Government now routinely approves requests for dollars and for rate increases based on inflation. "This is not some financial play -- this is a long-term commitment."
In addition to sometimes hostile politicians, the American managers have had to cope with a xenophobic labor unions. From the outset, union leaders opposed privatization, to the extent of trying to disrupt the ceremony granting the foreign investors the telephone concession in 1991. Led by the Radical Cause Party, the unions have also tried to block GTE's merit-based management system, preferring the political criteria that prevailed in the old state-company days.
"The Cantv multinationals raise rates and oppress workers," read one union poster showing a malevolent Uncle Sam figure pointing a pistol at passersby.
Despite the union problems, Cantv managed to negotiate a favorable deal. Two weeks ago, after seven months of negotiations, the company signed a new general contract giving it greater flexibility in setting hours and shifts and in defining the duties of the company's 12,000 unionized employees.
Last week, Venworld announced that Gustavo Roosen, a Venezuelan businessman with close links to the Caldera administration, would become Cantv's chairman. At the end of June, Mr. Haddad is to move to Irving, Tex., to work as international vice president for GTE Telephone Operations, the GTE subsidiary that oversees the Venezuela operation. He will continue as president of Cantv.
While Venezuela's Government and unions often have treated the American company managers roughly, Venezuela's public is increasingly pleased with the service they provide. With the average wait for a dial tone down to three seconds, customer satisfaction has hit about 80 percent, up from around 30 percent before privatization, Cantv surveys show.
Beyond political issues, Cantv's management has had to cope with Venezuela's roller-coaster economy.
After booming in the early 1990's, Venezuela recorded South America's worst economic performance in 1994. In a repeat this year, Venezuela is expected to record the continent's highest inflation -- about 70 percent -- and its only shrinking economy, a contraction of roughly 2 percent.
In last year's economic chaos, half of the banking sector collapsed. This year, the cash-short Government has fallen into arrears on its foreign debt payments and is expected to take over three failing insurance companies.
At Cantv, though, it is a different story: Its results are expected to swing back into the black from a 1994 loss of $220 million.
"We firmly believe that the long- term prospects for Cantv are excellent," a recent Salomon Brothers report read. "Venezuela's current economic problems will not last forever."
With oil revenues expected to be 20 percent lower than last year, the Government's budget deficit is heading toward 10 percent of the country's gross domestic product. And with foreign interest fading, the nation's privatization program has virtually stopped.
Although the Government planned to raise $1.5 billion this year by selling most of its remaining shares in Cantv, sales have been indefinitely suspended because of lack of investor interest. Although large mining companies are scheduled for sale, some foreign investors say they are staying away, citing Venezuela's exchange and price controls and the Government's rough treatment of Cantv.
"I just don't understand it," one American mining executive here said, shaking his head. "The Government should have given Cantv special treatment as an example for other companies interested in privatizations."

HEADLINE: Trump Tries to Convert 50's Style Into 90's Gold;
Makeover Starts on Columbus Circle Hotel

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
It is not reliably recorded that Midas ever touched a building. But Donald J. Trump, the developer, has made a successful grab for an aging glass skyscraper on Columbus Circle, and today construction officially begins on his plan to turn the walls of the old Gulf and Western Building into gold. Gold-tinted glass, anyhow.
Mr. Trump's well-publicized financial difficulties may have tarnished the lustrous image he enjoyed a decade ago, but his new project seems designed to prove that esthetically at least, he has not lost the tycoon's touch. 
 A 1950's International Style glass skyscraper in a 1980's gold lame party dress: that's one way to describe the look of the Trump International Hotel and Tower, Mr. Trump's latest Manhattan real estate venture. Designed by Philip Johnson and Costas Kondylis, the 45-story building tries to inject the developer's trademark flash with a dose of upscale architectural quality. The result is an undeniable improvement over the dull dark box that has loomed over this privileged location for the last 25 years.
But Mr. Trump's towering, brassy display is likely to raise howls of derision from those who were hoping that the glitzy 1980's had died of shame. And the building, which is due for completion in 1997, may well infuriate those who believe that Columbus Circle deserves the uniform design treatment of a classic civic place.
Like the Grand Hyatt Hotel, the project with which Mr. Trump made his Manhattan debut, the new tower clads an old building with a new skin. The Gulf and Western Building's walls of dark glass and light concrete ribbing will be stripped away. In what the developers describe as "a tribute to the tradition of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe," the pioneering modern architect with whom Mr. Johnson collaborated on the landmark Seagram Building on Park Avenue, the new skin will feature spandrels and columns covered with bright golden-bronze glass. In addition, the steel structure of the building, notorious for swaying in not-so-high winds, will be reinforced with a new concrete core.
Financed by the General Electric Pension Fund, and developed by Mr. Trump in association with General Electric and the Galbreath Company, the $250 million project will piggyback a luxury apartment building atop a hotel in one high-rise structure. The 167-unit hotel, with one- and two-bedroom condominium suites intended mainly for corporate owners, will occupy the lower 17 floors. The 28 remaining floors will have 166 luxury condominium apartments. Separate entrances and lobbies will open onto Central Park West beneath a gilded canopy.
A ground-floor restaurant will use a wedge-shaped terrace facing Columbus Circle. A small public park, landscaped by Thomas Balsley, will flank the western side of the building. The design's period look, and its "international" theme, will be accented by a small replica of the Unisphere, the stainless steel symbol of the 1964-65 New York World's Fair. Or perhaps the monument, which will grace the entrance to the 59th Street subway station, is intended for travelers to Queens.
This is not a major work by Mr. Johnson. Still, he has introduced considerable refinement to an essentially crass idea. In fact, the design's chief merit is the contrast between the commercial vulgarity of the gold skin and the relative subtlety with which it is detailed.
By eliminating the crown at the top of the Gulf and Western Building, and the tall colonnade at its base, the design gives the tower a more dynamic vertical thrust. The projecting V-shaped columns will enliven the shaft with their rhythmic proportions and the light reflected from their beveled sides. Stainless steel trim at the tips of the columns will give the gold color the impression of greater depth, diminishing the likelihood that the building will look like one gigantic, upended ingot. The relationships in scale between spandrels, columns and window mullions are clearly the work of an architect with a fine eye for proportion.
If Mr. Trump is not building a masterpiece, he has least acquired an interesting footnote in architectural history. For Philip Johnson is the architect who helped coin the term "International Style" and was for many years its chief American advocate. The Seagram Building, including the Four Seasons Restaurant on its ground floor, may well be the style's supreme work. Later, Mr. Johnson boasted that he had "put the nail" in the style's coffin with his design for the Chippendale-topped AT& T headquarters (now Sony Plaza) on Madison Avenue.
Those who revere the Seagram Building may be forgiven for feeling that Mr. Johnson's new design hits another nail, if a golden one, into that coffin. The enduring beauty of the Seagram Building is tribute enough to Mies van der Rohe, and to Mr. Johnson's own contribution to a classic skyscraper style.
In any case, Mr. Johnson's new design should not be seen as a true indication of his current architectural interests. Rather, the design makes an esthetic virtue out of a commercial necessity. By retaining the Gulf and Western Building's height and footprint, the design enabled the developers to avoid the challenge of public review.
But what is most vexing about the design is precisely the symbolic stridency with which its golden skin proclaims the triumph of private enterprise in such a publicly conspicuous place. Columbus Circle is one of the city's choicest sites. It has long aspired in vain to attain a true civic dimension. Efforts to develop the Coliseum site have raised enormous public outcry, and even lawsuits. Now a new Trump flagship sails into these troubled civic waters, carrying with it more than the faint air of a floating casino, or perhaps the winnings from one.
Mr. Trump has played by the rules, and then some. With monsters like the Gulf and Western Building and the Coliseum hulking around Columbus Circle, no one can honestly look at this new design and say, whoops, there goes the neighborhood. It's even reasonable to applaud this venture as a vote of confidence in the renewed vitality of a city trying to lift itself out of an economic slump. But Mr. Trump's golden slab should also be yet another reminder that the health of the public sector is what we ought to be worried about.

HEADLINE: Stocks Mixed, With Dow Slipping 3.12 and Nasdaq Index Up

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The financial markets, with the exception of the hard-charging Nasdaq exchange, were on cruise control yesterday before last night's speech by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, that might give clues to whether the central bank will cut short-term interest rates soon.
Stocks were mixed, bonds were little changed and the dollar was steady in overseas and New York trading. Unusually heavy trading volume -- some 384.3 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange -- indicated some confusion among traders, however. 
 Analysts said that the financial markets might be caught between a rock and a hard place because of Mr. Greenspan's speech. If he does not imply that the Fed will cut interest rates, traders may bid down stock and bond prices. If he does imply the Fed will cut rates, traders have already priced stocks and bonds to take much of the move into account.
Somewhat separate from stocks and bonds is the still weak but relatively stable dollar. A cut in interest rates, or even talk of it, is sure to stampede many currency traders away from the dollar and toward the Japanese yen and the German mark. But it is not clear whether a steady interest-rate policy would lead to a steady dollar. The currency has been hurt by long-term problems like the United States-Japan trade deficit.
After falling nearly 19 points, the Dow Jones industrial average closed yesterday at 4,550.56, down 3.12 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 fell 0.24 point, to 544.98.
By contrast, the Nasdaq composite index, rich with technology stocks, rose for the seventh session in a row. The index added 7.74 points to close at 929.83, another record.
Long-term interest rates held steady in the bond market. Bond prices inched downward and the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.58 percent from 6.57 percent.
The dollar has been stable for nearly three weeks, above 84 yen and around 1.4 marks. Yesterday, the dollar fell to 84.45 Japanese yen from 84.63 yen and to 1.3907 marks from 1.3970 marks.
Still, with the major stock indexes posting records almost weekly all year, "we had all the ingredients for a pullback" in stocks, said Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis for A. G. Edwards & Sons. "It's what didn't happen today that's significant. Typically, you'd see more profit taking, but we got very little downward pressure today."
Of the top 10 stocks in the Nasdaq index, all were high-technology companies, led by Intel, the semiconductor maker, which rose 3 1/4, to 65. The most active stock, at 17.6 million shares, was Intel.
At this point, many technology stocks do not need external news events to prompt institutional and individual investors to buy them. And those portfolio managers who do not own these stocks may buy them for what is known as end-of-the-quarter "window dressing" to impress clients. Moreover, many Silicon Valley executives are in New York for the Bear, Stearns technology conference and for PC Expo, a major computer trade show.
Hardware and software companies have been posting impressive gains. The American Stock Exchange computer technology index of 26 leading computer companies, including Intel and I.B.M., has risen nearly 44 percent so far this year and rose 2.47 percent yesterday. By contrast, the Dow industrials are up 18.68 percent so far this year and down 0.07 percent yesterday.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.42 point, to 291.76, with advancing stocks lagging declining stocks by 1,063 to 1,230. The American Stock Exchange composite index rose fell 1.13 points, to 495.08.
Among advancing stocks was Bolt Beranek and Newman, a computer networking company, which rose 9 1/8, to 27 5/8, after AT&T picked Bolt Beranek as an Internet access provider for business. Micron Technology, a semiconductor company, rose 4 3/4, to 57 3/4.
Among declining stocks was Transmedia Network, a provider of discount dining cards, which fell 2 7/8, to 8 1/8, after management said third-quarter and full-year results would be below Wall Street expectations. Esmor Correctional Services, which operated the detention center in Elizabeth, N.J., where illegal immigrants rioted over the weekend, fell sharply for a second straight day. Esmor fell 2 3/4, to 14 3/4.

Tokyo Plans Retaliation on Air Sanctions

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 20

 BODY:
Reacting angrily to Washington's threat of sanctions on Japanese airlines, the Japanese Government has begun planning to retaliate by blocking some flights from the United States.
Japan is contemplating prohibiting certain cargo flights of Federal Express and Northwest Airlines that originate in the United States from continuing beyond Japan to other Asian nations, Japanese officials and aviation industry executives said today. 
 "Japan will inevitably be forced to impose appropriate countermeasures if the U.S. actually imposes sanctions," Shizuka Kamei, the Minister of Transportation, said in a statement. He called it regrettable that Washington had announced possible sanctions even though his Government had been trying to resolve the issue by negotiations.
Another ministry official said the announcement of retaliatory measures could be made as early as Wednesday.
Such steps would be taken in response to the announcement in Washington on Monday that the United States had started actions to bar certain Japanese cargo flights to the United States in retaliation for Tokyo's refusal to let Federal Express strengthen its operations between Japan and other Asian nations, using facilities at Subic Bay in the Philippines. Tokyo says a three-decade-old agreement governing aviation between it and the United States is unfair and should be renegotiated.
Japanese officials said they still hoped to resolve the matter through diplomacy, as the American sanctions do not take effect until the second half of next month at the earliest. If Japan imposed sanctions of its own, however, the tensions could increase.
There was also some concern that the aviation dispute could disrupt efforts to arrive at a compromise in the two nations' pointed dispute over automotive trade.
Officially, the United States and Japan both say that the aviation and auto issues are separate. But it seemed clear that in announcing the proposed aviation sanctions three days before last-ditch auto negotiations were to begin, Washington was sending a message of toughness to Tokyo.
That message might well cause the Japanese to stiffen their position, at a time it seemed there had been some movement toward compromise in the auto talks. "This is not going to help," a United States official involved in those negotiations said.
The special session on cars and car parts is to take place in Geneva on Thursday and Friday. If there is no agreement to open Japanese markets by June 28, 100 percent tariffs on the import of 13 Japanese luxury cars into the United States will take effect.
The Japanese have held off from imposing automotive countersanctions against American imports because it would be awkward for them to take such a step while arguing at the World Trade Organization that Washington's sanctions violated international trade rules. Aviation issues, however, are governed by separate agreements outside the new trade forum.
Both disputes are potentially complicated by the attitude of Mr. Kamei, who as Transportation Minister would be involved in a settlement of the aviation dispute as well as the auto dispute.
In April Mr. Kamei, a right-winger, said the United States was "enslaving" the Japanese people by keeping the dollar weak against the yen. It is thought that he might want to be seen standing up to the United States as a way of increasing his popularity, just as the Minister of International Trade and Industry, Ryutaro Hashimoto, is said to have furthered his political ambitions by maintaining a strong stance on automotive trade.
Tokyo's response to the threatened aviation sanctions came amid dismay from some Japanese officials, who had hoped for further negotiations. Officials said Foreign Minister Yohei Kono had requested more talks when he met with the American Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, last week in Halifax, Nova Scotia, at the economic summit meeting.
Mr. Christopher turned down Japan's request, officials here say. But the Japanese were still under the impression that negotiations were possible.
The United States said it was punishing the Japanese in the area of aviation because they had refused to grant Federal Express new routes beyond Japan to other Asian destinations, particularly to the new cargo-distribution hub it has built at Subic Bay, the former American naval base. Under a 1952 aviation agreement with Japan, approval of those routes should be automatic, the Americans say.
Japan has argued that the 1952 accord, signed under the occupation and before it had its own international airlines, is biased in favor of American carriers and that in any case, the United States is violating it. It has said it will talk about the Federal Express routes in the context of a broad renegotiation of the agreement.
Washington's threatened sanctions would bar Japan Airlines and Nippon Cargo Airlines from carrying to the United States some cargo picked up elsewhere in Asia and routed through Japan. Washington said it would consider barring such cargo from as many as five areas -- Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.
Toyoichiro Nakata, president of Nippon Cargo Airlines, said at a news conference today that the United States had "gone too far" in proposing sanctions. He said the sanctions would deal a "severe blow" to the company, since about 10 percent of its total cargo consisted of goods that originated in Asia and were headed toward the United States.

Treasury Securities Prices Flat in Subdued Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were flat yesterday in subdued trading, as investors and dealers waited for more evidence of a slowing economy and for signals from the Fed.
Traders said light selling pressures hit nearly all maturities ahead of a scheduled speech by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, to the Economic Club of New York last night. 
 "The bond market has sailed through some fairly choppy waters recently, and there are those that wanted to position themselves defensively, electing to take profits ahead of what may be a volatile session overseas," said Eric Hamilton, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston. Few people were willing to make any sizable commitments, in case the speech gave any clues as to the Fed's intentions ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting next month.
The 30-year bond fell 7/32 , to a price of 11317/32 for a yield of 6.58 percent, up from 6.57 percent on Tuesday.
Treasury secretary Robert E. Rubin told the Senate Banking Committee yesterday that all signs were that inflation was under control for the foreseeable future.
Mr. Greenspan, who also testifed in Washington before coming to New York, told the committee that he was monitoring the economy and that there was no single economic indicator that was "all revealing." Analysts said his comments yesterday gave no clue as to what direction he might be leaning.
The Commerce Department reported on May housing starts yesterday. As expected, they fell 1.3 percent, to 1.239 million units. Building permits gained two-tenths of 1 percent, to 1.245 million, and single-family home starts fell to 951,000, the lowest since March 1993.
The housing report yesterday was overshadowed by Mr. Greenspan's scheduled speech. The Mitsubishi chain store sales index was unchanged on a week-over-week basis, and up to 7 percent year-to-year, with sales characterized as mixed and roughly on plain. "Sales have been mediocore but steady in the past few months," said James Hale, fixed-income analyst with MMS International in San Francisco, "suggesting consumption growth rather than the recessionary conditions some are declaring."
Mr. Hale said, "The report is timely and covers a key variable regarding the future of economic growth and how consumption is fairing, and it is for that reason, it and the Johnson Redbook are likely to be watched more closely than in the past."
Thomas E. Donne, vice president and a senior vice portfolio manager at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, who says he has been "agressively neutral" for over months, said. "The rally has pretty much discounted a lot of what we already received in the price of securities, and it will need additional information of a soft economy before moving any higher, he said."
He added. "If you look at the recent comments by the Fed chairman, the jury is still out." He expects the Fed to remain on its present path.
"The three reasons I think the Fed will remain cautious," Mr. Donne said, are "that (A) Gradualism works. This is a $7 trillion economy, you just can't turn it on a dime. (B) The Fed has to preserve its image as an strong inflation fighter, which is good for the economy because it gives people confidence in the Fed, and (C) The international scene, where the trading situation is very fluid. We're in difficult negotiations with the Japanese, and for the Fed to move at this point could be viewed as an intrusion in the process. So the Fed is more likely to play this close to the vest."
Elsewhere, in the municipal bond market states, cities and agencies sold $2.7 billion of new securities yesterday. In the day's largest competitive issue, Georgia awarded Goldman, Sachs & Company $303.2 million of triple-A rated general obligations bonds priced to yield from 3.95 percent for an issue due in 1997 to 5.60 percent in 2012.
Meanwhile, the recent deluge of corporate debt sparked by low interest rates continues to keep rolling. Cox Communications Inc., Nabisco Holdings Corp. and Fleet Mortgage Group Inc. plan to sell a total of $1.65 billion of debt in the days ahead, traders say.

The Japan Contract Is Void

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Imagine if someone came to you and said he had a novel idea for resolving the Bosnia crisis: Japanese intervention.
Think about it: The Japanese are neither Muslims nor Christians, so both sides would view them as neutral peacekeepers. Japan is not a member of NATO, so it comes with no baggage of having bombed one side. There is a distant connection between the Japanese and Hungarian languages, so they might be able to communicate with some of the parties. Japan wants to be a member of the Security Council, so this would be the perfect test case. And Japan's Trade Minister is without a doubt the toughest negotiator in the world today and thus the perfect person to go head-to-head with the Serbs. 
 Well, you would sputter, that's absurd. And you would be right. It is absurd. But that's the point. Japan today is the second-richest country in the world. But it does not assume global economic or security responsibilities commensurate with its size, and we have grown so used to that situation that even suggesting otherwise seems the height of folly.
Ending that situation, at least in the economic field, is what the U.S.-Japan trade war is really about.
The Japanese auto industry cuts right across the Japanese economy. It is the epitome of the Japanese system of using government regulations, interlocking supplier networks and plain old monopolies to keep foreign competition out. By threatening trade sanctions against the core of that Japanese system unless Japan opens its markets more, Washington is saying to Tokyo that the U.S.-Japan relationship that existed during the cold war, and the roles it assigned both countries, is over.
During the cold war the U.S. struck a devil's bargain with Japan. Washington gave Tokyo free access to U.S. markets and allowed Japan to practice mercantilist economics -- building up its export industries with protection from foreign competition, while importing as little as possible. In return, Japan gave the U.S. military base rights and its total allegiance in the global cold war struggle against the Soviet Union. In other words, we got an unsinkable aircraft carrier in the Pacific and Japan got to focus on making Toyotas instead of tanks, with a protected market to boot. As the Japan specialist Chalmers Johnson puts it, in return for Japan not being neutral in the cold war, "We gave Japan something we never permitted the Europeans, which was that Japan did not have to meet international standards for economic reciprocity."
No more. What this trade war is about is telling Japan that while the U.S. may accept Japan remaining a secondary military power, it will not tolerate Japan behaving anymore like a secondary economic power. The cold war bargain is null and void. Japan is going to have to start taking responsibility for the global economic system, not just preying on it. And that means it must recognize that its trade barriers, its structural trade surpluses with the rest of the world and its reluctance to stimulate its economy distort the global trading system and are a drag on the whole world.
The reason changing Japan requires a trade war is because Japan does not want to change. It's had a great deal going. For 40 years, U.S. Presidents had to practice diplomacy, balancing off competing strategic and economic interests, while Japanese prime ministers got to practice commerce, focusing exclusively on their economic interests and keeping their markets closed.
Presidents Reagan and Bush should have started really pressuring Japan to change years ago. But they didn't, and now the system is so out of balance, the yen so strong against the dollar, Japan's global trade surplus so huge and its politicians so inured to ignoring their global responsibilities, that the adjustment process is going to be even more wrenching. But not as wrenching as it will be five years from now if nothing is done.
Will Japan make the adjustments? I'm not sure. Old habits die hard. The day you see Japanese generals in the streets of Sarajevo is the day you will see General Motors in the showrooms of Tokyo.

Undermined by weak consumer spending, the economies of the United States and Japan could grow more slowly this year than predicted in May, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said today.
Over all, the economies of industrialized nations will continue to grow steadily. But the United States and Japan, the two richest countries, may not fare as well as previously predicted, the O.E.C.D.'s chief economist, Kumiharu Shigehara, said. 
 The O.E.C.D. now forecasts that American economic growth will be 2.7 percent this year, not 3.2 percent as forecast in May. The revision was prompted by signs that consumer spending and manufacturing output have been weaker than expected.
"This weakness of consumption is a puzzle," Mr. Shigehara said at a news conference. "Is it a blip or a signal of continuing weakness?"
Given data released today in Japan, Mr. Shigehara said that Japan's economy may not grow 1.3 percent this year, as forecast last month. The Japanese economy grew only one-tenth of 1 percent in the first quarter of 1995 from the previous quarter, and consumer spending rose by the same amount, the Government reported.
The news conference coincided with release of the World Economic Outlook, which is prepared by the O.E.C.D. twice a year.

Greenspan Reluctant To Cut Interest Rates
 Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said he was reluctant to reduce short-term interest rates right away despite an increased risk of a mild recession. 
 Mr. Greenspan said it was uncertain whether the country would slip into a recession in the next few months, but he said it would be a mistake to stimulate business activity by lowering rates if that led investors to pull money out of the United States. [Page A1.]
 
New Jersey Financier Fined $71.5 Million; Price-Gouging Cited
 A Federal judge in Manhattan ruled that Robert E. Brennan, the New Jersey financier and sports entrepreneur, had used illegal price-gouging and abusive sales practices to enrich himself and his brokers at his customers' expense. The judge imposed damages of at least $71.5 million on Mr. Brennan and his firm, First Jersey Securities. [A1.]
 The case of Quasar Microsystems, later bankrupt, shows how First Jersey Securities operated. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [D10.]
 The fraud judgment is expected to place Mr. Brennan's other ventures under renewed scrutiny, including his efforts to buy the Meadowlands sports complex and the New Jersey Devils hockey team. [D4.]
 
Citicorp in Stock Buyback
 Citicorp said it would buy back as much as $3 billion, or 13 percent, of its stock. [D10.]
 
Repeal of Utility Law Urged
The S.E.C. recommended that Congress repeal a 60-year-old law that places severe limits on the ability of a small group of utility holding companies to diversify. [D3.]
 
Housing Starts Fall 1.3%
 Housing starts fell 1.3 percent in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.24 million units, as lower mortgage rates failed to revive the housing market. [D2.]
 
A Move to High-Tech Banking
 American Express has hired William Heron Jr., a former Citibank executive, to lead a plan to offer banking and other financial services over the telephone and by computer. [D2.]
 
Metrahealth May Be Seeking Buyer
 The Metrahealth Companies, the giant joint venture of Metropolitan Life Insurance and Travelers, is looking for a buyer, insurance executives and industry analysts said. [D2.]
 
Disney Plans Wildlife Park
 The Walt Disney Company said it planned to build its largest theme park yet, one that would combine rides with real wildlife. The Wild Animal Kingdom is expected to open in the spring of 1998 on about 500 acres of Disney-owned land in Orange County, Fla., near Orlando and would be five times the size of the Magic Kingdom. Analysts estimated that the project would cost $600 million to $800 million. [B9.]
 
Shell Will Not Sink Platform
 Royal Dutch/Shell, faced with environmentalists' protests, has abandoned its plan to sink an aging oil platform. [A9.]
 
Slow Growth in Japan
 The Japanese economy expanded in the first quarter just one-tenth of 1 percent from the previous quarter, or at an annual rate of three-tenths of 1 percent. [D5.]

Japan's Trade Lightning Might Not Strike Twice

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
When Japan realized more than a decade ago that it needed a political strategy to deal with American demands to open its markets, its trade bureaucrats bought a giant map that showed the boundaries of every Congressional district in the United States. They hung it in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and used colored pins to show which districts had just received a new Japanese car factory or parts plant.
Investing in America turned out to be a brilliant strategy, both good politics and good business. Now, a week from the sanctions that would cripple the sale of Japanese luxury cars in the United States, the Japanese Government is hoping to make lightning strike twice. In return for getting the United States to drop its demands to open their market, Japanese officials and car makers are floating the idea of increasing annual production in the United States by 400,000 cars over the next three years, and raising the percentage of American-made parts in every model. 
 For President Clinton, it could be a tempting offer: the promise to create more jobs in Ohio and Tennessee, places where, as the Japanese well know, he could use more than a little help in the 1996 election. But his economic advisers say the Japanese are still fighting the last trade war, and if making a few more cars in the United States is all they have to offer when last-ditch talks begin in Geneva on Thursday, there will be no deal.
"We can't solve this problem in America," said Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative. "We have to solve it in Japan."
What makes the confrontation particularly nasty is that a lot has changed in the United States and Japan -- and in their relationship with each other -- since the first pins were pressed into that map on the wall in Tokyo. Those changes are evident from the strategies both sides are bringing to Geneva, strategies born of past agreements gone bad and odd politics in both capitals.
For Mr. Clinton, the objectives are clear. Five previous Presidents, starting with Richard M. Nixon, have promised to break through the system of corporate relationships that keep outsiders from prospering in Japan. Five have failed.
Certainly, there has been no shortage of trade agreements in that time, in everything from citrus fruit to window glass, and in some cases American suppliers have prospered. But in this fight, Mr. Clinton has promised to change not the trade numbers but the system. His objective, he and Mr. Kantor have said many times, is to end the days when Japan can make its home market a sanctuary for Japanese producers, where they can charge high prices free of the kind of competition they face around the world.
That is why the offer to increase production in the United States, an attractive deal a decade ago when the American auto industry was laying off workers and seemed headed into a ditch, is not so attractive today.
"This Administration is the first to really focus on the anomaly of the Japanese system -- that the Japanese have internationalized their business abroad far more than they have at home," said I. M. Destler, a professor at the University of Maryland who is a leading historian of past trade conflicts. "But that is a much harder deal to strike. Politically, it is a lot easier to open a new plant in America than to allow in imports into Japan."
It is so much easier to add capacity in the United States that the Japanese were planning to do it anyway -- with or without pressure. With the yen hovering around 84 to the dollar, it is ridiculously expensive to make cars in Japan and ship them here, and the Japanese auto makers did not get where they are today by losing money.
The Honda Motor Company, for example, said a year ago that it would increase its production in the United States by 110,000 units a year, to 720,000 a year, and raise the number of engines it produces here by 50 percent within several years. As a matter of economic survival, other car makers have developed similar plans. Indeed, the offer whispered by Japan in recent days appears to be largely a compilation of those previously announced expansion plans.
Of course, every car made in the United States, rather than one imported from Japan, helps close the $66 billion trade imbalance. But increased production here does nothing to solve the central problem that this dispute is about: winning equality of access for American companies trying to sell in Japan, the world's second-largest car market. And as both sides know, the rules set in the auto dispute are going to be replicated in trade agreements to come, in a variety of other industries.
So the challenge facing the American negotiators is to find a way to win guarantees that far more American parts will be purchased by Japan's auto makers and repair shops, all the while pretending that such a "voluntary" agreement does not lock the Japanese into binding commitments. Such quotas would constitute managed trade -- something Americans say they do not believe in (except when there is no other choice) and that the Japanese say they can never accept (except when they are given no other choice).
The challenge for Japan, meanwhile, is to assure the least disruption of the tight business relationships that are the foundation of its social contract with its own workers, including its tradition of lifetime employment. Today that system is threatened as it has never been before.
In private, of course, both sides are figuring their bottom lines, how much they can afford to bend. But it is an enormously complex equation, a game of three-dimensional chess. Japan has to weigh the economic losses implicit in any deal against the damage that no deal at all would wreak in its relationship with its most important ally. And its trade minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, has to decide what will play better as he seeks the prime ministership: a hang-tough attitude, or a compromise that shows he can handle the bullying Americans.
For his part, Mr. Clinton senses that this issue is a political winner. But the choices will get harder in the next week. Already there are voices in his Administration warning that a prolonged fight will damage the security relationship with Japan and the value of the dollar, and perhaps even threaten the trade gains already made by the United States.
Only in the last few weeks have both sides begun actively discussing those costs, and wondering what kind of brinkmanship will make the other blink. It may take weeks or months of sanctions to bring that thinking to a conclusion. And time may well be on the side of the Americans.
"Look to September for a deal," an adviser to Mr. Clinton said the other day, mentioning the month before Japan's new car models are supposed to arrive on American showroom floors. "That's when the Japanese will get motivated and we'll be getting nervous."

HEADLINE: Doubts Voiced By Greenspan On a Rate Cut

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

 BODY:
In the strongest statement of his intentions since economic growth began to stall earlier this year, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, indicated last night that he was reluctant to cut short-term interest rates right away despite an increased risk of a mild recession.
Speaking to the Economic Club of New York, Mr. Greenspan said it was uncertain whether the country would slip into a recession in the next few months. But in an open acknowledgment of the new constraints imposed by currency markets, he said it would be a mistake to stimulate business activity by lowering rates if that led investors to pull money out of the United States, weakening an already shaky dollar. 
 Mr. Greenspan left open the possibility of a cut in interest rates later this year if more signs emerged that the economy was heading into worse trouble or if Congress passed a budget that would significantly narrow the Federal deficit. During a question-and-answer session after the speech, Mr. Greenspan said that he detected an easing of the inflation pressures that prompted the Federal Reserve to begin raising interest rates last year.
The chairman said current interest rate policies were under review in light of the economy's weakness, and he hinted at possibly vigorous debate within the Federal Reserve committee that sets short-term rates; that panel is scheduled to meet on July 5 and 6.
A few members of the panel, including Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, have publicly expressed concern that the economy is now in considerably worse shape than they had expected it would be after seven rate increases during the 12-month period that ended on Feb. 1. Still, Mr. Greenspan is widely thought to have the influence to insure that short-term rates will fall only if he wants them to.
"Of one thing I am certain: our Federal Open Market Committee meeting in a couple of weeks will be most engaging," Mr. Greenspan said. "I am also confident that the consideration given to the stance of policy will be in the context of our longer-term goal of price stability. A consistently disciplined monetary policy is what our global financial system increasingly requires and rewards."
Mr. Greenspan's remarks on the growing force of international currency markets represented a break from decades of Federal Reserve policy, in which domestic considerations were given primacy, at least in public.
Mr. Greenspan, in his speech, discussed how the increased flows of money across national borders had made it harder for any central bank -- even the Federal Reserve -- to avoid the kind of swift retribution suffered by countries, like Mexico, that are seen as pursuing reckless economic policies.
"While there are many policy considerations that arise as a consequence of the rapidly expanding global financial system, the most important is the necessity of maintaining stability in the prices of goods and services and confidence in domestic financial markets," he said. "Failure to do so is apt to exact far greater consequences as a result of cross-border capital movements than those which might have prevailed a generation ago."
In afternoon trading today in Tokyo, the dollar fell slightly as traders said they had trouble drawing conclusions from news service reports of Mr. Greenspan's comments. During night trading on the Chicago Board of Trade, bond future prices climbed as traders bet that Mr. Greenspan might yet cut rates soon.
The Federal Reserve chairman's resistance to reducing short-term interest rates is likely to disappoint both the Clinton Administration and the financial markets.
Because changes in interest rates affect the pace of economic growth 6 to 18 months later, a rate cut in July would be likely to stimulate the economy during the 1996 election year. Some Administration officials, particularly the President's political advisers, had been hoping that Mr. Greenspan would cut rates soon to provide insurance against an economic decline next year even if such a move meant accepting an extra risk of feeding inflation.
Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said on June 11 that it would be helpful if the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates soon. But Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has strongly reminded his colleagues since then that such remarks could be counterproductive if they convinced financial markets that the independence of the Fed had been compromised and that inflation might be allowed to rise.
Whatever the complaints from the White House, they appeared to have made little impression on Mr. Greenspan. During the question-and-answer period after his speech, he praised the Administration generally and Mr. Rubin in particular for not pressing the independent central bank. "Our relationship with the Secretary of the Treasury and his predecessor, Senator Bentsen, has been exemplary," he said.
Mr. Greenspan spoke last night at a dinner at the New York Hilton in midtown Manhattan attended by more than 1,000 corporate and financial leaders -- probably the central bank's single most important constituency. His remarks appeared intended as an explanation to them of his reasons for postponing a cut in interest rates that many traders and analysts in the stock and bond markets had started to take for granted.
When Mr. Greenspan, in Seattle on June 7, raised the possibility of a recession but emphasized the economy's long-term health, stock and bond prices fell for three consecutive days as many investors were dismayed that a cut in short-term interest rates seemed less likely. The markets then rose when Mr. Greenspan said in Basel, Switzerland, on June 11 that the economic slowdown might turn into a mild recession, a comment widely interpreted as making a rate cut more likely.
But in Seattle and Basel, Mr. Greenspan made only brief off-the-cuff comments. Yesterday he provided a detailed picture of his thinking and specifically mentioned for the first time the coming meeting of the Open Market Committee.
Mr. Greenspan said the current slowdown reflected an effort by companies to pare their inventories of unsold goods, which have risen sharply this spring. But the economy's long-term health will depend on the pace at which businesses, consumers and government actually buy goods, clearing the shelves and creating a demand for more goods to be produced.
As he had in Seattle, Mr. Greenspan welcomed the decision by companies to cut production to reduce inventories. If the stockpiles had continued to accumulate even as spending slowed, the economy might have faced a more severe recession later, he said last evening.
"The process of slowing to a more sustainable pace has not been entirely smooth -- anyone who thought it would be is not a very close student of economic history or human nature," he said. "It is difficult at this point to judge with any confidence how these various forces will work themselves out in the period ahead."
The impact of economic demand abroad and of the Government's spending at home will affect how quickly inventories return to more typical levels and how soon the economy resumes a faster pace of growth, Mr. Greenspan said. Growth appears to be stagnating for many of the United States' biggest trading partners, notably Japan, and that may reduce sales of American goods to these countries.
Mr. Greenspan spent most of his speech last night reviewing how the new techniques in communications and trading have changed the international financial system. The same complex financial deals and computerized trading that apparently allowed a single trader at the British investment house of Barings to lose almost $1 billion earlier this year have also allowed investors to move vast sums to whatever country offers the highest returns on investments with the lowest inflation.
All this has made a unilateral reduction in interest rates difficult for any country, even the United States, which has traditionally been more insulated because of the sheer scale of its economy and the special status of the dollar in currency markets. Although he did not elaborate, Mr. Greenspan's remarks suggested that the Fed might not cut interest rates until after the Bundesbank of Germany had done so.
The German mark has emerged as the main rival to the dollar in international currency markets. Despite the mark's rise this year, Bundesbank officials have been reluctant to cut rates because of concerns that this could feed inflation in Germany.
During the late 1980's, the Reagan and Bush Administrations and the Federal Reserve were also worried about the value of the dollar, and made repeated efforts to persuade the Bundesbank to cut rates. But the Fed avoided public acknowledgment then of the importance of the dollar in its decision- making.

HEADLINE: ABOUT REAL ESTATE;
Fairfax County, Va., Gets 4 New Office Buildings

BYLINE: By JAMES R. HARDCASTLE 

DATELINE: FAIRFAX, Va.

 BODY:
Four large office development projects are under construction in Fairfax County, ending a five-year drought in new office construction in the county.
Fairfax County, which wraps around the western and southern edges of Washington, Arlington County and Alexandria, Va., saw explosive growth in the 1980's, when about 50 million square feet of office space was created, according to the county Economic Development Authority. But the market collapsed at the end of the decade, and developers forfeited to lenders on many unbuilt sites. 
 The four projects are being designed and constructed to meet the needs of the corporate customers who will be occupying them. Two of them are for major management and technology consulting firms: American Management Systems and Booz, Allen & Hamilton. The third project is for the Student Loan Marketing Association, better known as Sallie Mae and the fourth is for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, known as Freddie Mac.
Freddie Mac has already moved into a 290,000-square-foot, four-level structure and later this summer will begin using a second building, with 190,000 square feet of space.
"The build-to-suit market largely exists because the existing office market is unable to service the requirements of some companies," said Brian E. Lee, a senior real estate officer in Washington with the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company of Milwaukee.
Vacancy rates in northern Virginia have dropped from a high of 22 percent at the end of 1990 to a little more than 9 percent at the end of the first quarter, said Ben Orme, the manager of CB Commercial Real Estate Group office in Tysons Corner, Va.
There are about five prospective users exploring build-to-suit opportunities of 100,000 square feet or larger in northern Virginia, Mr. Orme said. He said there were only about 12 alternatives available today for users seeking in excess of 100,000 square feet of contiguous space.
Yet with current average rents still about $15 a square foot a year -- and rent for top-of-the line space in Tysons Corner just beginning to go over the $25-a-square-foot mark -- developers still cannot justify or finance speculative construction.
The projects for American Management Systems and Booz, Allen started when the companies agreed to sign 15-year leases for the buildings, which cleared the way for financing. American Management will be moving early next year into a 250,000-square-foot building along Interstate 66 west of Fairfax City. Gilbane Properties Inc., a unit of the Gilbane Building Company of Providence, R.I., is building the project.
Booz, Allen will be moving into a 206,000-square-foot building in Tysons Corner that is being built to the company's specifications by a joint venture of a unit of the Carr Realty Corporation, a Washington real estate investment trust, and Cousins Properties Inc., areal estate trust in Atlanta.
Freddie Mac's buildings are in the Westpark office park in Tysons Corner. Freddie Mac's partner in the project is the West Group of Tysons Corner, which owned the site.
Opening early next year in Reston will be Sallie Mae's new 450,000- square-foot headquarters building. The building will be near the Reston Town Center, about six miles west of Freddie Mac's new buildings.

HEADLINE: C.I.A. REPORT SAYS CHINESE SENT IRAN ARMS COMPONENTS

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
The Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that China has recently delivered important components for missile systems to Iran and Pakistan. Senior Administration officials said today that the shipments could violate an international missile accord and require the United States to impose punitive economic sanctions against China.
The report comes when diplomatic relations with China are deeply strained because of disputes over human rights, trade and the recent unofficial visit of Taiwan's President to the United States. 
 In the last year, China has delivered dozens, perhaps hundreds of missile guidance systems and computerized machine tools to Iran, the C.I.A. concluded in a report circulating among policy makers. The components could give Teheran the ability to improve the accuracy of North Korean Scud missiles already in its arsenal and enable it to build such missiles on its own, the report states.
The report also says that in the last three months, China has delivered to Pakistan parts that could be used in M-11 ballistic missiles.
In August 1993, the United States banned certain high-technology sales to China after American intelligence concluded that China had sent M-11 missile components to Pakistan in violation of an international missile accord.
"We have serious questions about China's missile-related exports to Pakistan and Iran, and we are in a position where we have to consider the question of sanctions," said John D. Holum, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. "There are substantial indications of continued missile-related transactions to both countries. We need clarification from the Chinese of what is under way. But as of now, that has not been possible."
Relations between the United States and China are at their lowest point since 1989, when the Chinese cracked down on the democracy movement and attacked protesters at Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
The private visit to the United States by President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan earlier this month touched off a campaign of diplomaic retaliation, including the recall of China's Ambassador in Washington, the cancellation of several high-level meetings between American and Chinese officials and China's refusal to approve the appointment of a former Senator, James Sasser of Tennessee, as the new Ambassador to Beijing.
An editorial Sunday in the official Communist Party's People's Daily accused the United States of plunging Chinese-American relations "into a danger zone" by allowing the visit by the President of Taiwan, an island China regards as a renegade province. The editorial concluded by asking, "Where does the U.S. Government want Sino-U.S. relations to go? We are waiting to see."
So is Washington.
The Administration is so determined to try to salvage its strategy of embracing rather than isolating Beijing that last weekend it offered to send Peter Tarnoff, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, to Beijing to take stock of the relationship. But a senior State Department official said today that the Chinese did not respond.
Since China has not shipped complete missiles or missile systems to either Iran or Pakistan, the report has generated a debate in the Administration over whether China has actually violated the Missile Technology Control Regime and should be punished with sanctions required under American law.
Administration officials who are trying to repair the damaged relationship with China contend there is no conclusive proof that the equipment is being used to improve Iran's missile capability in violation of the accord.
But other Administration officials primarily concerned about the spread of missile technology -- especially to a country like Iran, which the Administration has branded "an outlaw state" -- are eager to train the spotlight on the technology transfer and, if possible, punish the Chinese. They argue that the equipment will allow Iran to produce missiles that exceed the payload limits and range of the missile accord, which China has promised to uphold.
Some details of the report were in the current issue of Defense News. In apparent response, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Chen Yian, insisted on Tuesday that China "is strictly honoring its commitment" to the accord.
The Administration has asked the Chinese for an official explanation through diplomatic channels, but has not received a response, senior State Department officials said today.
American officials were poised to discuss the issue formally in talks in Beijing this week. But China canceled the talks as part of its protest of President Clinton's decision to allow Mr. Lee's visit.
The dramatic and persistent reaction of the Chinese since the visit puts the Chinese in a bind: they must respond strongly to prevent further American ties with Tawian, but not so strongly as to endanger their own interests.
Administration officials say they are heartened by the fact that China has not canceled the visit of Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown to Beijing in August, a sign, they say, of the importance of economic ties.
In addition, Chinese leaders, including President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Li Peng, allowed J. Stapleton Roy, the outgoing American Ambassador to Beijing, to pay them farewell calls before he left his post in Beijing last weekend.
No matter that the Chinese officials railed against the visit by Mr. Lee as violating decades-old understandings between Washington and Beijing; the fact that they received Mr. Roy at all was viewed by the Administration as a positive sign that at least the Chinese are willing to talk.
But the visit of Mr. Lee to Cornell University, his alma mater, in Ithaca, N.Y., has enabled Taiwan to make additional diplomatic inroads.
Senator Frank Murkowski, the Alaska Republican, has invited Mr. Lee to visit Alaska this November, and other Taiwanese officials hope to follow him to the United States. The United States Congress, in voting overwhelmingly to allow Mr. Lee to visit in the first place, is willing to oblige.
Taiwan has mounted an aggressive and successful lobbying campaign in Washington, in which a research group linked with the Government is paying a Washington firm $4.5 million to improve its image. Among its arguments is that Taiwan has moved from a one-party, authoritarian state into a democracy, in contrast with China, which continues to repress its citizens.

HEADLINE: NatWest Plans to Retain 1,000 Workers at Melville Data Center

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, L.I., June 21

 BODY:
The National Westminster Bank, which provoked angry protests last year when it transferred 700 jobs from Long Island to Pennsylvania, announced today that it would retain 1,000 workers at its technical operations and data center in Melville.
The bank also said it would spend $66 million to refurbish the building, which it bought in 1991, and update its equipment there. 
 John Tugwell, the chairman of NatWest, made the announcement jointly with Robert J. Gaffney, the Suffolk County Executive, who a year ago led government officials in protesting the job transfers and called on local governments to withdraw all public funds from NatWest.
"That's all forgotten and in the past," Mr. Gaffney said today, noting that the flow of government funds had resumed. Mr. Gaffney, a Republican seeking re-election, did not disclose how much money had been withdrawn from NatWest, but said, "It was a lesson for the entire business community, as well as all elected officials on Long Island."
Mr. Tugwell said the county had agreed to provide lower-cost electricity through the Suffolk County Electrical Agency, bringing savings to NatWest of up to $200,000 a year.
In addition, he said, the county will provide low-cost financing through the Suffolk County Industrial Development Agency and waive the sales tax on all equipment bought for the data center, which Mr. Tugwell said would have come to $5 million. He said the Long Island Lighting Company had rejected NatWest's application for reduced rates available to businesses being forced to leave the Island because of electricity costs, now twice the national average.
Suzanne Halpin, a spokeswoman for Lilco, said the utility had provided NatWest with $150,000 in energy rebates. "And the Suffolk Electrical Agency is doing just what it was designed to do," she said.
County officials said the Suffolk Electrical Agency, which buys power directly from the State Power Authority to aid industrial development, could sell that power to NatWest at a price between 15 and 20 percent lower than Lilco.
Mr. Tugwell said that its electric costs in Scranton, Pa., were half that charged by Lilco but that the bank decided that Long Island's quality of life, business climate and wealth of highly skilled workers, plus Suffolk County's help, led to its decision to keep its data center in Melville. "Our service operations in Scranton," he added, "will continue to grow."
NatWest Bank has about 325 branch offices in New York and New Jersey, including 65 on Long Island. It is a subsidiary of the National Westminster Bancorp and has 2,400 employees on Long Island.

HEADLINE: With $1 Billion Deficit, Los Angeles County Begins Facing Painful Cuts

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 21

 BODY:
In a noisy conference room punctuated by cheers and boos, the five Los Angeles County supervisors began to wrestle urgently this week with a fiscal problem they say has been threatening the stability of the nation's most populous county for 17 years.
Faced with a budget deficit of more than $1 billion -- the cumulative result, in part, of years of reduced revenues that began with the adoption in 1978 of an anti-tax ballot measure -- the county must cut nearly $1 from every $10 it intends to spend in the coming year. 
 Addressing the stark numbers of a proposed 1996 budget, the supervisors began hacking away immediately at some of the smaller and easier targets, while recoiling at major restructuring that economic analysts said was all but inevitable.
"We need to make painful cuts," Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said.
Reviewing the $11.1 billion budget proposal for the first time on Tuesday, the supervisors ordered more than $250 million in cuts in an interim budget.
"It shows that the board has some real resolve to move forward," said Sally R. Reed, the county's chief administrative officer, who drew up the budget that calls for across-the-board reductions of 20 percent in most departments, including the elimination of 18,000 jobs, with 10,000 by layoffs.
For Los Angeles County, the worst pain still lies ahead. Even now officials are contemplating reductions in health services that could include the closure of one of the nation's largest hospitals, the 2,000-bed Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center. On Tuesday, the supervisors created a committee to review the county's choices.
None of this should have come as a surprise, economic analysts said. The fiscal problems of Los Angeles County have their roots in the passage 17 years ago of Proposition 13, a ballot measure that began a national trend by severely limiting property taxes, threatening municipal operating budgets.
Throughout the booming 1980's, the State of California was able to keep its counties afloat. Flush with personal income taxes, business taxes and retail sales taxes, the counties had little problem providing for health, social and child services, as well as financing jails and welfare.
But when the economy contracted in the 1990's, the revenue shrank painfully. Under intense budget pressures of its own, the Legislature over the last three years redirected $1 billion from Los Angeles County to the state's troubled school system.
"All of a sudden you have a lot of chickens coming home to roost," said Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Economic Development Corporation of Los Angeles County, a private jobs-promotion agency.
At the same time, the county -- with a growing population of 9 million and more than 30 percent of the state's economy -- is facing the grim new reality of municipal finance in the 1990's. Even as the Federal and state governments around the country want to pass on responsibility for many government services, they are handing over fewer dollars to help local governments like Los Angeles County, which relies on such money to cover two-thirds of its budget.
As the problems became acute here over the past three years, the county resorted to quick fixes in the hope that a rising economy would save it again. It tapped reserve funds, mortgaged oceanside property and borrowed against future pension fund contributions. But as Mr. Yaroslavsky said, time has run out.
"You can't do these short-term fixes any more," Mr. Kyser said, citing a drop in confidence among lenders, fueled in part by the bankruptcy of neighboring Orange County. "You can't do short-term borrowing, can't borrow from pension funds. You've got a significant crunch point."
Both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, Wall Street credit rating agencies, this week placed the county's long-term rating under review pending the resolution of its budget problems.
In this new atmosphere, the county on Monday moved to guarantee repayment of $1.3 billion in short-term borrowing by purchasing a letter of credit from a syndicate of American, German and Swiss banks. Economic analysts said the purchase, which tides the county over until next year's property tax receipts, had been made necessary partly by the Orange County bankruptcy and that county's threat not to honor its debts.
The wake-up call in Ms. Reed's budget is a proposal to save $310 million by closing the County-U.S.C. Medical Center, with its 9,000 employees and its broad array of services to the poor. If the hospital is not closed, she said, four other smaller hospitals might be forced to close.
On Monday, when these proposals were first made public, Mr. Yaroslavsky, who is considered a swing vote and a fiscal expert on the Board of Supervisors, reacted brusquely, saying, "I don't think we are going to close down the biggest hospital in the country."
But on Tuesday, in an indication that the supervisors are daring to peek into the abyss, his defense of the hospital was less firm.
"The hospital bears no relation to our city's medical needs," he said. "It is an anacronism in today's medical world. It is a dinosaur that supports a huge bureaucracy that is bleeding the county dry."

HEADLINE: S.I. Terminal to Be Reopened by Sending Silt to Landfill in Utah

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Port officials said yesterday that they had finally found a way to open a long-dormant marine terminal on Staten Island that had become the focus of an environmental dispute. They said they would take the unusual and costly step of spending $17.7 million to send contaminated sediment that must be dredged from the shipping berths around the terminal to a landfill in Utah.
The announcement means that by the end of the year, large freighters should be able to begin arriving at the terminal, Howland Hook, helping to revive the moribund maritime industry in New York City. 
 But port officials acknowledged that though they appear to have handled the problems at Howland Hook, they are still searching for a broader solution to a dredging impasse in the harbor that is threatening thousands of jobs on the busier New Jersey side.
"We can't stay competitive without an economically and environmentally sound method to dispose our material," said Frank N. Caggiano, the deputy port director at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. "When you have to go to Utah, it's a crisis."
The fight is over what to do with contaminated material that is scooped from the floor of the harbor during dredging, which deepens shipping channels. Environmentalists fear that if the sediment is improperly handled by, for example, dumping it into the ocean, the toxins will kill marine life and damage the ecosystem. They have often used lawsuits to halt dredging that they believed would lead to pollution.
Though dredging may seem an arcane issue, it can have a significant impact on commerce in the region, affecting everyone from dock workers to insurance agents to consumers, who must pay more for oil or gasoline that cannot easily be transported by tankers into shipping channels clogged with silt. The Port Authority estimates that the port generates more than 180,000 jobs.
The contaminants in the sediment at Howland Hook, the largest container port in New York City, include pesticides, trace metals and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's. They are believed to have come from factories that once released their wastes into the harbor.
By disposing of the contaminated sediment from Howland Hook at a landfill, the Port Authority avoids a lengthy battle over a proposal it had made to dump the material into underwater pits off Coney Island and Staten Island. That plan had run into protests from environmentalists and residents, who maintained that the sediment could escape from the pits and foul the water.
But port officials conceded that Howland Hook, which closed in 1986 after its tenant went bankrupt, was a special case, and that it was not likely that they, or private operators, would be able allocate such large amounts of money to dredge other terminals that have had similar difficulties. City officials have long pressed the Port Authority to reopen Howland Hook.
Sending sediment to a landfill is far more expensive that dumping it at sea. If the 150,000 cubic yards of material from Howland Hook that is to go to Utah by barge and rail instead went to the Mud Dump, an area six miles off Sandy Hook, N.J., that receives uncontaminated dredged sediment, it would cost about $450,000, officials said.
For now, at least, private terminal operators who are independent of the Port Authority and have waited years to dredge remain stuck. A task force set up by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has called for the state to construct a different kind of pit in the floor of Newark Bay to receive toxic sediment, but that could take a few years.
Petroleum terminals on the harbor lose millions of dollars a year because their tankers often must stop in the harbor and unload some of their cargo onto barges. The tankers become lighter, ride higher in the water and can fit into shallow shipping channels filled with silt. This "lightering" is not only expensive, but the transferring of fuel from tanker to barge also increases the chances of a spill or accident in the harbor.
Cliff Zapp, a manager of the Stratus Petroleum Corporation in Newark, said he had been unable to dredge his terminal since 1987. The water depth, once 35 feet, is now 20 feet, he said. As a result of his increased costs and reduced business, he has had to lay off several workers.
"It has made it much more difficult to do business," he said.
The Citgo terminal on the Arthur Kill in Linden, N.J., has had to pay for 80 to 100 extra barges a year because the water depth had decreased from 30 feet to 15 feet since it was last dredged in 1991, said Jack McCrossin, its environmental and safety manager.
New York City is paying for $14 million of the $17.7 million cost of the Howland Hook project, with the Port Authority contributing the rest. The authority has invested $25 million in recent years to renovate Howland Hook.
The decision to spend so much money on the landfill surprised some environmentalists, who said it showed that the dredging policy in the port was poorly thought out.
Cindy A. Zipf, executive director of Clean Ocean Action, an advocacy group in Sandy Hook, N.J., said the plan was foolish, maintaining that port officials were spending exorbitant sums of money because they had no other options.
"The thing to remember here is that this problem has been creeping up on the Port Authority and the harbor region for 25 years," said Ms. Zipf, a member of Governor Whitman's task force on dredging.
She said she supported the Whitman plan to construct pits in Newark Bay, adding that in the meantime terminals like Howland Hook should construct small landfills on their own property to dispose of their contaminated sediment, instead of sending it elsewhere.
That sentiment was echoed by some residents in East Carbon, Utah, site of the landfill, when they heard the news that the sediment would be coming their way.
"It is disheartening," said Phyllis Johnson, who has led opposition to the landfill there. "They should just rename this city Garbage Town U.S.A."

HEADLINE: Fed Sees Signs of Weakness in Robust Economy

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
The nation's economy is still robust, but showing some signs of weakness, the Federal Reserve said in a survey released today, even as traders and financial analysts continued to puzzle over a speech on Tuesday night by Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman.
"Economic activity remains at a high level across much of the nation, although there are indications of some softening in many reports from the 12 Federal Reserve districts," said the study, the latest in a series that the Fed publishes two weeks before each meeting of its top monetary policy panel. 
 The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet on July 5 and 6. With the economic signals particularly confusing right now, the Fed's chairman, Mr. Greenspan, said Tuesday night in New York that he expected the two-day meeting to be "most engaging." At those sessions, the committee is likely to debate vigorously whether or not it should lower short-term interest rates in response to a marked slowing of the economy.
Mr. Greenspan said in his Tuesday speech that current Fed policies were under review in light of economic weakness, but warned of the threat to the dollar if international currency markets began to worry about a slackening in the fight against inflation. His carefully calibrated ambiguity included enough hints and caveats to leave room for the Fed to make almost any decision. And that seemed to be exactly what Mr. Greenspan intended. "I worry incessantly that I might be too clear," he said in a question-and-answer session after the speech. To gales of laughter from the audience of economists and financial experts, Mr. Greenspan said he had mastered "Fed-speak" in which the goal is to "mumble with great incoherence."
Nonetheless, the balance of his comments suggested a reluctance to cut rates at the meeting. In his speech, he emphasized the economy's underlying health even while acknowledging the chances of a brief, modest recession.
The study issued by the Fed today gave a similar picture of optimism with asterisks. It said the strongest economic growth was now occurring in the middle of the country, while there are "generally less favorable conditions on the East and West Coasts."
Manufacturers of factory equipment and electronics continue to enjoy strong sales, the study said, but bad weather has hurt agriculture and demand is slowing for some consumer goods and building materials. The study is known as the "beige book," reflecting the cover's color.
In the enormous auto manufacturing industry, sales remain depressed but "with a few indications of an upturn," the Fed analysis concluded.
The Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, also said today that his conversations with business leaders and others had persuaded him that the economy would rebound from its current weakness.
"I think we will go back to a resumption of solid growth," Mr. Rubin said. "My own view, having talked with a number of people involved in business, which I think gives you some sense of where the economy is headed, is that while there may be continued slowness for a while, there are some signs this thing is working itself out."
Mr. Greenspan's complex combination of economic arguments produced confusion today among traders. The stock market drifted with little change, but the yields on short-term bonds dropped by as much as a tenth of a percentage point as some traders concluded that Mr. Greenspan could agree to cut interest rates as an insurance policy against the risk that the current weakness might turn into a deep or lengthy economic recession.
Mickey D. Levy, an analyst at Nationsbank, said that the complexity of the speech limited its effect on the market. Many traders ignored the Fed chairman's unusual comments about the constraints that international financial markets have put on the Federal Reserve's freedom of action. That was because they came in the latter half of his speech, after he had mentioned the coming Open Market Committee meeting.
"When he wasn't talking about the meeting, people turned off -- they were looking for a sound bite," Mr. Levy said.
Mr. Greenspan, by obscuring his true intentions behind a blizzard of economic statistics and theories, helps keep his options open for the July meeting. Indeed, some analysts say that Mr. Greenspan may not even have any true intentions for the July meeting yet. "I still think he's on the fence," said Marc W. Wanshel, an analyst at J. P. Morgan.
Avoiding clear-cut policy statements also helps Mr. Greenspan survive the tricky internal politics at the Federal Reserve. Members of the monetary policy committee have made clear over the years that they do not like to be put in the position of undermining the chairman if they do not want to go along with a position that he has already expressed publicly.
"He's sort of obligated to keep his options open out of respect for the committee and the process," Mr. Wanshel said.
Mr. Greenspan joked repeatedly about his lack of clarity during Senate Banking Committee testimony Tuesday morning and after his speech Tuesday night. "If I say something which you understand fully in this regard," he told a Senator during testimony on Tuesday morning, "I probably made a mistake."
But some analysts said that Mr. Greenspan was fully capable of being even more enigmatic if he chose. David M. Jones, a longtime Fed watcher at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a Government securities dealer in New York, said that "I had thought before the speech that he wouldn't say anything about policy -- that would have been pure obfuscating."

Treasuries Rise in Price After Talk By Greenspan

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday as traders put their own interpretations on complex and somewhat ambiguous comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, on Tuesday night.
Mr. Greenspan indicated that he was reluctant to cut short-term rates right away, despite the increased risk of a mild recession. But he did leave open the possibility of a cut later this year if more signs emerged that the economy was heading into worse trouble or if Congress passed a budget that would significantly narrow the Federal deficit. 
 To traders, those were grounds enough for optimism that rates would come down.
The 30-year bond rose 20/32 , to a price of 1145/32 for a yield of 6.54 percent, down from 6.58 percent on Tuesday.
Early in the session the Commerce Department released trade-deficit numbers for April that showed a gain of 16.2 percent, for a record $11.37 billion shortfall. Economists had forecast a $9.2 billion deficit. Exports fell 1.3 percent while imports gained 1 percent, to a record $75.35 billion.
In his speech to the Economic Club of New York on Tuesday night Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that the currency markets imposed new constraints. "It would be a mistake to stimulate business activity by lowering interest rates if that led investors to pull money out of the United States, weakening an already shaky dollar," he added.
Mr. Greenspan said inventories would be the key in coming weeks.
The Fed's "beige book" report of regional economic conditions helped pare some early gains yesterday. The Fed said that inflation had remained under control and that labor markets generally remained tight.
Anthony E. Spare, chief investment officer of Spare, Kaplan, Bischel & Associates, a San Francisco money management firm, was not surprised by the market's rallying response to what others regarded as noncommittal remarks by Mr. Greenspan.
"Speculators are running the market up and down right now," he said, "making a long-term determination of interest rates in just a few hours of trading." He called it "reading the wrong tea leaves, by the wrong gypsies."
In fact, economists will not know what the last quarter did for at least three more years, when all the revisions are finished, Mr. Spare said. "Our guess is that you will see a 7 percent long bond before you see 6 percent bond."
Despite the attention paid to talk by Fed officials lately, Mr. Spare said, "Monetary policy alone cannot achieve higher real growth and low inflation, not without help from the Administration and Congress on spending and tax policy."
The Treasury said yesterday that it planned to sell $29.25 billion of new two- and five-year notes next week in addition to $27.2 billion of new three- and six-month maturities at the regular weekly bill auction.
In when-issued trading ahead of those auctions, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.65 percent and the five-year issue at a price to yield 5.88 percent.l
Municipal bond prices were up about a half-point yesterday. Since April tax-exempt securities had fallen on fears that changes in tax law could make them less attractive, but by now municipal bond yields have reached a percentage of benchmark Government bonds that investors find enticing, traders said.
About $3.2 billion of securities were sold yesterday, including $1.3 billion in short-term notes by Los Angeles County, and bond sales by Guam, the Puerto Rico Building Authority, Huntsville, Ala., and Sacramento County, Calif. The Los Angeles tax and revenue anticipation notes due July 2, 1996, and awarded to the Bank of America for sale, were repriced because of good investor demand, lowering yields about 10 basis points, to 3.75 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Corporate bond issuers continue to take advantage of the lower borrowing costs. Cox Communications, which is controlled by Cox Enterprises Inc., plans to price $800 million of debt today, with $300 million of five-year notes expected to yield 65 basis points more than the five-year Treasury; $300 million of 10-year notes expected at about 85 basis points more than the 10-year Treasury note, and $200 million of 30-year bonds at a price to yield about 115 basis points more than the Government's long bond.

HEADLINE: House G.O.P. Moves to Cut Immigration

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
Congress today began an ambitious effort to rewrite American immigration policy as House Republicans offered legislation to reduce the numbers of aliens, legal and illegal alike, who settle in the United States.
The chief sponsor of the bill, Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, said at a news conference that generations of immigrants had contributed "work, creativity and vibrancy" to the nation. But, he said, it is time to "put the interests of America first: the interests of the American worker, the American taxpayer and the American family." 
 Mr. Smith is chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims. The ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, John Bryant of Texas, endorsed the bill, saying it would reduce the displacement of American workers by cheap labor from abroad.
Similar legislation to be taken up by the Senate has substantial backing there, and Mr. Smith predicted that the Clinton Administration would support much of his bill because it echoes a Federal advisory commission's recommendations, which President Clinton has generally endorsed. The commission, headed by former Representative Barbara Jordan of Texas, has called for substantial reductions in the number of legal immigrants allowed to enter the country.
Representative Anthony C. Beilenson, Democrat of California, said he would be a co-sponsor of Mr. Smith's bill. "The proposal stands a pretty good chance of passage and, I would hope, approval by the President," Mr. Beilenson said.
The major provisions of the bill are these:
*Legal immigration would be reduced by about a third, to 535,000 people a year.
*The number of refugees, those admitted into the country because of a well-founded fear of persecution in their homelands, would be cut by half, to 50,000 a year.
*A new requirement would be imposed on employers to verify that job applicants are eligible to work in the United States: employers would have to call the Government to check the authenticity of applicants' Social Security numbers. But the bill would not create a national identification card, a proposal advanced from time to time for more than a decade as a way of verifying employment eligibility.
*The strength of the Border Patrol would be doubled, to 10,000 agents.
*A barrier along a 14-mile stretch of the Mexican border near San Diego would be bolstered with the construction of two fences, in addition to the one that already exists there.
*Any foreigner who illegally entered the United States could be fined a sum ranging from $50 to $250.
*New procedures would speed the deportation of illegal aliens by keeping them from delaying their departure through numerous appeals.
The immigration issue cuts across party lines. Some Republicans, like Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, support Mr. Smith's approach. But others, like Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, oppose new restrictions on legal immigration, which they see as an engine of economic growth. And some Republicans, like Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dislike the idea of making employers check the immigration status of job applicants and punishing those who hire illegal aliens.
Representative Howard L. Berman, a California Democrat on the House immigration subcommittee, said legal and illegal immigration ought to be handled in separate bills. He said that he would support efforts to reduce illegal immigration but that Mr. Smith was using public concern about that problem to justify "an assault on legal immigration."
Charles Kamasaki, a vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic organization, said that "the bill won't do much to reduce illegal immigration" and that it "heightens a climate of suspicion around any person who looks or sounds foreign."
Under Mr. Smith's proposal, the yearly total of 535,000 legal immigrants would be divided this way: 330,000 close relatives of United States citizens and permanent resident aliens, 135,000 skilled workers and 70,000 people fleeing persecution or civil strife.
In addition, the bill would provide 50,000 visas a year for five years to reduce the current backlog of spouses and minor children of legal permanent residents. But it would eliminate longstanding visa preferences for siblings and adult children of United States citizens.

Telmex Gains in Attempt To Buy Cable-System Stake

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, June 21

 BODY:
In a decision that could threaten American plans to invest in Mexican telecommunications, Mexican Government regulators conditionally approved a deal late Tuesday in which Telmex, the national telephone monopoly, would buy a 49 percent stake in the cable television subsidiary of Televisa, Mexico's largest media company.
The $211 million sale would bring together two of Mexico's largest and most aggressive companies, and would present a formidable challenge for American companies like MCI, GTE and Sprint, which are planning to enter the Mexican telecommunications market when it opens to foreign investment next year. 
 The American companies and their Mexican partners had made clear their opposition to the alliance in documents presented to the National Competition Commission, which announced its ruling in favor of the proposed sale Tuesday night.
In a letter to the commission, GTE and its Mexican partner, Bancomer S.A., said the new venture would create a new, Government-sanctioned monopoly that would dominate the Mexican communications market.
"Such combination would result in monopolistic control over the Mexican telecommunications market," the companies wrote in a letter to the commission dated June 16. "We are not opposed to the combination of telephones and cable services, per se, but we do oppose this unprecedented and plainly uncompetitive alliance of dominant players."
The alliance between Grupo Iusacell and Bell Atlantic also objected to the sale, contending it violated the terms under which Telmex, or Telefonos de Mexico, was privatized in 1990. They contend that Telmex is restricted from offering any type of television service. The commission ruled that Telmex was restricted only from involvement in broadcast television, not from pay TV.
Under the proposed sale, Telmex would acquire 49 percent of Televisa's cable subsidiary, Cablevision. At present the cable company's franchise is limited to Mexico City, where it is the largest nonbroadcast television service, with about 210,000 subscribers.
Contrary to optimistic early projections, cable television in Mexico has grown slowly, mainly because prices for services are beyond the reach of most Mexican families. When the Mexican economy slowed during 1994, Cablevision lost 17,000 subscribers. The company has not yet reported how the devaluation of the peso has affected its subscriber base.
For Televisa, which dominates the Mexican television market and produces films and soap operas that are seen around the world, the cable subsidiary has been disappointing. Its sales have never reached expected levels and collections have always been difficult to make.
Financial analysts said Televisa would be helped by Telmex's established distribution network and payment collections systems. Telmex has talked about offering many new services, including home video, through its local and long-distance telephone lines.
Marla S. Marron, an analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York, said that the venture also had strategic benefits for both Mexican companies because Telmex always saw Televisa as a potential competitor in the telephone business.
"What better way to pre-empt someone from coming into your market independently than by joining with them," she said.
Adding cable services would enable Telmex to increase productivity. Demand for new lines has started to level off and, because of political pressure and the strength of its union, Telmex cannot easily trim its work force.
When Telmex announced the proposed sale last November, the Federal Competition Commission, which was established in 1993 to insure open competition in Mexico, dropped its usual secrecy and warned that such a deal would need the commission's approval. That was taken as a sign that the commission looked askance at any deal that brought together such large companies.
The former president of the commission, Santiago Levy Agazi, who took a hard line on monopolies and unfair competition by Mexico's large companies, left in December to become under secretary of finance. The commission's new president, Fernando Sanchez Ugarte, was reported to have been under extreme pressure to approve the sale.
The commission's approval of the sale is conditional, pending further review by the Communications Ministry. Cablevision also had to agree that if it ever decided to offer telephone services over its lines, it would extend access to other companies besides Telmex.

HEADLINE: Markets Divided in Reaction to Greenspan Remarks on Rates

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The financial markets, reflecting the studied ambiguity of remarks made in a speech on Tuesday night by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, seemed to be split yesterday over where Mr. Greenspan stands on interest rates.
Mr. Greenspan told an audience in New York that he was reluctant to cut short-term interest rates, but bond traders yesterday bid up fixed-income prices slightly on the theory that Mr. Greenspan meant to imply that he would support a rate cut. Stock traders, however, bid down equity prices slightly on the theory that he would oppose such a cut. 
 Despite the small price movements in stocks, trading volume was unusually heavy on the New York Stock Exchange, totaling 398.2 million shares. The volume was not far from the 400 million-plus shares traded on "double witching" days, when stock options expire and traders are forced to buy and sell large numbers of shares.
In the currency markets, where a Fed rate cut might have its largest impact, the dollar dropped moderately, but mainly because of new data showing a widening trade deficit and pessimism about trade talks between the United States and Japan.
After falling nearly 9 points, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.46 points, to 4,547.10. The broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 1 point, to 543.98.
The Nasdaq composite index, rich in the technology stocks that have led the stock market for months, dropped for the first time in eight sessions. The index fell 0.64 point, to 929.19.
Bond traders continued to factor in what they expect will be an aggressive cut in interest rates by the Fed, with the major fixed-income instruments of five years and less yielding below the Federal funds rate of 6 percent. Even the 10-year Treasury bond yesterday yielded only 0.11 percent above the Federal funds rate, the rate for interbank loans essentially set by the Fed.
The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped to 6.54 percent from 6.58 percent.
The dollar, meanwhile, dropped to 84.04 Japanese yen from 84.45 yen and to 1.3844 German marks from 1.3907 marks.
Currency traders seemed to pay little attention to Mr. Greenspan's speech, which was delivered around the time Asian markets began trading. But traders bid down the dollar when the Commerce Department reported an unexpectedly large surge of 16.2 percent in the April trade deficit. And the continuing intractability of talks between the United States and Japan on automobile trade sent the dollar down further, as the June 28 deadline for trade sanctions looms.
The real puzzle was Mr. Greenspan's speech. Bond traders paid attention to his remark that inflation was "very clearly easing." But stock analysts noted a new emphasis on international concerns -- in other words, currency traders abandoning the dollar -- as a factor in determining Fed interest-rate policy. Fed officials have typically said the domestic economy is the paramount concern of the central bank.
"Emerging as the No. 1 issue is the protection of the dollar," said Tracy Herrick, chief investment strategist for Jefferies & Company. He noted that big banks in New York, which have some influence with the Fed, wanted a stronger dollar.
And inflation, while tame for now, has not gone away, said Edward G. Riley, chief investment strategist for the Bank of Boston, which manages $14 billion in stocks and bonds. He estimated that inflation would reach 3.5 percent by September, compared with 2.6 percent last year.
"The bond market has overreacted to economic data" and has not taken into account that the Fed will keep rates the same because of rising inflation, Mr. Riley said. He is therefore recommending to clients that they sell a small portion of their stock holdings and show some caution about buying more because stocks cannot stay at these lofty price levels.
"Trees don't grow to the sky," he said.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.15 point, to 291.61, with advancing stocks outnumbering decliners, 1,175 to 1,064. The American Stock Exchange composite index rose fell 1.01 points, to 494.07.
The most active stock, at 16.2 million shares, was XCL, an oil and gas exploration company based in Louisiana, which rose 5/16 , to 1. The company has a history of volatility and traded as high as 47/16 in December 1989. Yesterday, Dan Dorfman on the cable channel CNBC quoted Alan Gaines of Gaines Berland Inc. as saying XCL's China operations could yield 500 million barrels of reserves.

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Swells to Record; Japanese Auto Imports Cited

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit widened substantially in April to a record $11.37 billion, the Commerce Department reported today, as stockpiling in America of Japanese cars contributed to a new peak for imports.
The surprisingly big gap by which American imports of foreign goods and services exceeded sales abroad prompted analysts to further pare estimates of second-quarter economic performance, which was already thought likely to be barely positive. 
 The jump in car imports from Japan appeared to reflect a scramble by that country to rush vehicles into the United States at a time when American sanctions were under consideration but not yet announced. The new evidence of that stockpiling could intensify pressure on the Clinton Administration not to yield ground in its campaign to force Japan to buy more vehicles and parts from the United States.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said the latest figures "substantiate our concern" with a protected Japanese market and pledged to "pursue our policy regardless." to pry it open.
The two countries begin talks in Geneva on Thursday. Their failure could lead to the imposition of prohibitive 100 percent tariffs against 13 Japanese luxury models next week.
Mr. Kantor, in a telephone interview with several reporters, said he could not say what effect such sanctions would have on the trade deficit nor had he any direct knowledge whether Japan was drawing up lists of American products against which it might impose retaliatory sanctions.
He said no official in Japan had mentioned retaliation, "privately or publicly."
In a separate but related report, the Commerce Department said this country's broadest trade gauge -- the current account -- narrowed to $40.5 billion in the January-March quarter from the record $43.3 billion in the final three months of 1994.
The current account includes investment flows and foreign aid in addition to international transactions in merchandise and services.
The trade report for April showed a 9.5 percent jump from March, to $2.44 billion, in imports of new cars from Japan. But Mr. Kantor and private analysts were cautious in attributing this to Japanese efforts to beat possible sanctions, in large part because, unlike the aggregate figures, those for trade balances between individual countries are not adjusted for seasonal variation.
Still, the fact that imports of Japanese cars dropped 11.4 percent in April 1994 suggests that at least part of this year's surge reflected an effort to beat sanctions.
"Some of it was associated with the expectation of trade friction, but how much you can't say," said Michael P. Niemira, an economist at the Mitsubishi Bank in New York. He noted that the overall United States automotive deficit was $6.1 billion, compared with $4.7 billion in April 1994.
When the United States announced its tariffs on May 16, it said the levy would apply to all cars shipped beginning May 20. The Japanese seem to have anticipated that there would be much less leeway than usual in such situations and moved when sanctions were mere speculation. Another such surge could be disclosed when figures for May are published July 18.
Auto imports from Germany, home of Mercedes and BMW, which could substitute for Japanese luxury cars here, also rose last month.
For all products, however, the American deficit with Japan eased somewhat, to $5.9 billion, from $6.1 billion in March, the report also showed. Japan remained the country with which the United States has the biggest deficit. Next comes China, and the deficit with that country climbed $400 million in April, to $2.2 billion.
Over all, the United States raised imports 1 percent in April, to a new peak of $75.45 billion, despite slackened domestic growth. Much of this, analysts believe, went into inventory, implying reduced demand for foreign goods in coming months.
Exports, meanwhile, fell 1.3 percent, to $64 billion, as sales to Mexico continued to plunge in the wake of that country's economic crisis and related peso devaluation. Imports also dropped, resulting in a $200 million contraction of the American deficit, to $1.5 billion.
The $11.4 billion American deficit for April compared with $9.8 billion for March, with the latter figure revised from the $9.1 billion that the department initially reported.
Although the deficit is now running at an annual rate of $124 billion, about 17 percent higher than the 1994 total, many analysts believe the gap will not widen much further.
"The deficit should stabilize in coming months as the U.S. inventory correction stems the increase in imports," said Rosanne M. Cahn, an economist at CS First Boston.
For merchandise alone -- without benefit of a $5.1 billion surplus in services -- the deficit swelled to $16.5 billion in April from $14.7 billion in March, today's report also showed.
The nation's bill for imported oil eased to $4.5 billion as lower volumes offset a price increase of 95 cents a barrel to the highest monthly level since November 1992. Oil and autos combined to account for about 93 percent of the total deficit.

HEADLINE: B-2 Bombers Won't Feed the Hungry

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "The Planes the Generals Don't Want" (editorial, June 18): The House attempt to give the Pentagon more B-2 bombers than it asked for is "depressing" indeed. 
 It is infuriating too, for two common-sense reasons: First, this is the Congress that wants to cut out a President's program for putting young people to work in community service. Its leaders ridicule "make-work" and job subsidies for the underemployed.
What is defense spending, over and above defense needs, but a job subsidy -- expensive welfare -- for the already fully employed?
Second, and more infuriating here, is a fact as clear now as it was to Eisenhower in his famous speech on his departure from office in 1961: You can't feed hungry people with B-2 bombers, or provide taxpayers the things we like most from government: public safety, parks, bridges, Social Security for the old and food for poor children. Billions for all that; but not one cent beyond necessity for weapons that have, as their best use, their nonuse!
Buying weapons that not even the experts say we need is immoral. It is also economic folly; anyone who doubts that should look at the Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls as Concerns Mount About U.S.-Japan Auto Dispute

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the Japanese yen and other leading currencies yesterday as concerns grew over a possible trade war between the United States and Japan, which could further weaken the dollar.
The dollar was also hurt by speculation that the Federal Reserve would soon cut interest rates despite remarks made Tuesday night by the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, that he would be reluctant to do so. 
 Driving the decline in the dollar yesterday, currency traders said, were mounting expectations that Tokyo and Washington would not be able to reach an 11th-hour accord on automotive trade before the United States imposes 100 percent tariffs on imports of Japanese luxury cars.
Japanese and American negotiators will meet today and tomorrow in Geneva to try to reach agreement on improving access to Japanese markets for American cars and car parts. The Clinton Administration has said it will impose punitive tariffs on the luxury cars on June 28 if no accord is reached by then.
"My sense is the closer we get to the June 28 deadline, the less likely it is the Administration will be able to put together a compromise," said Wayne Grigull, director of foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch in New York. "It looks like we're headed for a trade war, which on balance is pretty negative for the dollar."
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 84.04 Japanese yen from 84.45 yen on Tuesday. The dollar fell to 1.3844 German marks from 1.3907 marks. The British pound rose to $1.6074 from $1.6058.
Contributing to the dollar's weakness was a report showing a surprise widening in the United States trade deficit in April, traders said. The trade gap hurts the dollar because it leaves foreign exporters with dollars to sell when bringing revenue home.
The United States trade deficit with the rest of the world widened 16.2 percent, to $11.374 billion in April, the largest monthly shortfall since the Commerce Department began combining figures for trade in goods and services three years ago.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Faithful Don't Endorse Nafta

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Who's an Isolationist?" (Op-Ed, June 6): Bob Dole, in his paean to internationalism, toasts Republicans as the party of the "North American Free Trade Agreement, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and most-favored-nation treatment for China." While my old friend may indeed speak for the Senate grandees, he does not speak for the populist rank and file. 
 Eighteen months after approval of Nafta, America's trade surplus with Mexico has evaporated, a $15 billion trade deficit has opened up, and hundreds of thousands of United States jobs are going south. Our $700 million Florida winter tomato industry has been ravaged, illegal immigration is up, and United States taxpayers have been put on the hook for $50 billion to our bankrupt Mexican partner.
Thirty years of GATT agreements have led to the hollowing out of America's industrial heartland, the loss of millions of United States manufacturing jobs and the collapse of the dollar against the yen and the mark. From the world's greatest creditor nation, GATT has helped to make us the greatest debtor nation in history.
In the last 20 years the real income of American working men and women -- forced to compete with Mexican and Asian laborers who earn a tenth of their wages -- has fallen 20 percent. As America strides toward this New World Economic Order, its working people fall further behind.
Why should Republicans be proud that we treat Beijing in trade relations the same as we treat Britain? Brutalitarian and despotic, China's regime forces young women into abortions as late as the ninth month of pregnancy, sells missile technology to rogue regimes, and uses the $30 billion trade surplus it runs at our expense to conduct the greatest military buildup by an Asian power since Japan in the 1930's.
And before we Republicans extend NATO war guarantees to Eastern Europe, we ought to reflect long and hard. Such a momentous decision would commit future generations of America's young to go to war to defend frontiers hundreds of miles east of where Generals Eisenhower and Patton were forced to stop.
Perhaps Senators Dole and Alfonse M. D'Amato and Gov. George E. Pataki would open up that closed New York primary and let other Republican Presidential candidates air these issues in the global communications complex in New York.
After all, if Mr. Dole is willing to allow the despots of Beijing equal access to America's marketplace of goods, why would he deny fellow Republicans equal access to New York's marketplace of delegates and votes?

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
In Mexico-style crises, the I.M.F. could be a bankruptcy court.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
BETWEEN quarrels over Bosnia, leaders of the seven economic powers meeting at Halifax last weekend made some progress on coping with the next Mexico-style financial crisis. What they did not do was make the conceptual leap toward transforming the International Monetary Fund from a rich (and occasionally wise) uncle for the developing world into a global bankruptcy judge for nations in trouble.
What a pity. 
 Jeffrey Sachs, the director of the Harvard Institute for International Development and a sometime consultant to governments from Bolivia to Russia, was among the first to propose the idea. But among the big power leaders only the Canadians were enthusiastic, and all the Group of Seven agreed to do was study the proposition. No surprise there: radical change rarely occurs without a catalyst. But this is one area where the Group of Seven, if it were prepared to move faster, would find that a little advance planning goes a long way toward delivering a big payoff.
The Mexican debacle was a warning that sovereign borrowers live on a knife edge. For while the Mexican Government lacked the cash to redeem its debts, almost everyone agreed that it was not insolvent. Mexico had plenty of income from export earnings to service the interest on its dollar-denominated debt, but nonetheless lost the confidence of private lenders.
In the end the Clinton Administration scrounged the $50 billion that Mexico needed to roll over the debt and halt the flight of capital, but it was a near thing. Old-line Democrats in Congress turned their backs on the President, while the new Republican majority took the occasion to reaffirm that politics does not stop at the water's edge.
This explains the White House's support for the much more modest Halifax plan, which would help take the United States off the hook but not go as far as the bankruptcy approach. That idea is to give the I.M.F. greater authority to act as a lender-of-last-resort. And best of all, from the White House viewpoint, would be if Saudi Arabia, Scandinavia and other deep foreign pockets ponied up the cash for the new operation. But none of them are very enthusiastic, which is one reason, among others, why creating a kind of bankruptcy judge for the global economy could be a much better alternative.
Consider some basics. Chapter 11 bankruptcy, American-style, accomplishes three things for a corporation lacking the cash to pay its creditors.
First, the law creates a time-out during which creditors cannot force the debtors to liquidate assets at a fire sale. Second, it allows a bankrupt company to borrow funds on a priority basis to keep the business going. Third, it empowers the judge to impose a settlement when the business is healthy enough to operate but lacks the assets to pay the creditors 100 cents on the dollar.
Sovereign governments aren't corporations, Mr. Sachs acknowledges, but a distressed government shares many of the problems of a distressed corporation. Suppose the I.M.F. had the authority to suspend a country's obligations to service foreign debt. That would prevent, say, a creditor in New York from seizing the aircraft of its national airline, just as bankruptcy protection prevents a disorderly liquidation of corporate assets.
By the same token, if the I.M.F. had the authority to put new creditors at the head of the line, it would allow countries to borrow in private capital markets to meet vital needs. That alone would probably have ended Mexico's financial crisis.
After all, that's essentially what the Clinton Administration did, in an ad hoc fashion. The $50 billion line of credit is collateralized by Mexico's revenues from oil exports -- a claim that effectively supersedes the claims of Mexico's other creditors.
So why not formalize it?
Where governments are insolvent in the sense that they cannot realistically be asked to repay all their old debts, the I.M.F. could force creditors to settle. This would prevent the sort of debt gridlock that left much of the third world and its private creditors in limbo for much of the 1980's.
There are problems, of course. John Makin, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, is skeptical of the bankruptcy approach. "It would transform the I.M.F. into a legal institution," he says. Such a transformation might fit its charter, but that doesn't mean it would be easily accepted by private creditors with political muscle in their home countries. And with the I.M.F. caught between creditors and debtors, he expects it would only be able to force settlements if it also brought along money to "sweeten the pot."
Mr. Sachs acknowledges the I.M.F. would remain a creature of international politics that could not rule without collective consent. But he is convinced that a formal bankruptcy mechanism would be so superior to informal rescue operations that once in place it would win the needed support.
Turning the I.M.F. into a bankruptcy court "would take an act of imagination," Mr. Sachs argues. And like most big changes, he suggests, "it seems impossible until you try it."

HEADLINE: Budget Deficit for May Is Larger Than Expected

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
The Government today reported a larger-than-expected Federal budget deficit in May, suggesting that an economic slowdown was already hurting tax collections. Federal spending also surged.
The May deficit was $38.95 billion, the Treasury said, or 21.5 percent higher than the $32.06 billion shortfall in the corresponding month a year earlier. It also exceeded analysts' forecasts of about $37.3 billion. 
 The May figures were in sharp contrast to the $49.72 billion surplus in April, the largest monthly surplus on record. The surplus was attributable primarily to a surge in income tax payments flooding Federal coffers at the April 17 filing deadline. But a calendar quirk also contributed to the figure: Because April 1 fell on a Saturday, the Government mailed entitlement checks to retirees, veterans, and other beneficiaries in late March, swelling that month's deficit.
Looking ahead, a research report from Nationsbank Capital Markets Inc. in New York said, "Slower income growth is likely to hold back revenues for the next several quarters, as businesses cut back production and payrolls."
Through the first eight months of the 1995 fiscal year, the Federal deficit totaled $133.226 billion. For the fiscal year, the budget deficit is on target to total about $176 billion, according to a projection from the Congressional Budget Office. That would be less than a deficit of $203.3 billion in the 1994 fiscal year and the third consecutive yearly decline.
For the year starting on Oct. 1, however, the Congressional Budget Office sees the deficit rising to $207 billion.
While increased tax revenue helped the Treasury trim the budget deficit as the economy was expanding, the long-term trend is toward higher deficits, analysts said. Unless Federal spending is controlled, annual deficits are projected to widen by the early part of the 21st century to more than $300 billion.
In May, Government receipts totaled $90.405 billion, up from $83.541 billion in the month a year earlier -- though lower than income of $165.392 billion in April. Receipts include taxes, fees and other income. Expenses increased to $129.355 billion last month from $115.597 in May 1994.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Barclays to Acquire a Unit Of Wells Fargo and Nikko

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
After a courtship lasting several years, Barclays P.L.C. agreed yesterday to acquire Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Advisers for about $440 million.
Wells Fargo Nikko, a joint venture of the Wells Fargo Bank and the Nikko Securities Company of Japan, is the largest quantitative fund management business in the world. Quantitative fund management caters to pension funds and other big institutional investors. Wells Fargo Nikko, based in San Francisco, had about $171 billion under management at March 31, of which about $150 billion is invested in the United States. The company earned $45 million before taxes last year. 
 Barclays, Britain's biggest bank, said it would integrate its acquisition with its own BZW Asset Management company, creating one of the largest institutional money managers in the world, with about $256 billion under management, of which $205 billion would be held in quantitative funds.
Quantitative funds typically include index funds, which are investments tied to market indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, the Dow Jones industrial average, as well as so-called asset allocation funds where investments are made automatically according to a preordained strategy. It is a big-volume, lower-margin business.
The purchase by Barclays reflects the current fad among banks for building asset management businesses, which are seen as a source of stable earnings to balance volatility in other investment banking activities. Barclays BZW asset management unit is part of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the Barclays investment banking subisidiary.
Martin Taylor, the Barclays chief executive, said asset management "is a high-quality business in terms of earnings sustainability and growth potential," and "an area of considerable strategic interest" for his bank. Barclays says it also expects to benefit from economies of scale as it merges the two asset management businesses.
Wells Fargo, however, with its strict goals for return on equity, is not as sanguine about the prospects for the quantitative asset management business, which earns lower returns than more active asset management services. "Wells Fargo is getting out of a business they think isn't a high-return business," said Ronald I. Mandle, senior research analyst at Sanford Bernstein Associates.
David S. Berry, director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said the deal was "a nice gain for Wells Fargo," noting that the sale would add $100 million after taxes to the company's 1995 profits, while removing about $10 million of annual income.
The purchase also includes the Masterworks division of Wells Fargo Bank, one of the biggest providers of administration and investment services for 401(k) plans, defined contribution pension programs that offer investors tax advantages. Masterworks has $7 billion in assets and 180 clients, a Barclays official said.
Nikko Securities will retain its 50 percent stake in the Japanese operations of Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Advisers, with Barclays taking over Wells Fargo's 50 percent.
Subject to regulatory approval, Barclays expects to complete the acquisition before the end of this year.

HEADLINE: All Eyes Follow Her In Flea Markets

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SLESIN 

 BODY:
SHE'S the striking woman whom most people who have shopped at the flea markets in New England for nearly a decade know on sight: tall, imposing, wearing colorful tentlike chenille outfits with coordinated turbanlike hats, day-glo feather-covered totes and extravagant makeup.
She is Elaine Rush, an antiques dealer, and there is nothing understated about her. 
 As Ms. Rush makes the rounds from dawn to dusk at the huge outdoor flea markets in New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, she is usually pursued by photographers from the local newspapers while some people pause in their foraging to stare at her.
None of this is new or surprising to her.
"For the most part I get a good reaction," she said. "And over the years I've met a lot of wonderful people that I may never have met if they didn't approach me to find out either what I'm selling or what the act's about. The truth is, it's only me." She says she is tired of the attention given to what "is simply the way I am."
But Ms. Rush's eye and quirky taste for all the things that now come under the umbrella of antiques and collectibles have also drawn attention to her every move.
"I'm in the business of finding neat things and loving them," said Ms. Rush, who is always one of the first on the flea market field. "You can't expect to go to markets in the afternoon and find things, so I go everywhere and anywhere at 4 A.M." No wonder one of her mottoes is "Keep moving and don't stand still."
That could apply both to her antiques shopping and her homes. Ms. Rush seems to be always buying old houses, renovating them, filling them with antiques and often selling them as is. In the last couple of years, she has transported her personal collection of tramp art, shell art, wooden Indian clubs (she has hundreds), carved or stuffed toy animals (dogs and moose are favorites), black collectibles and other arcane folk and out-of-the ordinary objects that have caught her eye from Manhattan to New Preston, Conn., then Sharon, Conn., and recently to South Egremont, Mass., in the Berkshires.
Some things don't fit in when Ms. Rush gets them home. Sometimes these oversize pieces spend time on the porch or she resells them -- mostly to other dealers who have come to know her as a dependable source for fashionable and desirable finds. These days, Ms. Rush has a particularly fertile and welcome outlet for her shopping sprees: her Church Street Trading Company, which has two locations. One is in New Milford, Conn., the other in Great Barrington, Mass.
The shops, which sell clothing and furniture, are styled after old-fashioned general stores and are run by her husband, Robert Rush, with whom she shares this business and who says, according to his wife, that he never wants to move. But he does anyway. Ms. Rush said: "He always feels the next house will never be as nice. But he's wrong.
"He is the most incredibly supportive friend, but I like to have a certain independence to be able to run off and go buying on the road whenever I want. In this type of business, you have to be ready at all times to take off, whenever and wherever."
By all accounts, Ms. Rush has been adventuresome since she was a young girl in Montreal. Her father, Benjamin Fraid, a Russian immigrant, met her mother, Fay, when they were working in a men's store in Montreal. A few years later, her mother opened a small women's clothing store.
"She was the first woman in Canada to have a department store, and one wild chick," Ms. Rush said. "I'm down-scaled in comparison." Ms. Rush started working at Fraid's when she was 13. What she liked was traveling to New York and Europe as a buyer. "Montreal was great," she said, "but there was no freedom. You felt so stifled."
In 1970, she moved to New York. "I just thought it was the most exciting place and wanted to meet everyone who was from another place," she said. She left behind her family's "fabulous house with all the desperately stylish and expensive stuff from the late 40's, 50's and 60's," she added.
A first job as a buyer at Bloomingdale's lasted three weeks. "That's when I decided I should be self-employed," she said. Traveling back and forth to Canada through the Adirondacks and the Berkshires, Ms. Rush started buying. "I like things that talk to your soul," she said, "like tramp and Adirondack stuff." She was one of the first to appreciate the rustic, quirky pieces, buying the things she saw and liked, by instinct, especially the items that had not yet become mainstream. "Back then, I didn't know hot from cool," she added. "But you know when you meet it."
She soon became obsessed. "I was chasing the stuff everywhere," she said. "I had never been exposed to old things before. You never saw two of them alike. That's how I got me into folk art. Talk about an addictive personality."
"I was always the odd bird," Ms. Rush continued. But she also seemed to have a practical side. In the late 1980's when, Ms. Rush said, "the recession hit" and her dry-cleaning bills were "over the top," she discovered chenille fabric and started buying every chenille bedspread she could find. Today, chenille forms the basis of her wardrobe. She had the chenille bedspreads made into the versatile coat dresses for which she is known. She has more than 200 outfits, in winter and summer weights.
"I used to pay $15, $20, maybe $25 for the good ones," she said. "Now, they're upward of $250." She calls them her "recession clothes." "They go in the washing machine, and if they're creased you just put them in the dryer and you have the fluffiest, most gorgeous outfit you've ever seen."
But they don't last forever. "They're made from old fabrics, and after going through the dryer 350 times, they sort of wear out and get frayed," she said. "Replenishing my supply is getting harder and harder, almost impossible, like finding good tramp art, unless you win the lottery."

HEADLINE: A TRAIL OF MURDER: THE OVERVIEW;
Ex-Convict's Murder Odyssey: 7 People are slain in 2 States

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
In five days of cold-blooded mayhem, an ex-convict from Atlantic City killed seven people and injured three others, two critically, before being shot and killed yesterday morning by the police under a highway bridge in Nutley, N.J., the authorities said.
In a meandering odyssey through New Jersey and New York, Darnell Collins, 33 years old, who was on parole, killed three people on Saturday in New Jersey, three more on Tuesday in the Chelsea section of Manhattan and a seventh early yesterday in Harlem, officials said. 
 Mr. Collins's own end came at the culmination of a half-hour high-speed car chase and foot race through suburban yards. As groggy commuters were heading to work, the killer fell in a furious shootout with more than a dozen police officers beneath a bridge fording a creek. "It was a quick ending to an extraordinarily violent episode," said the New York City Police Commissioner, William J. Bratton.
During his chilling rampage, Mr. Collins made his way from city to city, and in each one he left behind blood. His victims were acquaintances and strangers, united only in that they crossed Mr. Collins's path at the wrong time. They included Mr. Collins's ex-girlfriend and her mother, targets of robberies and innocent bystanders.
Mr. Collins, who also went by the name Mwanza Kamau, was born in New York and spent most of his life in New Jersey. The police and acquaintances depicted him as a drug user whose personality would turn diabolical when he was under the influence. Acquaintances said Mr. Collins was unemployed, and picked up money by buying decorative pictures in New York and reselling them on the streets of Atlantic City.
The police said he was arrested six or seven times in New Jersey. In 1984, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for armed robbery and burglary. After 10 years, he was released on parole on Jan. 11, 1994.
Last September, he was arrested for violating parole after testing positive for drug use and spent two weeks in the Atlantic County jail, according to the New Jersey Department of Corrections. But officials decided not to revoke his parole.
Law-enforcement authorities said they believed that a domestic squabble first ignited Mr. Collins's fury. But it also appeared that Mr. Collins was on drugs during much of the crime spree. One of his victims was a man who the police said was a drug dealer. Another victim, a woman who survived, told the police that she had smoked crack with him on Tuesday night.
What is clear is that beginning on Saturday afternoon, Darnell Collins seemed to want to kill nearly everyone he met.
From evidence they have collected so far, the police and prosecutors offered this rendering of Mr. Collins's five days of carnage and the events leading up to it:
About a year ago, Mr. Collins began dating April Gates, a 30-year-old blackjack dealer at the Trump Castle Casino Resort who lived with her young son at her mother's house in Atlantic City. The couple broke up about six months ago.
But Mr. Collins stalked her. Earlier this month, she sought a temporary restraining order barring Mr. Collins from any contact with her. It became final last Thursday. On Friday, when he showed up at her house, Ms. Gates went to the police, and a warrant was issued for his arrest.
Shortly before 3 A.M. Saturday, Mr. Collins rode a bicycle to Ms. Gates's home on North Virginia Avenue. She was not there. Her mother, Shirley Gates, 51, opened the door.
Mr. Collins tied up the mother and shot her once above the ear and once below with a .22-caliber six-shot Smith & Wesson revolver. It is unclear how he got the gun, but a friend of the family said it belonged to Mrs. Gates. After killing her, he took her van and drove three blocks to Maryland Avenue to the house of Alicia Chappell, a friend of April Gates. A birthday party was in full swing.
Mr. Collins walked in. Ms. Gates was sitting down. When she saw him, she called out his name. He shot her once near her ear. She stood, and he shot her twice more in the stomach. He shouted, "Why'd you tell?" But she was dead.
Ms. Chappell said that Mr. Collins was enraged at Ms. Gates for reporting him for violating the restraining order.
Mark Cotton, 23, a barber who said he saw the killing, said that Mr. Collins had threatened Ms. Gates before with a gun and broken her car windows. He said that Mr. Collins told Ms. Chappell earlier that day that he would kill Ms. Gates within three days for reporting him.
"He just started losing it," Mr. Cotton said. "He was always doing drugs -- cocaine -- and he was real abusive when he was doing it." Mr. Cotton said Mr. Collins often bragged about a violent streak, including stabbing to death a fellow inmate in the shower with a sharpened toothbrush -- a tale prison officials said was untrue.
Slipping into Ms. Gates's gold Saturn, Mr. Collins drove about 30 miles west to Williamstown and stopped at the Star Motel on Black Horse Pike.
For the last week, William Dawson, whom the police identified as a 41-year-old drug dealer, had been living in Room 7 with a 27-year-old woman named Stacey Smith and her 4-year-old son. The police said that Mr. Collins's name was in Mr. Dawson's address book.
Mr. Collins burst into Mr. Dawson's room. He shot Mr. Dawson to death with a bullet in the chest, and shot Ms. Smith in the neck, critically wounding her. She was in intensive care at Cooper Hospital-University Medical Center in Camden. Drugs were found in the motel room, the police said.
Abandoning Ms. Gates' car, Mr. Collins drove off in Mr. Dawson's rented 1995 Geo Prizm.
The next sighting came at 2 P.M. Sunday. Detective Robert M. Saunders of the Haddon Township police gave this account:
Mr. Collins pulled into a Shell gas station on Route 130 and Nicholson Road. He was wearing a white T-shirt and shorts, and had on a sun visor. After he got $10 worth of gas, he went into the minimart section of the station and picked out a bottle of orange juice, some chips and a Chunky candy bar.
When he put the items on the counter, he pulled his revolver from beneath his T-shirt, stuck it against the attendant, Badri Awsi, 60, and demanded money.
"He said, 'Give me your money,' " Mr. Awsi said. "I had 80 or a hundred dollars in my pocket. I gave that to him. He pushed me with his gun in my back. Then I said, 'No money in the cash register.' I pushed his gun, and he hit me in my head and my face."
Mr. Collins made off with a total of $854.
By then, police forces along the East Coast had been alerted. On Monday, the Geo Prizm Mr. Collins had been driving was discovered by the police further north in Camden. But there was no trace of Mr. Collins. New Jersey officials notified the New York police that he might be in New York City. They were asked to check his aunt's house in Harlem. He was not there. The apartments of a brother and sister in Harlem were also staked out, to no avail.
Mr. Collins surfaced again just before 2 P.M. Tuesday. Presumably indifferent to the hour and crowds, he approached an attendant at a parking lot at West 26th Street near the Avenue of the Americas and demanded money.
The attendant, Jose Gabriel Escarpetta, 38, apparently resisted the robbery. Mr. Collins put three bullets into his arm and shoulder, killing him. (Although police investigators on Tuesday said they were investigating whether the death of Mr. Escarpetta was connected to the drug-related killing of his brother last January, they said yesterday that it was clear that it was a robbery.)
After Mr. Escarpetta was killed, Mr. Collins fled on foot to a building at 138 West 25th Street. He went to the ninth floor and stepped into the elevator, where he encountered two men who worked in the building, Jeffrey Roork, 26, a computer graphics designer, and David Roth, 54, an architect. As the elevator descended, Mr. Collins shot both men in the head. Mr. Roork died instantly. Mr. Roth was pronounced dead yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center.
On the third floor, the elevator opened into a display advertising business. Several people gaped in terror at the site of two bleeding victims and a gunman standing over them. Brandishing his gun, Mr. Collins tried to yank a man into the elevator with him, but he resisted.
Getting off, Mr. Collins pointed his gun at the man and demanded, "How do I get out of here?" He was guided to the freight elevator. Alone, he took it to the ground floor and fled onto West 25th Street. The police said they believed that at the time Mr. Collins got off on the third floor, his gun was empty or else he would have shot his guide.
Mr. Collins's thirst for blood was not yet quenched. In the evening, he turned up at a garbage-strewn apartment that the police suspect is a crack house in a brownstone on East 126th Street in Harlem. About 10 P.M., he shot a woman in the apartment, Norma Acosta, once in the head. A woman who lives on the third floor of the building, who gave her name only as Tootsie, said Ms. Acosta banged on her door and yelled: "Help me! Help me!" Then, she said, the bleeding woman stumbled downstairs, banged into some garbage cans and left.
Ms. Acosta, 39, told the police she had met Mr. Collins on the street earlier in the day. They went to the apartment, where they ate dinner and then smoked crack. She told the police that Mr. Collins had "got paranoid" and shot her.
Less than an hour later, at 11:20, Mr. Collins was at 119th Street and Third Avenue. He happened on the Rev. Robert Gethers, 46, a pastor at the Canaan Land Christian Church of Christ, and Joseph Johnson, a deacon. They were in front of the church, and should have been long gone. But the engine in Mr. Gethers's balky car, a 1985 Chrysler LeBaron, would not turn over, and they had just finished jump-starting it.
Mr. Collins demanded their money. When Mr. Johnson said he had none, Mr. Collins asked three times for Mr. Gethers's wallet. "He said, 'Give me your money or I'll shoot you,' " the pastor said. "I just pulled it out and gave it to him." The wallet contained about $350, some credit cards and a phone card.
Mr. Gethers said that Mr. Collins hopped into the car and told him he would leave it several blocks uptown. "But then I saw the taillights keep going," he said.
At 2:45 A.M. yesterday, Mr. Collins hailed a livery driver at his taxi company on Amsterdam Avenue near 82d Street. A dispatcher said there was a dispute over the fare for a trip to 101st Street. The cab company wanted $6 and Mr. Collins felt $5 was enough. Finally, Mr. Collins gave in.
On the way uptown, Mr. Collins shot the driver, Emmanuel Malan, in the back of the head. His body was found at 177 East 101st Street. The police found Mr. Gethers's telephone card next to the body. Mr. Collins went off in Mr. Malan's white 1980 Oldsmobile Delta 88.
The last half-hour of Darnell Collins's life went quickly.
About 6:30 yesterday morning, a woman called the Newark police in the city's North Ward to report that three people with a gun were in front of her house on Broad Street, bothering a woman.
This time, it was Mr. Collins who was in the wrong place. According to the police, he was not with the three men with the gun. But he happened to be parked nearby.
When the police arrived, they spotted Mr. Collins in the white Oldsmobile. He hurriedly drove away, scraping one of the police cars.
The Newark police pursued Mr. Collins through the North Ward for 20 minutes. They lost him in Belleville, the next town to the north, but the Belleville police quickly picked up the scent.
Mr. Collins fired a shot through his rear window, striking the bumper of the trailing police car. Then he fired several more shots.
He sped north into Nutley, where the Nutley police joined the chase. Twice more, he fired at his pursuers.
Hurtling along Washington Avenue, he tried to turn onto Kingsland Street, near the Clifton border, and struck an embankment. He careered into the yard of a house at 147 Kingsland, before hurtling into the neighboring yard at 151 Kingsland, where the car settled on the sidewalk.
Mr. Collins leapt from his crumpled car and eluded officers as he weaved through well-kept yards. In a combat stance, he hunkered behind a retaining wall of a house. As officers approached, he stood and began firing. The police fired back.
Hearing a dog barking, Arlene Kraus peered out of her bathroom window to see Mr. Collins crouched in her neighbors' driveway. "He started shooting and the cops were shooting at him, and I'm screaming to my family to stay down," she said. "I was in horror."
No one was hit in that exchange, but the windows were shot out of the neighbors' Acura. Mr. Collins sprinted onto Walnut Street and desperately rammed his shoulder against the side door of a house. It did not yield. He turned and ran.
Soon, the police spotted him. At Washington Avenue and Memorial Drive, he fired two more shots. He missed. He darted through a park, then scampered down the bank of the Third River and beneath the Kingsland Street Bridge. He lay on his back in the shallow river and reloaded his gun.
As officers neared, Mr. Collins resumed shooting. But it was the officers' bullets that found their target.
Darnell Collins was pronounced dead at 10:13 A.M. at University Hospital in Newark. There were 14 gunshot wounds in his head, torso, legs and arms.

WHIRLPOOL WARNS OF LOW SECOND-QUARTER EARNINGS

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The Whirlpool Corporation said yeaterday that it expected its second-quarter earnings to be significantly lower because of slowed consumer spending, higher material and start-up costs and intense competition. The appliance maker, which is based in Benton Harbor, Mich., said it expected earnings of about 70 cents a share, compared with $1.10 a share, or $84 million, a year ago. But the company's chairman and chief executive, David R. Whitwam, said he expected earnings to rise in the second half of 1995. Whirlpool is the world's leading maker and marketer of major home appliances. It markets products under 10 leading brand names. The company's shares dropped $2.625, to $53.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.

 BODY:

Republicans Reach Deal on Budget
 Republican leaders in the House and Senate struck a deal to cut income and investment taxes by $245 billion over the next seven years, removing the biggest barrier to a compromise plan to balance the Federal budget. 
 Leaders said they were still separated by a few billion dollars on a handful of items, including spending for the military and for Federally subsidized student loans. Negotiators said they hoped to close those gaps by today, clearing the way for both chambers to approve the budget outline before the July 4 holiday. [Page A1.]
 
Bond Rally Sparks Another Stock Record
 The stock market rose sharply to record levels, mainly on the strength of an accelerating rally in a bond market convinced that the Federal Reserve is about to cut short-term interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 42.54 points, to 4,589.64, posting its 40th record close this year. [D6.]
 The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.47 percent as prices rose. [D16.]
 The dollar rose to 1.3981 German marks, helped by speculation that central banks might stage another round of dollar-buying to support the currency. The dollar also edged up to 84.54 Japanese yen. [D13.]
 
Wages Plunge 2.3%
 The Labor Department said that wages plunged 2.3 percent after adjusting for inflation during the 12 months through March, the largest drop in the eight years the agency has calculated the figures. [D4.]
 
WMS to Buy Bally Gaming
 WMS Industries reached an agreement to acquire Bally Gaming International in a $116 million stock swap. The price is lower than the original bid by WMS and well below an offer by Alliance Gaming earlier this week. [D5.]
 
Executives in Bond Probe
 Court documents filed in Miami show that the Fanjul brothers, leaders in Florida's $2 billion sugar industry and major contributors to the 1992 Clinton campaign there, are under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for possible violations of Federal laws barring political contributions by municipal bond underwriters. [D3.]
 
Caution Over Falling Yields
 Dividend yields have fallen to record lows, setting off a traditional warning that the stock market is overvalued. But bullish analysts say the figures underestimated the payout because they did not include stock repurchases. Hogwash, says an analyst from Salomon Brothers.
 Floyd Norris: Market Place. [D6.]
 
Sony Disk System Gets Lift
 In a sign that its own digital compact cassette audio system faces a troubled future, Matsushita Electric said it would sell the mini-disk system developed by Sony. [D5.]
 
Sprint Deal Finally Settled
 Sprint, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom announced their long-delayed, $4.2 billion global alliance. Analysts were pleased that it would be settled with one payment, instead of two. [D2.]
 
Is it the Left or the Right?
 If the United States goes ahead with its threatened 100 percent tariffs on Japanese luxury cars on June 28, auto makers in Japan are considering selling all those left-hand drive cars built for the United States at home. In Japan, however, the steering wheel is customarily on the right, something Japan has been lecturing Detroit about for years. [D6.]
 
Hill & Knowlton Forms Unit
 The increasing interest among mainstream advertisers in aiming sales pitches at homosexuals has led Hill & Knowlton to form a unit for marketing communications efforts to address gay men and lesbians.

HEADLINE: Americans' Real Wages Fell 2.3% in 12-Month Period

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22

 BODY:
Middle-class angst over falling wages, sometimes dismissed by economists as a matter of anecdote and not fact, received statistical support today as the Labor Department said that wages plunged 2.3 percent after adjusting for inflation during the 12 months through March.
The drop, while not the first, is the largest in the eight years that the Labor Department has calculated these figures. The decline occurred largely because the department revised upward its estimate of the number of people working in occupations with falling wages. By contrast, the department's quarterly figures, which have been showing wages flat during the last year after adjusting for inflation, assume that the distribution of people among occupations has not changed since 1989. 
 William Parks, a senior economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said today's figures more accurately reflected current wage trends.
Before adjusting for inflation, average wages and salaries for all civilian workers crept up by 6 cents an hour in March from the year earlier, to $13.12. But after adjusting for inflation, wages fell 30 cents an hour.
Bradford DeLong, who was deputy assistant secretary for policy analysis at the Treasury until last month and is an economic historian, said the drop might be the largest since the 1840's, when the introduction of power looms produced widespread unemployment and falling wages among weavers, who were then the largest group of industrial workers.
Democrats and Republicans both tried to portray today's figures as supporting their views of the economy. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said falling real wages at a time of rapid economic growth put "in a very different light" Republican efforts to cut taxes on investment gains and reduce tax credits for low-wage workers.
"The wage part of this is very sobering and it suggests a major shift from earned to unearned income, from paychecks to dividends and capital gains," Mr. Reich said in an interview.
Senator Connie Mack, the Florida Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, strongly disagreed. "The middle class is anxious but it's not because they want more government spending or they feel they're undertaxed," he said. "It's because Clintonomics has produced falling family incomes. Producing a real balanced budget and cutting taxes will stimulate growth and economically strengthen the American family."
Representative Christopher Cox of California, chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee, said the fall in average real wages might also reflect rising employment during the last year as new workers enter the work force through low-wage jobs. "If they're doing it at the minimum wage, congratulations and I hope they get a raise soon," he said in an interview today.
Mr. Parks said that while the data did not separate new workers, wages rose during previous years when the economy was growing and many new workers entered the work force.
Even before adjusting for inflation, overall compensation fell when benefits are included. The main reason is that companies and state and local governments spent less on providing health care benefits. Mr. Parks said it was unclear whether spending fell because fewer workers received health insurance; because employers chose less generous health care plans; because employers required higher deductibles, or some combination of these factors.
After adjusting for inflation, overall compensation per worker fell 3 percent during the 12 months through March, the Labor Department said.
This year's figures include substitute school teachers for the first time among the occupations for which employment costs are measured. But Alan Krueger, chief economist at the Labor Department, said their inclusion depressed wages and compensation very little.
The average hourly wage figures also include overtime pay. Americans are working less overtime this year than last year. But Mr. Parks said this did not appear to have a big effect on wages and salaries.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a nonpartisan agency, calculated the new wage figures without adjusting for inflation. The Labor Department, which is run by Mr. Reich and other Clinton Administration appointees, then made the adjustments using the Government's official figures for consumer price inflation.
The Commerce Department's worker compensation figures do not show a drop after adjustment for inflation. But these figures are scheduled for a broad recalculation late this year.

HEADLINE: Clinton Returns to Jersey To Begin Re-election Push

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: EDISON, N.J., June 22

 BODY:
He has barely a visible campaign apparatus yet and he says he wants to defer re-election politicking as long as he can. But demurrals aside, President Clinton all but officially opened his re-election campaign here today as he embarked on a mission to raise $3 million over the coming week.
Returning to New Jersey, a pivotal state in Presidential politics that gave Mr. Clinton a narrow victory in 1992, the President addressed his first major fund-raising event of the 1996 campaign tonight, urging Democrats to come to his side in what he said was a "debate of first principles" taking place in Washington. 
 "We ask you for your voice," Mr. Clinton told Democrats gathered for a $1,000-a-plate dinner at the Garden State Convention Center in Somerset, a dinner that party officials expected would raise $1 million. "We ask you for your labors. We ask you for your passion. We ask you for your heart. We are going to have to fight and debate and struggle to make sure that in this season we make the right decisions."
The President heatedly assailed the Senate defeat today of Dr. Henry Foster Jr. as Surgeon General as a vote against a woman's right to choose abortion. And he vowed to fight to keep a ban on assault weapons, referring to the narrow defeat of Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, in 1993, a defeat that some have partly attributed to his support of gun control.
"Jim Florio gave his governorship for it, and if I have to give up the White House for it, I'll do it," Mr. Clinton said to cheers. "It will be over my dead body if they do that."
Earlier, the President received a rousing welcome from auto workers at a Ford plant here as he vowed to make Japan open its markets to American automobiles and car parts, and stumped for his own budget plan and economic program.
"Every time you wonder what we're doing up there or you see a fight going on in Washington," Mr. Clinton said in an early preview of next year's campaign themes, "you just remember, my test is: 'Will it create jobs? Will it raise incomes? Will it make working people more secure if they're doing their part?' "
The fund-raising dinner was the first of three political appearances by the President that are expected to raise about $1 million each for the Clinton-Gore re-election treasury by next Thursday night. For the first time, White House officials said, Mr. Clinton's travel was being partly financed by his re-election committee.
In addition, the campaign finance operation, which opened its doors in mid-April, has been running a direct mail campaign that Mr. Clinton's national finance chairman, Terence McAuliffe, said had already been more successful than expected. The campaign will end its first quarter on June 30 with more than $8.5 million in contributions, he said, and with another $5 million in Federal matching funds.
The President will speak at another $1,000-a-plate homecoming fund-raising luncheon in Arkansas on Friday. And later next week, he is scheduled to travel to Illinois, another Presidential bellwether state, to raise $1 million in Chicago.
Mr. Clinton has repeatedly expressed a reluctance to be drawn into overt Presidential politicking so soon before 1996 -- although his appearance at Ford's Edison Assembly Plant, with his wife, Hillary, at his side, had all the trappings of a campaign event. The President and Mrs. Clinton donned black U.A.W. jackets in front of cheering auto workers, and then left as a sound system blared Bruce Springstein's "Born in the U.S.A."
It was a sympathetic audience for Mr. Clinton's stance against Japan's trade policies, with Earl Nail, an official of the United Automobile Workers union, telling the President to "get us more jobs."
Mr. Clinton's aides have not been coy about the fund-raising campaign, saying they learned a critical lesson about the importance of early money-raising from President George Bush, who did not start his 1991 push for campaign funds until months later in the year.
Mr. Clinton is only the latest entry in the race for campaign dollars. Among Republicans, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas has raised more than $13 million as of April, according to the Federal Election Commission, and had $8.4 million in cash on hand after expenses.
The Presidential campaign committee of Senator Bob Dole of Kansas had raised $4.4 million as of April and had about $2.5 million in cash on hand. And former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee had raised more than $5 million and had more than $3 million available to spend.
Although Mr. Clinton has not selected a campaign chairman and manager, a 20-member finance operation opened in mid-April. Mr. McAuliffe said the President's fund-raising strategy would proceed along two tracks, through large, $1 million fund-raising events and through direct-mail solicitations.
Mr. McAuliffe said Mr. Clinton was scheduled to appear at 10 major fund-raising events across the country, fewer than modern Presidents have done in the recent past, and would raise half of his campaign funds through direct-mail solicitations. "This President put the word down to me that he wanted this campaign funded by hundreds of thousands of small donors," he said.
With an eye toward the general election, when Presidential candidates benefit from efforts by the national and state parties, Mr. Clinton will also speak next Wednesday at a "Presidential Gala" sponsored by the Democratic National Committee. The party, which is charging $1,500 per person, is expecting to raise up to $2.7 million at the dinner.

HEADLINE: Big-Ticket Sales Take a Pounding;
Industries Supplying the Home Say a Slowdown Has Arrived

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: DALLAS, June 22

 BODY:
It may not look like a recession on Wall Street, where the markets have been booming, or to some inside the Federal Reserve, but for those selling big-ticket goods to homeowners, the downturn is here.
A combination of flagging home sales, weak income gains and growing fears of job losses have hammered demand for furniture, appliances and building materials. These industries were counting on families feathering new nests to sustain what until recently had been one of the few hot categories of consumer spending. 
 Even as business continues to pour money into becoming more efficient, consumers have been hunkering down for months. Workers' wages, adjusted for inflation, actually fell a record 2.3 percent in the 12 months through March. [Page D4]
Though unemployment remains relatively low, job losses are mounting again. This week, Home Depot, Whirlpool and Sunbeam, both appliance makers, and the furniture seller Ethan Allen Interiors all warned that business was considerably slower than they had expected. Maytag, another maker of home appliances, said that it had been forced to lay off hundreds of workers because of production cutbacks.
Over all, furniture orders were down nearly 12 percent in April from a year earlier, according to the industry's trade group. Maytag estimates that shipments of major appliances will be off 3.5 percent even though it predicts that sales should pick up toward the end of the year.
Although home mortgage rates have been falling all year, new home construction continues to languish. Single-family housing starts fell 4.4 percent in May, the fourth decline in five months and the lowest level in more than two years.
Roger Brinner, chief economist at Data Resources/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass., sees a growing split between the booming market for advanced technology and the slowdown in demand for consumer products, with home-oriented goods now joining apparel makers in a slump.
"When people ask, 'Are we in a recession or headed for one?' I say, 'It all depends on your industry.' "
You might call it the Regular-Joe recession. Business optimism and investment continue to expand even as average consumers grow more fearful. Commercial construction has strengthened even as home building has slackened. Corporations continue to invest at record rates in more advanced equipment, especially personal computers and other high-tech tools to trim labor costs. Yet retail sales have been flat for eight straight months and consumer spending at this stage of the business cycle is the weakest on record.
"Businesses are much more confident than their workers are," said Neal M. Soss of the Soss & Cotton economic consulting firm in New York. "They are investing to make the workers less secure."
Some of the most jittery workers might be at the furniture plants concentrated in North Carolina, the appliance factories in Tennessee and the carpet mills of Georgia. Cutbacks in industries related to housing have turned the South, which paced the nation's recovery from the last recession, into a region now growing as sluggishly as the rest of the nation. "We're slowing down more than the nation, to the nation's level," said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting center at Georgia State University in Atlanta.
Throughout the nation, the Government reported today, the number of Americans seeking jobless benefits for the first time climbed last week to the highest level in 17 months. More and more analysts are predicting that the Federal Reserve is leaning toward cutting short-term interest rates to help brake the slide.
Furniture and appliance makers throughout the nation are counting on recent declines in long-term interest rates to help revive the housing market and renew demand for their own products by the end of the year. In the meantime, they are trying to control costs by smarter management of production and inventories.
That's not much consolation right now, though. Roger Schipke, chief executive of the Sunbeam Corporation, of Providence, R.I., has seen consumers buying replacement parts for gas barbecue grills -- $30 burners and the like -- rather than plunging for new grills themselves, which average $150.
The lower demand for gas and charcoal grills, along with declines in sales of outdoor furniture, has caused Sunbeam to cut production at several factories around the nation. "A lot of people lost hours," Mr. Schipke said. "Those people won't be buying much."
Sunbeam said that its second-quarter earnings would be only half what the company had anticipated, and predicted that earnings for the year would fall far below those of 1994.
Sunbeam's sales of its small appliances like blenders, toasters and irons have remained healthy, but these don't depend on consumer willingness to commit to major purchases.
Appliance industry executives saw signs of their own downturn as early as March, when dealers started cutting back on orders as unsold goods piled up. The Maytag Corporation was one of several appliance makers that responded with layoffs. It sent home 100 people, or 20 percent of the work force, at its dishwasher plant in Jackson, Tenn., and laid off 130 workers at a washer and dryer plant in Newton, Iowa, where Maytag is based.
Home-oriented retailers are also feeling the pinch. Earlier this year, executives at Home Depot thought their do-it-yourself customers were holding back because of a stormy spring. But in recent days, as the sunshine returned, their shoppers did not.
"Home Depot is not experiencing an expected pickup in the tone of business," the company reluctantly said in a press release this week, acknowledging that its earnings were likely to fall at the low end of analysts' expectations.
Persuading customers to buy at Ethan Allen Interiors Inc., which makes and sells its own furniture, requires more patience and finesse than carving the finials on Chippendale highboys. When Farooq Kathwari, the chief executive, dropped into a store near the company's Danbury, Conn., headquarters this week, he heard sales people tell of wary customers who bought only after round after round of comparison shopping.
"They've got to work harder," Mr. Kathwari said of his sales help. "People are just cautious and careful about what they want to buy, especially for a major purchase like home furnishings."
The company said this week that a sales slowdown was likely to result in much lower profits during this quarter. The usual one-week summer shutdown at its 20 plants and 3 sawmills will be stretched to two weeks, Mr. Kathwari said.
Not every furniture company has seen a downturn. The La-Z-Boy Chair Company reported steady demand for its amply upholstered products, propelled by strong sales of home electronics. The Hooker Furniture Corporation, an industry pacesetter, expects growth of 10 to 12 percent this year, but the company grew more than twice as rapidly last year.
Even Hooker itself acknowledged that it was an exception. The Federal Reserve, in its region-by-region survey released this week, found that businesses were buying more eagerly than consumers. A maker of automation equipment for industry had a "backlog of Biblical proportions," the Fed said, while carpet, furniture and bedding makers, especially in the Southeast, were cutting back.
Not all economists see a long-term shift in consumers' habits. Mr. Brinner said their current parsimony, prompted by the rise in interest rates all last year, is part of a normal economic cycle. Lower rates, he said, should turn the cycle around by the end of this year, once consumers resume buying homes and decorating them.
But other economists hear the clank and grind of expectations being ratcheted down. Andrew C. Krikelas, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, suspects that slow sales of housing and related goods derive from the same anxiety about job security that causes workers to be grateful even for cost of living increases. "People are happy with the fact that they have a job and are not going to push it," he said.
Even if it means having to push the old grill, sofa or refrigerator to last one more year.

HEADLINE: Base-Closings Panel Spares New York Laboratory but Cuts 2 Huge Air Force Depots

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22

 BODY:
In a strong rebuke to the Air Force, a Presidential commission voted today to keep open a high-tech military laboratory in upstate New York that the Air Force had wanted to close, and to shutter two huge maintenance depots in California and Texas that it had wanted to keep open.
The commissioners decided to save Rome Laboratory in Oneida County, N.Y., which employs more than 1,000 civilians. They also set aside Air Force recommendations on the two maintenance depots, effectively closing McClellan Air Force Base near Sacramento, Calif., and Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, each of which stands to lose more than 10,000 civilian jobs. 
 As members of Congress looked on, the commissioners said closing the two maintenance depots -- political sacred cows because of the number of civilians they employ -- would save more money faster than the course recommended by the Air Force, which would have kept open Kelly, McClellan and three other depots but shrunk all of them slightly.
"For California, it is just a major hit," said one of the state's senators, Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat. She vowed to lobby President Clinton to reject the recommendation.
The decisions came as the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission began deliberations on the fourth and final round of base closings since the cold war ended in the late 1980's. By Saturday, when it is expected to complete its work, the eight-member commission will have shut down, scaled back or spared more than 150 military installations, many of them the linchpins of their local economies.
The commission, headed by former Senator Alan Dixon of Illinois, served notice today that it did not feel completely constrained by the recommendations the Pentagon had presented last winter. They voted unanimously to reject the plan to close Rome Lab, which develops sophisticated communications equipment. The Air Force had wanted to relocate to bases in Massachusetts and New Jersey.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican, and other New York elected officials had raised serious doubts about how long it would take the Pentagon to recoup the costs of relocating the laboratory's functions, protesting to the commission that the Air Force had given three different estimates over the last seven months. In October, the Air Force estimated the payback period at more than 100 years; in February, it reduced that forecast to 4 years, and last month, it was changed again, to 6 years. Today, the commission disclosed its own estimate, 13 years, which it decided was too long to justify closing the lab.
After the vote, Mr. D'Amato accepted congratulatory bear hugs from Representative Sherwood Boehlert, a Republican in whose district the laboratory is located, and Mayor Joseph A. Griffo of Rome.
"I don't mean to be critical of those who are in the Air Force, but I think those at the top were manipulating the situation unfairly," Mr. D'Amato said. "It was a terrific victory. It reaffirms my faith in the system."
The President must approve or reject the commission's actions as an entire package, forwarding his decision to Congress by July 15. If Congress does not disapprove of the recommendations within 45 days, they become law. Given the immense pressure on the Government to scale back the Pentagon's operations, the panel's decisions are effectively the last word in the process.
Throughout the day today, the commission periodically edited the Pentagon's original list. Saying its role as a Navy trouble-shooter was too valuable, the commissioners voted to save Lakehurst Naval Warfare Center in southern New Jersey, whose 1,400 civilian employees would have lost their jobs under the Pentagon plan. The commission also softened the blow it dealt to Texas by removing from the list of Pentagon closings Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio and much of the Red River Army Depot in Texarkana -- retaining a total of about 4,500 jobs.
But as in the past, the commission accepted the lion's share of the Defense Department's recommendations. It supported the Pentagon's request to close Bergstrom Air Reserve Base in Texas, a loss of 585 civilian jobs, and the Naval Undersea Warfare Center in New London, Conn., a reduction of 622 civilian jobs.
The commission made its way through about 40 percent of the Pentagon's recommendations today. Among the major recommended closings to be reviewed on Friday are Long Beach Naval Shipyard in California and the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Me.
Secretary of Defense William J. Perry said he had tried in this year's round of closings to choose installations that offered relatively low closing costs and could yield fast paybacks. The Pentagon estimates that after it has paid to close and clean up the bases in this round -- as well as those targeted in prior rounds in 1988, 1991 and 1993 -- it will save $6 billion a year.
Unlike previous rounds in which established, high-profile bases like the naval shipyard in Charleston, S.C. were placed on the chopping block, this year's round featured an array of installations that, for the most part, provide less-noticeable support functions like maintenance, supplies and technological expertise.
But several are important economic engines in their communities, particularly the two Air Force depots in California and Texas that were effectively closed, and those in Utah, Georgia and Oklahoma that were spared and will inherit many of their functions. Although the commission virtually gutted Kelly Air Force Base, it did move several thousand of Kelly's jobs to an adjacent site in San Antonio, Lackland Air Force Base.
The Air Force had contended that it would take too long to recoup the costs of closing Kelly (nine years) and McClellan in California (seven years), and even longer to achieve savings if the other three depots were closed. The commission staff did its own calculations, however, and found that the payback period was no more than a year for Kelly and McClellan.

But in Tobyhanna, Pa., all was happiness, right, when workers learned that their Army depot had been spared. Denise Lynott, left, and Marty Stanzcak embraced. The base-closing commission held a hearing on Capitol Hill, center, in which it discussed its recommendations. (Photographs by The Associated Press)

HEADLINE: Dow Sets Another Record On Rate-Cut Expectations

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
After two days of treading water, the stock market rose sharply yesterday to record levels, mainly on the strength of an accelerating rally in a bond market convinced that the Federal Reserve is about to cut short-term interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average surged 42.54 points, to 4,589.64, posting its 40th record advance this year. 
 Goaded by fresh evidence that the economy was slowing -- this time, by a large jump in unemployment claims -- bond traders sent corporate borrowing costs plummeting, helping to lift prices in the leading stock indexes. Indeed, interest rates fell so far that at one brief point in the session long-term interest rates were less than short-term interest rates, a reversal of the usual notion of risk.
Trading in stocks was unusually heavy as a result, with 422 million shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, a level normally seen only on days when stock-related options expire and traders are forced to buy and sell shares.
Meanwhile, the value of the dollar, which would be hurt by an interest-rate cut, rose. Some analysts said the rise, in a thinly traded currency market, resulted in part from some traders moving to the sidelines in advance of the Fed's July 5 policy meeting at which Fed governors will debate a cut in rates.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index headed even higher on a percentage basis, 1.3 percent, compared with 0.94 percent for the Dow. The S.& P. rose 7.09 points, to a record 551.07. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite index gained 10.90 points, to 940.09, also a new high.
The stock market rally has dazzled analysts. So far this year, the Dow and the S.& P. 500 have each risen nearly 20 percent and the Nasdaq index more than 25 percent. The American Stock Exchange computer technology index, an index of 26 of the high-tech stocks that have largely led the market, has risen nearly 45 percent.
The initial spark for the bond rally and, an hour later, the stock rally was the Labor Department's report that weekly jobless claims hit a 17-month high last week. While these numbers are often volatile, they give clues to the more important monthly job-creation data, which is next scheduled for release on July 7. Many bond traders are betting that the job-creation data will be so weak that the Fed will authorize an interest-rate cut either before or shortly after the report.
Bond yields fell. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped to 6.47 percent from 6.54 percent. Briefly, the 10-year Treasury bond's yield fell to 5.995 percent, or less than 6 percent, the Federal funds rate for overnight loans between banks. It ended the day at 6.03 percent.
"Is the bond market overinterpreting the weekly jobless claims? Of course," said Neal M. Soss, co-founder of Soss & Cotton, an economic consulting firm. "But it's the only new information they have."
Moreover, how much the Fed cuts may prove to be as tricky as whether it should cut at all, some analysts say. David De Rosa, a director of foreign exchange trading for the Swiss Bank Corporation, said he doubted that the Fed would cut rates soon.
But if the Fed cuts a relatively small one-quarter of a percentage point, or 25 basis points, it may send the wrong signal to the financial markets. "The currency market will sell off and it'll be very bad," Mr. De Rosa said. "Twenty-five basis points will look like a political concession and that they really didn't want to do it. Twenty-five has the ugly connotation that the Fed may have compromised itself."
A cut of half a point, or 50 basis points, would look like a policy decision, he said, and may have the paradoxical outcome of prompting only a minor drop in the value of the dollar.
The dollar rose to 84.54 Japanese yen from 84.04 and to 1.3981 German marks from 1.3844 marks.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.32 points, to 294.93, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining issues by 1,536 to 745. The American Stock Exchange composite index climbed 1.90 points, to 495.97.
Among advancing stocks was UAL, parent of United Airlines, which jumped 5 5/8, to 141 1/8, after securities analysts said they expected earnings to be higher than previously estimated. International Paper rose 3 3/8, to 82 3/4, on speculation that the Fed would cut interest rates, thus lowering borrowing costs for the capital-intensive paper business.
Among declining stocks was Digi International, a telecommunications equipment company, which fell 4, to 21 3/4. After the market closed, Digi's management released a statement about its "unusual market activity" and said it was comfortable with meeting analysts' estimates for quarterly and full-year earnings.

HEADLINE: Mismanagement and Waste Erode U.N.'s Best Intentions

SERIES: The U.N. At 50

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 22

 BODY:
While the United Nations was trying to keep peace in Somalia last year, $3.9 million vanished from its headquarters in Mogadishu. The cash, lying inside a cabinet with a faulty lock, was stolen in what investigators believe was an inside job. A steel safe had been shipped in to store the money, but minus its combination.
The incident epitomizes some uncomfortable truths about the United Nations as it prepares to celebrate its 50th anniversary. It was in Somalia for the noble purposes of delivering food to starving people, which it did for a time, and restoring civic order, which it did not. 
 But this blatant lapse in office security and money handling reflected the mismanagement and waste that are all too typical of the sprawling collection of agencies, councils and commissions that the United Nations has become.
The ideals of cooperation for world peace that engendered its creation in 1945 still motivate inspectors to seek out illicit weapons in Iraq or North Korea, aid workers to struggle to feed two million Rwandan refugees and peacekeepers to endure humiliation and worse in Bosnia.
Out of the same idealism came specialized agencies like the World Health Organization, which leads the battle against AIDS in Africa, and the United Nations Children's Fund, which has reduced infant mortality in the third world.
Yet some officials of the United Nations and foreign diplomats serving there also describe, with exasperation, anger and regret, an organization grown rife with what a longtime official called "appalling inefficiencies and backbiting and corruption" -- tenacious cancers that have debilitated the world organization, demoralized its own staff and severely undercut its support in the United States and elsewhere.
Money is lavished on conferences that produce little but talk. Millions of words are printed in turgid reports on topics as arcane as the "colonial" status of American Samoa or Britain's Pitcairn Island (population: 65). Defense of the status quo perpetuates unneeded projects, while fraud has tarnished the luster of even some of the more successful aid operations.
 
A Vast Bureaucracy Looks Out for Itself
 "This bureaucracy was designed in hell," Australia's representative, Richard Butler, said in a recent interview broadcast over the Secretariat's in-house television channel. "Let's change it," Mr. Butler pleaded, adding: "It's going to be very tough. Some people don't want these changes. Some people have vested interests in the existing system."
The problems are not new, nor have they exactly been ignored. The newest of many attempts to revitalize the United Nations has brought aboard Joseph E. Connor, a retired chief executive officer of Price Waterhouse, as Under Secretary General for Administration and Management. Mr. Connor, who arrived 14 months ago, is cutting costs and staff.
And a German career diplomat, Karl Theodore Paschke, has been hired to look for waste and fraud as the new Under Secretary General for Internal Oversight Services, though with powers that stop short of an independent inspector general's. "The main deficiency of this organization is that it is poorly managed," he said.
The failings of the United Nations, which have undermined its credibility with both governments and private citizens, can be traced in part to micromanagement by the 185 member nations.
"The trouble with the bureaucracy is it's affected by a status quo problem that the governments impose," said Sir Brian Urquhart, a former Under Secretary General who served 41 years in the United Nations from its inception in 1945.
The United Nations, its proponents say, is only the sum of its members who pass the resolutions and set the rules. The problems start with the personnel who staff the organization: From the Secretary General on down, many officials are picked not for their administrative talent but to satisfy demands for geographical diversity, often made by countries that use these appointments mainly as political rewards.
Madeleine K. Albright, the United States chief delegate to the United Nations, likened it in a recent speech to "a business with 185 members of the board; all of them with strong and contradictory opinions, coming from every conceivable culture, speaking every conceivable language -- and each with a brother-in-law who is unemployed."
But the United Nations' weaknesses can also be attributed to an unwieldy bureaucracy preoccupied with its own welfare. The United Nations is so short of financial auditors that its departments and agencies are audited only every six years on average. Yet the same strapped Secretariat requested $150,000 in the current working budget to hire consultants on "ways of securing public support for activities related to the 50th anniversary."
The Secretariat, the central United Nations office in New York working directly under the Secretary General, has been run so haphazardly, several officials say, that it could not quite say how many employees it had or match them to jobs until a computer system was finally introduced two years ago. When the payroll was computerized last year, there was no record of valid appointments for more than 1,500 of some 7,000 Secretariat employees.
 
Programs Are Born But They Never Die
 Over the years, the United Nations has accumulated programs that overlap or were devised for an earlier era, but are rarely closed down. Resolutions by member countries spawned much of the duplication, resulting, by one analyst's count, in 29 United Nations agencies and other departments with food and agriculture programs alone.
The damage that weak management can do to good intentions was illustrated last month when the United Nations Children's Fund, one of the most respected agencies, disclosed that its Kenya operation had lost as much as $10 million to fraud and mismanagement by employees there.
Though outright theft is the exception, some officials say slack financial oversight has become commonplace. One described a crime-prevention institute in Uganda so wasteful that United Nations Development Program officials recommended it no longer be financed. After several African governments complained, the institute was promised another $500,000.
The system has taken on the worst attributes of a rigid civil service, designed more to protect employees than foster efficiency. Department supervisors say they can get rid of bad employees only by persuading another department to take them. One manager said that he could lose 15 percent of his staff without affecting its output.
Office politics at the United Nations are worsened by national jealousies and rivalries that leave competent employees "angry and bitter," as one manager put it. .
"Dedicated staff have learned that it is unwise to criticize malpractice or incompetence because they have no reliable protection from managerial cliques," said a study published last year by a veteran civil servant, Erskin Childers, with Sir Brian Urquhart.
A hot line has been set up for what Mr. Paschke called "information and hints and complaints and accusations for things we ought to be investigating." Some employees worry that what they report will not be kept confidential.
Mr. Paschke accepts anonymous complaints but does not encourage them. "Where I come from," he said, "you would not take seriously anonymous whistle-blowers."
 
Members' Rivalries Undercut Efficiency
 Fiefs have sprung up in hidden crannies of the United Nations. For two decades, Conrad S. M. Mselle, a Tanzanian, has been chairman of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, which reviews budget costs for the General Assembly. No outsider can explain how decisions get made because Mr. Mselle, who has no formal training in finance, convenes committee meetings behind closed doors.
"This is not nuclear science, this is financial stuff," a diplomat said. "There's no reason for it to operate in secrecy."
Mr. Mselle made another rule that no one in his office can be reassigned without his consent, a colleague said. This covers his companion, Mary Elizabeth Browne, whom the United Nation pays over $60,000 to work for him. Mr. Mselle earns more than $134,000 in salary and allowances.
Several attempts to reach Mr. Mselle were unsuccessful; his office first said he was traveling and later failed to respond to other phone calls.
Some of the funds appropriated for worthwhile programs are nibbled away by seemingly modest political add-ons that, together, swell into hundreds of thousands of dollars, as the current $2.62 billion United Nations budget confirms.
Nearly $497,000 earmarked for a two-week conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States in Barbados last year included $15,000 to fly in representatives of a "national liberation movement" recognized by the Organization of African Unity. In fact the movement was Polisario from Western Sahara, a desert region conspicuously short of small islands.
Another $53,000 was requested in the 1994-1995 budget to pay consultants for "in-depth research" on apartheid, which disappeared with the election of a black majority government in South Africa in April 1994. The United Nations Special Committee on Apartheid disappeared nearly a year later.
Mr. Connor indicated that he would crack down on the overuse of consultants. "We've taken some very significant reductions in the next budget," he said.
Many consultants are former United Nations employees who in theory cannot be paid more than $12,000 a year as experts, but circumvent this ceiling by calling themselves "generalists." A Unicef report last year confirmed that its consultants included "retirees who preferred to be hired as consultants in addition to obtaining their normal pensions."
Critics contend that true reform should include pruning the United Nations of its obsolete appendages. The Trusteeship Council, for example, which was set up in 1945 to supervise the administration of territories entrusted to the United Nations, has had nothing to do since Palau, a tiny Pacific island chain, became independent last Dec. 15.
But almost no one talks of abolishing the Trusteeship Council, though other duties have been found for its staff. Doing so would require a revision of the United Nations Charter, which could open it to proposals for amendments by some countries that others do not want, like eliminating the vetoes that the United States, Russia, Britain, France and China wield over the Security Council.

HEADLINE: First-Time Jobless Claims Climb To Highest Level in 17 Months

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22

 BODY:
The number of Americans seeking jobless benefits for the first time increased last week to the highest level in 17 months, and the closely watched average of recent claims rose to a two-and-a-half-year high, the Government said today.
Initial claims for state unemployment pay increased by 20,000, to a seasonally adjusted 395,000, in the week ended June 17, the Labor Department said. That was the highest level since the 401,000 claims reported for the week ended Jan. 29, 1994. 
 The closely tracked four-week moving average, viewed as a more reliable gauge of labor market conditions than the weekly figure because it smooths out weekly fluctuations, climbed to 381,000 in the June 17 week -- the highest level since Oct. 10, 1992 -- from a revised 377,250 a week earlier, the department said.
The weekly total far exceeded Wall Street economists' forecasts of 373,000 initial claims.
"It's pretty stunning," said Christopher Low, economist at HSBC Markets Inc. "It points to significant deterioration in June, especially in the goods-producing sector.
"To put it into perspective, when the 1990 recession began, claims were at 355,000. They rose up above 400,000 during the course of the recession. This 395,000 level is very high and is consistent with recession."
The department said the number of jobless claims for the June 10 week was revised to 375,000 from the previously reported 371,000.
Marilyn Schaja, money markets economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities, said the jump in weekly applications was a significant increase. "But I personally don't get too excited about these numbers," she said. "You can't infer too much or assume we will have a particularly weak June employment report."
Still, she added that "the numbers do show a deterioration in the jobs market."

HEADLINE: UConn to Get $1 Billion For a Face Lift

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: STORRS, Conn., June 22

 BODY:
As they moved to cut spending and shrink government this spring, lawmakers in Hartford took one stunning step in the opposite direction: They approved a $1 billion package to rebuild and expand the University of Connecticut.
University officials say the 10-year plan, widely called UConn 2000, is the largest such initiative in the nation for a publicly financed university. It entails building new dormitories, new chemistry and pharmacy buildings, a new campus in downtown Stamford and an expanded campus in Groton, and it bucks a national trend toward trimming support for public higher education. 
 Despite initial skepticism, the program sailed through the Legislature, thanks to a well-orchestrated lobbying campaign and, in no small measure, to the wave of "Huskymania" that swept the state as the women's and men's basketball teams pursued national championships.
"UConn 2000 has been largely credited to Rebecca Lobo, and I have to give her some credit," Harry J. Hartley, the university president, said of the school's All-America basketball player. "There was a little bit of luck in having both teams ranked No. 1 in the country just after we announced the proposal, but remember, luck is the residue of design."
He added, "We were ready for this."
At a jubilant ceremony today at the main campus here, Mr. Hartley was joined by Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, and the House Speaker, Thomas D. Ritter, a Democrat, as well as more than 500 others to mark the start of what was described as a renaissance for the university. A student band played the school fight song, and a cheerleader in a Husky costume pumped his arm in the air.
The plan is seen as a jump-start for a school that has been troubled in recent years by deterioriating facilities. University officials called it a critical first step toward building the school's endowment, which at about $45 million is one of the smallest in the nation for a major state research university.
"This will give us the opportunity to be the No. 1 public university in the United States," Lewis B. Rome, chairman of the board of trustees, told the crowd.
Whether or not the university achieves that goal, there is little question that UConn 2000 is one of the most ambitious state programs to enhance a university system, particularly when many states have been cutting back.
Peter M. Buchanan, the president of the Council for Advancement and Support of Education, a nonprofit group that represents university professionals, said: "UConn 2000's approval is a benchmark for public higher education in this country. No other state has taken such decisive action to strengthen its flagship university."
John M. Hammang, director of state and campus relations at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, said the amount of state and local revenues devoted to higher education had dropped to 6.2 percent in 1994 from 7.6 percent in 1982. He estimated that the shrinking support from government had left state universities with a $7.7 billion gap in purchasing power from 1990 to 1994 -- about one-fifth of their appropriations when adjusted for inflation.
New York, one of the most extreme examples, cut capital appropriations for its state university system from $313.9 million last year year to $181 million in the 1995-96 fiscal year. The net appropriation for operating expenses dropped by more than one-tenth, from $1 billion to $862 million.
The University of Connecticut has also suffered. State money for university operations is below its 1991 level and is not expected to grow substantially in the next two years.
In response to the dwindling state funds, tuition has grown faster at UConn than at its counterparts in New York and New Jersey. Tuition for in-state residents has more than doubled over the last seven years, from $2,293 to $4,712. In that period, it was more expensive than the State University of New York or Rutgers University, the state school in New Jersey.
The university has been forced to close dorms because of leaky plumbing and dangerous electrical wiring. The main library is covered in plastic to prevent bricks from falling on pedestrians. And the ventilation system in the chemistry building does not meet current health standards.
Under the UConn 2000 plan, the university can issue $980 million in bonds to cover 62 capital projects. Half the money will go to repairing facilities, and the rest will be used to expand and build new ones.
To encourage private donations, the state has also committed to provide $20 million in matching funds toward the first $20 million the university raises on its own. Beyond that, the university hopes to raise $280 million, seeking gifts from private industry as well as alumni.
Once the debt from the bonds is repaid, the total cost to the state will exceed $2 billion.
Several experts said it was difficult to compare the extent to which different universities use bonds to raise money. They noted that several other universities had embarked on substantial expansions and that still others were preparing for them. For instance, the University of California is considering an $11 billion bonding project.
Still, state officials said that given UConn's size, the state's investment most likely represents more per student than at any other such school.
This afternoon, Mr. Rowland said that he was proud of his reputation as a tax-cutting fiscal conservative, and that the investment in the university was consistent with that approach, protecting the state's economy over the long haul.
Connecticut is the only state in the nation to have lost population three years in a row, he said, adding that Connecticut has the largest percentage of college-bound seniors leaving for out-of-state schools.
"This commitment will assure that we stop the brain drain," he said.
But this economic argument was by no means the sole reason for the success of the measure.
For the first time in the university's history, it mobilized its substantial population of alumni to lobby for aid.
The idea became even more politically popular after the women's basketball team capped an undefeated season with a national championship, and the men's team succeeded in making it to the quarterfinals of the NCAA championship.
Indeed, one of the wildest frenzies in the Legislature this year occurred the day the two teams visited the Capitol and were mobbed by lawmakers seeking autographs. Interestingly, that was also the day that Governor Rowland announced his support for UConn 2000.

HEADLINE: Fed's Top 2 Said to Discuss Cutting Rates

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman, have talked in recent days about the possibility of lowering interest rates when the Fed's policy makers meet on July 5 and 6, senior Fed officials said yesterday.
The conversations come against a backdrop of a steadily slowing economy. Mr. Blinder has publicly expressed concern that the economy might be weakening more than is necessary to control inflation. Now he appears ready to vote against any resolution at the July meeting that fails to lower interest rates, the senior officials said. 
 Mr. Greenspan has not indicated his position for the July meeting. But in fact there is a chance that Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Blinder might both recommend a rate cut at that time, the Fed officials said. Joseph R. Coyne, chief spokesman for the Fed, said he had no comment on the reports.
Mr. Blinder, a Princeton University economist, and Janet Yellen, an economist on leave from the University of California at Berkeley, are President Clinton's only appointees to the Federal Reserve Board, which currently has six members. Ms. Yellen is also reported to favor a rate cut and might side with Mr. Blinder against any resolution that kept rates unchanged instead of lowering them.
"The risks have increased on the down side," she said in an interview yesterday. She declined to state her position on a rate cut.
Mr. Blinder and Mr. Greenspan have displayed some basic differences in how they view the economy. Mr. Blinder is reluctant to let the economy enter a sustained period of what he considers unnecessarily weak economic growth and rising unemployment. Mr. Greenspan has shown a willingness to let the economy come closer to recession if that keeps the rate of inflation from rising.
He has said that reversing a rise in inflation, and the expectations it engenders of future price increases, is more difficult than reversing weak economic growth by eventually lowering interest rates to stimulate borrowing and spending. Mr. Blinder, in turn, says that in the short run, one is no harder to reverse than the other, so no good reason exists to let the economy become too weak and unemployment rise.
The potential political stakes are considerable. A weak economy in 1996, a Presidential election year, could undermine Mr. Clinton's re-election prospects.
Both Mr. Blinder and Mr. Greenspan also have a lot at stake. If Mr. Clinton's appointees were to vote unsuccessfully for a rate cut and the economy were to revive later this year without the aid of such a cut, as some economists and several Fed policy makers believe might happen, then Mr. Greenspan might get the applause. That would come particularly from the financial markets, for his refusal to cut rates and thus prevent a rebound from becoming too robust and inflationary.
"We are in a slowdown, we all know that, and it is impossible to tell how far it may go," said Edward W. Kelley Jr., a Fed governor. "But I believe there are very good reasons to be optimistic and after we work through this period now, we will return to growth."
But if the economy were to continue to decline instead of rebounding, thus risking a recession and raising the unemployment rate, then the blame might focus much more on Mr. Greenspan. That might let Mr. Blinder and Ms. Yellen -- and by extension the Clinton Administration -- at least partly off the hook.
The Fed's policy makers have raised short-term interest rates by three percentage points since early last year, with the last half-point increase taken on Feb. 1. Mr. Blinder and Ms. Yellen had argued against that last increase, but in the end they voted with the others for approval.
"Dissent around here, any dissenting vote, is a big deal," Mr. Blinder said in an interview in March. "This is not like the Supreme Court, where you regularly get 6-3 or 5-4 votes. So you hold your fire until you feel you must shoot."
The Federal Reserve's policy makers generally approve their decisions concerning interest rates by unanimous or near-unanimous votes. Any departure from this collegial approach could result in volatility in the nation's stock and bond markets. These markets often respond favorably to what traders think is solid Fed policy, shared by the chairman, the vice chairman and the other governors, as well as most of the 12 presidents of the Fed's regional banks.
Most recently, long-term interest rates have fallen on Treasury bonds, mortgages, car loans and the like because traders expect that the Federal Reserve will vote to reduce the Federal funds rate, which is the rate banks and other financial institutions pay to borrow for a day or two from each other. Through a ripple effect, changes in the Federal funds rate eventually bring changes on many other rates paid by consumers and business to borrow money.
As a matter of practice, Mr. Greenspan's recommendations concerning interest rates have prevailed at virtually every meeting since he became Fed chairman in 1987, and his view of what should be done now seems likely to prevail at the early July meeting, however Mr. Blinder and Ms. Yellen -- or others -- might vote.
The last time a Fed chairman and vice chairman voted against each other was in February 1986, when Paul A. Volcker, the chairman, and Preston Martin, the vice chairman, disagreed not on whether to cut the discount rate, but when. This is the rate that the Fed itself charges to lend money to banks. Any changes are made at one of the weekly meetings of the Fed's seven governors.
Mr. Volcker wanted to wait until the Japanese and German central banks made similar rate cuts. Mr. Martin, joined by three other governors, voted to act immediately. The two sides finally agreed to defer action.
The coming July meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee brings together the governors as well as the 12 regional bank presidents. They meet every six to eight weeks to consider changes in the Federal funds rate, which has a much bigger impact on the economy than the discount rate.

In the longtime war over lawyer advertising, the latest shot leaves as many wounds as ever.

BYLINE: By Linda Greenhouse 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Of course fancy law firms don't advertise, not if advertising is defined as televised come-ons, tacky billboards or -- the focus of a Supreme Court decision on Wednesday -- letters to accident victims soliciting their business.
Only if advertising is defined more generally to include hiring expensive public relations agents to convert anonymous partners into often-quoted experts, sending newsletters on the finer points of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act to potential clients or announcing by a dignified, properly engraved mailing that a former deputy assistant counsel to a Cabinet department has joined the firm can the establishment bar be described as participating in the revolution the Supreme Court unleashed when it ruled 17 years ago that lawyers have a First Amendment right to advertise. 
 The vote in that case, Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, was 5 to 4, and it is clear from the 5-to-4 vote in the direct-mail-solicitation case on Wednesday that the fissures are still wide open both on the Court and within the legal profession.
The Court ruled this time that contrary to the spirit if not the precise holding of post-Bates cases, states may forbid lawyers to send letters within 30 days of an accident seeking to sign up the victims or survivors as clients. The decision, Florida Bar v. Went for It Inc., upheld a rule that the Florida Supreme Court had adopted at the urging of the Florida Bar.
Perhaps the most curious element of the ongoing debate is the organized bar's position, which boils down to a plea to the Justices to "stop me before I advertise again."
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in her majority opinion, cited with alarm a Florida Bar study showing that lawyers in the state were mailing hundreds of thousands of direct solicitations to accident victims every year. These personal injury lawyers are, after all, not plumbers or automobile dealers but lawyers, who presumably pay their bar dues as regularly as the corporate partners in the big firms. Yet the organized bar, while tolerating the more genteel forms of self-promotion, does not deign to speak for its more aggressive and flamboyant members.
As a historical matter, that is probably not surprising: the bar's leadership has long opposed advertising and has yet to give up the fight.
"The people who are in charge of the bar don't need to advertise," said Alan B. Morrison, a lawyer with the Public Citizen Litigation Group, a consumer-oriented firm affiliated with Ralph Nader that filed a Supreme Court brief against the Florida rule. "They've got their clients, and they didn't get them through advertising. They met them at the country club. They regard advertising as unnecessary and undignified."
P. Cameron DeVore, a partner and First Amendment specialist at Davis Wright Tremaine in Seattle, who also filed a brief against the rule, said the opposition to advertising came not so much from the big law firms like his own as from the small firms and solo practitioners who provide the bar leadership in many states. Unlike the big firms with established practices, these lawyers are directly challenged in the quest for clients by "a lot of hardscrabble young lawyers using advertising to shake the tree for business," Mr. DeVore said in an interview on Thursday.
"Behind all the talk about reclaiming the dignity of the bar," he said, "is a powerful economic self-interest."
But there is a passion to this debate that transcends mere economics. Warren E. Burger, the retired Chief Justice, was on the losing side in the Bates case and, 42 years after serving his last client, at a Minneapolis law firm, has never reconciled himself to the result.
In a speech at the University of Tennessee two years ago, the former Chief Justice, who is now 87 and in failing health, denounced "the outrageous breach of professional conduct we see in the huckster advertising of some attorneys."
"Perhaps 'huckster' is not strong enough a word," he added. " 'Shyster' is more appropriate, but I find on consulting the dictionary that even 'shyster' is not strong enough."
In his speech, Mr. Burger observed wistfully that at one time the "learned professions" -- the church, medicine and the law -- were "considered something different from a trade."
Perhaps that is the key to understanding why the legal profession will never find peace through advertising. Many lawyers do consider themselves part of a special calling, with roots in public service and ethical obligations that extend to a broader system beyond their office walls.
Yet these high-minded elements of a life in the law coexist, with increasing discomfort these days, with the grubby need to make a living. Commerce may hide under an elegant patina, but it is there, in all its gritty reality, nonetheless. At a certain level, lawyers who recoil from the spectacle of advertising may be looking into the mirror of the television screen and seeing themselves.

Bond Prices Move Higher On Jobless-Claims Report

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The Labor Department's report that more Americans than expected filed for jobless benefits last week sent bond prices higher yesterday. Investors and dealers viewed the report as added proof of an econmic slowdown, raising the likelihood that the Fed would cut interest rates.
The 30-year bond jumped nearly a full point in price -- 31/32 , to 1156/32 -- for a yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, of 6.47 percent, down from 6.54 percent on Wednesday. 
 Jobless claims rose by 20,000, to 395,000, in the week ended June 17, and the claims numbers in the previous June 10 report were revised up to 375,000 from 371,000.
Another factor in the rally, according to James Hale, fixed-income analyst with MMS International in San Francisco, has been strong recent demand for corporate issues, which has allowed the rapid unwinding of hedge positions.
Investment bankers who underwrite corporate bond issues initially have the new issue on their balance sheets, he explained. Since the bonds are exposed to market fluctuations, the investment bankers hedge that exposure with short positions in Treasury securities.
"So, of course, the next step when the underwriters do sell the corporate issue," he said, is to "unwind the hedge positions by buying back Treasury securities." This, he said, has helped fuel the latest run-up in Treasury prices.
An offering by Cox Communications Inc., which is controlled by Cox Enterprises Inc. was well received by investors yesterday, and the company increased the size of the deal by 19 percent, to $950 million, through the CS First Boston Corporation. The Atlanta-based cable television company sold $425 million of five-year notes at a price to yield 6.44 percent, or about 65 basis points more than a Treasury security with a comparable maturity; $375 million of 10-year notes at a price to yield 6.89 percent, or 85 basis points over Treasury; and $150 million of 30-year bonds at a price to yield 7.68 percent, or about 115 basis points over the Treasury benchmark issue. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Donald E. Maude, chief fixed-income strategist at Scotia McLeod U.S.A. Inc., characterized the jobless claims as the key event to shape yesterday's market. "This was important because this is the survey period for the June employment report due July 7, the day after the Federal Open Market Committee meets," he said, referring to the Federal Reserve's policy-making panel.
"Basically, the level we're looking at is the highest jobless number since October 1992," he said. "And that would imply only a modest increase in nonfarm payrolls, somewhere in the vicinity of 100,000. The bottom line for the market is that it definitely puts into play the strong likelihood of an interest rate cut at the July meeting of the F.O.M.C."
But the prospect of a July Fed easing, Mr. Maude said, could change quite a few times before the policy meeting. Among the key data to be released before the meeting is held are those in the National Association of Purchasing Management's report.
Mr. Maude said that the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, "constantly refers to vendor performance and feels it is a good measure of the health of the manufacturing sector as compared to the durable-goods reports, which are usually volatile." The Commerce Department is scheduled to release the report on May's durable-goods orders this morning.
Mr. Maude said the coming purchasing-management report could swing the vote in either direction. "If it weakens significantly more, then a easing is almost certain," he said.
Traders said yesterday's Treasury auction of new one-year bills did not produce any surprises. The average yield was 5.53 percent, down a basis point from last month's auction and the lowest since July 21, 1994, when it was 5.20 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a new 52-week bill:

Discounted Rate . . . 5.22%

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper Prices Surge on Concern Over Drop in Warehouse Stocks

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Copper prices surged yesterday as concerns mounted that world consumption was running ahead of new supply.
The price run-up reflects alarming declines in warehouse stocks on the Commodity Exchange of New York and on the London Metal Exchange, said Fred Demler, an analyst at E.D.& F. Man International in New York. 
 "The metal just isn't there," he said. "Fundamentally, stocks are continuing to fall and we're starting to see real worry about shortages."
On other commodity markets, wheat and lumber prices were sharply higher. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities fell 0.18 point, to 237.28.
Copper for July delivery rose 4.95 cents, to $1.46 a pound, the highest price for the contract closest to delivery since April 14, 1989, when it settled at $1.465 a pound. Nearby prices for the metal, used in automobile manufacturing and home construction, threatened to surpass the high of $1.585 a pound set seven years ago, analysts said.
Traders have ignored the weakening United States economy. The United States consumes only about 35 percent of world copper supplies. Instead, they have focused on booming industrial production in Europe and Asia.
Prices advanced after large gaps separated nearby contract prices from longer-term contracts, an indication of supply tightness.
Wheat prices rose to eight-month highs on the Chicago Board of Trade on continued concern about tight world stocks and diminishing hopes of a bumper American crop.
Wheat for July delivery rose 12.5 cents to settle at $4.1025 a bushel.
Lumber prices advanced the permitted $10 daily limit for a second day on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid higher cash prices and expectations that the Federal Reserve Board would cut interest rates.
If the Fed lowers interest rates to keep the economy from slowing into a recession, resulting lower mortgage rates could help turn around sluggish home sales, analysts said.
July lumber rose $10 to settle at $238 for 1,000 board feet.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Advances Against Mark Amid Intervention Speculation

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar gained against the German mark yesterday, helped by speculation that the central banks of the leading industrial nations might stage another round of dollar-buying to support the currency.
The dollar also gained against the British pound after Prime Minister John Major announced that he was resigning as head of the ruling Conservative Party to force an election for the party leadership. Political turmoil often prompts investors to sell a nation's currency. 
 The dollar took off after traders who had sold dollars for marks and other currencies started buying them back amid speculation that the Federal Reserve and its allies were poised to start a round of buying, traders said.
"When the dollar started to move, it accelerated rather quickly, exacerbated by rumors," said Paul Farrell, manager of strategic currency trading at Chase Manhattan Bank.
Traders were especially wary of renewed central bank buying since the dollar late Wednesday fell below 1.3860 marks, the level at which the Fed and many other banks staged a dollar rescue effort on May 31. That buying sent the dollar higher, and stung investors who had bet the dollar would decline further.
The dollar also drew some support against the mark after a Bundesbank council member, Dieter Hiss, suggested German interest rates could be cut to promote growth. Lower German rates often help the dollar by making mark-denominated deposits less attractive relative to dollar deposits.
The dollar surged as high as 1.4013 marks as concern about central bank buying mounted. It settled in New York at 1.3981 marks, up from 1.3844 marks on Wednesday. The pound fell to $1.5962 from $1.6094. The dollar also edged up to 84.54 Japanese yen from 84.04 yen.
Still, currency traders said they were reluctant to make large wagers on the dollar while American and Japanese officials were meeting in Geneva to try to resolve their auto trade dispute.

HEADLINE: Harlem Pathmark Is Stalled, Awaiting Word From Mayor

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
After more than a year of rancorous debate, many residents in East Harlem have finally begun to look forward to the opening of a new Pathmark supermarket in their neighborhood, where large grocery stores are few and far between.
But two months after the Manhattan borough board approved the new store, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani still has not said whether he supports or opposes the 53,000-square-foot project. As a result, the supermarket that was planned at 125th Street and Third Avenue as a boon to the blighted neighborhood remains stalled, and both proponents and critics say they are bitter and disillusioned with the Mayor. 
 The city had promised the developers rich tax breaks and a 1 percent mortgage on the city-owned property where the store is to be built, as well as various other incentives. But the development cannot go forward until the Mayor signs those papers. Mayoral aides say Mr. Giuliani is stalling to give himself time to draft a plan to help Hispanic merchants in East Harlem -- an attempt to mitigate any political damage that may result from approval of the supermarket plan.
He is doing this because the issue has grown much larger than a question of financing The project is bitterly opposed by many Hispanic owners of small food stores in the area who fear they will be driven out of business.
Already, recent polls have shown that the Mayor's standing among Hispanic New Yorkers has slipped badly. And he knows that without support from this group, he might not have been elected in 1993.
On the other hand, the Mayor is also under a great deal of opposing pressure to approve the project -- from the city's black politicians, who want the store for their constituents, and from business executives, investors and the development community. These people contend that failure to move ahead with the Pathmark store will discourage anyone from trying to develop similar plans for other economically distressed areas.
Mr. Giuliani declined to state his view before the borough board voted on the project in April. But now the project rests squarely in the center of his desk, unable to move forward without his assent.
Asked about it during a news briefing yesterday, the Mayor said: "I'm considering the project. I'll consider it in my own time, and in the way in which my staff advises me.
Mayoral aides say that the administration is looking for a Hispanic partner to enter the project, though so far they haven't found one.
Still, all the parties in the long, emotional debate on Pathmark seem to believe that Mr. Giuliani's delay is making the entire matter even more emotional and nerve-racking than is necessary. Proponents and opponents have complained that they have heard nothing from the Giuliani administration, that the Mayor and his surrogates have utterly ignored their calls and requests for meetings.
"I'm deeply troubled because I think that we have not been respected," said Calvin O. Butts 3d, the pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. The church has a community development arm that is part of the consortium developing the project.
"I have heard nothing from the Mayor or anyone connected with the Mayor despite my repeated attempts to reach out to him. I feel we have been, as the kids say, dissed, "Mr. Butts said.
An opponent of the project, Councilman Antonio Pagan, said he is bitter, too. "The delay has been bizarre and perplexing," said Mr. Pagan, who represents the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
Mr. Pagan said Mr. Giuliani should be persuaded to stop the project partly because it will cost the city a lot of money -- but also because the Republican Mayor will get no political benefit from it because most of the store's supporters are black.
"It makes no sense, because those that are supporting this are not his friends and will never be his friends," Mr. Pagan said.
But Hispanic constituents cannot get the Mayor's attention, either. A group of Hispanic elected officials had requested a meeting with the Mayor to discuss the project, Mr. Pagan said, but "there has been no response, and none of our calls have been returned."
Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough Presidentand a champion of the plan to build the Pathmark store, said that she welcomed the Mayor's efforts to increase the amount of money available to small businesses. She added that she had worked out a plan with Pathmark to provide additional assistance for merchants in East Harlem.
Still, she said, the Mayor's delay in at least announcing his intention was creating tension.
"I find it strange that a decisive mayor who talks about community economic development has not moved to endorse this plan," she said. "He is leaving it hanging in a way that is distressing to people on all sides."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Berlin to Beijing

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Five times in six decades the United States has confronted threats to its national interests from a specific kind of enemy: political dictatorships sitting atop a great military machine and bent on expansion, political or territorial.
Three times the U.S. finally had to go to war to deal with the dangers presented by that system of government -- German, Japanese, Iraqi. To deal with the Soviet model, the U.S. used its political, economic and idealistic strength and made clear that if necessary it would commit its military power. 
 Each time there were powerful Americans and allies who fought for the appeasement doctrine that the only way to deal with the dictatorship of the decade was to get closer to it politically and diplomatically, hoping to influence and moderate it.
Now Communist China follows the power-dictatorship model precisely: elimination of dissent through slave labor, concentration camps, arrest and torture, and invasion and occupation of a neighboring nation. And in the 1950's it met and matched American arms in North Korea. Since then it has hugely expanded militarily. Now, the C.I.A. says, it is able to sell missile delivery systems for nuclear weapons to Iran and Pakistan.
But, as if neither history nor American national interests existed, the Bushbaker and Clinton Administrations adopted a policy that goes even beyond traditional appeasement. This policy knowingly strengthens China's economy and thus China's army -- at cost to the American workers.
How could this be? Three answers stare at us: greed, cowardice, stupidity.
Leave Bushbaker to history. President Clinton talked himself into betraying his own pre-election and Presidential promises to raise China's low-tariff privileges, the only American economic lever for human rights. That turnaround grew out of an act of political cowardice -- the surrender to the greed of the American China lobby. The evidence of the role played by stupidity is that the policy is already a disaster.
The U.S. deficit in the China trade has soared to about $40 billion a year -- six times what it was before the Tiananmen massacre. The chief American beneficiaries are companies selling what China wants most -- high technology and aeronautics -- and those that use cheap Chinese labor to overcome the competition of American workers.
But the major winner is the Chinese Army. It is the largest commercial and industrial empire in China, controlling much of China's exports. The profits allow the Chinese military to expand and sell missiles to friendly dictatorships.
Oh, yes, human rights. Mr. Clinton once actually said that his turnaround on his human rights promises would improve human rights in China; he did. At least he has dropped that dreadful line.
The only change in China is more: more arrests, tortures, forced abortions, religious oppression, the whole sickening lot, in China and Tibet.
It is important to recognize the infamy of American policy but it is also important to recognize Americans who continue to fight it.
Among Republican Presidential candidates only Patrick J. Buchanan has had the constancy and courage to denounce the Republican leadership's support of low tariffs for Beijing and point out how that support helps China's military buildup.
In Congress some members of both parties refuse to accept the idea that torture is good for the Chinese. And they refuse to accept the current nasty campaign in China and America to build up one Communist hack or another as China's next leader by absolving him of blame for Tiananmen and pinning responsibility on student leaders.
Despite party and White House pressure they continue to fight for the Chinese people and against the Chinese Government. Next week their new efforts to lift China's tariff privileges will be voted on in the House. The measure was introduced by Representative Frank R. Wolf, Republican of Virginia, who fights the Chinese gulag as he fought the Soviet, the great democratic Democrat Nancy Pelosi of California, and about 25 other members.
Their legislation will be defeated by the Democratic and Republican leaderships. But its sponsors honor their names, their constituents and the people of America and China. So in the history of American democracy, next week they will be winners.

HEADLINE: Displaced Workers Don't Feel Hopeful

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Who Should Worry About the Economy" (Op-Ed, June 16): Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, assures us that despite the fact that "the line between recession and recovery has been blurred as never before" and that "the restructuring of corporate America is going forward with a vengeance," we shouldn't worry. He tells us we should be hopeful. 
 Productivity gains and lower labor costs will control inflation and insure that our corporations will continue to prosper. Mr. Roach mentions peripherally that workers might not share in this prosperity and that job formation is slower in this recovery than in previous times.
Perhaps there is an alternate vision. The very workers who "have borne the brunt of this shakeout" might not be as willing to subscribe to this trickle-up economic model. They might mistake the competitive factors for corporate insensitivity to their personal recessions. I'm not sure if Mr. Roach has heard it, but there is a crescendo of angry voices that cry out for more than crumbs from the corporate table.
A look back might bring a dose of sober reality. Not long ago the country experienced an economic shock brought upon us by unfettered forces of the marketplace compounded by the sheer stupidity of compliant government "servants." Workers by the millions were left without sustenance, and an uncaring Washington turned its back.
The Bonus Marchers of 1932 were just the seeds of a full-scale revolt. Had not Franklin Roosevelt opened the Federal coffers in an attempt to stimulate the marketplace, there may have been a cry for the man on a horse to seize government.
Look around, Mr. Roach. What you see as market transitions toward competitiveness is not a vision shared by many of your fellow Americans. They are afraid for their future and the future of their children. There is real pain throughout this nation, and patience for orderly change is increasingly at a premium.

HEADLINE: One Small City Is Jubilant After Lab Gets Reprieve

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Residents of Rome, N.Y., celebrated yesterday after the eight-member Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission in Washington unanimously rejected an Air Force recommendation to close the high-technology Rome Laboratory on the grounds of Griffiss Air Force Base.
"A lot of hugging and tears" was the way Francis Crumb, the chief of public affairs for the laboratory, described the reaction among the more than 50 people who gathered to watch the vote on C-Span yesterday morning in a conference room in Building 3, an information technology center in a converted World War II supply depot. 
 "When they got the fifth vote, no one heard the last three," he said. "I heard one lady say that besides her wedding and the birth of her child, it was the greatest day of her life."
At stake were roughly 100 military and 1,000 civilian jobs at the laboratory, which anticipates a budget of about $400 million in the coming year. The laboratory carries out advanced work in communications, computers and intelligence, among other activities. In addition, the laboratory is said to support 3,000 other jobs and generate about $300 million in economic activity in and around Rome, a city of about 45,000 in Oneida County in the central part of the state.
Hanging in the balance, too, was the city's vision of the Rome Laboratory as the hub of a technological park comprising new high-technology businesses that the community hopes to attract after the Air Force Base, a casualty of an earlier round of base closings, shuts down on Sept. 30.
Local officials lobbied aggressively. They hired a public relations firm that brought in former Defense Department employees to challenge the Air Force's figures on the potential savings from closing the laboratory.
When the vote came in today, champagne started flowing and telephones began ringing in the office of Mayor Joseph A. Griffo, who was in Washington.
"People were going crazy, yelling out the windows and down the halls," said Gregory Mattacola, 23, the Mayor's administrative intern. "You could hear the screams for a few miles, I think."
A lot of the noise was coming from Bucky's Bar and Restaurant, about 200 yards from the main gate of the Air Force base and a popular gathering place for employees of the laboratory. By 11:30 A.M., Bucky's was filled with people, noise and joy. "Yes, sir, it's quite a celebration," said Dave Wedlock, the manager.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. LEADERSHIP ANNOUNCES ACCORD ON TAX REDUCTION

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22

 BODY:
Republican leaders in the House and Senate struck a deal tonight to cut a variety of income and investment taxes by $245 billion over the next seven years, the final element of a compromise blueprint for balancing the Federal budget by 2002.
Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, announced the tax and budget agreements tonight, ending three weeks of off-and-on haggling between their offices and Congress's ranking tax and budget officials. 
 Aides said that the final proposal called for spending of about $12 trillion over the next seven years, just under $1 trillion less than is currently assumed. It would also reduce projected "discretionary" spending -- on roads, education, the environment and other programs without fixed spending formulas -- by $190 billion through 2002, and increase projected military spending by about $34 billion during that period.
Two of the biggest and fastest-growing entitlement programs, Medicare and Medicaid, would also get major reductions in their rates of spending growth, although their budgets would continue to rise.
After the agreements were announced, the White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, said that the Republicans were going about their budget balancing in the "wrong way" and that their plans apparently called for "extreme cuts in Medicare and unwise cuts in education to pay for tax cuts to those who don't need them." His remarks echoed earlier White House rumblings of a possible veto if tax and spending cuts were judged unacceptable.
As a practical matter, the agreements reached tonight are less important as fiscal documents than as political symbols. The House and Senate took their biggest steps toward erasing the deficit in May, when they approved separate proposals to bring the Government to fiscal balance, and this compromise is devoted to eliminating what were mostly small differences between the two plans.
Both chambers are expected to give their final approval to the new budget outline before Congress adjourns for the July 4 holiday. That, in turn, would give Congress's committees the directions they need to write detailed spending and tax plans for the 1996 budget this summer.
Mr. Gingrich called the agreements "another historic step in bringing the Federal budget into balance" and added, "After decades of reckless spending, we are committed to making Government leaner, more efficient and cost effective."
But by no means does the accord insure that the Republican vision of a budget will become law. President Clinton has virtually promised to veto any budget containing deep reductions in the rate of spending on Medicare and Medicaid as well as deep cuts in taxes.
Mr. Clinton entered the budget-balancing competition himself last week, offering his own 10-year plan plan that included a tax cut of $111 billion. Mr. Gingrich said tonight that the President's proposal had "created an environment that made it easier" to reach an accord, but that the plan had never been seriously considered on Capitol Hill.
The $245 billion deal on taxes effectively splits a very big difference between the Senate and House versions of the budget resolution, one that had seemed to threaten the prospects for any agreement at all.
House Republicans voted nearly unanimously in April for a package of tax cuts totaling $350 billion over seven years and mainly intended to benefit families and investors. The Senate's more cautious Republicans, fearful that a package of that scale would undermine any plan to erase the deficit, voted in May to set aside $170 billion for tax reduction, but to be spent only if and when it could be proven that the Federal budget was headed toward fiscal balance.
The compromise announced tonight lifts elements from both positions. The $245 billion in tax cuts includes the principal breaks sought by the House, including a $500-per-child tax credit for taxpaying families and reductions in the capital-gains rate. The proposal would halve the current capital gains rate of up to 28 percent for private investors and cap the corporate rate at 25 percent. These provisions, if enacted, presumably would take effect sometime before the 1996 elections.
Other provisions could attack the so-called marriage penalty by giving a credit to couples whose taxes increase because of matrimony, create a tax-free retirement savings account for nonworking spouses, offer credits to adopting parents, reduce the alternative minimum tax for corporations and give small businesses more favorable tax treatment for deducting investments.
The critical word, however, is "could." The actual mix of tax cuts, while heavily influenced by the Republican leaders and the budget committees, will be determined by the House and Senate tax-writing committees in legislation to be written this fall.
One provision that seems destined to change is the House's proposal to extend the full $500-a-child tax credit to households earning up to $200,000 per year, gradually phasing out at a ceiling of $250,000. Democrats had attacked that as a giveaway to the rich. Negotiators said tonight that the full credit was likely to begin phasing out at incomes of $95,000 or even less.
But in other respects, the $245 billion package is roughly what the House had haggled for in the last week, and far more than the Senate wanted. The $170 billion that senators had reserved for tax cuts was based on experts' predictions that a balanced budget could bolster the economy and produce a so-called fiscal dividend of that size; to reach $245 billion, legislators will have to find more economic benefits or cut spending further.
As compensation, senators won the House's promise that no tax cuts would take effect until the Congressional Budget Office certified that spending reductions were locked in and sending the budget toward balance.
As many as a dozen of the Senate's 54 Republicans, many of whom wanted no tax cut at all, had expressed grave doubts about supporting such a hefty package. But their resistance collapsed in recent days.
The compromise on taxes promises to produce one unintended and unwanted effect: a crush of major political and fiscal decisions in late September, just as the fiscal year is ending and the budget battle between Mr. Clinton and the Republicans reaches its climax.
Republicans had already elected to postpone enactment of major changes in the Medicare program until September, just before those changes will be folded into a vast package of spending and taxing proposals that is the core of the budget.
But by requiring the Congressional Budget Office to certify that the budget has enough money to pay for a tax cut, Republican leaders have effectively postponed action on a tax package until September as well.
The two sides agreed to reduce projected spending on the fast-growing Medicare program by $270 billion over seven years, about $8 billion less than the House had sought, but almost $25 billion more than the Senate wanted. Medicaid would lose $180 billion from projected spending through 2002, splitting the difference between the two proposals.
The Senate also gave in to House demands to sharply cut spending on one of the more popular and politically sensitive Federal benefits: subsidized loans for college and graduate-school students.
The House had proposed to cut $12.5 billion from the loan program by 2002, mostly by requiring students to assume the interest costs of loans during their years in school.
The Senate had fought the House proposal, but in the agreement announced tonight, spending on student loans would fall $11 billion from current projections through 2002.

For the 20th year in a row, Bergen County has been given Moody's Investor Service's Aaa rating, county officials said yesterday. Bergen, one of the wealthiest counties in the state, was one of only four in New Jersey to get Moody's highest rating. The investment service said Bergen's "economic base remains sizable and diverse, and unemployment levels continue to be below both state and national levels."

HEADLINE: Protection for Corporate Fraud

 BODY:
Two bills before Congress reveal how reckless the Republicans have become in their zeal to reduce regulation. The bills -- which would "reform" laws governing securities firms and banks -- go far beyond their stated purpose of ending frivolous litigation. What they would actually do is insulate corporate officials who commit fraud from legal challenge by their victims.
The Senate securities bill sets out to protect corporate officials from being sued when they issue overly optimistic predictions of corporate profitability that are simply innocent misjudgments. Sponsors cite cases where opportunistic shareholders waited for a company's share price to nosedive, then sued on the grounds that their investment was based on fraudulent representations of the company's health. 
 But to solve this infrequent problem, the bill would erect a nearly insurmountable barrier to suing officials who peddle recklessly false information. It would block suits against accountants, lawyers and other professionals who look the other way when the companies they serve mislead investors. The bill requires that suits be filed within a short statute of limitations and threatens plaintiffs who technically violate the court's procedures with heavy fines, including payment of the defendant's legal fees.
These provisions would ward off frivolous suits. But they just as surely ward off valid suits. Securities markets work well when investors are confident that the data on which they base decisions is honest. The bill threatens that confidence.
Banking legislation working its way through the House would also cause damage, both socially and economically. It would remove the Justice Department's authority to sue bankers and realtors who systematically block blacks and other minorities from renting apartments or getting mortgages. Apparently Justice has been too vigilant fighting discrimination for the G.O.P.'s taste. Astonishingly -- in the wake of the fraud that brought down savings and loan institutions during the 1980's -- the bill would weaken regulatory oversight over bank directors, requirements to provide independent audits and prohibitions against preferential loans to bank officials.
The bill leaves few customer protections in place. It would eliminate some requirements that banks report interest rates on customer accounts in uniform, easy-to-compare terms. It would also gut the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to lend money in the neighborhoods where they take deposits or else possibly relinquish the right to merge or open and close branch offices. The act requires reform because enforcement is needlessly expensive. But the answer is to clarify and tighten standards, the solution the Administration has already taken.
The bill will make banks more profitable. But it will also invite some of the sordid practices that contributed to the $500 billion that the savings and loans failures cost taxpayers.
The Administration has expressed opposition to many of the banking provisions. But it has remained silent on the securities bill. Apparently, powerful Democrats, like Christopher Dodd of the insurance state of Connecticut, have pressured the White House to remain mum.
President Clinton seems eager to run as a candidate who could work with the Republican Congress but protect Americans from G.O.P. excesses. He could demonstrate his worth by vowing to veto the securities and banking bills -- and any others that would put the interests of deceptive executives above those of ordinary voters.

HEADLINE: Remedial Education at CUNY

 BODY:
In the 25 years since it adopted open enrollment, the City University of New York has had to carry out a large and expensive remedial effort for students unable to keep up with college-level work. Now the city and state budget crises have forced the university to curtail many programs, including remedial instruction in reading, writing and mathematics. The remedial-education budget cuts need not be destructive, however. Indeed, they should be embraced as an opportunity to refashion a program that has grown too large and weakened the essential mission of the university.
For all its many problems, the City University remains one of the glories of New York. Despite this year's tuition hikes and cutbacks in departments and programs, enrollment is expected to keep growing. The city needs the university more than ever to help supply the trained work force to keep its economy alive. 
 A generation ago, a mixture of politics and idealism led to the creation of open enrollment and such programs as SEEK, which provides tutoring and counseling for the most disadvantaged students. The ideals remain worthy, but the programs have expanded out of hand. Too many students in the system are struggling with the basic language and number skills that should have been part of their education before they arrived.
Remedial education has grown because two-thirds of the incoming students at the senior colleges and nearly 90 percent at community colleges fail at least one of the assessment tests in reading, writing and mathematics. As a result, one out of eight dollars spent for instruction in the system goes to pay for remedial programs or to teach basic English to foreigners. Many students stay for years in remedial programs, raising doubts about the programs' effectiveness. As for the SEEK program, it enrolls nearly 11,000 students, but the overwhelming majority never graduate from the university.
It would be a mistake to abandon remedial programs entirely, as some critics demand. Special instruction in English will always be needed for some students. By the end of the decade, half the university's incoming students are expected to be foreign-born, many of them possessing skills that the city needs. In addition, many students from disadvantaged backgrounds should also be given a second chance in the university to make up for missed opportunities earlier in life.
The university leadership, taking a sensible initial step to reduce the remedial burden, will soon require that students at the four-year colleges complete their remedial work within their freshman year. Any remedial work beyond that will have to be done at the community colleges. Eventually, the university should cut back even further on remediation by expanding its cooperative efforts with the city's Board of Education to require completion of a rigorous course of study in high school for CUNY-bound students. Students in need of serious remedial help in English or other subjects might even be given help in the summer before entering college. Anyone who cannot pass the basic skills tests after extensive remedial work should not be allowed to stay in college.
No one gains if the City University is turned into a vast holding station for students struggling to learn basic reading and writing skills. But the university's historic goal of helping educate the next generation of skilled workers is no less vital than it was in the 1920's and 1930's. If that goal is not achieved, it is not just the students who will suffer. It is the whole city.

HEADLINE: Big Private Garbage Haulers, Linked to Mafia, Are Indicted

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
State prosecutors charged yesterday that a Mafia-dominated cartel used arson and threats to control the city's commercial garbage business for more than 50 years, forcing virtually every business, university, and hospital in New York City to pay up to 40 percent more for trash collection than they would have in a free market.
Culminating a five-year investigation led by an undercover police officer posing as a garbage hauler, a state grand jury indicted some of the largest garbage haulers in the city, as well as executives described as senior members of the Gambino and Genovese organized crime families. 
 The 17 people and 23 carting companies named in an indictment unsealed yesterday include some of the dominant figures in the industry here, among them the Barretti Carting Corporation and V. Aponte & Sons. Besides arresting executives of these companies, District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau of Manhattan obtained an emergency court order temporarily freezing $268 million in assets of the indicted companies and individuals.
Judge Walker M. Shlackman also appointed receivers to manage the carting giants while the state seeks to seize their assets under a law in which property used in a criminal enterprise is forfeited.
Since 1957, when the city opened up commercial garbage routes to private companies, it has been an open secret in New York that trash haulers and their workers' unions are linked to organized crimes. One report after another has accused the companies of acting in concert with the Mafia to strangle competition, thus driving up prices and making New York one of the few major cities avoided by most national waste disposal companies.
But until yesterday's indictment, state prosecutors had only brought individual extortion cases, never managing to come up with enough evidence to take on an entire industry critical to the city's economy.
"We know how the cartel functioned because we infiltrated it," Mr. Morgenthau said during a press conference called to announce the sweeping, 114-count indictment. "We attended their meetings. We dealt directly with their leadership."
He said the investigation is continuing. "This is the beginning and not the end of this investigation and we are thoroughly determined to break up this cartel," Mr. Morgenthau said.
Lawyers representing some of the executives indicted declined to comment on the grand jury's charges. Others could not be reached for comment last night.
The indictment is the latest seeking to depict the Mafia as playing a dominant role in a local industry. Others have contended that organized crime once dominated the trucking industry that serves the garment district, the Fulton Fish Market, and huge portions of the construction industry.
In New York, commercial pickups are handled by private companies. Residential collection is handled by the city.
By Mr. Morgenthau's account, the cartel's ability to keep prices artificially high was demonstrated three years ago when Browning-Ferris Industries, one of the world's biggest waste hauling companies, tried to break into the New York market.
Browning-Ferris executives, who said they received threats, offered low enough rates to pick up about 200 customers. But hundreds of other businesses refused to switch carting companies even after Browning Ferris offered much lower bids than cartel members.
The businesses that did change companies saved huge amounts, said Mr. Morgenthau. For instance, a large office building at 55 Water Street that had been paying $100,000 a month to V. Ponte & Sons for pickups now pays only $10,000 a month to Browning-Ferris. Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center cut its monthly hauling bill from $100,000 to $40,000 by contracting with Browning-Ferris.
The District Attorney said that Browning Ferris officials cooperated with the investigation, after going to his office to say they were dismayed that their low bids were continually ignored.
Prosecutors said that during the last three years, a New York City detective worked undercover inside a company that was being extorted by the four trade associations that represent garbage haulers, and gathered information about the operations of the cartel. In addition to the activities of the undercover officer, who was not identified, investigators used wiretaps extensively and secretly recorded meetings with carting executives.
What they learned, prosecutors contend, was the broad outline of a complex conspiracy that represents a powerful example of organized crime's lingering influence in legitimate business.
Describing the defendants, Daniel J. Castleman, the chief of the District Attorney's investigations division, said, "They are some of the biggest haulers, and their customer list reads like a Who's Who of corporate America."
The garbage haulers were members of four trade associations, which, prosecutors said, provided a forum where carters could conspire not to compete with one another. The associations carved up the city, using a system of "property rights," the indictment charged. Each carting company "owns" buildings where their customers are located.
If an company that is not a member of the trade associations tries to offer a lower price for a building's business, the associations scare off the interloper with arson and physical violence, prosecutors said.
If a company inside the cartel takes a site away from another hauler in the cartel, prosecutors charged, the associations force the offending company to pay the former hauler up to 40 times the monthly pickup charge. The associations generally pocket part of the penalty money as well, the state contended.
During the investigation, the undercover police detective posing as a carting executive paid more than $790,000 in "dues" to the associations and in compensation to other haulers. In exchange, he won the right to pick up garbage at stops where he had submitted the lowest bid.
When necessary, some of the hauling companies named in the indictment turned to violence to protect their turf, prosecutors said.
Philip Barretti Sr., 56, of Essex Falls, N.J., the owner of three hauling companies, was charged with assaulting an independent carter and later setting fire to his garbage truck. The owners of Mongelli Carting Company in the Bronx -- Louis and Paul Mongelli, father and son, -- were accused of severely beating a driver for a rival company with a baseball bat.
The trade associations that controlled the industry were dominated by the Genovese and Gambino crime families, Mr. Morgenthau said. The dues collected by the associations amounted to a garbage tax for the Mafia, he said.
By the prosecutors' accounts, the Gambino family controls the Association of Trade Waste Removers of Greater New York, in Manhattan, and the Queens County Trade Association in Brooklyn.
Both associations were under the command of Joseph Francolino Sr., 57, of Staten Island, before his arrest yesterday. Prosecutors portrayed Mr. Francolino as a senior member of the Gambino organization, and the apparent heir to James Failla, the reputed Gambino carting boss convicted of murder conspiracy in Brooklyn Federal Court last year.
The other two trade groups -- The Kings County Trade Waste Association and the Greater New York Waste Paper Association -- are under the control of Alphonse Malangone, 58, of Staten Island, prosecutors said.
Mr. Malangone was described by prosecutors as a powerful captain in the Genovese family who controls virtually all the hauling operations in Brooklyn. Mr. Malangone's assistant, Frank Giovinco, 28, of Bayside, Queens, was also arrested and identified as a soldier in the family. Lawyers for Mr. Malangone and Mr. Giovinco declined to comment.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 26, 1995, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about the indictment of garbage haulers accused of using threats and arson to control the industry in New York City misspelled the names of a state judge who froze the assets of the companies involved, and misstated an element of his order. He is Acting Supreme Court Justice Walter M. Schackman; while he has scheduled a hearing on the issue of appointing receivers to oversee the companies, he has not yet appointed receivers.

HEADLINE: In Review of Albany's Budget, Moody's Remains Pessimistic

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 23

 BODY:
A leading state credit agency issued a skeptical report today on the first budget of Gov. George E. Pataki, who entered office in January with a pledge to restore fiscal responsibility to New York. The agency said "the state's fiscal picture remains stressed," and its analysts said that an upgrade in its low bond rating appeared unlikely soon.
 Mr. Pataki immediately attacked the report from Moody's Investors Service, one of two major agencies that assess the state's creditworthiness. He charged that Moody's had overlooked what he said were several accomplishments, particularly a 1 percent actual drop in state spending over last year. 
 The agency did praise the decrease. But the report also cited several risks in keeping the fiscal plan in balance this year and worried about projected shortfalls in the coming years -- gaps Mr. Pataki has estimated at $2 billion in fiscal year 1997 and possibly more in 1998.
 As a consequence, Moody's analysts said, they did not anticipate that the agency's rating committee would upgrade the state's A rating on general obligation bonds -- the second lowest in the nation, after Louisiana -- anytime soon. The analysts said they would watch in the coming months how well the budget stays in balance and what steps the state takes to addresses future shortfalls.
 "There still needs to be more work toward getting his budget in balance over the long term," George W. Leung, a Moody's vice president, said.
 An improved credit rating would save money by allowing the state to borrow money at lower interest rates. It also would have been a major political boost for Mr. Pataki, who often complained about the state's poor creditworthiness during the gubernatorial campaign. Despite Mr. Pataki's statements that his budget represented a major change over past fiscal plans, administration officials said they had not expected an immediate improvement in the credit rating.
 Claudia S. Hutton, a spokeswoman for the state budget division, said, "We felt that Moody's would want to see successive years of spending cuts leading to a structural balance," meaning a budget that does not cause deficits in future years. "It took the state a long time to get this unbalanced," she added. "It will take us more than one budget to get us back on the right path."
 The report said that keeping the $33 billion state budget in balance this year may be difficult: the budget was 68 days late, it noted, meaning there is less time in the fiscal year to make the savings. Many of the cuts, the report said, came in welfare and Medicaid, and local governments, which administer these programs, may not be able to keep pace with state's savings projections. The report also noted that slowed economic growth may mean that the state will not bring in as much tax money as anticipated.
 Looking ahead, the report said that the budget contained $900 million in so-called one-shot revenues, a fiscal gimmick Mr. Pataki had often criticized because these funds cannot be used in future years. "New York State will likely continue to experience contentious and protracted budget debates, and late budgets," the report said.
 The second major rater, Standard & Poor's, has not yet released an assessment of the Governor's budget. Richard J. Marino, a company director, said that analysts were scheduled to meet with state officials next week to discuss the budget.

HEADLINE: California Takes New Hit on Base Closings

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
A day after stripping California of an Air Force maintenance depot that employs more than 10,000 civilians, a Presidential commission voted today to close the naval shipyard in Long Beach, Calif., which employs another 3,500.
By following the Navy's recommendation on Long Beach, the commission was able to save the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on the Maine-New Hampshire border. Dating from the War of 1812, Portsmouth is one of the nation's most historic bases, and is also the only one in the region able to service nuclear-powered submarines. 
 Last month the panel had added Portsmouth to the list of bases it would consider closing, but today it accepted the Navy's argument that Portsmouth played an irreplaceable role.
"I'm very pleased, to say the least," said Senator Robert C. Smith, Republican of New Hampshire. "But I didn't get any enjoyment out of the fact that someone else lost a base."
In its vote on the 50-year-old Long Beach shipyard, which the Navy uses to repair nonnuclear ships, the commission decided it was not worth continuing to spend $115 million a year to keep it open, despite the economic pain the closing would cause California. Already stung by the loss on Thursday of McClellan Air Force Base, a depot outside of Sacramento, the state's lawmakers promised a vigorous appeal to the White House.
"I'm disgusted," said Representative Steve Horn, a Republican whose district includes Long Beach. "The President should throw this out."
The votes came on the second and final day of deliberations by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, which decided whether to shut, shrink or retain 174 military installations. The panel's deliberations, which ended tonight at 9:30, represented the last scheduled round of base closings in the aftermath of the Cold War.
Among its other actions today, the commission dealt two blows to the metropolitan New York region. The commission voted tonight to close the Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne, N.J., which employs more than 1,200 civilians and has packed off untold tanks, trucks and crates of ammunition to battlefields around the world. And the panel supported the Pentagon in voting to move a Naval nuclear training installation in Orlando, Fla. -- which has more than 2,000 military personnel -- to Charleston, S.C., instead of New London, Conn., where the 1993 commission had voted to move it.
The eight-member panel voted to keep open the Naval Air Station in Meridian, Miss. -- the third time in five years the panel has rebuffed the Pentagon's efforts to close the pilot-training installation, which employs about 450 civilians.
And it also effectively closed Fort McClellan in Alabama, a center for chemical defense and military police training that employs about 1,100 civilians and 10,000 military personnel. The commission chose to move much of its operations to Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri.
But the most significant development today was the decision to close Long Beach, which the commissioners debated for half an hour. Like the California lawmakers who watched nervously from the gallery, all the commissioners were aware that California had already lost 22 bases -- and more than 200,000 jobs -- in three previous rounds of base closings.
"This is nothing but pain," said the commission chairman, former Senator Alan J. Dixon of Illinois, before joining the 6-to-2 majority. The Navy plans to shift many of the shipyard's repair functions to private companies in San Diego. But elected officials in California have contended that the private sector is ill-equipped to handle the amount of work coming its way.
The commission further hurt California tonight by closing an Army cargo port in Oakland that employs 670 civilians.
The commission's decisions on California may have political ramifications for President Clinton, given California's 54 electoral votes in the 1996 Presidential election. Under the commission's charter, the President must accept or reject its decisions as a package, forwarding them to Congress or sending them back to the panel by July 15. Because of the pressure to cut the Pentagon budget in an era of dwindling troop levels, the commission's decisions have, in past rounds, been the final word.
In its deliberations this week, the commission signaled its independent streak early on: it voted on Thursday to retain Rome Laboratory, a high-technology Air Force installation in upstate New York that the Pentagon wanted to close. Then it voted to close the California McClellan depot and another huge maintenance depot at Kelly Air Force Base in Texas, both of which the Defense Department wanted to keep open. And soon after, it voted to keep open Lakehurst Naval Air Station in southern New Jersey, which the military wanted to close.
But it also followed the Pentagon's lead on an overwhelming number of recommendations, including its votes today to close three small Army bases -- Fort Pickett in Virginia, Fort Indiantown Gap in Pennsylvania and Fort Chaffee in Arkansas -- and the Naval Air Station in Weymouth, Mass.

U.S. and Japan Extend Trade Talks Over Autos
Japanese and American trade negotiators in Geneva agreed to extend their bargaining sessions over the Clinton Administration's threatened sanctions on Japanese luxury cars through the weekend.
 Negotiators reported minimal progress in a session that focused on how Japanese auto makers could increase their purchase of American parts without explicitly agreeing to a numerical target or its equivalent. [Page 1.]
While business has been brisk at many car dealers, some are now seeing a falloff as the tariff deadline nears. There is still a decent supply of cars, but not in all models. [46.]
 
Bradlees in Bankruptcy Filing
Bradlees, the struggling regional discount retailer, filed for bankruptcy protection, saying it had to do so because many of its suppliers, fearing they would not be paid, stopped shipping their goods. The company said all its stores would remain open. [35.]
 
Plaintiffs Gain in Tobacco Suit
In what plaintiffs' lawyers hailed as a victory in a giant class-action suit against tobacco companies, a Federal district judge in New Orleans agreed to permit the discovery process to go forward, months before an appeals court rules on the class action. [35.]
 
Stocks Ease on Durables Report
Blue-chip stocks eased as news that durable goods orders had surged in May tempered hopes that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates soon to stimulate the economy. The Dow industrials were off 3.80 points, to 4,585.84, retreating from Thursday's record close of 4,589.64. For the week, the average rose 75.05 points. [37.]
 
Treasury securities prices fell, too, on the strong durable goods report. The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.49 percent. [36.]
 
USAir Stock Down 6.5%
Shares in USAir Group fell 6.5 percent, to $12.50, because of rumors that the troubled carrier planned to buy Hawaiian Air, T.W.A., or both. USAir denied the rumors. [34.]
 
G.M. to Raise Prices 2.7%
G.M. said it planned to increase prices in the United States for its 1996 model cars and trucks by an average of 2.7 percent, which is comparable to Ford's price rises. [46.]
 
Shanghai Rents Are Soaring
With surging demand from American and other foreign companies streaming into China, Shanghai's real estate market has become one of the most expensive in the world. Real estate agents estimate that residential and office rents have more than doubled since 1992. [1.]
 
New York Warned on Budget
Moody's warned that New York State's "fiscal picture remains stressed" and said that the state failed "to rebuild reserves as a buffer against the next economic downturn." [22.]
 
Credit Cards on the Internet
Mastercard and Visa agreed to a standard for credit card transactions on the Internet. Mastercard plans to join -- with minor modifications -- an encryption system that Visa is developing with Microsoft. [35.]
 
F.C.C. Awards 99 Licenses
The F.C.C. said it had awarded 99 licenses to winners of its airwave auction, which ended in March. [35.]
 
Dickstein Claims Hills Victory
Dickstein Partners said it believed it had won its proxy fight for control of the board of Hills Stores, clearing the way for a sale of the regional discount store chain. [35.]
 
Duty-Free, a Hit in Manila
The Philippines has moved into the top ranks of the world's duty-free merchandisers, but with a twist. The main customers are incoming travelers, not outgoing. [34.]
 
Wheat Futures Up on Crop Damage
Wheat futures prices surged after early Kansas harvest results showed unexpectedly heavy damage from April rains. [43.]
 
The dollar weakened on news that inflation was accelerating in Germany, making a Bundesbank rate cut unlikely. [43.]

HEADLINE: Bikers Without Helmets Cost Us Big Money

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "The Case for No Helmets" (Op-Ed, June 17): While Dick Teresi and other motorcycle enthusiasts delight in feeling "the wind in their hair," the rest of us are feeling their hands in our pockets. Bikers without helmets cost the rest of us big money. 
 Mr. Teresi's "facts" don't add up. He makes statistically invalid comparisons between states and ignores the fact that every state that enacts a universal helmet law experiences fatality reductions and every state that has repealed a helmet law has seen motorcycle deaths go up.
He also rejects conclusions reached by the nation's premiere public health institution, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, because it doesn't support his position, but he accepts a study by an obscure college economics professor who does.
The facts are simple:
* Helmets work. According to the United States Department of Transportation, helmets reduce the risk of fatal injury by nearly 30 percent and are highly effective in preventing head injuries, the leading cause of motorcyclist deaths.
* Helmet laws work. Between 1976 and 1980, helmet laws were weakened or repealed in 28 states. Motorcycle fatalities increased 60 percent (registration went up only 15 percent). The 25 states currently with all-rider helmet laws have use rates near 100 percent, compared with 36 percent in states without.
* The rest of us pay. Taxpayers assume the majority of the cost for the care of injured motorcyclists -- up to 80 percent of the acute and long-term care costs.
Between 1984 and 1993, if motorcycle helmet use had been 100 percent, we could have saved an additional 4,100 lives, prevented more than 2,500 injuries and saved approximately $4 billion.
* The public supports these laws. A recent public opinion poll found that 79 percent of Americans oppose weakening or repealing motorcycle helmet laws and 63 percent believe doing so will place a greater burden on taxpayers.

HEADLINE: Religion Journal;
On the Importance of Instilling Unity

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
Each year, summer's arrival means the start of a cycle of national religious meetings. The faithful of one particular group or another meet in conventions, assemblies and synods to debate resolutions, elect officers and spend time with people of shared beliefs in a country that grows evermore religiously diverse.
 Over the last 10 days, for example, more than 200 Roman Catholic bishops met in Chicago, while 20,000 Southern Baptists met in Atlanta. 
 From the style of their clerical garb to the language of their prayers, the bishops and the Baptists portrayed quite different points on Christianity's broad landscape. But it was possible to take a common lesson from their meetings: how a single individual can play a vital role in instilling a spirit of unity at such gatherings.
 In the case of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, that role has long been filled by Joseph Cardinal Bernardin, the Archbishop of Chicago. But this year he was unable to attend, after undergoing surgery the same week as the bishops' conference to remove a cancerous tumor from his pancreas.
 At the Southern Baptist Convention this week the talk focused on the Rev. Billy Graham, who managed to preach despite suffering his own health problems, though less severe than the Cardinal's.
 In Cardinal Bernardin's absence, the bishops found themselves without a man who has been a center of intellectual gravity at past meetings. The 67-year-old prelate has long held the distinction of being a moderate trusted by both the dominant conservatives among the bishops and their diminishing liberal wing.
 Admirers ascribe to him characteristics like those of an effective Congressional committee chairman -- a zest for detail, an abundance of patience and an ability to find common ground on which people of differing opinions might stand.
 Using a powerful Chicago basketball metaphor to describe the Cardinal's absence, the Rev. Thomas Reese, a senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University, said, "It really is like losing Michael Jordan from your team."
 The bishops themselves were more guarded in their assessments. The conference's president, William Cardinal Keeler, the Archbishop of Baltimore, said he believed that Cardinal Bernardin's prayers were helping move other bishops to take quiet positions of leadership.
 But Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland of Milwaukee said he believed the Cardinal held a unique role. "Having the trust of everyone is important," he said.
 That would be particularly true given Archbishop Weakland's concern that the conference has changed over the last two or three years, with the bishops becoming less willing to take the bold stands they took in the 1980's with pastoral messages on world peace and the American economy.
 More and more prelates are not speaking out at all, the Archbishop said, adding, "Maybe the conference is typical of the whole nation." Differences among bishops "are greater," he said, and "there doesn't seem to be a clear vision."
 Mr. Graham, by contrast, has not played anything like the direct role among Southern Baptists that Cardinal Bernardin has among the bishops. The evangelist's appearances at Baptist meetings have been occasional; he has delivered inspiration rather than delving into committee work. And many perceive him as a sort of universal Christian clergyman, speaking to ecumenical gatherings around the world.
 But Mr. Graham is a Southern Baptist -- by choice, he points out, having been reared as a Presbyterian; he changed affiliation in college.
 His adopted denomination has suffered severe traumas in the last two decades, the result of a struggle between conservative and moderate factions that the conservatives won hands down. Some of those on the losing side have been forced from jobs on seminary faculties and in denominational agencies.
 And repercussions continue. The day before Mr. Graham appeared, officers of an alumni association at one Southern Baptist seminary resigned in protest over its new, conservative policies, among them what the officers said were narrow theological restrictions imposed by the administration.
 But Thursday morning, all eyes were on the 76-year old evangelist. Earlier this month, he was twice hospitalized in Toronto, where he had gone to preach one of his "crusades." Doctors diagnosed a bleeding colon and ordered several blood transfusions.
 Arriving at the Baptists' convention, which was held at the Georgia Dome, an indoor stadium, Mr. Graham walked more slowly than usual. And his sermon tended toward the conversational rather than the declamatory as he praised the denomination for its evangelistic efforts.
 He first spoke to the annual convention in 1951, Mr. Graham said. He had done so more than a dozen times since, and was now back on the denomination's 150th anniversary.
 "Think of it," he said: He had been around "long enough to have preached to one-third of the history of Southern Baptists."
 In all, he received four standing ovations.

HEADLINE: Teacher Accused of Asking Student for Bribe

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
A high school social studies teacher with a salary of $62,331 was charged with extortion yesterday, accused of soliciting $300 in bribes to improve the grade of a senior enrolled in his remedial economics course.
 The teacher, identified as Kenneth D. Cotton, 44, of Queens, was arrested on Thursday night at Jamaica High School in Queens by investigators from the office of Edward F. Stancik, the special commissioner of investigation for the city's school system. 
 Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines announced that he had suspended Mr. Cotton and directed the school system to seek his dismissal.
 "Extorting money from students to change their grades is a horrible, inexcusable exploitation of a teacher's position," he said.
 Mr. Stancik said he did not believe that accepting bribes for raising student grades was widespread. But he said his office was looking into a similar allegation against Mr. Cotton from another student.
 Officials in the school system and the Queens District Attorney's office said the student, Andres Namen, 18, of St. Helena's High School in the Bronx, had been told he was in danger of failing economics and not graduating unless he enrolled in a makeup course at night at Jamaica High School.
 The District Attorney's office said Mr. Cotton, who has worked for the Board of Education for 20 years and was teaching at Adlai E. Stevenson High School in the Bronx during the day, approached the teen-ager on May 23, told him he had too many absences from the class and offered to "stick his neck out" for him. But he said there would have to be some reward, the District Attorney's office said.
 Mr. Namen told the authorities that Mr. Cotton said he wanted money -- "not in the four digits, but not less than $100."
 Rachel Bluestein, a spokeswoman for Mr. Stancik, said the young man gave Mr. Cotton $150 in late May.
 "The teacher said he needed more money," Ms. Bluestein said. At that point, she continued, Mr. Namen began to feel he had done something wrong, and on June 16 he reported the matter to a safety officer at Jamaica High School.
 Mr. Namen was fitted with a recording device and given $150. "We have on audiotape that the teacher accepted the bribe and gave the kid his grade," Ms. Bluestein said. Mr. Namen was going to fail, but the teacher instead gave him a passing grade in exchange for the bribe, she said.
 The Queens District Attorney's office charged Mr. Cotton with grand larceny by extortion, receiving a bribe and other charges. He could receive a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison for extortion.
 He was arraigned before Criminal Court Judge Joseph Grasso and released on $1,500 cash bail pending a preliminary hearing on Wednesday.
 Mr. Cotton's lawyer, Douglas H. Krieger, said, "There is a lot that has not been said, and at the proper time it will be revealed." He said his client "is saying that it is not as pictured."
 Mr. Namen's class graduated on Thursday night. His status was reported to be unresolved.

HEADLINE: GOVERNMENT ACTS TO SET ITS POLICY ON RACE PROGRAMS

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
Little more than a week after the Supreme Court ruled that Federal preference programs based on race must be held to an exacting constitutional standard, the Clinton Administration is beginning, occasionally with fits and starts, to develop its response.
Administration officials said today that the Justice Department would provide legal guidance on affirmative action to Federal agencies next week and ask them to review their programs to make sure of meeting the standard laid down by the Court. 
 But already, in an announcement today, the Federal Communications Commission has said that it plans to scrap its earlier intention to provide preferences to women and minorities in its coming sale of wireless-telephone licenses. Instead, F.C.C. officials said, those advantages will now be given to small business generally.
On the other hand, the Transportation Department today gave Oregon officials a go-ahead to continue with a program in which states are encouraged to set aside a percentage of federally financed highway construction projects for companies owned by women or members of minority groups. Oregon officials had suspended bidding on five such projects earlier this week, fearing that the Court's ruling would leave the contracts vulnerable to lawsuits.
The Court's decision, and the Government's effort to determine how that decision ought to apply to varying programs, come at a time when the Administration was already reviewing all Federal affirmative action programs to see whether they accomplished their goals and imposed no undue burden on whites. President Clinton will announce the results of that review, which must now conform with the standard set by the Justices, in a speech that Administration officials expect him to give in July.
In its 5-to-4 decision, the Court held on June 12 in Adarand Constructors Inc. v. Pena that any Federal program that classifies people by race can be considered constitutional only if it is "narrowly tailored" to serve a "compelling governmental interest." The Justices had applied such a standard to state affirmative action programs for years but had allowed the Federal Government far more leeway in administering its own programs.
Even as the Administration seeks to find its legal legs on the issue, civil rights, labor and women's groups are trying to ratchet up the political pressure in favor of affirmative action.
At a news conference in Washington this week, civil rights and labor figures led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson raised the possibility of an economic boycott against states like California where either legislation or voter initiatives would ban consideration of race or sex in employment, contracting or school-admissions decisions.
Indeed, officials of some civil rights groups said they had already begun to research the feasibility of a boycott of California. "It's very serious," said Barbara Arnwine, director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. "A number of things are being done, and all required steps are being taken to examine the potential of such a concerted effort."
An official of another civil rights group said the issues related to a boycott were many and complex. Among them are these:
*If the boycott succeeded in imposing economic hardship on California, what would be the political effect on politicians there who are friendly to affirmative action?
*What about the possibility of suits brought by California businesses that had played no role in the anti-preference policy but were nonetheless being hurt by the protest?
*Should supporters of affirmative action forgo travel to the state entirely or instead make a particular city the target?
*Or should they boycott a product like wine or table grapes?
Those pushing for a boycott say the point would be to bring pressure not only on California but also on any other state that might be considering a ban on preference programs. They say a boycott could sway politicians who are wavering on the issue.
"This is also directed at two Washington players: Congress and the White House," said one civil rights leader, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. "Both have to be reminded that there is going to be a major effort to bring political costs into this debate."
Experts in affirmative action law say Federal preference efforts are mainly concentrated in set-aside programs run by the Transportation Department, the Small Business Administration and the Defense Department; programs like the F.C.C.'s that give minority- and female-owned companies extra credits in bidding; the Federal Government's own personnel policies, and a program run by the Labor Department to prod Federal contractors to hire and promote women and minority-group members.
So far, the F.C.C. appears to be the only Federal agency making a major change in such efforts. The change applies to an auction of wireless-telephone licenses scheduled for August.
The commission's original intent was to provide minority- or female-owned companies engaged in the bidding a 25-percent discount, or "bidding credit." Responding to the Supreme Court's decision, however, the F.C.C. today formally proposed instead giving the 25 percent credit to all companies with annual revenue under $40 million.
In issuing their new plan, F.C.C. officials said they were primarily concerned about avoiding disruption of the auction. The auction was temporarily blocked by a Federal court earlier this year after a rural telephone company had sued the commission, then was allowed to proceed when the F.C.C. and the company negotiated a settlement.
Given the choice between the preference program and the possibility of further litigation that would cause them to fall behind competitors that have already received licenses in earlier bidding rounds, many minority-owned companies supported today's change in the F.C.C. policy.

HEADLINE: SESSION EXTENDED BY U.S. AND JAPAN IN IMPASSE ON CARS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Saturday, June 24

 BODY:
Japanese and American negotiators agreed early this morning to keep talking through the weekend in an effort to head off the imposition of $5.9 billion in sanctions against Japanese imports that loom just four days away. But officials from each country said neither side gave much ground in a day and night of intense talks.
Long after this city had shut down for the night, the Japanese and American teams remained holed up in a small American trade office on the edge of Lake Geneva, arguing over the demands from Washington for fundamental changes in the way Japan regulates its economy and organizes it industry to keep outsiders -- both foreign and Japanese -- at bay. 
 "There was no indication of any significant progress," a senior Administration official said.
As the evening wore on, the Japanese negotiators appeared to be in constant communication with Japan's car makers back in Tokyo, apparently in an effort to coax them into issuing "voluntary plans" for the purchase of American parts that could form the basis of an agreement. But there were no signs of any breakthroughs and several officials familiar with the talks said they still suspected that the Japanese plans would fall far short of what the Administration had demanded.
The painstaking progress underlined the uncomfortable choice facing President Clinton over the next few days: whether to take the best deal he can get by the Wednesday deadline in order to avoid a huge rift with America's closest ally in the Pacific, or whether to go ahead with the 100 percent tariffs, betting that they will spur the Japanese on to deeper concessions in the next few weeks or months.
"The issue is whether the sanctions themselves will motivate the Japanese to solve this problem," said a senior Administration official familiar with the debate, "or so anger them that our leverage will be gone. And there are reasonable arguments on both sides."
Another official involved in the discussion called sanctions "the nuclear weapons of trade, and they may not be worth much after you've used them."
In public, Mr. Clinton has struck an unyielding pose, saying last week at the economic summit meeting in Halifax, Nova Scotia, that he would neither delay nor drop the sanctions unless a deal was struck first. But with the Japanese now negotiating seriously, the question is what kind of deal represents the bottom line for Mr. Clinton. Will he settle for one that simply forces Japan to buy more parts in America and eliminates some regulations in Tokyo that have contributed for years to the problems facing American car makers? Or will he insist on one that begins to break the back of the corporate interrelationships in Japan that keep newcomers -- both foreign and Japanese -- out of the rich market.
Given the public hyperbole in both capitals, the tone of the two days of talks here has been surprisingly cordial. After months of refusing to even talk about inducing the Japanese car makers to issue so-called voluntary plans for their parts purchases, Japanese negotiators are now talking about such plans in some detail. The plans are always termed voluntary to skirt international trade rules that do not allow countries to set rules favoring one nation's imports over another's.
But on the hardest question -- getting American parts into the Japanese market in meaningful and measurable volumes -- there have been no reports of real progress so far. Only if that happens can the Administration truly assert that it has broken the back of the "keiretsu" relationships -- families of closely linked companies -- that are at the heart of the auto dispute.
One of the oddities of the talks here is that the most important participants in these negotiations -- Japan's car makers -- are 7,000 miles away. They hold the key to how many American parts will go into Japanese autos, and whether the parts will go into cars produced only in the United States or also into models made and sold in Japan.
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, whose industrial policies helped build the Japanese car industry out of the the ruins of World War II, insists that it no longer has control over the car makers. Therefore, it contends, the Japanese Government cannot and should notmake an agreement on their behalf.
American negotiators say that is a smokescreen, and that the Government's influence is still so vast over Japanese industry that it could, at a minimum, bless and help support any program to increase American content in Japanese cars.
Japan's strategy, officials close to the negotiations said, is to have the car makers prepare "business plans" for increased parts purchases over the next 48 to 72 hours, with the understanding that none of those plans would be binding. The Honda Motor Company was the first to edge toward such a plan, albeit in the sketchiest possible form. The company, which was the first Japanese auto maker to begin producing motorcycles and cars in the United States, said that it would begin importing more replacement car parts from the United States. But it did not say how many parts, or when they would be purchased.
The Honda plan addresses one of the three major American complaints about the Japanese automobile industry, focusing on Japanese repair shops. The shops conduct inspections of cars in Japan, often replacing a wide range of components. It is profitable work, and the shops are dominated by the car manufacturers, meaning they use authorized and very expensive parts. The American negotiators argue that Japanese consumers should have a choice, and should be able to choose foreign-made mufflers or brake linings that are only one-half to one-fourth as expensive as their Japanese equivalents.
A Honda spokesman said the company's announcement had nothing to do with the trade talks. Honda was motivated, he said, by the high value of the yen, which has made Japanese parts too expensive.
But the Toyota Motor Company, the biggest Japanese car maker, said it had no plans to follow Honda's lead, and without Toyota no deal is possible. As the most politically connected of the car makers, however, Toyota is presumably more subject to leverage by the Japanese Government.
For all the 11th-hour frenzy, none of the plans being discussed at the moment meet even the most minimal tests established by the Clinton Administration for a deal acceptable to the United States. The key problem is that the Administration insists that any plan to increase purchases must be measurable, so that it can keep the pressure on Japan rather than just sign an agreement and file it away.
The question is whether the two sides can come up with a formula that the Americans can declare a victory, and that the Japanese can claim does not constitute a "target" or a "commitment."

HEADLINE: Lakehurst Sleeps Easier After Decision on Base

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: LAKEHURST, N.J., June 23

 BODY:
When Butch Wood was growing up in this small borough in southern New Jersey, there was an expression he heard often enough that he recalled it today at the age of 54: "We had the apple."
 "The apple represented total care," he said, sipping a drink at the Airship Tavern. "You put your head down at night and you were secure that in the morning you had a job, benefits, for you and your family." 
 For the residents here, the Lakehurst Naval Warfare Center was the apple for most of this century. It had lost some of its polish in recent years, Mr. Wood said, as layoffs on the base had spun several of his longtime friends off to other parts of the country. And yet Lakehurst was still Lakehurst because of the base.
 But for months, this borough of 3,000 had lived under a shadow -- ever since the Pentagon recommended that the base be closed as part of a broad effort to save money. On Thursday, though, Lakehurst won an unexpected reprieve, as a Presidential commission rejected the Pentagon's recommendation and ruled that the base should stay in business.
 Many residents celebrated the news with the passion of a patient recovering from long a illness.
 On Wednesday night, the Airship Tavern, a popular place for many base workers, was thronged with hundreds of revelers after the end of the 4 P.M. shift.
 Shortly before 2 P.M., Capt. Leroy A. Farr, the base commander, had received the news from Washington, and word spread quickly throughout the base and the borough. From his office, the captain heard horns, including a distinct horn, once used to signal lunches and breaks, that had been long silent.
 "The last six months had brought a lot of stress," the captain said. "It would come out in conversations. You could see they were bothered about their future, their family."
 The base employs 3,000, of whom 500 are military personnel, Captain Farr said. About 2,500 of the jobs would have disappeared under the Pentagon's plan to relocate the center's responsibilities to design and develop aircraft launching and landing equipment.
 The closing of the base and the evaporation of its $100 million payroll were inconceivable to a town whose economy and identity were tied to the base. A chemical company used to be the largest employer in the county but closed in the late 1980's.
 "We were very happy yesterday," said Randy Perez, 28, whose family has owned the Airship Tavern for 43 years. "Happy for them. Happy for the bar.
 "I think it would have killed the town," said Mr. Perez, who like other natives refers to himself as a "piney," after the region's ubiquitous pine trees.
 It is perhaps a measure of the base's real and psychological importance to the community that Jacqueline Welch's mother, uncertain about the outcome, decided to sell her duplex of 23 years. Miss Welch, 30, grew up in the house on Maple Street. But she said her mother sold the house three months ago, fearing that property values would drop if the base closed and worried about rumors that the base housing might be converted to public housing.

HEADLINE: A Gingrich Budget Gain

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
The Republican balanced-budget proposal unveiled with some flourish on Thursday evening is a compromise that, on most of the issues that count, bears the stamp of the House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, more than that of his Senate counterpart, Bob Dole, the majority leader.
But the important thing to remember is that it is only a Republican proposal. In a Republican Congress, it is an impressive work of political deal-cutting. In the two-party world beyond Capitol Hill, it stands no chance of becoming law without major changes. 
 The best way to regard the seven-year, $898 billion package of deficit reduction is as a marker -- an opening statement of Republican fiscal ideology in a battle with Democrats for control of the Federal purse. And what it says is that that ideology is moving to the right.
The plan contains a mix of proposals that the Senate and House offered a month ago, when they first issued separate blueprints for achieving fiscal balance. Each side made some concessions, but on the biggest issues -- tax cuts and defense spending -- Mr. Gingrich and the revolutionaries who led the Republicans to victory last fall won the day.
The Speaker secured a commitment to enact virtually all the tax breaks the House had sought at a higher cost than the Senate's negotiators first said they could stomach. To pay for those cuts and still reach a balance, the new budget runs higher annual deficits in its first years than the Senate wanted, and cuts spending more deeply in later years than it preferred.
Mr. Gingrich also prevailed on welfare, where the budget plan adopts the House's proposal for deeper spending cuts than the Senate preferred. He largely prevailed in winning deeper cuts in Medicare spending. And he conceded -- for now -- that the only Cabinet agency to vanish under Republican rule is the Commerce Department, but the Speaker's aides say that battle is not over.
The Senate won an important assurance that the tax cuts would not take effect until budget experts certify that the deficit was in fact on a path toward zero as planned. But should a worsening economy or other factors change that path after the tax cuts are enacted, there is no real guarantee that Congress would rescind the breaks in the name of fiscal responsibility.
The shifts are small. At the day's end, all Republicans favor balancing the budget and all Republicans want to cut taxes, either now or sometime later. And all Republicans want the smaller Government that this budget would produce.
The difference is that the Senate, and Old Guard Republicans, would proceed cautiously, out of concern that they would harm the economy or the fabric of the Government itself. The budget proposal that the party's leadership agreed to on Thursday is clearly in a much greater hurry.
Senator Dole, the party's senior leader and its front-runner in the 1996 Presidential race, rose to power in an era when deficits were a matter of fiscal rather than political concern and tax cuts were rare. But he faces a fair number of Republican revolutionaries in his own chamber, and he needs the party's right wing if he is to prosper in the primary elections to come. So his views on the final shape of the budget package were muted, at least in public.
The House may come to regret its insistence on big tax cuts if the economy sours, deficits start rising again and the Republican pledge to balance the budget begins to look like political puffery, said Kevin Phillips, the author and conservative political analyst.
"But on its face, it looks like the differences were split in Gingrich's favor," he said today.
The new budget plan still must be ratified in separate House and Senate votes next week, but few anticipate that Mr. Dole or Mr. Gingrich will have much trouble rounding up the votes they need on its behalf.
How much it matters is a different question. The budget proposal may affirm Mr. Gingrich's status as a rising force in Republican politics, as if that were needed. But the remainder of the budget battle will be fought on a broader field.
Having promised in their campaigns to cut spending, and having said this week roughly how they plan to cut it, Republicans now have to make the actual cuts, in scores of committee meetings and floor votes.
Political and budgetary experts, many of whom have underestimated the party's resolve before, predict a rising chorus of protest from both Democratic and Republican voters as the reality of spending reductions and curtailed Government services begins to sink in.
Most Republicans will surely stick to their deficit-reduction pledge. But most will not be enough: The Republicans can afford to lose only 4 of their 54 votes in the Senate and 14 of their 231 votes in the House before losing majority control on spending and tax issues.
Those same slim margins make it highly unlikely that either the House or the Senate could override a Presidential veto of spending bills this fall. That means President Clinton will have a decisive say in the final shape of the 1996 budget, regardless of what Congress does this summer.
And Mr. Clinton has already made it clear that the Republican proposals at the core of the new budget agreement -- the big tax cut and the deep reductions in projected spending for Medicaid, Medicare and welfare -- will not survive in any final spending package.
Republicans in Mr. Gingrich's camp have got this far, budget analysts note, by refusing to compromise on their ideology. But in the end they almost certainly will have to decide whether to compromise and gain some of their goal, or fight and lose some.

HEADLINE: Clinton Calls G.O.P. Plan On Budget 'Too Extreme'

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., June 23

 BODY:
A day after Republican Congressional leaders reached an agreement on a seven-year blueprint for tax cuts and a balanced budget, President Clinton today began a public campaign to set out the differences between a plan he called "too extreme" and his own proposal to erase the deficit over 10 years.
In a conference call with five Democratic governors, Mr. Clinton said the Republican budget plan, which would cut a variety of taxes by $245 billion and sharply scale back Federal spending, would "complicate your lives as governors considerably." He said the Republican proposal would shift to the states new responsibilities even as the magnitude of the cuts risked sending the nation into an economic downturn. 
 "I believe that their plan is still too extreme, runs a significant risk of putting the economy into recession and raising unemployment," Mr. Clinton said.
Congressional negotiators never seriously considered Mr. Clinton's alternative 10-year plan, which he unveiled in a television address last week. That plan called for less severe reductions in social programs and taxes and would have protected education and some other domestic initiatives.
But the President indicated that he believed the debate was far from over as Congress moves into a phase this summer of passing the individual spending bills for 1996 that will put the budget plan into effect.
"Now that the Senate and House have resolved their differences, we can proceed to what I hope will be an honest open and civil discussion with the American people about the agreements and the differences in our two plans," he said. "And I hope in the end we'll wind up doing a balanced budget in the right way that will grow the economy."
The conference call with the five governors, broadcast over a sound system for reporters, preceded Mr. Clinton's address to a second $1,000-a-plate campaign fund-raiser in two days, this time in his home state in a ballroom of the Excelsior Hotel that was named for him after he was elected President.
Democrats packed the room, the largest hotel conference room in Arkansas, bringing in more than $1 million for Mr. Clinton's re-election campaign. But the event had its bittersweet moments in a state that has seen a number of its prominent citizens come under indictment or legal scrutiny since Mr. Clinton became President.
Showing touches of nostalgia for simpler times in Arkansas, Hillary Rodham Clinton deplored the "politics of meanness."
And Mr. Clinton said, "You know, some nights I watch the news, and I feel like that old country song, 'They Changed Everything About Me But My Name.' "
The audience rose to a standing ovation when Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the lifelong friend of Mr. Clinton who serves as counselor to the President, introduced the state's Democratic governor, Jim Guy Tucker. Mr. Tucker was arraigned Thursday on charges of fraud brought by Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater special prosecutor. The crowd applauded again when Mr. Clinton said he was "especially grateful" for the ovation granted to his successor as governor.
Mr. Tucker pleaded not guilty to the charges, which stem from his purchase and sale of cable television interests in 1987.
For the second day in a row, Mr. Clinton criticized the Republican Senate for blocking the nomination of Dr. Henry W. Foster Jr. as Surgeon General, saying Democrats could have kept Justice Clarence Thomas off the Supreme Court if they had followed a similar strategy of using a filibuster to prevent the nomination from coming to a vote. "In this new world there are no rules except winning and losing," Mr. Clinton said in deploring the Republican tactics, "because one side is all good and the other side is all bad."
His voice becoming soft and impassioned, he blamed those same tactics for the troubles that have befallen colleagues in Arkansas since the Whitewater inquiry began into the real estate land dealings of the Clintons and after the suicide of the deputy White House counsel, Vincent W. Foster, Jr., who had been a partner with Mrs. Clinton at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock.
"A lot of what's happened to you here, a lot of the outrageous, outrageous things that have been said in our state, and a lot of the licking that you've taken," Mr. Clinton said, "is a product of the confusion and the disorientation of the times, and the idea that there are no rules and people just sort of flailing around trying to win another one to get to tomorrow."
He added: "That is not what made this country great. And it's not what you taught me to do here."
Saying "the stakes are the highest they've ever been," Mr. Clinton urged his supporters to help him in his re-election fight for his economic priorities and for a politics that is more civil. "It's my last election," he said to laughter. "I'll never run for anything else. You'll never have to come to one of these again."

HEADLINE: Road Gets Bumpy for Electric Car, And Presidential Politics Is Blamed

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
The future of the electric automobile, always uncertain, now appears tangled in Republican Presidential politics.
California requires that in the 1998 model year, 2 percent of the cars sold by major auto makers in that state have "zero emissions," and Gov. Pete Wilson has generally supported the program. But Mr. Wilson is running for President and has recently taken steps that advocates of the cars say amount to laying the groundwork for eviscerating the electric car plan to placate four Republicans whose support he needs for the nomination. 
 Officials in the Wilson administration deny the accusation.
The four Republicans Mr. Wilson is supposedly courting are all Midwestern Governors: John Engler of Michigan, Jim Edgar of Illinois, Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin and George V. Voinovich of Ohio. They sent a letter to Mr. Wilson on May 1 saying the "zero emission vehicles" that California will require would be of little environmental benefit and would be so expensive that they would have to be subsidized by raising the cost of conventional automobiles, which they said would cost jobs in their states. Instead, they endorsed a compromise drafted by the auto companies, calling for the production of conventional cars for all 50 states that are cleaner than what Federal law now requires.
"We are willing to organize and participate with you in an event here in one of the Great Lakes states, or anywhere else you choose, to announce your support for a national clean car," the Governors said. "Pete, your leadership can benefit the economy and the environment for all Americans."
All four states have their Presidential primaries on Feb. 19, 1996.
Mr. Wilson rejected the Governors' appeal, but he did call for a new "audit" to determine whether the electric car program was practical. The California Air Resources Board, which conceived the electric car program in 1990 as part of a broader strategy for cleaner cars, has held a technology review every two years, and will begin another one later this year to see if all phases of its requirements are working out. But this audit would be performed by outside experts, probably a panel of academics and consultants.
"We're not implying that we don't have confidence in the Air Resources Board, and we're not implying that they haven't done a good job," said Paul Kranhold, a spokesman for the Wilson campaign. The zero-emission vehicle quota rises to 10 percent in 2003, and Mr. Kranhold said, "The bottom line is that on a decision of this magnitude by a regulatory agency, the people deserve the benefit of this type of audit."
A major figure in the maneuvering is Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, who is also Mr. Wilson's national campaign finance chairman. Massachusetts, along with New York, has adopted the California plan and has come under intense pressure from the auto industry to drop it. Mr. Weld recently sent a letter to Mr. Wilson suggesting that the two states conduct a joint review of the technology. Electric car advocates say they fear that the auto industry and the oil industry, which also dislikes electric cars, have enough fund-raising power to sway Mr. Weld and Mr. Wilson.
"I obviously can't prove what's on Governor Weld's mind," said Joseph L. Caves, a lobbyist in Sacramento, Calif., who represents the Union of Concerned Scientists and other proponents of electric cars. "But it appears to me that this decision has as much to do with Presidential politics as with environmental quality."
"The Wilson administration and its appointees have consistently supported the Air Resources Board, until he decided to run for President," he said. "There's never been any indication before that this decision was going to be made on anything other than its importance to the California air quality program. Now our concern is Presidential politics has entered into it."
State and Federal officials outside California raise the same fear, although they do so only in private. For years the Air Resources Board has pioneered the regulations that led to new technologies on automobiles, like catalytic converters.
But officials in the Wilson and Weld administrations say seeking another review is just being prudent.
At the California Environmental Protection Agency, the parent body of the Air Resources Board, Daniel F. Pellissier, a spokesman, said, "Pete Wilson has made it clear the environmental decisions in the state of California made by our agency are being driven by the environmental needs of California, end of statement, period, paragraph."
In the East, 12 states from Virginia to Maine, plus the District of Columbia, said they would adopt the California plan of rising proportions of ever-cleaner vehicles, but only two, Massachusetts and New York, said they would require zero-emission vehicles. The auto companies, complaining of a logistics nightmare in a fragmented national market, offered their compromise for all states but California: a car cleaner than the Federal standard but not quite as clean as that in the California plan. The companies later offered California the same arrangement.
Many of the Eastern states said they liked the idea, but the auto companies are demanding that New York and Massachusetts drop the electric-car requirement first.
But whether or not the requirements change, the discussion could make investors nervous, say officials at CalStart, a not-for-profit consortium, partly financed by the state, that promotes electric vehicle technology. "In California, folks have invested over $500 million already in this effort, with much more estimated to come within the next two years," said Michael J. Gage, president of the consortium.
The auto companies, meanwhile continue to maintain that the electric car is not ready for major marketing. Advocates, though, point to the performance of a new electric model in a race last month. A four-passenger sedan built by Solectria, of Wilmington, Mass., with approximately the same interior space as a Ford Taurus, it traveled 238 miles over public roads without recharging.
The car used nickel metal hydride batteries, a type that is already common in laptop computers. General Motors and the company that holds the patent, Ovonic, are gearing up to mass produce the battery in sizes appropriate for cars.

HEADLINE: Raghavan Narasimhan Iyer, 65, An Expert on East-West Cultures

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Raghavan Narasimhan Iyer, a philosopher, author and professor emeritus of political science at the University of California at Santa Barbara, died on Tuesday at St. Francis Medical Center in Santa Barbara. He was 65 and lived in Santa Barbara.
The cause was complications from pneumonia, said his son, Pico Iyer. 
 Dr. Iyer (pronounced EYE-er) was educated at Oxford University, and his work bridged the cultures of East and West, old and new. His writings and lectures could be spellbinding as he drew from sources from Plato to the Bhagavad-Gita, the Sanskrit poem and classic of Hinduism, from Agatha Christie to the pop songwriter Jackson Browne.
He wrote and edited scores of articles, book chapters and books. His body of work included "The Moral and Political Thought of Mahatma Gandhi" (Oxford University Press, 1973), which reflected his knowledge of the histories, philosophies and literatures of diverse worlds and placed Gandhi in the context of Plato, Kant, Buddha and Jesus.
Another notable book was "Parapolitics: Toward the City of Man" (Oxford, 1979). It gave his view on large-scale political theory with reflections on such themes as commitment and over-commitment, the relation of means to ends, the morality of revolution and the hazards of democracy in underdeveloped countries.
He increasingly became involved in theosophy, a system of thought akin to mysticism that claims special insight into the nature of God and the world. He was a leading member of the Santa Barbara branch of the United Lodge of Theosophists.
In 1976 he founded the Institute of World Culture in Santa Barbara, of which he was president until 1986. Its purpose is to explore the cultures of East and West and their interaction through history.
Dr. Iyer was born in Madras, India, and studied at the University of Bombay, earning a master's in economics. He won a Rhodes Scholarship in 1950 and studied philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford, where he was elected president of the Oxford Union and received a doctorate in moral and political philosophy.
In addition to his son, a travel writer who lives in Santa Barbara, Dr. Iyer is survived by his wife of 40 years, Nandini Mehta Iyer, a professor of religious studies at Santa Barbara.

HEADLINE: May Orders For Durables Jumped 2.5%

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
Orders and shipments of factory equipment and other costly manufactured goods surged in May, as business and consumer demand remained strong despite signs in other recent Government statistics that the economy was slowing.
 But most economists concluded that the extra manufacturing activity was not enough by itself to change the course of the economy or alter the Federal Reserve's policy on interest rates. 
 "We've seen some temporary bounce-back, which gives you some confidence" that the economy will not slide into a recession, said Richard B. Berner, the chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. But, he added, "These data don't convince me that the economy is poised for a rebound yet."
 Stock and bond prices dropped at the opening after the Commerce Department's announcement of the statistics on orders and shipments, as investors initially decided that senior Federal Reserve officials were slightly less likely to cut short-term interest rates at their next policy meeting on July 5 and 6.
 But prices soon recovered as analysts played down the importance of the figures, and the Dow Jones industrial average closed with a loss of just 3.80 points. [Page 37.] Bond prices ended the day slightly lower, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rising to 6.49 percent from 6.47 percent. [Page 36.] Yields and prices move in opposite directions.
 New orders for durable goods -- which range from washing machines to aircraft -- rose 2.5 percent in May after falling 4.5 percent in April, the Commerce Department said. It was the first increase since January. Shipments climbed nine-tenths of a percent in May after dropping 2.2 percent in April.
 Eric Falkenstein, an economist at Keycorp, a Cleveland-based banking company, said that he doubted that today's figures would dissuade those Federal Reserve officials who believed that the central bank should be cutting interest rates soon. "It didn't recoup the fall in the prior month, so if anything, I think this pushed the Fed further toward an ease," he said.
 Mr. Berner said that some of the improvement in orders might reflect a strengthening of demand from abroad after the dollar's fall in currency markets this spring. To the extent that is true, then business confidence may not be as strong as today's report suggests, making the domestic economy appear slightly less robust.
 Since the statistics on durable goods often show big swings from one month to the next, many experts distrust the figures for any single month. Today's figures were also an advance estimate, subject to revision.
 Orders and shipments of transportation equipment, like cars and planes, are particularly volatile. Those orders rose 3 percent in May after a fall of 10.2 percent in April, but shipments dropped for the fourth consecutive month.
 Economists were more encouraged by the orders for factory equipment and other gear used to produce goods and services. Orders for nonmilitary capital goods, an indicator of business confidence in future sales, climbed 6.8 percent in May after dropping 5.9 percent in April. Shipments were up just seven-tenths of 1 percent, after being unchanged in April.
 Nonmilitary capital goods include everything from steam turbines and computer equipment to ship components and furnaces.
 Orders rose even more sharply for military capital goods, which range from tanks to missiles. These orders increased 9.5 percent in May after plunging 27.7 percent in April.
 Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment were particularly strong, bouncing back from a dip in April to register the eighth increase in 10 months.
 Backlogs of unfilled orders for all types of durable goods, an important indicator of future economic activity, were unchanged in May, after falling by half a percent in April.

HEADLINE: State to Hire A Work Force At Javits Hall

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
Moving to break the grip that mob-influenced labor unions have long held over hiring practices at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, the state will soon begin hiring its own permanent work force there, stripping the unions of their rights to assign workers, officials said yesterday.
 The changes, they say, should sharply reduce what trade show exhibitors have described as exorbitant costs that they have had to pay to union workers for constructing booths and providing supplies. 
 Since the center opened in 1986, the three union locals representing teamsters, carpenters and other exhibition workers have wielded enormous power over the operations of the center. Because the unions had signed collective bargaining contracts with exhibition companies and contractors, they -- and not the Javits Center -- had the power to fill the jobs, which pay between $30,000 and $90,000 a year.
 Recent investigations by state officials and a court-appointed monitor have found that the influence of organized crime on the Javits unions is pervasive and that jobs there were routinely awarded to former convicts and mob-connected union members.
 Under the new plan, the state will begin hiring at least 500 new employees, all of whom will be screened to eliminate those with extensive criminal records or ties to organized crime.
 Although some of the workers may come from the current union rolls, officials said the jobs will be open to anyone, and they expect that about 200 carpenters, teamsters and exposition employees with tainted backgrounds will be permanently removed from the work force.
 "We want to clean up the enormous featherbedding that we now have as well as the notorious presence of organized crime," said Robert E. Boyle, the center's new executive director. "Whether we will succeed in doing that is still questionable."
 The new work rules are the latest in a series of crackdowns on organized crime in New York City. On Thursday state prosecutors indicted some of the largest garbage haulers in the city, and other recent efforts have focused on the Fulton Fish Market and the trucking industry in the garment district.
 The newly hired personnel will become state employees and will be subject to provisions of the state's Taylor Law, which prohibits strikes by state employees. In a radical departure from previous hiring practices at the Javits Center, officials said they would advertise the job openings in New York City and upstate newspapers.
 The officials said that new work rules will reduce the number of employees needed for shows and conventions and reduce costs for exhibitors by up to 40 percent. In some instances, the officials said, a single employee will perform the unloading and construction tasks that under old agreements had required four or five workers.
 Law-enforcement officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that hiring booths for new applicants would be open at the center within two weeks. A squad of 25 state troopers will patrol the center when the hirings begin because of the possibility of demonstrations by current workers who are expected to be banned permanently from seeking jobs.
 For years, trade show exhibitors have complained about inflated labor costs, rules that require the hiring of unneeded workers, thefts, inadequate security and poor maintenance. In fact, some trade-show organizers say they have moved their exhibitions to other cities, draining money from New York's economy.
 In March, Gov. George E. Pataki branded conditions at the center as intolerable and appointed Mr. Boyle, a longtime supporter who had no experience in managing convention halls, as the center's top official and directed him to launch a cleanup campaign.
 In an interview yesterday, Mr. Boyle declined to comment on specific aspects of the hiring plan or when it will begin. "All I can say is that we are continuing to negotiate with the unions and we are reviewing all contracts," he said. Most of the center's employees unload materials for exhibitions and construct the booths and exhibits for trade shows and meetings. The number of daily employees can range widely -- from as few as 50 to as many as 1,000 -- depending on the size of a trade show or convention.
 The center's new managers say they are not bound by the old collective bargaining agreements and are negotiating revised terms with the unions. Under the new arrangement, the unions will have to seek certification as collective-bargaining agents by proving that they represent at least 50 percent of the employees in one of two new personnel divisions that the center will establish: the freight and erection units.
 State and union officials said that the center's negotiators have demanded that the unions accept their new terms on wages, welfare benefits and working conditions, before being permitted to seek recognition as the bargaining agent for either unit.
 On Thursday, Ron Carey, the general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said that Teamsters Local 807 had accepted the new terms. In March, Mr. Carey ousted the top leaders of the local, charging that it was controlled by the Mafia, and appointed a trustee to run it.
 Matt Witt, a spokesman for Mr. Carey, said yesterday, "The hiring is now up to the Javits management." He said the union would urge Local 807 members who had previously been denied jobs by former union leaders to seek employment there.
 Mr. Witt said the union expected to win recognition in the freight unit and that wage scales would not be cut. But state officials said that the center had eliminated a clause that paid many teamsters about $5,000 a year as Christmas bonuses.
 State officials said that they expected that the District Council of Carpenters would also accept the new terms and seek to represent employees in the erection unit. The council has been accused by Federal prosecutors of being dominated by the Genovese crime family, and it is being monitored under a court order by Kenneth Conboy, a former Federal judge.
 Bernard B. Cohen, the council's chief lawyer, said the union "is concerned that honest, hard-working carpenters should not be laid off because of this new program." He said that Frederick W. Devine, the council's president, had been asked by aides to Governor Pataki and to Mr. Boyle not to discuss the specifics of the negotiations.
 Negotiations with the third union, the Exposition Employees Workers Union, Local 807, will begin Monday, said Jay McNamee, the union's secretary and treasurer. Law-enforcement officials said that the local also has been infiltrated by organized-crime figures and that the union has many featherbedding or unnecessary jobs at the center.
 Mr. McNamee declined to discuss the new hiring plan.
 Prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney's office said that the three unions are being investigated in connection with Mafia ties and corruption. In 1992, that office obtained the indictments of 27 men, including officials of the three unions, on charges of extortion and theft at the center.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Retreat After Durables Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities retreated in quiet trading yesterday as a strong report on durable goods caused traders to reassess the chances of a cut in short-term interest rates.
 The 30-year bond fell 13/32 , to a price of 11425/32 for a yield of 6.49 percent, up from 6.47 percent on Thursday. Shorter-maturity bill rates were also weaker, as were the intermediate-term notes. 
 Prices fell after the Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items ranging from air-conditioners to aircraft -- jumped 2.5 percent. The market had been expecting an increase of two-tenths to seven-tenths of 1 percent.
 The report suggested that the economy might not be slowing as sharply as previously thought, which could forestall an expected cut in interest rates by the Fed when its policy makers next meet in early July.
 But the durable goods report tends to be volatile from month to month. So while the stronger-than-expected numbers may have put a dent in the case for a Fed cut in rates, they have not greatly damaged it. Traders say that is why coming data will still be critical and as Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, noted recently, there are still considerable uncertainties in the economy.
 "The process of assessing and fine- tuning monetary policy, and ultimately the economy, is a complex and gradual one," said Carroll J. Delaney, director of research at Stires, O'Donnell & Company. "The market's recent meteoric rise, on the other hand, has been anything but complex and gradual. Sooner or later the piper must be paid. We tend to think sooner."
 But the market's view of Fed policy is not the only factor moving prices. Peter McTeague, a market analyst with MCM Moneywatch, a market research and analysis firm in Boston, said quarter-end pressures to enhance money managers' portfolio performance were helping to drive the market. Expectations about the Fed's next move, he said, "are running wild and there's a real big chance of disappointment."
 The market must also turn its attention next week to a new supply of two-year and five-year notes. The two-year notes will be auctioned on Tuesday, and the five-year notes on Wednesday. In when-issued trading late yesterday, the two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 5.57 percent and the five-year notes at a price to yield 5.80 percent.
 Rusty Vanneman, a senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said the market was "just simply overextended." He noted that the futures bond contract, which established a high of 116 in early June, reached 11530/32 yesterday.
 "What this implies is that the market does not have enough gas to go beyond that level," he said. "And raises the possibility of a double top, or a resistance level that will be a formidable obstacle in the future.
 "From a technical standpoint the market is essentially trading in a range and coiling for its next big move."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Weakens as Hopes Fade For German Interest Rate Cut

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was weaker yesterday after reports of accelerating German inflation dashed speculation that the Bundesbank would soon cut interest rates.
 Lower German rates would have helped the dollar by making bank deposits denominated in marks less attractive. 
 The dollar was little changed against the yen. Traders hesitated to sell dollars while the United States and Japan continue negotiations on automotive trade. Washington plans to impose sanctions on imports of Japanese luxury cars on Wednesday if no agreement is reached.
 "There are a number of conflicting tides affecting the dollar," said Varick Martin, manager of currency trading at the Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company. "With the German price data, interest rate cuts in Europe seem further away now than yesterday."
 The dollar also suffered from a drop in bond prices yesterday in the United States, said Olli Enqvist, chief currency dealer at Skandaviska Enskilda Banken in New York. Lower bond prices hurt the dollar as foreign investors shy away from American assets.
 In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.3863 marks from 1.3981 marks on Thursday. The dollar slipped to 84.26 yen from 84.54 yen. The British pound, which fell on Thursday after Prime Minister John Major's announcement that he was resigning as leader of the ruling Conservative Party, edged back to $1.6066 from 1.5962.
 The dollar fell against the mark after the German states of Hesse, Baden-Wurttemberg and Rhine-Westphalia announced that consumer price increases were larger in June than May.
 The reports reduce the chances of annualized inflation slowing to the Bundesbank's target of 2 percent and throw a rate cut into doubt, said a Bundesbank council member, Guntram Palm. "These latest numbers make such a step tougher and more difficult," Mr. Palm said. Inflation in western Germany was 2.2 percent in May.
 The Bundesbank last reduced official rates March 30, when it lowered its discount rate to 4 percent from 4.5 percent.
 "The German price data and Palm's comments hurt the dollar," said Vicki Schmelzer Alicea, a currency saleswoman at Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale.
 The uncertainty surrounding the auto trade negotiations between the United States and Japan will help prevent a significant decline by the dollar, traders said.

HEADLINE: The Trash-Hauling Indictments

 BODY:
For half a century New York City has been prey to Mafia racketeers who control the commercial waste-hauling industry. Restaurants, hospitals, universities and businesses have been systematically gouged with prices 40 percent higher than an honest market would charge for their waste disposal. Now prosecutors have finally attacked the corruption broadly, with an indictment against 17 individuals, several of them associated with organized crime families, 23 carting companies and 4 trade associations accused of ripping off the city.
District Attorney Robert Morgenthau must still prove the 114 counts in the indictment. But there is no doubt about the city's long victimization. The $1.5 billion yearly business in hauling New York's trash should draw competitors from all over. Instead it is dominated by a mosaic of market-splitting cartels whose monopoly practices are enforced by mob muscle the moment an honest competitor seeks a slice of the business. 
 When Browning-Ferris Industries, a huge nationwide waste hauler, sought entry into the city's markets, a company executive's wife found a dog's severed head at their front door with a note, "Welcome to New York," tucked in its mouth. The company repeatedly found its low bids rejected, evidently because customers were too terrified to switch. When Browning-Ferris sought help from law enforcement, the District Attorney welcomed it to an investigation already under way since 1989.
The indictment cites violence and arson threats against potential competitors or any haulers who wanted to break ranks and compete with other cartelists. From an undercover detective who posed as an executive of a hauling company comes a charge that the cartel charged him more than $790,000 in trade association "dues" just to enjoy the business he had earned by a low bid.
Mr. Morgenthau seeks more than criminal convictions. He asks the courts for forfeitures and the appointment of receivers who will introduce competition. He hopes to draw outside bidders with a new climate and a safe environment. Similar reforms imposed on Long Island under Federal court supervision are beginning to take effect on equally notorious mob organizations that controlled trash collection there.
A secure victory will need an economic as well as a police response. Other haulers must enter the market, and existing haulers must compete with them and each other. Business customers, some of them huge corporations, must find the courage to shift their valuable patronage to low bidders.
Mark Green, the city's Public Advocate, has a promising bill in the City Council that could anchor the economic response. He proposes experimental collection districts where a single low bidder wins all the business in an area of several blocks now served by numerous small, non-competing carters.
It is time for the Council and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a former prosecutor, to address this longer-term reform. Meanwhile New York can take pride in its newfound courage to break with 50 years of defeatist bondage to plundering trash haulers.

HEADLINE: Bad News for Workers

 BODY:
The economy has grown steadily for four years. Productivity -- output per hour of work -- shot up by 2 percent last year and by a gaudy 2.7 percent annual rate at the beginning of this year. Profits are near record levels and stock prices have surged 15 percent since January. By some measures, these are bountiful times.
But not for many workers. A disturbing report released this week by the Labor Department shows that average wages and salaries fell by more than 2 percent, after accounting for inflation, between March 1994 and March 1995. Total compensation, which includes fringe benefits like health insurance, fell even more, by about 3 percent. A big factor in that decline was health benefits, which fell 8 percent for unclear reasons. The losses were not caused by workers shifting from high-paying manufacturing to low-paying service jobs. 
 For long stretches of American history, the shares of total income going to low-paid workers, high-paid workers and owners of capital rarely budged. But in the 1970's, unskilled workers began to fall rapidly behind skilled workers. Even so, workers kept pace with owners of capital. Wages tracked productivity growth, so that as workers produced more -- with the help of more and better equipment -- they were paid more.
Now, according to new data, even that trend seems broken: for the past two years, wages have risen more slowly than the growth of output. As a consequence, the share of income going to workers has fallen since 1993.
Experts will need time to determine if the new data hold up under scrutiny. But if they do, the important yet unanswered question is whether labor's plight is temporary. There is growing suspicion that stagnation of wages might be due to permanent structural forces. One indication is that wages appear to be falling behind productivity in Western Europe as well. Perhaps the cause is modern technology. Perhaps it is global competition or the demise of powerful unions. No matter what the explanation turns out to be, the trends will not be easily reversed.
If the wages of those who work continue to lag behind returns to those who own places of work, the social consequences could be explosive. That is why the budget fight between the White House and Congress takes on an importance beyond politics.
President Clinton's budget would do far more to help workers than would the Republicans' proposals. The President narrowed the differences between his budget and theirs, but did not eliminate them. He would preserve public investments in training, education and research -- investments that can pay off in higher-wage jobs. The G.O.P. chops much of these investments away. The President's tax break for tuition payments is badly targeted and wasteful, but is still smarter than the Republican proposals to riddle the code with new tax shelters.
Although taxes and budget policy have little to do with recent trends in wages and profits, the Republicans will exacerbate income disparities by pushing a tax package that puts most of the savings in the pockets of wealthy families. Washington may not have the answers to the plight of workers. But it surely need not make matters worse.

HEADLINE: A Bridge to the 21st Century

BYLINE: By Alfred A. DelliBovi; Alfred A. DelliBovi, president of the Home Loan Bank of New York, was Deputy Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Bush Administration.

 BODY:
Think of it this way. A certain Monsieur Antoine boards the Concorde at 11 A.M. in Paris, crosses the Atlantic, takes a high-speed airport link to a renewed Times Square, enjoys lunch with a glass of red wine on 46th Street's Restaurant Row, takes in a matinee on Broadway and returns to the airport in time for a slower overnight flight home. And at no point does he worry about gridlock and missed connections.
That is a fanciful idea today. But it is precisely the vision New York must keep in mind if it hopes to remain a world-class international city tomorrow. 
 The transportation system is antiquated, especially its links to LaGuardia and Kennedy Airports. Getting to and from the airports is expensive -- especially for the ordinary citizen whose $35 cab rides are not underwritten by a benevolent employer. It is also chancy, with possible traffic jams everywhere, which of course slow down city buses to the airports.
This means the city loses money, because the traveler who survives this arduous journey has little energy to do anything else after arriving in Manhattan. And this is why New Yorkers must rethink two imaginative transportation proposals. If done right, both offer great benefits to residents and visitors alike. The first is the Port Authority project to link LaGuardia and Kennedy airports to the city. The second is the proposed 42d Street trolley.
There is general agreement on the need for a high-speed link to the planes. But the Port Authority's plan needs revision. The notion of placing the Manhattan terminus at 59th Street and Lexington Avenue has aroused strong opposition among East Siders. In addition, the costs of reconfiguring the 59th Street Bridge (reducing it by two lanes) and building a spur to Grand Central Terminal under Madison Avenue are considerable.
The Port Authority estimates the cost of redoing the bridge to accommodate a rail line at $135 million and the cost of the underground spur at $600 million. That is a big chunk of the total estimated project cost of $2.5 to $3 billion.
The long-planned 42d Street trolley has also generated criticism. A trolley makes economic sense compared to elevated or underground alternatives. Reputable estimates suggest that a trolley running westward from the United Nations to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, would cost less than $100 million, including rolling stock and a maintenance facility, But skeptics question whether it could generate enough passenger revenue to operate the service and pay off the original capital costs of construction.
There is an answer to both problems: a new East River crossing at 42d Street -- a bridge to the 21st century. A Port Authority white paper did, in fact, explore the alternative of such a bridge. The study concluded that it would cost $213 million more than it would to reconfigure the 59th Street Bridge. It also foresaw a complicated and unattractive station on the East Side -- an unsightly three-story structure that would cross the river at the 130-foot clearance required by the Federal Government for the East River ship lanes.
But there is another way to cross the river: construct an adjustable bridge -- a conventional drawbridge or a bridge that can go up or down hydraulically. It would rise either from the existing 42d Street ramp of the Franklin R. Roosevelt Drive or a new ramp and would cross the river's navigation channels at 65 feet above mean high water.
This height level, which matches the height level on the Intracoastal Waterway, is sufficient for most river traffic. Besides, the bridge could be elevated to accommodate the occasional ship requiring clearance of up to 130 feet. An informal survey of East River traffic suggests this would occur no more than once a month, and probably less.
An adjustable bridge would obviously cost less than the Port Authority's 59th Street alternative. There would be no need to build a tunnel between Lexington Avenue and the existing 59th Street bridge and no need to build a separate tunnel to Grand Central. At 42d Street, passengers arriving at Grand Central could board the trolley, which in short order would have them on their way to the bridge and then to the airport.
The bridge would boost ridership on the trolley because it would link key destinations in Manhattan -- the Javits Center, Port Authority Bus Terminal, Times Square, Grand Central and the United Nations -- with the LaGuardia and Kennedy gateways.
Visually, the bridge would be less intrusive than a permanent structure with approaches reaching several blocks into Manhattan. An international competition, perhaps sponsored by the Municipal Art Society, could yield an imaginative design for what might well be the world's longest movable span.
The Port Authority should develop a plan that would make this vision a reality in affordable steps. In doing so, it would assure robust passenger revenues for the trolley and make it far easier and cheaper than it is today for travelers to move comfortably to and from the airports. It would also restore the Port Authority's long tradition as a force for regional economic development.

HEADLINE: METHOD & MADNESS;
The Great Escape

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WADE 

 BODY:
TECHNOLOGY MAY BE THE engine of progress but its milestones are historic disasters -- Titanic, Hindenburg, Chernobyl, Challenger. Even its successes are built on unemployment and bankruptcy, the social costs that must be paid if the loom is to displace the hand shuttle and the sail yield to steam.
These destructive forces were brought to mind by a voice-mail message I received last month from a stranger, asking me to call about a "personal matter." The caller turned out to be a historian, Michael A. Findlay, who is studying the artifacts now being brought up from the wreck site of the Titanic two and half miles deep in the Atlantic Ocean. His news was that my grandfather's property tag had been recovered. 
 My grandfather was a high-school science teacher, 35, when he boarded the Titanic on April 10, 1912. The ship, the largest and most luxurious in the world, was bound on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York. Its owner, the White Star Line, described it as an "unsinkable lifeboat" because of its advanced safety features, including a double bottom and watertight compartments.
As is well known, the Titanic carried only as many lifeboats as the law then required, which was far too few for its 2,208 passengers and crew. Traveling at high speed on a moonless night, ignoring radio warnings of an unusual ice field in the area, the great vessel ran across an iceberg, which gashed through its metal plates like a can opener. Within two and a half hours the unsinkable ship had sunk, with the loss of 1,503 lives.
Though the captain knew at once that the Titanic was doomed, he did not warn the passengers of their imminent peril, and many refused to enter the first lifeboats. One reason for my grandfather's survival was that he had taken a keen interest in the ship's operation and realized from the outset of the collision that it was in danger of sinking. Another was his fortuitous decision to ignore a rumor that men were to be taken off from the port side and women from the starboard. While the other men moved to the opposite side of the deck, he stayed on the starboard side, and when no more women could be found on his deck to take places in an early lifeboat, a crew member told him to jump in. Though at this stage the passengers had no idea that there were not enough lifeboats, my grandfather seized the chance.
As his lifeboat rowed away from the Titanic, he could see the lines of lighted portholes, strangely unparallel with the sea surface. He watched the bow portholes slip farther and farther beneath the water. Then the stern rose slowly until the great ship stood vertically in the sea, all its lights still ablaze. There was a roar as of heavy machinery tearing loose from its mountings. For five minutes more the ship remained like a dark column in the water, then slid slowly from view.
As those in the lifeboats stared awe-struck across the icily calm waters at where their ship had been, they were appalled by an unexpected sound: the screams of the drowning, which continued for some 40 minutes until they fell silent one by one.
On board the rescue ship, the Carpathia, my grandfather decided to write an account of his experiences in order, as he loftily explained, "to calm public opinion and to forestall the incorrect and hysterical accounts which some American reporters are in the habit of preparing on occasions of this kind." His book, "The Loss of the Titanic," by Lawrence Beesley, was widely praised as one of the most accurate accounts of the disaster.
The shipwreck was a blow to the confidence of the age, and I think it also shook my grandfather's trust in science and technology. In postgraduate research at Cambridge University he had discovered a rare alga, which was named after him, Ulvella beesleyi. He was proud of being a great-great-great-grandson, though through an illegitimate line, of Sir Richard Arkwright, whose invention of the water-powered spinning frame transformed cotton manufacturing in the late 1700's and helped to bring about the industrial revolution.
But after his escape from the Titanic, my grandfather dabbled in all kinds of fringe science, as if to hedge his belief in rational inquiry. He practiced Christian Science and attended spiritualist seances. I remember as a child playing with a Ouija board he had, and watching him show off his expertise with a water-divining rod. Even then it seemed to me odd that so many underground torrents should course beneath his suburban garden.
His life, in a sense, had been changed by the turbulent forces of technical progress that his ancestor's spinning frame had unleashed. The weavers put out of work by Arkwright's machines tried to destroy his mills, but the decision made then to choose new technology over Luddism has seldom been revisited, at least in open societies. Yet the choice is fraught with dangers. To win backers and foil opponents, the promoters of a new technology often exaggerate its benefits and underplay its risks. The more glamorous a new undertaking, the keener are its advocates to dismiss disaster as unthinkable.
HAVING ESCAPED BECOMING A victim of new technology by the narrowest of margins, my grandfather thereafter married my grandmother, led an uneventful life and died in 1967. The Titanic's deep wreck site was not discovered until 1985, and in 1987 a salvage company, R.M.S. Titanic Inc., began with the help of a French submersible to retrieve objects from the debris field. Surprisingly, the cases strewn over the sea bed often contain documents that, after appropriate conservation, can still be read. Some of these cases are Gladstone bags that apparently contain the contents emptied out of the purser's safe as the ship was sinking.
Among the documents that emerged recently from the conservation laboratories in France was a property tag bearing the number 208 and the words "This portion to be retained by the purser." When news of the tag was reported to Findlay, the salvor's historian, he at once recalled the following passage from my grandfather's book: "Before me . . . is a small cardboard square: 'White Star Line. R.M.S. Titanic. 208. This label must be given up when the article is returned.' " The tag was the receipt for an envelope of money he entrusted to the purser's safe.
I don't know what became of my grandfather's half of tag 208. Its counterpart, buried for more than 80 years in 12,500 feet of water 400 miles off Newfoundland, was evidently in the safer place. Last month it joined the exhibition of Titanic artifacts at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England, a fragile memento of one individual's escape from the savage tides of history.

HEADLINE: WORD & IMAGE;
Summer Musings

BYLINE: By MAX FRANKEL; This will be the last Word & Image column for the summer. The column will resume biweekly in the fall.

 BODY:
ON THE WAY TO A SUMMER'S sabbatical, I've been rummaging in a file marked "Media Thoughts Rarely Examined in the Media." Here are some of the seeds that I wish I had brought to life over the last nine months.
Policy Rut: "When Social Security was enacted, life expectancy was only 62 -- three years less [my emphasis] than retirement with full benefits. Today, life expectancy is 76 and still climbing. With the same relationship today, retirement would be set at almost 80!" -- Jessica Mathews in The Washington Post. 
 Semantic Rut: "We would not dream of keeping our checkbooks balanced the way a balanced budget would require the Government to. We borrow to buy houses and automobiles and to send our kids to college. If we lose our job or suffer a financial reversal, we may well borrow to tide ourselves over to a better time. In 1993, net borrowing of the U.S. Government was $256 billion; that of private households was $294 billion. . . . The great majority of state governments . . . balance only their operating or current budgets and borrow -- that is, run deficits -- for capital expenditures." -- Prof. Robert Eisner in The Wall Street Journal.
Statistical Rut: "The media wallow in stories of discontent. . . . As every American surely knows, household incomes have stagnated for nearly two decades. . . . But over time, the mismatch between stagnating household income and large expansion of the economy as a whole is so stark that it undermines the credibility of the figures. Part of the explanation is probably that the erosion of the two-parent family (as more people chose to stay single or become single parents or as widows live longer) depresses the median household income; in other words, the figures say more about the size of households than the size of incomes." -- The Economist.
Ideological Rut: "Representative Gingrich and his friends are moles, working within the Government to bring it down for the benefit of the people. This is an attractive idea, because it enables its users to be on the side of everybody and not against anyone -- only against the Government. . . . Tax reduction is routinely described as taking money from the Government and giving it to the people. . . . But tax reduction cannot give money to some people without taking it away from other people. . . . Transferring money to the people from the Government may be a metaphor for transferring to the people who earned it from people who did not earn it. . . . There is something in that, but . . . there are no self-made men or women in America. . . . We ought to be able to discuss the question of how much money to transfer from some people to other people explicitly, to try to learn what the effects are and where the community's conscience lies. The discussion is not helped by demagogic talk about the Government vs. the people." -- Herbert Stein, former chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, in The Wall Street Journal.
Computer Skeptics Unite! "I'm not a Luddite," says Prof. Neil Postman, the author of "Amusing Ourselves to Death, "although I secretly like it when something happens, as it occasionally does, where a group of people in political concert say no to a machine. . . . But our problem is not that we don't have enough information. I mean if there are children starving in Somalia, it is not because we don't have enough information. If crime is rampant on the streets of New York or Boston, it's not because people don't have enough information. . . . The problem lies elsewhere, and I think it is a loss of meaning. People don't know what to do with the information. They have no organizing principle -- what I would call a transcendent narrative."
Less News, More Media: At the inspiration of Jack Rosenthal, the editor of this magazine, its researchers have documented the explosive increase in news product over the last generation. Rosenthal thought there's no more going on in the world, indeed probably less news than 30 years ago, but that it's reported much more. His suspicions were easily quantified:
The number of all-news radio stations has grown from one, in 1961, to dozens, perhaps as many as 90 today, plus several hundred stations dedicated to news and talk or all talk. The time devoted to news by one television network (ABC) has increased from 2 hours and 15 minutes in 1960 to about 35 hours in 1994; the total for all networks is now about 110 hours, not counting CNN, Headline News, C-Span, Court TV, sports and weather news networks or breaking news stories like Oklahoma City.
More Media, Less Advertising: Despite dramatic growth in the economy, ad agencies that sell to mass markets are suffering from stagnation. Professors Roland T. Rust and Richard W. Oliver attribute that to the fragmentation of the media and of its audiences. Writing in the Journal of Advertising under the title "The Death of Advertising," they predict the transformation of the industry from one that intrudes with involuntary information to one that helps each consumer acquire individualized information --perhaps even charging for the service through interactive media. The professors conclude that schools and scholars specializing in advertising have about a decade to adapt to the new technologies before they are "hopelessly obsolete."
Illicit Advertising for America: The Voice of America (now supplemented by Worldnet television) is fighting for its life against Senator Jesse Helms and others who think of it as a cold-war relic no longer worth its annual $215 million budget. The Clinton Administration believes, as did the Reagan and Bush Administrations, that billions of people are still deprived of honest news by authoritarian regimes. It's hard to judge this debate because the Government is forbidden to air its propaganda domestically. But it is now possible to monitor the Voice via the Internet [gopher:// gopher.voa.gov/] and also to check the schedules of Worldnet TV and Radio Marti to Cuba. (Special bonus on the latter: a searchable file of 35 years' of speeches by Fidel Castro.) Feel free to scroll past the warning that "In accordance with U.S. law, the materials in this directory hierarchy are provided exclusively for recipients outside the United States."
I Am Still Not a Camera: I hope to return to this corner in time to argue again, and more persuasively this time, that cameras are different from ordinary "press" and should be barred from the second Simpson trial. Never quit while you're gaining.

HEADLINE: The Morale Crisis In the Workplace

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
SHE was earning $85,000 a year as an officer of a large company, but as the company reduced its staff and reorganized, a man being groomed for the president's position got the position she felt she deserved. So the woman resigned. "I won't ever work for a corporation again," she said. "I think you sell yourself out."
The woman, who spoke on the condition that neither her name nor her former employer's name be used, said she had been excluded from the powerful clique of male executives during the many years she worked with the company. In order to keep her job, she said, she was forced to compromise her values. 
 "I had trouble getting people to look at all sides of an issue before making a decision. The 'old boys' had their agenda set ahead of time. I decided that in order to survive, I needed to start playing their game," she said. "I became harder and more impersonal. I detached myself from people and treated them coldly. My goal was to do whatever was best for the corporation."
As she poured all her energy into her job, her health deteriorated, she said. She began working late into the night and taking a dozen aspirins a day to relieve relentless headaches and pain in her jaw. She was tired all the time and often angry. Her marriage broke up. The story has become a familiar one, and one by no means limited to female or minority workers, as Connecticut businesses continue to downsize in a lingering recession. In fact, low morale in the workplace has become a public health problem, said Stephen Advocate, a senior social worker at the Hospital of Saint Raphael's Mental Health Resource Center.
"Tremendous tension is building up in the workplace," Mr. Advocate said. "It certainly is the place where reality and ideology clash. Every year, it becomes more apparent that old, implicit contracts between boss and employee have turned to dust." Trust, honesty and loyalty do not seem to fit into the working world of the 90's, Mr. Advocate said. "The worst things you can lose are trust and a sense of participation," he explained. "When that spirit goes out of one part of life, it affects another part as well. People go home with less to offer."
Business leaders say that they are doing what they can, given the tough times being felt throughout the state. Some have attempted to avoid layoffs by turning to alternatives like a shorter workday, job sharing, voluntary furloughs and the four-day work week, said Robert D. Noonan, vice president and counsel for management services for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association. Businesses are also making a greater effort to keep employees informed about possible layoffs and provide counseling for employees and their families, he said.
Brian Beaudin, senior vice president of the management services division of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, added that there are employers who choose to keep workers on the payroll even though business is slow. "While I'm sure there are exceptions, employers do not enjoy the tough part of running a business," he said, "which is telling people they don't have a job anymore."
But others say the morale crisis in the workplace does not yet hold high priority in the minds of company executives, preoccupied as they are with many pressing issues.
"I had dinner with about a dozen human resources executives of major corporations in the region, and nobody talked about it. They didn't even mention it," said Fabio Sampoli, senior vice president of regional issues for the Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce. "It's not because it isn't perceived as a problem, but they're dealing with so many issues, like how to contain workers' compensation and health insurance costs and how to deal with a reduced work force and not only maintain but increase productivity."
That perception leaves a corporate critic cold. "There's a war going on in corporate America between the employer and the employee," said Barbara G. Lifton, a lawyer in New Haven who handles employment discrimination cases.
Ms. Lifton sees harassment used often as a tool to make employees leave. A boss may start to criticize a worker's performance and issue warnings that his or her job is in jeopardy. "Employers pick something vague like inability to get along with others or communication problems," she explained. "They get the person rattled and upset so he can't do his job, and then they fire him. They lay a paper trail so the person feels he has no recourse."
The constant pressure eventually affects the worker's health, said Ms. Lifton -- with insomnia, loss of appetite, nervousness, hysteria, depression, suicidal tendencies and symptoms resembling a heart attack showing up all too often. "The truth is, the problems are caused by the company's policies, not the employees," she said.
Connecticut's faltering economy makes it easier for employers to justify heavier demands on workers and reward-denying approaches, Mr. Advocate said. "Everyone is pointing to the other person and saying that in order to remain competitive, you have to sacrifice. While that is noble and worthwhile," he said, "it becomes cynical when the average worker sees chief executive officers getting larger salaries and bonuses while the worker suffers through uncertainty about whether or not he'll keep his job."
Older workers who have been laid off have particular difficulty finding other employment and maintaining confidence in themselves, said Judith Andrews, who until recently provided unemployed people with job counseling and other services at the Workforce Development Center in New Haven. (The New Haven program has been phased out, merged in part with the state's Department of Labor in Hamden, and Ms. Andrews is now doing career training for high school students in the greater New Haven area.)
The majority of her clients were between 35 and 45, Ms. Andrews said. But some, older, had been with the same company for as many as 30 years, and were laid off with only a day's notice. The common theme in their stories is that they believed they were obsolete. "They have their futures ahead of them," Ms. Andrews said, "but they were replaced by younger people just out of college, and they fear they will face that experience again on another job."
One way for employers to improve morale is by encouraging communication, Mr. Advocate said. "There is a tendency for management to insulate itself behind walls and barriers," he explained. "When you don't promote personal relationships with people you work with on all levels, a paranoid organization can develop, where you become fearful of what others think, and they become fearful of you. Then, criticism is seen as being disloyal or even plotting."
In addition, said Clifford R. Briggie, administrator of the Hospital of Saint Raphael's department of psychiatry, employers should reach beyond staff reductions and change the nature of tasks in the workplace so that more can be done with fewer people. That means streamlining procedures, eliminating the unnecessary.
The woman who lost the $85,000 job has not found other work, but, armed with the money from a severance package, has taken time out to read and travel and is considering studying for a master's degree in social work. "I want to work one-on-one with people," she said. Looking back, she added, she is grateful for the opportunity to leave a job she had disliked for a long time.
Other workers, too, are beginning to make changes, investing less time and energy in their jobs, she said. "They are saying, 'I'll give you eight hours only. That's all you'll get from me.' They're not doing that little extra for their employer because they feel the employer isn't doing anything for them," she concluded.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
Hartford Trying to Rebound From a Long Recession

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
FOR five years, Hartford has been in the depths of a recession even worse than the one it experienced in the mid-1970's. Loaded with excess real estate built during the 80's, it is still struggling to recover.
But city officials say that in the last eight months, a growth of interest from both within and beyond the immediate region, buoyed by cheap rents and a trained labor pool, indicates that the situation may be on the cusp of change. 
 "We're coming back now," said Mayor Michael P. Peters.
Articulating a policy that depends less on the industry that gave Hartford the nickname of the Insurance Capital of America, Mayor Peters said: "We lost 20,000 jobs over the past five years. We are not necessarily looking for the company that employs 4,000 people; we are looking for 50 to 800 employees and a more stable economic base through diversity. We are keeping in constant touch to see that whoever is here stays, and we are marketing ourselves aggressively to outside companies."
Jon Putnam, director of commercial real estate for Cushman & Wakefield in Hartford, agreed that there was reason for renewed optimism. "We have mutual-fund companies looking at spaces of over 100,000 square feet," Mr. Putnam said. "Two insurance companies from Texas -- Trans General and Blue Ridge -- have moved here, and U. S. Homecare, situated in Westchester, is looking for a headquarters and administrative offices downtown."
He also said that Fleet Bank had renewed its lease for 130,000 square feet at 1 Constitution Plaza and that Shawmut had moved some of its divisions from East Hartford into 90,000 square feet downtown at 1 Corporate Center, at 20 Church Street.
"The activity level is clearly up," said Elizabeth G. Judd, portfolio manager for Koll Management Services, a building-management firm in Hartford. "Cheap rents are bringing businesses back from the suburbs, and financial and insurance companies from Boston are looking for back-office space. They are attracted by low rents and a trained labor pool of people who were laid off from Aetna and ITT and Phoenix" Home Life Mutual Insurance Company.
Crime that flourished downtown when the workforce went home to the suburbs has abated "by 45 percent since 1989," said Deputy Police Chief Thomas O'Connor. The decline is attributable, he said, to bicycle patrols, a substation and increasing numbers of people availing themselves of the city's night-time activities. Brokers also say that middle-class residents are beginning to return to Hartford.
"We have seen people come in from the suburbs because of the value in spacious, high-ceilinged Victorian houses," said Mollie Abend, a broker with Prudential Real Estate. "In the past six months activity in the West End has been in move-ups to larger homes, and move-ins from out of state." West End homes that were built for insurance executives at the turn of the century sell for $150,000 to $500,000.
"We feel the city has bounced off the bottom," said Scott Phelps at the Convention and Visitors Bureau. "Hotel occupancy is up by 10 percent to near 70 percent this year, and we have seen an increase in meetings and conventions."
A hotel that was once The Sonesta, then The Clarion, will reopen this summer under a new name -- still to be chosen -- and management, bringing the total number of hostelries to eight.
An encouraging development earlier this month was the announcement that Heublein Inc., the liquor company, will return to Hartford, where it was founded in 1875. Heublein's headquarters had been in Farmington since 1973. It will add 125 employees, for a total of 425, when it moves early next year into 150,000 square feet at Connecticut River Plaza, a two-building, 586,000-square-foot office complex building on Columbus Boulevard.
Additional boosts have come from the Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Company, which recently bought an 80,000-square-foot building at 56 Prospect Street, next to its headquarters. It also plans to buy a 35,500-square-foot building at 38 Prospect Street now owned by the Travelers Insurance Company.
AND the breakup of ITT restores The Hartford, a 185-year-old insurance firm, as a self-governing hometown company.
The $22 million indoor-outdoor Meadows Music Theater, seating 30,000, is scheduled to open next month, and places like ZuZu's on Pratt Street and The Blue Star Cafe on Trumbull Street are indicative of a handful of new night spots that are keeping more adults downtown in the evenings.
The landmarked former Colt Firearms Company complex is now occupied by 80 artists living and working in some of its 755,000 square feet of space. About 45 percent of the complex of 30 buildings is being leased until a permanent use is found.
That's the good news.
Just about everyone agrees that Hartford, despite its abundance of landmarked buildings, its oasis of Bushnell Park, the cultural treasures of the Wadsworth Atheneum, the Hartford Stage Company, the Old State House and Bushnell Hall, and sporting events at the Civic Center, still has many problems.
Its three major department stores, G. Fox, Sage-Allen and The Richardson, all in national-landmark buildings, succumbed in recent years to two suburban malls flanking the city -- in Farmington to the west and Manchester to the east -- and many restaurants followed their patrons to the suburbs.
Business shrinkage is still occurring. The vacancy rate in the city's 8.1 million square feet of downtown office space is up to 24.2 percent so far this year, from 20.4 percent for the same period last year, according to Stephen Bastrzycki, market analyst for Farley Whittier Partners, commercial realtors.
But Mr. Bastrzycki said that "rentals of $11.25 to $19.78" a square foot "will eventually bring companies that went to the suburbs back to the city."
Mr. Putnam of Cushman & Wakefield said that his optimism was tempered by the fact that a Fleet-Shawmut merger, which is near final approval, is expected to have a downsizing effect. Also, he said, some large insurance companies whose leases expire in two or three years may not renew. "That could leave 100,000 to 300,000 square feet vacant," he said.
High taxes are a persistent drag on businesses and residences, almost everyone agrees. One-third of Hartford's $5.96 billion worth of real estate is tax exempt, and nearly half of that third is made up of state-owned buildings.
IN just two years, from September 1992 to September 1994, the state increased its real estate holdings by $94.9 million, creating a tax loss of $2.04 million, according to the assessor's office. Two of the most recently purchased properties are the former Xerox building, at 25 Sigourney Street, and an office building at 60 Washington Street. Other properties must make up for the shortfall.
"State-owned property has been a killer," said Mayor Peters. "We have asked for a moratorium on any more purchases, and a better formula for payment in lieu of taxes." The state now pays 20 percent of normal taxes on properties it owns, which translates into a net loss to Hartford of around $26 million a year. Total losses from a variety of more than one thousand tax exempt properties come to $2.89 billion, according to the assessor's office.
But Dennis Kerrigan, chief of administration at the state's Department of Public Works, said that the state's presence brought a significant number of people into the urban area that would not be there otherwise."
"The depressed real estate market put these properties, which were partially or entirely vacant, in a range that made it possible for us to purchase for the same money as renting," Mr. Kerrigan said.
In 1989 an effort was made to reduce the tax load on residents by using a state enabling law by which residential tax credits can be applied to commercial real estate as a partial surtax. On a $150,000 house, taxes of $3,400 are reduced to $2,100, and a commercial property valued at $150,000 pays taxes of $4,045 with the surtax, instead of $3,602 without it.
When times were good, the effect was positive. Today many small businesses are unable to survive the combination of recession and surtax, and homeowners can do better in suburbs like West Hartford or Avon, where taxes are $28.79 and $20.25 per $1,000 of assessed value respectively, compared with $33.30 in Hartford.

HEADLINE: Now Playing: Invasion of the Multiplex

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
THE movie industry is riddled with angst these days. Costs are skyrocketing, there's a glut of products, movies are under attack for mindless violence, and mergers, management buyouts and executive defections are causing musical chairs at the top.
But apparently, the anxiety has not filtered down to movie-theater owners. Even in the metropolitan area, home of some of the country's most cramped and expensive real estate, every new project, from the redevelopment of Times Square to shopping malls in Long Island to sprucing-up attempts in downtown Brooklyn, seems to include a movie theater. 
 Landlords love them, because they soak up less-than-prime space in Manhattan, or allow shopping-mall parking to do double duty in suburbia. And theater operators love the sheer size of the region's potential audiences -- and the relatively few theaters existing to snag them.
"New York may be the most underscreened city on the planet," said Benjamin Fox, a partner in New Spectrum, a store brokerage.
Clearly, the pundits who predicted that cable television would mortally wound the movie theater industry, and that VCR's would kill it off, were as wrong as they could be. According to the National Association of Theater Owners in North Hollywood, Calif., nearly 1.3 billion movie tickets were sold last year, the most in 35 years. Movie theaters nationwide grossed nearly $5.4 billion, a record.
Theater chains believe the boom will continue. Sony Theaters, whose 12-screen complex at 68th Street and Broadway has recreated many of the ornately decorated theaters of the past, is building a four-plex at 1540 Broadway, the Bertelsmann building at 45th Street. Cineplex Odeon is negotiating for a site on the Upper East Side.
United Artists is putting up a nine-screen theater on Union Square, and a smaller one at 300 East 64th Street. And AMC Entertainment is negotiating a deal for a 29 -- count 'em, 29 -- screen theater on 42d Street, in the heart of the Times Square Redevelopment district.
"Clearly, theaters still provide something you can't get at home," said David Firestein, a former AMC executive and now senior vice president of the Westchester-based Northwest-Atlantic Partners retail real estate brokerage.
Theaters also provide something that has been in short supply for much of this decade -- tenants. "The real estate climate is really fueling growth," said Howard Lichtman, Cineplex Odeon's executive vice president of marketing. "We can get lease terms that make it truly viable to put up new theaters."
The push to accommodate theaters makes sense. Outside of Manhattan, movie theaters can round out an office or industrial park, since employee parking spaces can double as theater parking in evenings and weekends. In Manhattan, they can sop up unappealing space.
"Theaters are a great way to maximize the rent you can get," said Jeff T. Blau, vice president of The Related Companies, which is developing the Union Square site. Faith H. Consolo, managing partner of the Garrick, Aug store leasing brokerage, explains why: "Movie theaters absorb tremendous amounts of basements, subbasements and other space that used to be viewed as undesirable," she said.
So why were the pundits so wrong?
Probably a lot of reasons, but the main one, movie industry experts seem to agree, is that the forecasts of doom were predicated on a steady stream of movies flowing out of Hollywood. Instead, the studios have unleashed a tidal wave of product. And cable and video, rather than stanching the flood, are what opened the dam.
Studios no longer have to rely solely on box office sales to recoup the cost of making and marketing a movie. Now they add in cable channels, and, of course, video rentals and sales. And the best way to breach those ancillary markets is to make a killing in a first-run movie theater.
Conversely, seeing things on video can spur people to go to a sequel. Jim Kozak, a spokesman for the Theater Owners group, notes that Terminator 2 and Die Hard 2 both made twice as much as the original films.
"Were the sequels really that much better, or did a lot of people discover the series by seeing the original on tape?" he asked, quite rhetorically.
Since by now video stores and cable are available almost everywhere, the synergies have spurred theater development throughout the country. Mr. Kozak said that by the end of last year there were 26,689 screens extant, up from 22,921 five years before. And nearly all of the chains have announced robust expansion plans.
New York City is a particularly tantalizing plum for movie-theater chains. According to Oppenheimer & Company, there are only 353 movie screens in the city, an average of 5.3 screens for every 100,000 people -- well below the nationwide average of 9 screens per 100,000 people. And, that is based on a New York population of 6.7 million people. Considering that millions more commute to the city each day, and might want to stick around for a movie, the shortfall is even greater.
Moreover, Oppenheimer says that 61 percent of New York's movie screens are in theaters of just one to three screens, while just 3 percent of its screens are in multiplexes of nine screens or more. Nationwide, just 49 percent of movie screens are in tiny theaters, while 9 percent are in complexes of nine screens or more.
"People don't only build in underscreened areas, but in areas with aging small houses," noted Susan Isserman, a senior entertainment analyst at Oppenheimer.
Part of the reason for the multiscreen preference is simple economics of scale. The more screens, the more tickets sold, so the easier it is to amortize fixed labor and rental costs. And the more people coming in, the more food sold. Considering that profit margins on concessions can run as high as 80 percent, that is no small factor.
But the deciding factor has been the explosion of new movies. Generally, a theater chain contracts with a movie distributor to show a movie for a minimum period of time. If the movie does poorly, the theater owner is out of luck; if the movie is a blockbuster, the theater owner could show it longer -- unless the theater's screens are committed to another movie.
A multiplex offers more flexibility. Its screening rooms have different seating capacities. The theater operator can put a film that is expected to do incredibly well into the largest room. If it turns out to be disappointing, he or she can move it to a smaller room, and move a "sleeper" movie to the larger room.
"This way, if you pick a Christmas picture wrong, you aren't stuck with a dog for the entire holiday season," said Michael W. Patrick, chief executive of Carmike Cinemas, a Columbus, Ohio-based theater chain.
Or if ticket sales for a blockbuster film start dropping gradually, the theater owner can move the film from, say, a 500-seat room to a 250-seat room, making way for an incoming potential blockbuster in the larger theater while continuing to pack the smaller house with the first film.
The availability of small theaters within huge multiplexes also lets theaters run so-called "art" films that, while they appeal to a smaller potential audience than does a "Die Hard" or a "Rambo," are less expensive to rent from distributors and can find a profitable niche. The Angelika Theater, on Houston and Mercer Streets, specializes in art films, yet is known among movie industry analysts as a profitable house.
"If you don't have smaller screens available, you can't afford to show a movie like 'Priest,' " said Joyce Steves Storm, executive vice president for real estate for Sony Theaters. "But there is money to be made in that kind of movie."
Old theaters that cannot be effectively cut up into smaller screens, nor retrofitted with modern sound equipment, are falling by the wayside. The RKO movie theater on Main Street in Flushing, Queens, is closed and for sale. A group of foreign investors recently purchased the 68-year-old Oriental Theater in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, a landmarked 2,700-seat building that was converted to a triplex but still could not compete with nearby multiplexes. The new owners will probably convert it to retail use.
"There wasn't enough parking to convert it to a multiplex," said Barry Rossner, a Williams Real Estate broker.
Smaller theaters still do get built, but because of space or contractual considerations, not preference. Loews Theaters, which Sony has since purchased, had contracted to build a four-screen theater at 1540 Broadway nearly eight years ago, before the huge multiplexes had hit their stride in Manhattan. Ms. Storm readily concedes that Sony would prefer to build more screens now, but the rest of the building's retail space has been allocated to other tenants.
Similarly, United Artists, which already operates the single-screen Gemini I and II theaters on Second Avenue near 64th Street, is building a third screen at 300 East 64th Street, a 28-story residential building going up next door. United Artists wanted to put up more screens, but the developers had already let the space to a bank.
"We figure residents want banking and entertainment, so we will give them both," said Trevor Davis, head of Davis & Partners, one of the building's developers.
If United Artists had not already had the two Gemini theaters, it might have walked away from the deal. Instead, it is hooking the new screen into the existing theaters, and all three will share management, staff and ticket offices.
"You figure, we have the staff in place, so the incremental cost of another screen is not huge," said William J. Quigley, a senior vice president of United Artists Theater Circuit. "And most of the theaters on Manhattan's East Side are singles or twins."
That lack of competition from multiplexes gives the Gemini theaters the luxury of perpetuating the status quo. Few new theaters can safely do so. Indeed, most of today's theaters bear little resemblance, either in size or amenities, to their recent forebears. They are huge multiscreened entertainment palaces, with big plush seats, staffs trained to handle functions ranging from selling tickets to crowd control, concession stands that sell mineral water and espresso, expensive art on their walls and huge indoor waiting areas.
"We've all recognized that we have to provide a quality film experience, not just a good movie," said Sony's Ms. Storm.
And often, the theaters are surrounded by other entertainment-oriented retailers, as landlords scramble to find that ever-elusive synergy among tenants.
For example, the Sony-Imax theater on 68th Street is a tourist attraction in its own right. Each of its 12 auditoriums is framed with a miniature version of the facade of an ornate theater of bygone years. There are sphinxes, palm trees, Mayan temple arches, most requiring a steep, four-story escalator ride to reach. And, of course, there is the Imax theater, which offers three-dimensional movies.
Not surprisingly, Millennium Partners, which developed the 68th Street site, has tried to get a lot of ancillary mileage from the traffic the theater pulls. The Sony theater already is cheek-by-jowl with a huge Reebok sports center and store and a Coconuts music store. A Barnes & Noble book store and a Tower Records will soon open nearby. And, of course, Lincoln Center is right across the street.
"We've created an urban entertainment complex, with a merchandise mix of books, music, movies, all kinds of things that relate to people's leisure time," said Philip Aarons, Millennium's vice president.
Clearly, the theater is drawing more than neighborhood residents. Ms. Storm says that 13 percent of the moviegoers are from Queens and Long Island, 10 percent from Brooklyn, and 10 percent from New Jersey. In fact, she said that the influx had made the 68th Street multiplex the highest grossing theater in the country.
United Artists' planned Union Square theater will also be part of an entertainment center that will cover a square-block site stretching from 13th to 14th Streets and from Broadway to Fourth Avenue. According to Ms. Consolo of Garrick, Aug, The Related Companies, the site's developers, are talking to a book store, a record store, and a sports store.
"There are all these residents in the area, and Beth Israel is opening a clinic across the street, so the traffic will be really good," Ms. Consolo said.
Even the finest movie theater cannot overcome a rotten neighborhood. In the mid-1980's, Cineplex Odeon built a six-plex on 50th Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, an area that seemed poised for redevelopment. Instead, Worldwide Plaza, the office building that houses the theater, has remained an isolated modernity in an ungentrified neighborhood that moviegoers saw little reason to visit. The only way that Cineplex could stanch its cash hemmorhage was by running movies that were released months before, and charging only $2 for tickets.
But while all the chains see location as key, and bigger as better, they differ widely on their perception of the best markets.
Increasingly, New York's boroughs and suburbs are in that category. "Manhattan is getting saturated," said Steffen H. Warfield, managing director of the Northwest-Atlantic brokerage. "Downtown Brooklyn, Queens, all have good sites for movie theaters."
Clearly, the chains agree. National Amusements, a Dedham, Mass., theater chain, is planning a 12-plex at College Point, Queens, near the Whitestone Expressway, as a companion to Toys 'R' Us and Kids 'R' Us stores. Cineplex Odeon will soon open a 10-screen theater on Court Street, in Downtown Brooklyn. Sony is building a 10-screen theater at the former Roosevelt Raceway in Westbury, L.I.
Sony, United Artists, and Cineplex Odeon seem to be the biggest players in the urban markets. Sony Theaters, an outgrowth of the old Loews movie chain that has grown to 862 screens, is based in New York, and views operating in the urban market as playing in the home court. In fact, the company just formed a joint venture with Magic Johnson to open theaters in the inner city.
United Artists, the world's largest theater chain, already has about 2,300 screens worldwide, and is putting up 300 more this year, many in densely populated areas. By the end of this year Cineplex Odeon, which already has 1,617 screens in North America, will have added 68 new screens, and has another 249 slated for 1996, also primarily in large markets.
"Urban areas require greater rent, greater service and state-of-the-art amenities," Mr. Lichtman said. "But they also offer unsurpassed population bases, higher-priced tickets and a population that is more likely to buy bottled water and decaffeinated cappuccino at the concession stand."
Other chains are less tempted by big cities. Cinemark USA, for one, has 1,174 screens, and 200 under construction, primarily in mid-size markets of maybe 500,000 people. "In urban areas you typically find a lot more competition, and your operating costs are just so much higher," said Randy Hester, Cinemark's director of corporate development.
National Amusements, a 953-screen chain, sees its ideal locations as "at a major intersection of a major highway," said Shari Redstone, the company's executive vice president. The company, which owns Viacom, has traditionally built stand-alone theaters on land that it owns, and has been replacing many of its drive-in theaters with multiplexes, including big ones in Valley Stream, L.I., Newark and the Bronx.
But lately it has veered from its own rules. It recently opened a posh 12-plex in the Broadway Mall in Hicksville, L.I. And College Point is a shared and rented facility, too. "The area had great demographics, it was underserved and we couldn't pass the opportunity up," Ms. Redstone said.
And then there's Carmike Cinemas, a 2,190-screen chain that has grown primarily by buying up screens from larger chains that want to concentrate on densely populated areas. Most recently, it purchased 64 screens in Florida, and 17 in Georgia from Cineplex Odeon.
"We figure, why compete with the big exhibitors in their markets of choice, when we can buy them out in markets they no longer want?" said Mr. Patrick, Carmike's chief executive. The company is attacking economies-of-scale problems by turning into the ultimate do-it-yourselfer: It has developed its own theater-management software, builds its own projectors, and is about to open its own drapery company.
But strategic differences aside, each chain is planning explosive growth for the rest of this decade. It may be a foolproof strategy: Demographics show that teenagers, still the heaviest movie-goers, will be a growing part of the general population between 1995 and 2010.

HEADLINE: Paterson Hopes Hotel's Rebirth Will Lead the City's Way

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: PATERSON

 BODY:
The checkered history of the Alexander Hamilton Hotel sounds a lot like the history of Paterson.
In the 1950's, the hotel was perhaps the best in North Jersey -- an institution associated with elegance and power, a place where high-society wedding receptions were held in the Main Ballroom and political deals were cut in the Hamilton Bar. 
 By the 1980's, the hotel was the province of drug dealers and prostitutes, a dilapidated fire hazard teeming with roaches and vermin, another reminder of just how far this city had fallen.
Now, as Paterson struggles to revitalize itself, the hotel may get a new lease on life: a proposal by the New Community Corporation -- the nonprofit organization that made a name for itself by transforming a blighted neighborhood in Newark's Central Ward -- to turn the Alexander Hamilton into affordable housing for the elderly, complete with 100 new apartments, activity rooms and nursing and health-care services.
There are still many details to be resolved in the $12.5 million proposal, which was unveiled this month. But if the project becomes reality, it would mean a lot to New Jersey's third largest city, not just as a source of needed housing, but also as a poignant symbol of what Paterson was and wants to become.
"It's a turning point," said Donna Brightman, the city's director of housing. "Either you do it and it's part of a rebirth or you don't do it and it projects further decline. We're trying to fight to stay alive."
Alive was a feeling Paterson used to know well. For the better part of the century, Paterson was a vibrant hub nicknamed Silk City, a leading center for textile and locomotive manufacturing. It was the kind of place that nurtured Allen Ginsberg and inspired poets like William Carlos Williams, the kind of small city that was proud of its working-class roots as well as its luxurious indulgences.
When people talked about fancy hotels in those days, they talked about the Alexander Hamilton. Built in 1930, the 170-room hotel was a natural magnet for the rich and powerful, a handsome eight-story brick building just two blocks from City Hall and surrounded by cigar and fedora stores and the famed Fabian Theater.
It was only natural that the hotel was where the Passaic County returns would be tallied on Election Night. The Democrats would gather in the downstairs ballroom, the Republicans in the upstairs one.
A hotel brochure from the 1950's with bright color photos showed as much: "Traditionally Elegant: From intimate dining to lavish banquets, the magnificent public rooms of the Alexander Hamilton provide the perfect setting for social and business events of every description."
But as the city declined in the 1960's, so did the hotel. Factories closed because of labor unrest and high costs, the well-to-do fled to the suburbs, crime and unemployment rose and the hotel fell into disrepair.
A 1983 fire killed 15 people. The ballrooms were stacked to the ceiling with mattresses. Garbage was everywhere and there was a stench of sewage. People passed out in the stairwells. Only the cockroaches thrived.
In 1989, the hotel's owner, Paul Lachmann, died, and bequeathed the property to his grandchildren, not his children. A judge appointed James F. McCoole, a lawyer, to administer the estate and run the hotel.
"It had deteriorated beyond belief," Mr. McCoole said. "When you parked in the parking lot behind the hotel, all you did was crunch on the crack vials when you walked out of your car."
Mr. McCoole shut the place down for a month, put in new management and cleaned it up to the point at which 100 transients now live in spartan but functional rooms. Still, on a recent tour of the hotel with Mr. McCoole, Mayor William J. Pascrell Jr. and a reporter, it was apparent that the hotel still needed a lot of work. The ballrooms reeked of mildew, waterlogged ceiling strips dangled, wallpaper designs shown in the brochure were soiled and sliding off the wall.
In several years, however, the picture may be different.
The New Community Corporation plan would use bank loans, public financing and tax credits to buy the hotel for $1 million and renovate it for $12.5 million. Current residents would be relocated to low-cost housing. People older than 62 making less than $18,000 a year would be eligible to move into the renovated complex. Activities like bingo, films, music and aerobics would be offered, said Raymond Codey, the corporation's director of development.
Ground is to be broken by spring, and officials hope to open the new housing the following year. "The hotel is important because we look at every project in terms of a ripple effect," Mr. Pascrell said. "You can't just work on one tree and let the others rot."

HEADLINE: Abandoned 36 Years Ago, the West Shore Rail Line Creeps Closer Toward Revival

BYLINE: By States News Service 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
For many a Bergen County commuter a century ago, the New York Central's West Shore Line service to the Weehawken ferry was the best of all routes to midtown Manhattan. But by 1959, West Shore ridership had declined so far, said New York Central's president, Alfred E. Perlman, that he needed a 100 percent fare increase to break even on the line. It was shut down that year, and the ferry with it.
Since the 1980's, spurred by Bergen County's ever-greater traffic congestion, some commuters and public officials have been trying to bring back the West Shore Line. New Jersey Transit says it has spent about $3 million looking into the idea. Chester Mattson, Bergen County Planning Director, calls the restoration of the West Shore Line the county's "top rail priority." 
 Now, the revival has moved a step toward reality with the announcement on June 15 that the Federal Transportation Administration has awarded a $3.97 million grant to New Jersey Transit to conduct a major West Shore study.
"This is great news for New Jersey commuters," said Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, who had pushed to include the funds in legislation adopted last year. "As the most densely populated state, transit investments are critical to maintaining our economy, environment and quality of life."
Under current plans, the restored service would run along a stretch of about 30 miles from West Nyack, N.Y., to the Hoboken Terminal and Secaucus Transfer Station, which is scheduled for completion in 2001. Conrail is moving freight on the original West Shore tracks, so new tracks would be put down along the old right of way.
Instead of taking the Weehawken ferry, passengers would switch to trains to midtown Manhattan or to the Hoboken ferry service to lower Manhattan.
The efforts to restore of the West Shore Line, said Alfred Harf, New Jersey Transit's assistant executive director of planning, reflect increasing traffic congestion, reduced bus service and concern about air quality.
Studies commissioned by New Jersey Transit estimate that 9,000 people would make the round trip on the restored line every weekday.
But that is not going to happen soon. New Jersey Transit does not expect to complete the study before the summer of 1997. Among the issues it will consider is community support: new rail construction beyond the West Shore right-of-way could lead to neighborhood opposition.
The biggest challenge could be financing. According to preliminary research, the project would cost $500 million, this at a time when Federal and state budgets are both under the knife.
But New Jersey Transit has a contingency plan. If the new West Shore Line is not fully financed, Mr. Harf said, service might be restored along only a portion of the line -- to the Meadowlands sports complex, for example.
"We're optimistic about its chances," said Mr. Mattson, the county planning director. "We think, on the merits, we'll be able to make a good case."

HEADLINE: Computer Transforms County Map Making From Glacial to Quick

BYLINE: By TOM CALLAHAN 

 BODY:
THE County Department of Planning can now access all sorts of geographic, demographic and zoning information for any street address in the county after installing a high-tech computer map-making system.
Planning officials used to work as long as half a year to prepare a general land use map. Map making was a painstaking process involving scribing, drafting and four-color inks. 
 "It was a dumb map," said Paul Gisondo, associate planner for the county. "All the measurements were made by hand and at each step of the way there were opportunities for errors."
The map, made just once every five years, was almost immediately outdated. "If there was a zoning change, for example, Pepsico buying some land and converting it into an office park, the map might not catch up with it until five years later," said Sam Wear, principal planner for the county. "You always have to wonder: was this accurate three years ago?"
The new mapping process, known as the Geographic Information System, uses an I.B.M. UNIX workstation to store geographic information. The system has access to 60 databases, including 1,400 variables taken from the 1990 census.
In addition to containing the county zoning and environmental characteristics, the computer can divide the county into 876 census block groups, which can be broken down by racial, income and demographic features. A new map containing that information, as well as updates, can be produced in a matter of hours, sometimes less. The system holds two gigabytes, or four million pages of data.
The county began developing the computer-mapping program in the late 1980's. In recent years, improvements in the cost and availability of the computer hardware and software have made it more comprehensive in scope and easier to operate. Mr. Wear estimates that the county has spent $250,000 on the hardware. Similar geographic information systems are operating in New York City and several counties around the state. Several New York State agencies also use the system.
"We can pull all sorts of different areas of data together through this system," said P. Lynn Oliva, the county's Planning Commissioner. "This is not a new function but the decades-old job of government providing information to citizens, government departments and municipalities. Before this technology, we spent 80 percent of our time gathering information and mapping and 20 percent planning. Now it's reversed."
The county government uses the mapping information to help manage the 15,918 acres of parks and parkland under county control as well as the various office buildings owned by the county. Within seconds, planners can have a printout of the floor plan of any government building.
If the county's Department of Environmental Services must repair a sewer line, they can obtain a map showing the effects of the construction on nearby roads and homes.
The County Health Department can get information on neighborhoods with the highest instance of Lyme disease or infant mortality or AIDS cases and compare that data with economic and demographic factors.
Westchester Community College has used the technology to produce a map showing where its students come from. The college has also traced the number of 14-year-olds to 18-year-olds in certain parts of the county and the number of people who didn't finish high school. The data are used for marketing purposes, even to the extent of including information on the nearest public transportation routes for prospective students. The computer can also create topographical maps to monitor runoff and possible pollution into Long Island Sound.
"The timing of getting information can be done in an afternoon, rather than having five people working with an atlas and drawing the information on tissue paper and overlaying that on a map," said Gerard E. Mulligan, the Deputy Planning Commissioner. "It provides remarkable decision-making ability."
The information in the computer mapping system is available to the county's 45 municipalities. Commissioner Oliva said she wants to form a consortium of municipalities with the technology, whereby local governments would be linked on the same computer network. That would allow zoning information to be updated immediately. The village of Croton-on-Hudson received a grant from the New York State Archives and Records Administration to obtain the mapping system. The county is working with the village on the project, which Village Manager Richard F. Herbek expects to have working in the next few months.
"It is going to help with so many different facets of what we do in local government," Mr. Herbek said, citing as examples the ability to retrieve information on properties and tax mapping.
"This is the wave of the future," he said. "Within the next decade, Geographic Information Systems will be in the mainstream of municipal planning around the country. These systems will replace the manual handling of information."

HEADLINE: STEINWAY & SONS;
In Tune

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The impression created by Edward Rothstein in his article "Made in the U.S.A., Once Gloriously, Now Precariously" [May 28] that Steinway & Sons is in decline stands the truth on its head. 
 The quality of today's Steinway pianos, far from being in decline, is in fact universally acclaimed. For example, 93 percent of all piano soloists performing with major orchestras in North America during the 1994-95 season played exclusively on Steinways. The instruments they are playing were manufactured not in previous decades but within the last five years. Similarly, virtually all finalists in the world's major piano competitions insist on playing on today's Steinway.
Regarding sales trends, while Mr. Rothstein's thesis fails to factor in the recession that swept the United States and the rest of the world during 1991-93, Steinway sold more pianos in the five years before the recession than in any such period in more than half a century. Dollar income over the last two years is once again setting records.

HEADLINE: NEW YORKERS & CO.;
Starbucks Pours It On

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
WITH designer coffee bars on almost every corner, terms like "slim grande" and "short latte" have become regular staples of the city's lexicon.
But the coffee bar business itself is far from settled. In the last year, the national chain Starbucks has descended on the city, opening in 15 locations, with another very likely to be coming soon to a corner near you. And, in the Darwinian economics of New York's storefront marketplace, the chic coffee bars that only recently displaced the old-time coffee shops are now concerned about being bullied out of business themselves. 
 Last September, for example, a Starbucks opened on Second Avenue and 81st Street, directly across the street from Timothy's Coffee, itself part of a small chain and just down the block from Seattle Bean. "We were upset," said Kalie Kimball, the manager at Seattle Bean, which has been open for about three years, "but we're not going to try to be them. We're going to try to be Seattle Bean."
Starbucks also recently arrived on Third Avenue at 66th Street, one block up from New World Coffee. At Columbus Avenue and 67th Street, Starbucks has plunked itself down diagonally opposite Cooper's Coffee Bar, and within five blocks of at least six other coffee houses.
Rivalry is nothing new to the world of New York coffee bars -- in fact, their explosion has compelled the Zagat restaurant survey to rate them for the first time this year in its new edition, due out in the fall. But coffee bar owners say the formidable strength of Starbucks intensifies the competition considerably. The Seattle-based company's national prominence, slick appearance and financial success make it the Goliath of the country's coffee bars, the Big Bean, if you will.
If the company's plans for expansion are any indication, Starbucks is going to become an increasingly prominent part of the landscape. The company says it plans to open about 80 more branches in New York City over the next four years and to have 1,500 nationwide (from the current count of nearly 600) by the year 2000.
The chain's confidence is so great that, in some cities, it has opened branches across the street from one another.

ONE wouldn't blame coffee-bar owners for quaking in their cups. But so far, most are holding to a determinedly positive party line, saying that competition can only be good for business and that finicky New Yorkers need a lot of choices.
"It's no different than when you have three dry cleaners on the same block," said Andrew Resnick, vice president in New York for Timothy's, which is based in Toronto. "We all benefit, in a sense. Competition makes you better. We need to be sharper, cleaner, nicer."
Despite such studied cool, many coffee bars are also clearly trying different ways to stay hot. But prices tend to vary no more than a nickel or a dime from chain to chain, and there are only so many creative things you can do with coffee. Timothy's posts a daily trivia question every day: the first 10 people to answer correctly win a free eight-ounce coffee. Seattle Coffee Roasters offered two-for-one deals for a while. And Seattle Bean counted among its claims to uniqueness using colored chalk on its outdoor sign -- until Timothy's down the block started doing the same. New World boasts of the two espresso shots in its tall latte, compared with one at Starbucks.
When Starbucks arrived across Columbus Avenue last March, the two-year-old Cooper's started offering half-price happy-hour granitas (sort of a coffee-flavored slushy) -- and Tanya Leach, a Cooper's manager, said the company was considering adding tables to its counter seating. The tables at Starbucks tend to be full into the night. "They're a huge company, they have all this money, so they're a little intimidating," Ms. Leach said. "And I think they're intentionally intimidating. But we have a lot of confidence in our customers."
Some independent coffee bars are trying to get mileage out of their comparative meekness, playing up elements like personal attention and an intimate atmosphere -- which the cynical might translate as less customer traffic and fewer square feet. "Our stores are a lot cozier than most of their's," said Stephen Levy, owner and president of Seattle Coffee Roasters on Columbus Avenue between 68th and 69th Streets.
"We know most of our customers by name," said Ms. Kimball at Seattle Bean. "We have more of a coffee house feel instead of a chain."
The Sensuous Bean, which has hung on at West 70th Street off Columbus Avenue since 1976, has apparently decided not to even try to compete. Although it offers coffee and tea by the cup from thermoses, the small, old-fashioned place concentrates on selling 72 varieties of coffee and 50 kinds of tea in bulk. "We don't have muffins, we don't have lattes, we don't have mochaccinos -- that's their thing," said Lucretia La Mura, a co-owner. "We're pounds -- volume."
Starbucks also stirs conflicting feelings among people who live near their branches. Some see the coffee bars as promising signs of upscale development and badges of sophistication. Others are put off by the sprawling uniformity of Starbucks stores and fear that they may threaten the distinctive character of old-time establishments in their areas.
The actor Bruce Willis, who arrived at the Muffin Shop, on Columbus Avenue at 70th Street, after a softball game in Central Park last Monday, puts himself in this camp. He was in search of an iced latte, and as if on cue for a commercial for the small independent coffee house, he said, "Great service, great coffee, and it's got more personality." He added that it was his second time there that day. "It's not the cookie-cutter thing that Starbucks has going," he said.
 

MANY West Siders living north of West 96th Street welcome the prospect of a new Starbucks -- due to open by the end of summer at 102d Street and Broadway -- as a chic counterweight in a neighborhood heavy with social service agencies. But some in the area are also concerned that the sleek newcomer may cut into the breakfast business of their local standby two blocks away, called Positively 104th Street, which serves help-yourself coffee, homemade cranberry-orange muffins and 35-cent refills under the honor system.
"I keep thinking of Starbucks as an elegant McDonald's -- it's become such a monolith," said Chris Huntington, 34, a television producer who lives on 105th Street and gets his morning coffee at Positively 104th. "I'm an underdog fan. I worry about stores that are urban pioneers when larger conglomerates come in."
Starbucks maintains that the coffee business is big enough for everyone. "A lot of street corners in the world have more capacity than any one person can handle," said Yves Mizrahi, vice president of real estate for Starbucks. "Having competitors nearby does nothing but increase the awareness of coffee in general, and we view that as a positive."
But others predict that Starbucks will leave casualties in its wake. "I think ultimately you will see a shakeout and a consolidation or an elimination of a number of operators," said Michael T. Moe, an analyst at Lehman Brothers who follows Starbucks. "I think Starbucks, both through its size and through its execution and quality of product, is a truly formidable player to go up against."
Then again, there are those hard-boiled New Yorkers who insist they couldn't care less who makes their coffee, as long as it has caffeine.
Bob Youngman, an iron worker employed at a site on West 67th Street, would just as soon get his Java and jelly doughnut for $1 from the truck vendor on the corner. He said he had tried the new Starbucks nearby and didn't recommend it. "They've got terrible coffee," Mr. Youngman said. "It's probably Folgers or something."

MIDTOWN
Cool Sounds Abound Up on the Roof 
 The midtown Y.W.C.A.'s fifth season of rooftop jazz begins Wednesday. Curated by the composer and jazz cellist Diedre Murray (above), the series consists of new music by composers with backgrounds in blues, jazz, soul and Brazilian music.

PROSPECT PARK
Where Children Can Travel Back to the City's Past
A class of fourth graders from Public School 161 in Crown Heights (some pictured below) was asked to come up with questions about the site of the Lefferts Homestead Children's Museum in Prospect Park. The most frequently asked: "Who lived here?"
With a cultural grant from the state Council on the Arts and the city Department of Cultural Affairs, the directors were able to answer the question with a new interactive exhibit at the museum. The exhibit covers the period from 1650 to 1850 and deals with the Lenape Indians, the Dutch and African-Americans. "Kids can go there and experience what it was like to be a kid during these times," said Janine St.Germain, a spokeswoman for the park.
For example, children can crawl into an elk skin bed like that used by Indian families, or a mahogany sleigh bed from the era of the Dutch settlers, or a rustic rope-strung box bed used by the children of African-American slaves.
Lefferts Homestead Children's Museum, Prospect Park, Flatbush Avenue, north of Empire Boulevard; Saturdays and Sundays, 12 P.M. to 5 P.M.; free; (718) 965-6505.

Taking a New Look At Hungarian Artists
In the art world, Hungarian paintings have never captured the interest of high-end collectors.
"Only now are collectors beginning to recognize the value," said Janos Aranyi, an investor and a collector of Hungarian art, "but Hungarian masterpieces at this point still remain affordable." Mr. Aranyi has selected 23 paintings by Hungarian artists, ranging from impressionist to constructivist, for a new exhibit.
"Through the period of fascism and Communism there wasn't much cultural exchange between Hungary and the United States," he said. "Now Hungary is experiencing an economic and cultural resurgence, and a new collector class is beginning to assemble."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Credit Is Lax, So Why Buy Banks?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Sometimes the news you get from opening junk mail is more important than the information that makes headlines.
Last week there was a bit of a stampede into bank stocks on the news of the biggest bank takeover yet, of New Jersey's First Fidelity by First Union, the North Carolina-based bank holding company. Lots of people were searching for the next bank to be bought for twice book value. We wish luck to those doing the searching. 
 The more important news is available in your trash can. Banks are eager to lend and are cutting prices. That shows up in credit card applications and in the terms for second mortgages. The personal loan come-ons -- "Check this box and we'll send you a check for $10,000" -- are also on the rise.
What does that mean? It means that credit standards, and loan pricing, are on the way down. Martha Klessen, an analyst for the Loan Pricing Corporation, which monitors the corporate loan market, uses the word "desperate" in describing the attitude of banks trying to push loans out the door.
"Banking is such a relationship business that, even if they are going to lose mony on a loan, they have to do it to preserve the relationship," she explains. After all, some other bank would make the loan.
It was only a few years ago that everyone was talking about how tightfisted bankers were, complete with handwringing over excessive caution brought on by over-regulation. Of course, back then a bank could also lock in a good profit by taking deposits at a low rate and then lending them out to the Federal Government by purchasing two-year Treasuries. It was the beginning of a golden age for banks, and their share prices zoomed from badly depressed levels as weak balance sheets became strong. Standard & Poor's regional bank index is up 219 percent from its 1990 low, while the S.& P. 500 has gained 86 percent.
Now the average rate on six-month bank certificates of deposit is almost 5 percent, and some banks are paying 6 percent. A bank has costs to cover, and it can't cover them if it takes in money at those rates and then buys two-year Treasuries, which are yielding just 5.6 percent. So borrowers must be found, and more and more banks are willing to lend in both the junk and investment-grade corporate markets. The competition for lending is showing up in the junk bond market, which is requiring a lot less in the way of indentures before making loans. There are also suspicions that some banks are getting credit card accounts by being a bit too lenient in deciding who is a good credit.
One might think that the signs of declining credit standards and lower profit levels on new loans would have scared shareholders, but that is not the case. Bad loans are not showing up on profit statements now, so who cares? "Any notion that the credit cycle will re-emerge as an issue is not present in the valuations," reports Frank R. DeSantis Jr., the bank watcher at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. You can get more attention from investors by putting together a list of potential takeover targets.
Bankers say privately that the excesses now are nothing like those of the late 1980's, and they are probably right. But the trend seems to be in place. Bank profit margins have peaked, and are declining despite the fact that most banks are setting aside less than ever before to cover potential bad loans. We will not know until the next recession just how lax the lending standards have become, but it is clear now that takeover speculation and investor enthusiasm over lower interest rates is overdone.

The Great Asian Steeple Chase

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China

 BODY:
THE skyscraper was born and raised, and raised some more, in the United States, defining the nation's proudest cities, enshrining its largest corporations and giving airline pilots the willies. But just as skyscrapers are leveling off here, they are reaching their gawky maturity in the Far East. Of the world's 10 tallest buildings finished in the 1990's or under construction, only one is in this country -- the headquarters for an overambitious Atlanta bank whose finances turned so shaky a few years ago that it was swallowed by a hostile buyer. The other nine are in Asia, including twin towers in Malaysia that, when completed next year, will be the world's tallest.
 In the Far East, every few years a new building claims the Tallest-in-Asia title: the Kompleks Tun Abdul Razak Building in Penang, Malaysia, in 1985; the Overseas Union Bank Centre in Singapore in 1986; the Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong in 1989; Central Plaza, also in Hong Kong, in 1992, and next year, the Petronas towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
 Why? The question in Asia is, "Why not?" "They all want to show off," said I. M. Pei, the architect, just back from discussing a new headquarters for the Bank of China in Beijing. "Everyone wants to outbuild everyone else."
 Kuala Lumpur's landmark will be 22 feet taller than Chicago's Sears Tower, built way back in 1974 and dubbed "the world's tallest real estate problem" before Sears, Roebuck & Company unloaded it last year.

 
 
See-Through Buildings
 Although Asia's upstart economies are expanding much more rapidly than America's, the architectural space race turns on more than economic growth rates. In the 1980's real estate speculators in the United States built office towers with all the space companies need into the next millenium, and maybe into the one after that. Despite several years of economic growth, many American cities still have vacancy rates higher than 20 percent, their downtowns filled with see-through buildings.
 No longer is the demand for office space growing as fast as the economy. Cost-crazed corporations terrorize their staffs with vast layoffs even when their sales expand. They hand out cellular phones and laptop computers to their sales, audit and service people, telling them to hit the road and stay there. And those employees who still haunt company premises find that while they once sprawled out in offices as large as hotel rooms, they are now crammed into spaces the size of hotel bathrooms.

 
 
Offices Like Hotels
 In fact, companies like the Ernst & Young accounting firm run many of their offices just like hotels, allowing employees to check in only temporarily. "I'm not sure how the staff thinks about it when they have 37 people operating at the same desk," said Ken Townsend, managing partner in Dallas of the firm's subsidiary, the E & Y Kenneth Leventhal Real Estate Group. "But management thinks it's great."
 In the United States, skyscrapers have become gauche, symbols of executive ego and corporate extravagance, objects of shareholder and neighborhood scorn. Donald Trump's schemes for raising the world's tallest building on Manhattan's West Side were soon discounted more than his junk bonds. A skyscraper planned for Columbus Circle has come no closer to construction than Columbus came to Asia.
 Companies now go for suburban greenery. The tallest building at Microsoft's headquarters near Seattle soars three stories, outstripped by the surrounding Douglas firs. Could there be a Microsoft megatower in the works? "Oh no," said Erin Carney, speaking for the company. "For us, what's truly important is the products and the software you produce, not a flashy, tall building."
 Arriviste Asians, meanwhile, are jumping straight from rice paddies to high-rises. Here in Gaungzhou, office towers stand right near apartments with no indoor plumbing, where residents begin their days by emptying chamber pots.

 
 
No Sewers
 The metropolitan area of Jakarta, Indonesia, has 16 million people and a new tower that rises higher than New York's former Pan Am Building, but, as yet, no sewers. In Engineering News-Record magazine, Rem Koolhaas, the prominent Dutch architect, questioned the wisdom of building skyscrapers for raising, as he put it, "chickens on the 40th floor."
 As the high-rise business has dried up in the United States, the nation's master builders fly off to court Asian executives and ministers. Mr. Pei designed the Bank of China building in Hong Kong and Cesar Pelli of New Haven has the Kuala Lumpur commission. Mr. Pelli vigorously denies reports that in order to win the commission he had to promise the Malaysian Prime Minister that he would top the Sears tower. He says he won the job by designing distinctively Malaysian buildings, although quarter-mile-high towers have not figured prominently in the country's architectural history. Meanwhile, Mr. Pelli's plans for a skyscraper in Chicago have languished for five years, with nobody willing to write the necessarily tall check.
 With the start of even loftier buildings planned in Chongqing, China, and Hong Kong this year, Asians are just beginning to learn a few American-style lessons in high-rise economics. Japan has already crashed, leaving real estate investors unable to even guess how much their property is worth. Hong Kong, where a parking space once sold for $500,000, is also teetering; real estate values there are now off more than 10 percent from their peak and the Chinese Communists are due to take over in two years. The next victim could be Shanghai. Western-style offices were virtually unknown there until about a decade ago, but Shanghai is confidently putting up the equivalent of five new Empire State Buildings for the fourth year in a row.

 
 
Everywhere but Up
 "One thing we learned in the United States in the 1990's," said Anthony Downs, a global real estate specialist for the Brookings Institution and Salomon Brothers, "prices always have someplace to go but up."
 Some engineers question how well the Asian towers can withstand the region's natural forces, its earthquakes and typhoons, let alone its market forces. Then there are the supernatural forces.
 Most major projects in many Far Eastern nations require the blessings of feng shui masters, who are able to divine whether the sites, the designs, even the alignment of escalators, conform with ancient Daoist tenets. "They earn more than the architects do," Mr. Pei whispered, betraying a trace of annoyance.
 Mr. Pei, an American born in Guangzhou, said his Bank of China building in Hong Kong had won approval from one feng shui master. Then another discovered that Mr. Pei's angular building was shooting destructive rays at the Governor's mansion. Some strategic willow-planting defended the colonial residence. Still, it might be harder to propitiate the heavenly powers as they hear clangorous Asian construction crews drawing ever closer.

HEADLINE: The World: ...Or Else;
Hostage-Taking Is a Weapon Of War Whose Time Is Now

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN their citizens are taken hostage, most nations start out talking like Clint Eastwood. We won't negotiate with terrorists, they say through clenched teeth. Go ahead, make our day.
 It usually turns out to be bluster. The fact of life in modern democracies is that television pictures of handcuffed, blindfolded prisoners exert an inexorable, sapping effect on political will. Cutting a deal is almost always easier than explaining away bungled commando raids. 
 Just ask Jimmy Carter. Or Ronald Reagan. Or the French, who publicly proclaimed they would never yield to terror even as they privately proffered concessions to secure the release of NATO soldiers held by the Bosnian Serbs. Or Boris N. Yeltsin, the Russian President, who erupted in volcanic anger at the economic summit meeting in Nova Scotia last Sunday after the Russian Parliament demanded that he open direct talks with Chechen rebels holding nearly 2,000 Russian hostages.
 "This is a bad mistake, a bad move on their part, because now I, myself, have become a hostage to these very same bandits," Mr. Yeltsin blurted out, in a blunt summing up of what many Western leaders have felt but few have dared say aloud.

 
 
Comeback
 This century's conflicts have been accompanied by almost every imaginable brutality, from genocide to nuclear warfare to poison gas attacks to the indiscriminate fire-bombing of civilians. But it was not until quite recently that the time-honored tactic of taking of hostages re-emerged as a weapon of warfare or national policy, accompanied by the rise of global, instantaneous communications.
 Iranians held American diplomats hostage for 444 days from 1979 to 1981, giving birth to a nightly television special then called "America Held Hostage," and now known as "Nightline." Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, grabbed "human shields" on the eve of the Persian Gulf war, paraded them around in televised interviews, and then released them.
 The Bosnian Serbs took United Nations peacekeepers as hostages after the latest NATO air raids, and set them free only after being allowed to reclaim their heavy weapons from depots in the Sarajevo hills. By some accounts, French officials promised the Serbs there would be no further NATO bombing, a charge France denies.
 Just last week, Moscow opened new talks with the Chechen rebels, shortly after permitting perpetrators of the raid to exchange their hostages for safe passage back home.
 "We're all vulnerable to hostage-taking," said Peter Rodman, a national security official in the Reagan Administration. "It's an effective tactic against a modern, industrial power that has inhibitions. It is the weapon of choice for the ruthless and weak."
 The modern era has heightened that vulnerability in several ways. Live TV pictures of captives put a human face on a problem that might otherwise seem remote. (It's no coincidence that France advised its networks to electronically obscure the faces of soldiers taken hostage by the Serbs.)
 The fall of Communism turned loose a host of tribal mini-states bidding for independence and unfettered by the niceties of international order. Neither the Bosnian Serbs nor the Chechen rebels seem to care much whether they end up with a seat in the United Nations or the other trappings of world status that they might earn by respecting international norms.

 
 
Barbary Payoff
 In Russia, the advent of democracy has opened up new possibilities for terrorism in the ethnically fractious country. Unlike his predecessors, Mr. Yeltsin has to deal with a free press, opposition legislators and public opinion, which is molded by TV footage of Russian civilians begging for their lives.
 Taking hostages, of course, is hardly a modern invention. It was commonplace in the brutal wars of the Balkans and the Caucasus for hundreds of years.
 Two centuries ago, a hostage crisis marred George Washington's second term as pirates operating off the coast of Africa seized more than 100 American sailors.
 An outraged Congress declined to pay ransom -- the custom at the time for dealing with pirates -- and in 1794 ordered the Administration to create an American Navy to challenge the Barbary pirates. Military procurement, however, proved as cumbersome then as it does today. Two years later, Washington won the captives' release, and peace with the pirates, by paying nearly $1 million, a huge sum for the period.
 Although the Japanese did put prison camps near some potential military targets, the big wars of this century by and large did not involve the use of the hostage weapon.
 John Keegan, the British military historian and defense editor of The Daily Telegraph, noted that Hitler's "curious legalistic streak" prompted the Nazis to generally follow the Geneva Convention on their treatment of Western prisoners. The Germans, he said, were also constrained by a fear that the Allies might retaliate in kind. Neither the North Koreans nor the North Vietnamese used prisoners as human shields, though both had ample opportunities.
 The Munich Olympics in 1972, with the seizing of Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists, marked the advent of a new era, in which blanket news coverage of an event was the goal rather than a byproduct.
 Throughout the 1980's, Islamic groups, the Red Brigades and others took hostages, and turned governments upside down. President Reagan swore he would never negotiate, and then ended up nearly destroying his second term with the covert sale of arms to Iran in a largely failed attempt to free American hostages held in Lebanon.
 Noel Koch, a former senior counterterrorism official who runs TranSecur, a private security concern, said: "When you're new to this business, it's very easy to swallow this 'no negotiations' thing. I can tell you, the first time you manage one of these things, that goes out the window."
 Over the years, hostage-takers have learned a lot about how to frustrate the West's counterterrorism commandos. The Bosnian Serbs, for example, made sure to scatter their prisoners at a variety of remote locales, making rescue missions all but impossible. Russian soldiers had little luck in dislodging an enemy that fired weapons while hiding behind civilian captives.
 So, is the late 20th century going to end up being the Age of Hostages in military history? Mr. Keegan argues not, saying the tactic has limited effectiveness, since after a while "people harden their hearts."
 Robert Kagan, former member of the State Department's policy planning staff, was less sanguine. Allowing the rogues of the world's new conflicts to break the rules invites imitation, he said.
 "People have said you could somehow cauterize this conflict, and keep it from disrupting the state system," Mr. Kagan said of the events in Bosnia. "But ultimately, history makes it clear that you can't cauterize these things. Retreat by the state system only accelerates the challenges."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Productivity Is All, But It Doesn't Pay Well

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT is a principle as old as capitalism and the antithesis of Marxism: workers should reap according to their labors. Yet over the last six years, compensation for American workers seems to have stagnated even as they have worked ever more efficiently and produced ever more goods.
 The trend is especially striking because it breaks one of the most enduring patterns in American economic history. Workers have fairly consistently collected about two-thirds of the nation's economic output in the form of wages, salaries and benefits. Owners of capital, like stocks or bonds or small businesses, have collected the other third, in the form of dividends, profits and investment gains. 
 "It is remarkable how constant labor's share has been over the last 150 years," said Lawrence Katz, a former chief economist at the Labor Department. "This is one of the strongest regularities of advanced economies."
 Wages and salaries and benefits actually climbed slightly faster than productivity for a while in the late 1960's and early 1970's. Productivity moved ahead a little faster than compensation during the late 1970's and through much of the 1980's. But it seems that the real gap opened after that.
 The strongest evidence so far that workers are receiving less of the fruits of their labors came last week, when the Labor Department revised its estimates of wage and compensation growth. After adjusting for inflation, average wages and salaries apparently fell 2.3 percent over the 12-month period that ended in March. Productivity rose 2.1 percent during the same period.
 Include fringe benefits, and the current numbers look even worse for the wage-earners. Overall compensation fell 3 percent in the 12-month period through March, as companies and state and local governments provided fewer health care benefits.
 The drop has provoked a profusion of historical comparisons. "A high-capital income society is no longer a middle-income society but something reminiscent of the Gilded Age," said Bradford DeLong, a former deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury for policy analysis in the Clinton Administration.
 Conservative economists question whether the new pattern will persist. People will tend to leave companies that consistently pay them less than the value of their work, they contend, so companies will have to increase pay as their workers produce more.
 Wages may be falling because many of the workers now entering the labor force are poorly educated and therefore have less value to employers, said John C. Weicher, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservative research group here. The declining value of young American workers reflects the decline of the nation's educational system, he said, adding that during the late 19th century, the arrival of millions of poorly educated immigrants also held down wages.

 
 
Paychecks vs. Dividend Checks
The Labor Department's new figures are particularly striking because they suggest that wage problems in the work force do not just reflect a widening gap between high-paid workers and low-paid workers. People who rely on paychecks also appear to be losing ground to people with dividends and investment gains.
 The Labor Department figures are not the only word; data from the Commerce Department show a relatively modest erosion of labor's overall share of the nation's goods and services. But those figures are scheduled for a broad recalculation at the end of this year, and Professor Paul Krugman at Stanford University, who has argued that inequality among workers is more of a problem than an overall shrinkage of employment compensation, said that he would not change his mind until discrepancies among the two departments' figures are addressed.
 No matter how the numbers are calculated, workers with few skills seem to be losing out in the struggle for prosperity in America, Mr. Krugman noted. "We're only asking whether it goes to highly skilled professions or to capital," he said.
 Experts offer many explanations for falling pay. They include the increasing automation of workplaces, more competition from foreign countries and the declining power of labor unions.
 But there are fewer arguments about the effects on American society if the trend continues for many years.
 "If we lose our middle class and become a two-tiered society, we not only risk the nation's future prosperity but also its social coherence and stability," said Labor Secretary Robert Reich. "As the economy grows, people who work the machines and clean the offices and provide the basic goods and services are supposed to share in the gains, but that hasn't been happening."

HEADLINE: The Nation: Primary Politics;
In Congress, It's Nearly 1996

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Senate majority leader had it all figured out. He would get the Congress to move quickly on a litmus test issue that would guarantee support from the key element in his party.
 That was in 1960, and the Senate majority leader was Lyndon Johnson. He arranged a Congressional session to follow the party nominating conventions so that a new minimum wage bill could be passed and the Democrats' concerns for the working man demonstrated. 
 History repeated itself, sort of, when Bob Dole maneuvered last week to kill the nomination of Dr. Henry W. Foster Jr. to be Surgeon General, thereby pleasing anti-abortion forces and the right generally and one-upping Senator Phil Gramm, who has wanted to slay the Foster-dragon himself.

 
 
The First Primary
 Despite ritual denials from Mr. Dole and others, Presidential politics was plainly at work. Democrats scoffed at "the first Republican primary" just as Republicans fumed in 1960 that Johnson was misusing the legislative process for partisan gain by putting off the minimum wage issue until close to the election.
 But there are important differences. This time it was 17 months before the election instead of 3. Mr. Dole was playing politics with Senate business -- arranging for Dr. Foster's nomination to be killed by a brief filibuster, since he had enough votes to keep a filibuster alive but not enough to defeat the nomination on the merits -- in pursuit of his party's nomination, not the general election. Moreover, Mr. Dole succeeded. Johnson did not. He got the Senate to pass the bill raising the minimum wage from $1 to $1.25 an hour, but the House would not go along. And he and John F. Kennedy did not have the issue for the campaign.
 It is commonplace for one party to accuse the other of manipulating Congressional business to help its chances for the White House. But it is also usually wrong. The lawmakers are generally far less worried about electing a President than about re-electing themselves.
 One recent Congress did seem to be dedicated to affecting a Presidential election. In 1992, the Democrats went to great lengths to embarrass George Bush. They arranged vote after vote on extending emergency unemployment compensation. They stalled on a family leave bill until not long before Election Day. They put nice-sounding bills before him that they expected him to veto so they could attack him for that. The most spectacular was their campaign reform measure, which passed in the House only after Speaker Thomas S. Foley personally guaranteed reluctant Democrats that Mr. Bush would veto the bill.
 Since their nominee won the election, by one standard the Congressional Democrats won. But the gridlock "fed the image of neither institution being able to do something," said Charles O. Jones, a Congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution, and ended up damaging the Democrats in Congress. They lost a dozen House seats and only held their own in the Senate.
 In the Foster debate, too, the Republicans showed that they are better at playing politics in Congress. Senator Edward M. Kennedy insisted it was not fair to Dr. Foster to have to vote on ending a filibuster, which needs 60 votes. So Mr. Dole came back with a list that showed there had been 24 filibusters against nominees since 1968, including a couple Mr. Kennedy had led. And he insisted that breaking filibusters was the normal way the Senate now does business.

 
 
What Was Fair Then
 Nor is it only the Democrats who find consistency a hobgoblin of political failure. In 1986, when Democrats were filibustering against a judicial nominee named Clarence Manion, Mr. Dole complained, "I hope we will do what is fair and what we customarily do in this chamber and that is give this man an up-or-down vote." Mr. Dole had his way. The filibuster was broken. Democratic filibusters have never defeated a nominee.
 Of course, this skirmish is not over for Mr. Dole. Ann F. Lewis, a former Democratic operative now working for Planned Parenthood, was sorry for Dr. Foster's loss, but said that standing against abortion worked better in Republican nominating politics than in general elections. "Bob Dole might have won the straw poll today," she said, "but this issue has a habit of swinging the other way in the general election."

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends;
Get on Line for Plato's Cave

BYLINE: By DAVID BERREBY 

 BODY:
"Bombardier beetle" seems an apt name for an animal that fights its enemies by shooting a burst of chemicals that explode with a tiny bang. But what if the beetle had been discovered before anyone had ever heard of bombardiers? It would have been known by some other name. Every age sees the world through the lens of its own obsessions, using its latest inventions as metaphors. For Rene Descartes to see animals as machines, there first had to be machines. It takes nothing away from Charles Darwin's observation that species compete and adapt to note that Darwin himself came from an industrializing society whose members were being forced to compete and adapt. 
 The digital revolution is based on the idea that things as disparate as love letters, Hollywood movies and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony can all be broken down into the digital code of 0's and 1's and distributed by various kinds of computer. Now there's no doubt that thought has followed the economy out of the industrial era; Rust Belt metaphors for both nature and society -- the sun is a furnace, New York is a melting pot -- have given way to images of information-processing. The sun is now an information system changing over time. So is New York. So are you.

 
 
Stock Prices and Traffic
 The brain is a computer. The essence of humanity is encoded in DNA, a highly efficient chemical for storing information. Advocates of complexity theory say they can find fundamental laws of change and use them to predict and manage that change, regardless of what is changing -- stock prices or traffic.
 What is common to these intellectual and commercial currents is the idea that the information itself is the most profound aspect of whatever is being studied. Hence the biologist Richard Dawkins argues that we are all only elaborate carrying cases for our genes. And the physicists Doyne Farmer and Norman Packard, of the Prediction Company in Santa Fe, N.M., make stock picks on the basis of numerical patterns, without worrying about what the companies do.
 Like Europeans of the Enlightenment, who perfected the clock and then saw all nature as clockwork, we moderns tend to think information is all that counts. Once a symphony has been encoded on a disk, what difference does it make whose stereo it plays on? The belief that information is all is the heart of the fantasy of "Jurassic Park," whose premise was that once dinosaur DNA could be retrieved, it would be no trouble to make dinosaurs. Get the code, solve the problem. The rest -- eggs, fertilization, care and feeding -- is trivial.
 Last week, David Bunnell, a man enough on top of trends to have been a leader of Students for a Democratic Society in the 1960's and to have worked at the New Mexico firm that made the first personal computer in 1975, announced that he would launch Content.com, an on-line service devoted to books and publishing. It will offer book-related clips and book excerpts when it first gets rolling next year, Mr. Bunnell says, but he foresees a day when users could download an entire book. How -- or whether -- they print it out will be their business. Typography and paper would be up to each computer user. Those are details, Mr. Bunnell suggests. "What are books, really," he asks, "but ideas?"
 But there is a dissenting view. The critic Walter Kendrick, an English professor at Fordham University in New York City, does not see books as mere packages for ideas. "Reading a book," he said, "is a physical experience -- holding it, propping it on your lap. Reading has never been just naked contact between your mind and the author's. Reading is a sensual pleasure."
 What about electronic mail? One of its virtues is that it has no physical existence. A subscriber to a network can get mail in New York or New Delhi. But there's something missing. "When I touch a letter from a friend, I value the knowledge that I'm touching the same paper that was in contact -- actual physical contact -- with the friend," said David Ives, a playwright in New York City.

 
 
The Messy World
 Part of the current backlash against the Internet is a desire to speak up for messy, specific, embodied things, as distinct from their information content.
 Actually, the idea of a split between the corrupt, confusing material world and the clear world of abstraction dates back to Plato, who saw perceptible reality as an imperfect embodiment of a realm of perfect forms. The current emphasis on information resembles a familiar turn in Western thought: denigrating the earthbound, elevating the abstract. "Cyberspace," writes the philosopher Michael Heim in "The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality," "is Platonism as a working product."
 But information is not all there is to human experience. Mr. Dawkins's notion of the "selfish gene" as the only important unit in evolution, for example, is hotly contested by other biologists. And the "Jurassic Park" notion of DNA as the be-all and end-all is not one shared by cell biologists. The code is important, but so are all the questions about how exactly the code is made flesh. "How a protein folds, how it responds in the cell to hormones and nutrients, all those things are tremendously consequential," said Dr. Rex Chisholm, a molecular biologist at Northwestern Medical School, in Chicago.
 Just as the clockwork universe receded, no doubt the information metaphor will eventually give way. Still, the idea of pure information may always have its adherents, for much the same reason that the perfect forms of Plato have endured. Immaterial abstractions seem appealing when the material world is bleak. "Our material world gets dirtier and shabbier and more brutal as we go along," Mr. Kendrick said. "So we're attracted to this ethereal bill of goods we've been sold, this wonder world elsewhere."

One Perverse Distinction New York Can't Claim

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

 BODY:
IT is an article of faith among New Yorkers that if it happens in the Big Apple it is either top of the heap or bottom of the barrel.
 The famous New Yorker cover by Saul Steinberg showing the Manhattan skyline dwarfing the rest of the United States is a wry expression of New York City's outsized ego. That self-centeredness is also evident in the best-worst way New Yorkers rank their museums and their murder rate, their home teams and homeless, their roguish politicians and percolating night life. 
 Yet despite the way many of them gripe about New York City's schools as if they were in the national cellar, they are, by several measures, better than most urban school systems.

 
 
'His Brother Was Worse'
 With 47.5 percent of the city's students scoring above grade level on reading tests and 50.3 percent above grade level in math, according to results released June 12, New York City fares better than all but one of the 10 largest urban systems, and the gap with first place San Diego is small. In Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami and Philadelphia, only a third of the students read above the national average, though they perform somewhat better in mathematics.
 New Yorkers long exasperated with their schools may see the distinction as something like the tribute in the story about a scoundrel's funeral where no one could be found to deliver a eulogy until one mourner piped up: "His brother was worse!" Still, New York City's educational ranking, experts say, tells much about its uniqueness among cities.
 For one thing, New York City's sprawling geography and its place as the world's center of finance and communications has allowed it to retain more of a middle class willing to send its children to public schools than cities like Detroit or Newark, experts say. Economic class correlates closely with academic achievement, and middle-class families in leafy neighborhoods like Bayside and Douglaston in Queens -- where 80 percent of the students scored above grade level -- tend to be more demanding of their schools.
 "You've got a wider mix of students than most school systems that have largely been abandoned by the middle class," said Michael Casserly, director of the Council of Great City Schools, which keeps statistics on the 50 largest systems.
 As the nation's legendary port for immigrants, the city attracts thousands of students who may be poor but are hungry for the achievement that may have eluded their nomadic parents. It is even favored by its particular immigrant mix. The city's Asians, for example, tend more often to come from relatively stable countries like China and Korea than from countries like Vietnam and Cambodia where children were swept up in political turbulence and lost crucial school years.
 "With immigrant populations, you get high-achieving kids, but you also get kids who are illiterate in their own language," said Diane Ravitch, author of "The Great School Wars: A History of New York City Public Schools" (Basic Books, 1974). "But compared to other cities New York has a more dynamic mix of the kids who are incredibly ambitious and striving."
 Reading and math data, of course, must be interpreted delicately. The 10 largest cities use five different exams, test different grades and sometimes exclude all bilingual and special education students, thereby inflating their scores.
 Still, New York City -- which in recent weeks has been struggling with a departing chancellor, a flurry of sexual abuse incidents involving teachers and school guards, spoiled food in some lunch programs and decaying school buildings -- is nevertheless blessed by several hoary traditions.
 Emanuel Tobier, a professor of planning at New York University, cites the city's strong civil service system and that it is linked to merit. Just as its public housing managers are among the nation's best, so its teaching and administrative staffs have been somewhat shielded from the patronage and nepotism dogging other cities.
 Tom Loveless, who studies education policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, points out that New York State's Regents examinations force teachers to teach to a moderately high standard. And, he notes, New York City spends more per pupil than many urban systems, particularly those in California and Texas.
 Finally, because of its vibrancy and cultural life, the city has always attracted more than its share of imaginative people, and so have its schools. Over the decades, it has come up with some of the country's most celebrated innovations, including some of the first selective schools in the country, like the Bronx High School of Science and Stuyvesant, which have helped it retain bright children whose parents might otherwise depart for the suburbs. It is no accident that New York City turns out a sizable percentage of the 40 winners of the Westinghouse Science Talent Search.
 "New York City is a very sophisticated town," conceded Eugene Campbell, superintendent of Newark's ailing public schools, "and they know how to deal with things on a sophisticated level."

HEADLINE: Celebration And a Plea For Spending On Seawolf

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER 

DATELINE: GROTON, Conn., June 24

 BODY:
Under a gloomy sky as steel-gray as the boat being christened, Navy Secretary John H. Dalton today delivered an impassioned plea for continued spending on the nuclear-powered Seawolf submarine, even as its future remains highly doubtful in Congress.
In doubt, too, is what will happen to thousands of workers at the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics, many of whom watched pensively as Mr. Dalton's wife, Margaret, broke a champagne bottle on the hull of the boat at a crowded ceremony in the shipyard here. 
 Construction of a second Seawolf is well under way here, and the Clinton Administration wants a third copy of the $2.4 billion attack submarine, even though its military usefulness has not been seriously defended since the end of the Cold War. But Republicans in the House have been hostile, and even supporters talk as much about preserving jobs and submarine-building skills as they do about facing up to the Russians.
"The nuclear submarine-building industry represents an investment we have spent over 40 years to develop," Mr. Dalton said today as hundreds of naval officers, several Congressmen and thousands of Electric Boat employees looked on. "We are gambling with a national treasure if we do not take steps to preserve it."
The New-Age piano music tinkling around the great gray bulk of the partially submerged vessel gave off a deceptive air of calm to a ceremony that might prove to have been a wake for a dead armament.
Hardly anyone questions the effect that shutting down Seawolf production would have on the economy of southeastern Connecticut. About 14,500 people are employed at the shipyard here, and if the third Seawolf is not built, all but 3,000 or 4,000, most of them engineers, will be out of work, said James E. Turner, Electric Boat's president.
"If we don't build the third Seawolf, there will be no work in the shipyards for a couple of years," Mr. Turner said in an interview.
But already, the House, in its version of the defense spending bill passed earlier this month, has refused to appropriate the remaining $1.5 billion needed to complete the third Seawolf, allocating instead roughly that amount for more work on the second submarine and the Seawolf's successor, known as the New Attack Submarine.
The Senate Armed Services Committee's seapower subcommittee takes up the Seawolf next week, with supporters predicting passage at least at that stage. But its future in the full Senate is much less certain. The program has some powerful opponents, including Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, the home state of Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, which wants to compete with Electric Boat for submarine work.
"I'm concerned about my job more than anything," said Bob Berek, a pipefitter at the shipyard who has worked on the Seawolf. "It would be great to get a third Seawolf, but that isn't going to stop the layoffs.
"The workers know our time is limited, and we'll have to gear up and start looking for other employment."
In his remarks today, Mr. Dalton made an argument for the third Seawolf, casting it less as a necessity of international geopolitics than as a measure needed to preserve a valuable native industry. And he made oblique reference to a frequent criticism of the ship's expense.
"The third Seawolf which we need will be the bridge that preserves this industry to build a more affordable, littoral warfare-oriented New Attack Submarine," Mr. Dalton said.
"There is a chasm in our defense industrial strength," the secretary said. "If Congress does not authorize and fund the third Seawolf, the depth of this chasm will not simply be measured in lost jobs, or dollars wasted in higher overhead and contracting fees, but in the potential breakup of a defense industry that has always served our best interest in preserving the peace."

HEADLINE: U.N., in Debt, Seeks Arrears From U.S. and Others

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 23

 BODY:
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is bound for the celebration of the United Nations 50th anniversary in San Francisco next week bearing a gloomy message: The United Nations is going broke.
Speaking to a working group on the organization's financial problems on Thursday, Mr. Boutros-Ghali said that only 48 of the 185 member states had fully paid their regular budget contributions by the end of May. 
 The deepening financial crisis this has caused could force the United Nations to stop reimbursing countries that contribute troops and equipment to peacekeeping, he said. He said the peacekeeping debt could rise from the present $800 million to $1.1 billion by the end of the year.
The Secretary General is trying to persuade the nations that are behind in their payments, especially the United States, that it is in their national interest to pay up.
On Friday, he told the World Affairs Council in Los Angeles that the United States could save money working through the United Nations. For example, Washington's cost of intervening in Haiti had fallen from $50 million a month to less than $8 million since the United Nations took over the operation.
He will take his case further when he speaks Sunday at the celebration, spelling out what the United Nations is doing to save money.
According to Mr. Boutros-Ghali's office, the United Nations is owed nearly $2.8 billion in assessments by member states, while it owes more than $1.7 billion.
The Secretariat has identified the United States as the worst delinquent, with $1.18 billion in arrears as of May 31. Others include Russia ($599 million), Ukraine ($217 million), South Africa ($113 million) and France ($81 million). The United States, disputing some calculations, says its arrears amount to $955.5 million.
The debts accumulated by the United Nations include $800 million owed to 60 member states that provided peacekeepers and equipment. About $375 million more is owed to businesses that supply the organization.
The arrears of South Africa include assessments for the years from 1974 to 1994, when it was barred from taking part in the General Assembly because of its apartheid policy. An official at the South African mission here said the post-apartheid Government is considering the issue.
Last week, the Secretary General proposed that countries that owe money for peacekeeping should issue bonds that other countries awaiting payment could hold and redeem, but the proposal received a cool response.

HEADLINE: Vote Today a Turning Point for Haiti

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: ST.-MARC, Haiti, June 23

 BODY:
The ballots have been stacked in a corner of a dark, bare room, 420 to a box in a pile that reaches almost to the ceiling.
Guarded by an armed police officer, they are waiting to be shipped off to polling places in this rundown Haitian port on the north coast and in the nearby countryside, where eager voters are expected to begin lining up at 6 A.M. Sunday. 
 Biron Odige, 28, deputy chief of the Communal Election Board here, appreciates the significance of those sheets of paper. He knows only too well, he said, that thousands of his countrymen died and hundreds of thousands were forced to go into exile or -- like him -- to go underground so Sunday's vote could take place.
"This is a turning point for all Haitians," said Mr. Odige, a student. "For me, election day represents the end of the coup d'etat and our entry into a state of law. There were many difficult moments during the time I spent in hiding, but I always held to the idea that some day this could happen."
As an exercise in democracy, the election will be even larger than the vote in December 1990 that swept Jean-Bertrand Aristide into the presidency. More than 10,500 candidates from 28 political parties are competing for 2,200 posts, from the Senate and Chamber of Deputies to mayors's offices and municipal councils.
Since Mr. Aristide's election, Haiti has experienced much.
There was a military coup that overthrew the President, three years of a brutal military dictatorship, a crushing economic embargo intended to topple that junta, the intervention last fall of 20,000 American troops to restore President Aristide to office and now the presence of United Nations peacekeepers.
But suffering has only enhanced the meaning of the election.
"To be able to cast a ballot is one of the biggest things in my life," said Dugariste Ditreuil, 21, a student who was studying for final exams with friends on a park bench in the main square. "I've been preparing myself for a long time to be able to take part in the betterment of my country, waiting for this moment to arrive."
The Government estimates that 3.5 million people, nearly 90 percent of those thought to be eligible, have registered for Sunday's vote -- a 25 percent increase over 1990.
Virtually no opinion polling has been done, leaving candidates of all political stripes free to forecast smashing victories.
But Haitian political analysts and foreign diplomats predicted that most votes would be won by three political groups that supported Mr. Aristide in 1990: the Lavalas Political Organization, the National Front for Change and Democracy and the National Congress of Democratic Movements.
"Yes, if two-thirds of the people voted for Aristide in 1990, it is logical that the democratic sector will be heavily represented" at all levels of power once the vote is in, said Gerard Pierre-Charles, leader of the Lavalas group, which has President Aristide's formal support.
But, he added, since Haiti has little experience with democracy, "no one knows what motivates people to vote, whether it is adherence to an organization or the force of a candidate's personality."
With a few exceptions, the campaign has gone more smoothly than predicted. There have been isolated episodes of candidates being fired on or election officials being beaten up, and one former leader of the despised Tontons Macoute threatened to disrupt the vote when he was ruled ineligible to run.
[Overnight Friday, two polling centers near Cap-Haitien, on the northern coast, were attacked, Haitian and international officials said. One center was set afire and about 3,000 ballots burned; election supplies were stolen from the other Election officials said new materials had been sent and they expect voting to take place normally.]
So far the systematic violence and intimidation led by the disbanded Haitian armed forces that forced the cancellation of the 1987 presidential election and threatened the 1990 vote has been avoided.
"This time there's been no security problem, and it feels like a holiday for the entire country," said Osler Lyndor, 49, a laborer here who said he was enthusiastically following the campaign. "For once we Haitians are not fighting with each other."
The Haitian organizers of the vote and their United Nations advisers have taken many steps to avoid the vast fraud that has almost always marred elections. For instance, all voters are to have their fingers daubed with indelible ink to prevent them from voting more than once.
Hundreds of official observers from the United States, Latin America, Canada and Europe, led by more than 300 delegates from the Organization of American States, will be deployed at polling places. The United Nations peacekeeping force of nearly 7,000 soldiers and police officers will protect voters.
The campaigning has been marked by many organizational problems and irregularities, though, leading some opposition parties to complain of a deliberate effort to hinder their chances. Criticism of Anselme Remy, president of the Provisional Election Commission, and the eight other members has been almost universal.
"They have made a lot of honest mistakes due to lack of experience and lack of competence," said Jean-Robert Sabalat, who was chairman of the electoral commission that supervised the 1990 election. "It's a pity, but they have lost their credibility, and no one trusts them anymore." Mr. Sabalat is running for a Senate seat.
Mr. Remy's most controversial action was his announcement late last month that a million or more voter registration cards had disappeared. In an interview, he said he had made the statement to "sensitize the public to the possibility of fraud in the system."
American, United Nations and O.A.S. officials have since said that the cards were not, in fact, ever missing. But Mr. Remy has continued to insist that hundreds of thousands of cards are missing, and foreign election observers say his statements have cast doubt, apparently unnecessarily, on the credibility of the election process.
The large registration fees that independent candidates and small parties are required to pay under the election code that President Aristide decreed into law in February are also controversial. Some opposition candidates fear they may triumph at the polls only to see their victories annulled because they have not paid the fees.
Mr. Remy said a final tally in Sunday's vote would not be available for 8 to 10 days. Much of rural Haiti, where nearly three-quarters of the population lives, lacks electricity or telephones. The ballots will be counted by hand and the results taken, in some cases on foot or by donkey, over a precarious road system to regional counting centers.
The vast majority of Haitian voters are illiterate, and each party has adopted symbols that will appear on the ballot next to candidates' names.
But many independent candidates, including Manno Charlemagne, a popular protest singer who appears to be running a strong race for Mayor of Port-au-Prince, have complained that a Haitian flag was used on the ballot next to their names instead of their individual emblems.
Mr. Odige, the election official, said he had his favorite candidates but he declined to disclose them. What is important, he said, is not so much the result as the process itself.
"Aristide's return opened the door for us," he said. "Now we must step through it into democracy."

HEADLINE: U.N. Finds Skepticism Is Eroding The Hope That Is Its Foundation

SERIES: The U.N. At 50

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 24

 BODY:
Senator Claiborne Pell, the sole remaining member of Congress to have been present when the United Nations Charter was adopted here 50 years ago this Monday, nurtures vivid memories of a euphoric time.
The Senator, now 76, was among scores of young Americans and Europeans demobilized from the battlefields of World War II and shipped west to be the aides of statesmen pledged to create a new international order. 
 "It started out just right," he recalled in a recent conversation in his Senate office. "Instead of flying us to San Francisco, they chartered a train across the United States.
"You could see the eyes of all those people who had been in wartorn Europe boggle as we passed the wheat fields, the factories. You could feel the richness, the clean air of the United States. It was a wonderful image. We shared a spirit, a belief, that we would never make the same mistakes; everything would now be done differently."
In those heady days half a century ago, the United Nations emerged as a club of victorious allies pledged to prevent aggression and provide assistance for those in need. Today, for most Americans, it is no longer the hope of a better world.
As San Francisco has been preparing friendly and glittering ceremonies to mark the Charter's birth on June 26, 1945, the United Nations is under attack in Congress. This attack could significantly alter Washington's relationship with the organization, crippling its work in fields as diverse as labor practices and population control.
United Nations offices are getting more threatening crank calls and less access to Congressional committees, officials say.
President Clinton, who is to speak at ceremonies on Monday, has warned against isolationism but offers only lukewarm praise for the United Nations. "Sometimes, as bad and as ragged as it is, the U.N. is better than nothing," he said in an informal debate with Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker, in New Hampshire on June 11.
In Congress, on talk shows and on the street, Americans voice recurrent fears and complaints. The United Nations, almost entirely American in concept -- its name was coined by President Franklin D. Roosevelt -- had barely begun to function before it got trapped in the cold war. Soon Moscow and many newly independent nations were isolating and vilifying the United States.
"There were times when only the United States and Israel voted together, and people questioned whether we had any friends there," said Benjamin A. Gilman, the New York Republican and chairman of the House Committee on International Relations.
Resolutions defining Zionism as racism cost the United Nations Association of the United States, an important support group, thousands of members as whole chapters disbanded.
"Congress has been concerned about the extensiveness of our funds and about a great deal of mismanagement in the organization," Mr. Gilman said. In peacekeeping, he added, "there are some 17 missions around the world costing millions of dollars where the U.N. is engaged in nation-building and other activities which have not produced much peace."
"A number of things have added up to a questioning of the U.N.," Mr. Gilman said. Meanwhile, the organization seems too aloof, unable or unwilling to educate the American public on its accomplishments. "It would be extremely helpful," he said, "if people were to recognize, for example, how much goes into disease control and disease elimination, and how much goes into feeding the hungry."
Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana and the ranking minority member on Mr. Gilman's committee, said notions of threats to American independence of action also loom large.
"In some groups of Americans, there is a distinct fear of loss of U.S. sovereignty to the U.N.," Mr. Hamilton said. "In many of my public meetings people have gotten up to attack what they call the New World Order -- something President Bush first talked about. I'm not sure what the New World Order is in their minds."
Among radical armed militia groups, rumors circulate that black United Nations helicopters or white-painted all-terrain vehicles are coming to invade one part of America or another. Early this year, the military attache of the United States Mission to the United Nations had to write to the commander of the Michigan Militia to assure him that the United Nations was not about to take over a Michigan camp to train its troops -- and that, in any case, it had no troops.
 
Skepticism
Surges of Optimism About U.N. Fade
 Doubts about the United Nations are sometimes fundamental. At the Heritage Foundation in Washington, Charles M. Lichenstein, the resident expert on the organization and recently co-chairman of a Congressionally mandated, bipartisan Commission on Improving the Effectiveness of the United Nations, says there was considerable skepticism about the world organization's mission, even among Americans officials, right from its birth.
"The initial concept was terribly, terribly flawed," said Mr. Lichenstein, an academic from Yale and Notre Dame who served as alternate United States representative at the United Nations for special political affairs from 1981 to 1984.
"It is, I suppose, theoretically possible to set up an institution that is somehow or other going to be better than the people who set it up," he said, "that is going to be more responsive to an objective world view, that will identify aggressors rapidly, that will identify trouble spots rapidly and that will have mass resources to do something about it.
"It is theoretically possible, but it's very unlikely. I think that most Americans soon began to sense that."
He noted that the Korean War, which began within five years of the founding, was always perceived as an American operation despite its United Nations imprimatur. In 1991 the war against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq also had United Nations backing but American leadership. When no major country is willing to go to battle -- as in Somalia or Bosnia -- the results have been very different.
"When a great country feels its security threatened, it's going to reach out to the people who share that sense," he said.
A wave of optimism about the future of the United Nations that surged after the collapse of the Soviet empire beginning in the late 1980's is now almost universally thought to have receded.
Gallup and Roper opinion polls over more than 40 years show that the American public was most enthusiastic about the United Nations in October 1991, after the Persian Gulf war, when 67 percent of those polled said the United Nations was doing "a good job."
The highest previous figure, 58 percent, was registered in 1954, after the Korean War. This month, 42 percent of Americans polled were favorably impressed, 46 percent said the United Nations was doing a bad job and the rest had no opinion.
 
Reappraisal
Cuts by Congress Raising Fears
 So how to mark the 50th year of the United Nations, beginning here and culminating in New York on Oct. 24, the anniversary of the first General Assembly session?
"This is not a propitious time to celebrate," said Rita E. Hauser, a New York lawyer and chairwoman of the board of the International Peace Academy, a United Nations affiliate. The political climate, she said, is unfortunate.
"President Clinton has stuck his finger into the wind and is watching to see how it is playing, while the rest of the Administration -- except Madeleine Albright -- is really not out there," said Ms. Hauser, referring to the chief United States representative. Ms. Hauser has represented the United States in United Nations bodies and is president of the Hauser Foundation, which she established to work to resolve international conflict.
Although White House officials have spoken forcefully on occasion against a rebirth of isolationism, and Hillary Rodham Clinton has appeared at several major United Nations functions this year, the ranks of supporters in the State Department seem thin. It is Ms. Albright who is on the front line of the Administration's countercharge. A refugee from the Communist takeover of Czechoslovakia in 1948, she relishes the task.
Ms. Albright says all the 50-year commemorations marking the end of World War II have been instructive for people unacquainted with modern history.
"Given the climate here, I find that the anniversary will be a very useful taking-off point for creating an understanding in people as to why the U.N. is important," she said in an interview.
Morris B. Abram, an international lawyer, former United States representative at the United Nations in Geneva and later founder of a monitoring organization, U.N. Watch, articulated a more cautious theme for the anniversary.
"If we simply celebrate with drums and bugles and fifes, we're doing the U.N. a disservice, because the U.N. has many faults," he said. "This should be a time of re-examination and reappraisal, with a view not to destroy it but to improve it. Without honest criticism, particularly from outside sources, it will not be improved."
The House of Representatives did not wait long this year to demonstrate how it planned to celebrate the 50th anniversary. In early March it passed a bill significantly amending and tightening the terms under which the United States will continue to support the United Nations.
Among other changes, the House bill demands that the President run down a checklist of United Nations behavior before Congress pays the United States assessments in full. The bill also cuts contributions to peacekeeping and requires that the sharing of intelligence be monitored and controlled.
Further cuts and restrictions were included in a recently passed foreign aid bill. In the Senate, where a companion bill is being written, Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, proposed ending or sharply curtailing American support for nearly three dozen United Nations agencies or programs.
In a letter on April 26 to Senator Pete V. Domenici, chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Helms said, "United States participation in most United Nations programs should be terminated."
Mr. Helms says this would cut hundreds of millions of dollars from about $2 billion that the United States pays annually toward the regular United Nations budget, specialized agencies, peacekeeping and programs supported by voluntary contributions.
Earlier this month in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, campaigns by two Democratic Senators, John F. Kerry of Massachusetts and Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, succeeded in restoring some of the proposed cuts. But the Senate version is still $200 million short of the Administration's $425 million request in voluntary contributions alone, for programs in areas like the environment and economic development for women.
Daniel L. Spiegel, the United States representative at the United Nations and other international organizations in Geneva, said a drop in Congressional support could threaten agencies like the World Health Organization, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Organization for Migration.
Mr. Spiegel said he believed that the magnitude of the cuts suggested not only a desire to save money but also a determination to withdraw from cooperation on many fronts, including health and environmental programs.
"Reckless cutting will hurt all international health efforts at a time when we are in the middle of dealing with the reappearance of the Ebola virus in Zaire, cholera in Latin America, the plague in India and diphtheria in Russia," he said. "The whole international civil infrastructure will be seriously eroded."

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
Extreme Rhetoric Bedevils Congress

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
The 104th Congress, which once marveled at its own legislative efficiency, is bedeviled by partisan sniping, wild exaggeration and a bizarre degree of self-confidence.
Its leaders even asserted that there was nothing strange about the Senate's failing to vote squarely on a nomination for an office with only symbolic power. Instead, they said, it made perfectly good sense to vote twice not to take a vote on confirming a Surgeon General -- and for 57 senators to be insufficient to make the vote happen. 
 That, believe it or not, made sense in the Senate.
That argument recalls the last time that Congressional leaders insisted that they understood reality better than anyone else -- and said the House bank scandal had amounted to no more than a few bookkeeping problems. That time it was House Democrats who were out of touch.
Today the leaders are Republicans, and they defend themselves by saying that they are only doing to Democrats what Democrats did to them. Sometimes they have a case. Senator Bob Dole pointed out on Thursday that Senator Edward M. Kennedy had led the 1986 filibuster against the nomination of William H. Rehnquist to be Chief Justice, as had other senators who were complaining that it was not fair to deny Dr. Henry W. Foster Jr., the Surgeon General nominee, a straight vote on his confirmation.
And the Democrats can hardly be expected to say that their inability to make their filibusters stick means that it was O.K. when they did it.
Nor is the problem merely in the Senate.
With an overnight break for a trip to a Republican fund-raiser in New York City, House members had to vote twice on the fate of an obscure Congressional agency, the Office of Technology Assessment. On Wednesday, a quick gavel kept two Democrats from voting and allowed the Republicans to eke out a 214-to-213 vote to kill its financing.
On thursday, faced with the prospect that Democrats would express their fury by bringing the legislative pace to a halt -- just the way Republicans did last year when they felt mistreated -- the Republicans allowed an unheard-of reprise of the vote and took a 220-to-204 defeat along with a serving of the humble pie that has seldom been seen on their plate much of this year.
But they are not overdosing on humility. A House Appropriations subcommittee unveiled plans on Thursday to abolish the President's Council of Economic Advisers, a Presidential agency set up half a century ago to give the Government scholarly advice on economics.
Democrats said they were startled at the lack of respect for a separate and equal branch of Government displayed by the gesture, and even the subcommittee chairman, Representative Jim Ross Lightfoot of Iowa, said he recognized that he could be accused of "micromanagement" and lack of proper respect for the office of the President. But he said the Administration had plenty of other economists in the Office of Management and Budget. "We were looking for anything that was duplicative," he said.
An extreme level of argument accompanied those efforts in both houses. To accompany the debate on the Surgeon General, Senator Bob Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, displayed photographs of fetuses. He was arguing that Dr. Foster had performed 700 abortions (Dr. Foster himself, after some initial confusion, put the figure at 39), and that any of them might have prevented the birth of someone better qualified to be Surgeon General than the Tennessee obstetrician.
In the House, Representative Earl F. Hilliard, Democrat of Alabama, who was denied the opportunity to vote on Wednesday when he arrived as the roll-call was finishing, proclaimed: "This is not Caesar's Rome, this is not Hitler's Germany and this is definitely not Stalin's Russia. This is where the voice of freedom should reign."
Much of the debate these days is wildly exaggerated. The argument that the defeat of Dr. Foster was a blow to abortion rights sounded as overdrawn as the contention that his confirmation would have hampered the anti-abortion forces in the nation.
But the day's record for hyperbole was set by Senator Dole. After boasting off the floor that by dooming the nomination he had out-slicked Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, his leading rival in the Senate for the 1996 Republican Presidential nomination, he told the Senate, "This is not about Presidential politics; that may be a good sound bite."
In fact, almost all debate here is for sound bites, fed by the hope that network television will use an extreme comment. Most members speak as if they think that not one of their colleagues is listening seriously -- or could be persuaded by thoughtful arguments.
One Republican who is not running for President, Senator William S. Cohen of Maine, spoke up on Thursday. A supporter of Dr. Foster's, he accused some other defenders of the nominee of following a double standard, of ignoring the excesses of liberal campaigns against conservative nominees like Judge Robert Bork, a Reagan choice for the Supreme Court whose nomination crashed in a storm of bitter attacks.
He said it was time for Congress to stop "shredding the character of the individuals who come before the body for confirmation."
"If we disagree philosophically, let us be very up front about it and base it on that," he said. "We have lowered the standard for civil debate and discourse in this country. What we have to do is lower the rhetoric and the charges and the countercharges about who is sacrificing whom on what altar."
But Mr. Cohen was speaking to an empty chamber, as senators usually do.
Not long after, Mr. Smith was on the floor. He argued that Dr. Foster could not be believed about the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiment; Dr. Foster had denied knowing that the experiment abandoned black patients to suffering without treatment. Dr. Foster testified that he had protested angrily when he discovered what had been going on.
And the Senator brought his pictures of fetuses.

HEADLINE: WITH TRADE TALKS STALLED, TOP AIDES AGREE TO STEP IN

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: GENEVA, June 24

 BODY:
Negotiators for Japan and the United States said today that the top trade officials from both countries had agreed to fly here on Monday in a last-ditch effort to resolve their differences on automotive trade before American sanctions on Japanese luxury cars go into effect on Wednesday.
The two officials, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, and Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry, will try to bridge what both sides say is an enormous gulf on how Japan should organize its economy and how its businesses should interact with foreign suppliers. 
 But neither side expressed much optimism that the surprise meeting between the two longtime sparring partners would come in time to avert the 100 percent tariffs planned on 13 Japanese car models. The sanctions, the largest trade retaliation in American history, go into effect at midnight Wednesday.
"The situation is very difficult, but it is not yet hopeless," Japan's lead negotiator, Yoshihiro Sakamoto, said in an interview late this afternoon at the Japanese mission here, which has been converted into a temporary headquarters for scores of Japanese bureaucrats, experts and industry officials.
In an hourlong talk, Mr. Sakamoto said Japan was committed to deregulating its economy and weakening the hold of the keiretsu, the families of interlinked companies who keep outsiders from obtaining some of the country's most lucrative contracts. But he suggested that the changes would happen at Tokyo's own pace -- and not under pressure or threats from the United States.
Mr. Sakamoto, who is the highest-ranking civil servant in the Trade Ministry and one of Japan's most powerful bureaucrats, also said that if the sanctions hurt small- and medium-sized Japanese businesses, the Japanese Government would try to help them out, perhaps with subsidies.
"Whatever the cause of trouble -- a major earthquake or political action by another government -- it is part of the Japanese Government's role to provide assistance to medium- and small-sized companies that are hurt." But he said he did not expect that help to extend to the five biggest Japanese car makers, even if some -- including Mazda and Nissan -- are under extraordinary financial stress.
Mr. Sakamoto's comments came after a brief negotiating session, the shortest since the two sides began talking on Thursday.
Asked whether he agreed with Mr. Sakamoto's pessimistic assessment of the talks, Jeffrey E. Garten, the Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade, said, "We are wide apart on all the big issues, but we're certainly not giving up."
Ordinarily Mr. Hashimoto and Mr. Kantor, two outspoken and combative trade officials who have come to personify a new age of economic foreign policy, would not come here to meet unless a deal was pre-cooked and ready for public consumption. But both sides went to pains today to suggest that an agreement had not been reached.
Certainly there will be enormous pressure on both Mr. Kantor and Mr. Hashimoto to reach a settlement. But the session seemed intended primarily for domestic audiences in both capitals. Mr. Kantor wants to make clear that he has gone the extra 3,000 miles to make good on President Clinton's commitment a week ago in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to make "every possible effort for a negotiated settlement" before the sanctions go into effect.
For Mr. Hashimoto, the politics of the meeting are more complex. If he reaches a deal without loss of face, he can return to Tokyo to proclaim that he has saved Japan's relationship with its most important ally. But if the talks fail, he can say he did everything possible to avert sanctions -- but that nothing could satisfy a bullying and unreasonable Clinton Administration.
Japanese political experts disagree on the question of which outcome would better improve Mr. Hashimoto's chances of becoming Japan's next prime minister, perhaps as soon as later this year.
As described by both American and Japanese officials, the negotiations have stalled on three major issues: Getting far more Japanese car dealers to handle American models, breaking up a virtual cartel in the business of replacing parts on Japanese cars and, most important, forcing Japanese car makers to buy far more American components when they build new cars -- in the United States and in Japan.
The dealership issue is primarily an argument about measurements: The United States insists that Japan commit itself to a clearly stated increase in the number of dealers handling American cars and that the two sides measure the progress annually. Japan has rejected that approach as a use of "numerical targets" and managed trade.
"They want a government commitment," Mr. Sakamoto said. "And this is not the Government's business. Governments don't sell cars; only car dealers sell cars."
The question of replacement parts is part of a broader effort to force Japan to break up what Washington calls a cartel: A system of car inspections that is dominated by repair shops that are tied to the Japanese car makers. Those shops carry virtually no foreign-made parts. Because of the rigid inspection system, Japanese drivers replace parts far more extensively than do American drivers who own the same models, and this is an enormously lucrative business in Japan.
The biggest differences, though, are on the "voluntary plans" that the Japanese car makers are expected to issue next week, spelling out their programs to purchase more American parts.
There are two areas of dispute. One focuses on verifying how the Japanese makers fulfill their goals. The more important difference, however, centers on the willingness of Japanese makers to buy those parts for use in their factories in Japan, not just those in the United States.
So far, the car makers have only hinted about greater use of American parts in their "transplant" factories in the American Midwest. But the United States has said repeatedly here that there would be no deal without major purchases for factories in Japan, where the keiretsu hold is the tightest.
Mr. Sakamoto portrayed that today as a new demand from Washington. American negotiators deny it is new; the Japanese "just weren't listening before," one official said.
"This isn't for us to decide," said Mr. Sakamoto, who claims his ministry long ago gave up controlling the Japanese auto makers. "This is up for the free and independent auto makers themselves to decide."

HEADLINE: 'Militia' Man Tells of Plot To Attack Military Base

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WATERFORD, Mich.

 BODY:
The way Eric Maloney tells the story, the plan to blow up Camp Grayling, a National Guard base in northern Michigan, was hatched in late January when 70 members of the Michigan Militia Corps, a statewide right-wing paramilitary group, met at a truck-stop restaurant northwest of Detroit.
Mr. Maloney, then a member of a local unit called the Oakland County Sixth Brigade, says the focus of conversation that night was photographs taken by a militia member of Russian tanks being transported to the camp on rail cars. Some at the meeting considered the photos proof of a conspiracy theory popular among far-right groups: that foreign troops under United Nations command are massing to take over the country. They wanted to act. 
 Three days later, Mr. Maloney says, when about 20 members of his unit gathered at a farm near Leonard, Mich., for their weekly military training, brigade leaders laid out a detailed plan to attack the camp on Feb. 12. He quotes one brigade leader as saying, "Let's go blow up those tanks and kill those bastards who put them there."
Mr. Maloney alerted Federal agents. The attack never occurred.
Some militia members flatly deny Mr. Maloney's account of a plot. Others, speaking on the condition of anonymity, verify it broadly but differ on some important details; one says it was Mr. Maloney himself who helped devise the scheme and pushed hardest for it. The Federal Bureau of Investigation continues to look into the matter, a case that adds at least to the perception that despite the disavowals of leading figures in the national militia movement, some of their members seem inclined to plot violence against the Government.
Mr. Maloney and his wife, Christine, who also attended the meeting at the farm, say Timothy J. McVeigh, now the principal suspect in the Oklahoma City bombing three months later, was sitting beside Mrs. Maloney when the assault plans were discussed and jumped up to volunteer for the mission.
Mr. McVeigh's involvement could not be corroborated, though. F.B.I. officials in Michigan and Washington declined to answer any questions about the episode.
As Mr. Maloney outlined the assault in a written summary for the F.B.I., it was to include the following:
*"Contact all the brigades in the state and storm Camp Grayling, killing anyone who attempts to defend the base and arresting anyone else who is left."
*"Photograph, for historical purposes, all foreign equipment."
*"Bring in the media" and blow up the camp "on worldwide television."
* "Hunt down anyone involved in bringing in the foreign equipment and try them for war crimes in a revolutionary court, which denies the accused a chance for appeal. The accused would be executed as soon as possible."
*"Hunt down all U.N. forces in the U.S."
Having concluded that the attack would be "suicidal for everyone involved," Mr. Maloney says, he spent the next few days trying to persuade his brigade's leaders to abandon it. When they ignored him, he says, he arranged to meet on Feb. 8 with agents of the F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The next day he told one brigade leader, Kevin Shane, that he had exposed the plan to the authorities. Soon afterward, the brigade disbanded.
"It was like a B movie," Mr. Maloney, a 33-year-old auto mechanic, said in an interview at his home in this Detroit suburb not far from the truck stop where he says the plan was first discussed. "I was unwilling to let people get killed out of stupidity."
Others who attended one or more of several such meetings described by Mr. Maloney offer varying versions of what occurred.
Mark Koernke, a militia strategist widely known for his shortwave radio program, "Mark From Michigan," acknowledged in an interview that he had attended the truck-stop meeting but denied involvement in any plan to attack Camp Grayling.
Mr. Shane, a nurse from another Detroit suburb, Lake Orion, accused Mr. Maloney of promoting the assault and said brigade leaders had spent several days trying to dissuade him. Mr. Shane has sued Mr. Maloney for slander.
A member of the brigade who spoke on the condition that he not be identified said that Mr. Maloney and a brigade leader named Richard Binkley, whom other members describe as an unemployed real estate appraiser, were the chief architects of the plan and that Mr. Maloney went to the authorities only after he and Mr. Binkley had a falling out.
Mr. Binkley, who has no listed telephone number, could not be reached for comment.
Matthew Krol, a spokesman for the Michigan Militia Corps, said the state organization had conducted an internal inquiry and had concluded that other than for a few offhand remarks -- he quoted one member as saying, "Yeah, we should go in there and blow it up" -- nothing had happened.
But Federal agents were certainly interested. Mr. Shane, for one, said that agents had interviewed him about Mr. Maloney's account and that the F.B.I. had sent him a routine notification that it had completed a wiretapping of his telephone.
"The F.B.I. has taken this seriously," said the member who did not want to be identified. "And as far as I know, they are still poking around."
And what about the photos of Russian tanks that touched off the entire affair?
As it turns out, Russian tanks were indeed on their way to Camp Grayling at the time. A camp spokesman, Lieut. Col. Jerold Foehl, said they were part of a program, under way for at least 12 years, in which captured foreign military equipment is shipped by rail from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida for analysis by military contractors and the training of American soldiers.
Colonel Foehl said such equipment always traveled on open, uncovered flatcars, to avoid precisely the kind of suspicions voiced by paramilitary groups.
The name of the program, he noted, is Chicken Little.

HEADLINE: U.S. Asserts Iranians Plotted To Disrupt Rally in Germany

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
Iranian diplomats working out of their embassy in Bonn plotted to disrupt a huge opposition rally in Germany last week, perhaps with the intention of assassinating a leading Iranian dissident, American intelligence officials said today.
At about the same time, Germany asked two Iranian intelligence officials to leave the country because of evidence that they were planning potentially lethal operations from German territory, the American officials said. The expulsions did not appear to be specifically linked to the plot. 
 German Foreign Ministry officials denied any knowledge of the plot or the expulsions, although they abruptly banned the opposition leader, Maryam Rajavi, from entering the country to address the rally.
But United States officials said they confirmed the incidents both with German officials and through independent American intelligence-gathering efforts in Germany.
The American disclosure of the incident in Bonn is likely to embarrass the German Government and may further divide the Clinton Administration and its allies in Europe and Asia about how to deal with Iran.
For the United States, evidence of an Iranian-inspired plot in Europe is just more proof that Iran is, as Washington claims, an "outlaw state" that spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year on terrorism and has embarked on a "crash" course to develop nuclear weapons. The evidence is certain to be seized on by the Administration to bolster its uncompromising though much-criticized campaign to undermine the Teheran Government through economic means.
Both American and German intelligence concluded last year that Iran is using its embassy in Bonn as an informal headquarters of the Iranian intelligence services in Europe, and as a base from which to watch its 100,000 citizens in Germany and to buy militarily useful technology and equipment.
The German determination to remain silent about the plot and expulsion underscores the vast difference in approach between the United States and Iran's major trading partners, which have refused to join the American economic embargo. They argue that the best means of changing Iran's behavior is to embrace it, rather than isolate it.
President Clinton acknowledged that difference in a news conference earlier this month when he said, "I don't know that we're on the same wave length" with the allies, adding, "the evidence is that constructive engagement with the Iranians has, at least so far, failed to produce any positive results."
Most of the allies would agree with the American case -- despite official denials in Teheran -- that Iran is positioning itself to become a nuclear power, building its arsenal of chemical weapons and ballistic missiles, undermining Middle East peace efforts, and supporting terrorist groups and acts worldwide.
But the Europeans and the Japanese contend that the United States, with its relentless name-calling and sweeping charges often without concrete proof, has tended to distort the Iranian threat for domestic political reasons, including a desire to neutralize an anti-Iranian Congress. There is also a strong perception abroad that the anti-Iranian stance of the United States reflects the increased influence of Israel in shaping American perceptions of Iran, at a time when Iran is strongly supporting terrorist groups determined to undermine Middle East peace talks.
Iran has done little to help the Europeans and Japanese justify their conciliatory approach, as shown most recently by Teheran's rejection on Thursday of an appeal from the 15 European Union nations to lift the death threat imposed against the novelist Salman Rushdie.
Early last week, when the German Government abruptly banned Mrs. Rajavi, the Iranian opposition leader, from entering Germany, officials explained that as the head of a movement determined to violently overthrow the Government of another country, she was not welcome.
But American intelligence officials concluded that there was another reason as well: the discovery by German intelligence that Iran's embassy in Bonn was assembling a team from the terrorist group the Party of God to violently disrupt the rally, and perhaps assassinate Mrs. Rajavi.
Since Germany has led the Europeans in defending what it calls a "critical dialogue" with Teheran that is based on high-level exchanges and efforts to boost trade, it is not surprising that German authorities have kept quiet about the alleged plot, but have clung to the official line.
"We cannot allow cause for the violent overthrow of a government from our own territory," said Sabine Sparwasser, a Foreign Ministry spokesman in Bonn. Asked whether Germany has asked for the expulsion of two Iranian diplomats, she added, "To my knowledge there have been no recent cases where we told Iranians from the embassy to leave."
Officials in the office of Bernd Schmidbauer, the intelligence coordinator for Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the senior German official involved in contacts with Iran, declined comment on any matter involving Iran. It was Mr. Schmidbauer who infuriated the Clinton Adminstration after he allowed Ali Fallahian, the head of Iran's intelligence services, to visit Germany in 1993, and tour intelligence headquarters in Wiesbaden.
Of all the arguments the Administration has made against Iran, its case that Iran supports terrorism has been the most difficult to make. That is because American officials say they are reluctant to disclose information that could reveal intelligence sources and methods in gathering the information and thus compromise the operations involved.

HEADLINE: As Rugged Vehicles Take to the Streets, Gas Prices Take Off

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Thanks in part to America's growing love affair with vans and big sport utility vehicles, demand for gasoline is rising across the nation, pushing prices to their highest levels since the Persian Gulf crisis in 1990.
In the last 10 years, the number of mini-vans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles sold in the United States has more than doubled, now accounting for more than 40 percent of all vehicles sold. And in general their gas mileage is much lower than that of the cars they are replacing. 
"The trend toward more powerful engines, the shift to trucks and greater luxury, has offset the technical gains that we've made in fuel economy," said John DeCicco, a senior associate for the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research group that has become a lonely voice of conservation these days.
Along with other factors, like rising taxes and higher refining costs to comply with tighter environmental rules, the growing demand for gasoline has produced a sharp increase in prices, particularly in the last year. Across the nation, the average price of unleaded regular gasoline stood at $1.22 a gallon on June 9, the latest date for which figures are available, up 12 percent from $1.09 a year earlier.
Call it Cherokee madness or Bronco fever. One symptom is that many drivers say they are not concerned about the higher cost of driving; indeed, they are using their rugged vehicles not only for outings like camping trips but also for running errands and commuting.
"I haven't looked at gas mileage in the last five years," said Richard Meyersburg, as he had his hulking Chevrolet Suburban filled with Exxon Plus, the middle grade of gasoline, at $1.31 a gallon at the Exxon station in Tenafly, N.J. "It gets us up to our house in Vermont on one tank load. That's my barometer."
Mr. Meyersburg also uses his Suburban, a utility vehicle with a V8 engine, to commute each workday from Tenafly to Paterson, N.J., where he owns a plastics company. And he said he paid little attention to the price of gas.
He is not alone. "If we run out of regular they just pull up to the next grade and fill up," said Denise Pristera, the manager of the Exxon station. "They just want to hit the road."
The recent increase in prices has been the biggest since 1990 -- when a 23-cent jump was registered in the month after Iraq invaded Kuwait. But the cost of gasoline is still not high in historical terms. After adjusting for inflation, economists say, the cost is roughly the same as it was in the days before the oil shocks of the early 1970's, a time when the pump price was a little more than 30 cents a gallon, and far less than in 1981, when the average was $1.35.
Gasoline deliveries to retail stations, a good measure of motorists' demand, have been running about 4 percent higher than last year. In May, they were up more than 5 percent from the corresponding month of 1994.
The surge in demand is "inherently implausible," said Michael L. Canes, the chief economist for the American Petroleum Institute, the industry trade group that compiles the delivery figures. "Yet we've gone over the numbers and we haven't found a mistake," he said.
The American economy, considered healthy but not booming, is an unlikely source of increased demand. The normal seasonal increase in driving at this time of year, plus the small loss in fuel economy from the switch last January to reformulated gasoline, is not enough to account for such a jump, he said.
The only possible explanation, according to some oil industry economists, is Americans' growing use of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans. Sport utility vehicles sell at prices in the neighborhood of $30,000.
A recent survey by Allison-Fisher Inc., an automotive research firm in Southfield, Mich., asked car buyers to rank 20 factors in their buying decisions. Dependability was first. Fuel economy was last.
"They drive recreational vehicles for errands," said Theodore R. Eck, the chief economist for the Amoco Corporation. "They don't ask what the mileage is. They don't want to know what the price of gas is. They're looking for comfort, size and performance -- not mileage."
In the early 1970's, before the Arab oil embargo, average fuel economy was about 15 miles a gallon, as measured in laboratory tests used to calculate the mileage figures on the stickers of new cars and light trucks. The embargo in 1973, and the resulting price surges and long lines at gas stations, led to legislation that encouraged Detroit to change its ways. The Big Three auto makers began turning out smaller cars to compete with the importers that were rushing into the market, and fuel efficiency climbed. It peaked in 1988, at an average of 25.9 miles a gallon. By 1993, the last year for which data are available, it had slid to 25 miles a gallon.
Some studies have shown that under real driving conditions, the average is much lower, Mr. DeCicco said. For light trucks, which have a listed average of 20.5 miles a gallon, the real figure is closer to 16.5, he said. And for some of the big sport utility vehicles, it can be as low as 10 in stop-and-go driving.
The Clinton Administration and Congress have shown little willingness to push up the fuel economy standards or to penalize people who own less efficient vehicles with new taxes, although higher Federal and state taxes have accounted for about 2 cents of the price increases of the last year. And new legislation in Congress would end federally imposed speed limits, a change that could encourage higher-speed driving and further cut fuel efficiency.
While the price of gasoline, adjusted for inflation, is about the same as it was more than two decades ago, gasoline's share of driving costs has actually declined because of improvements in fuel economy. Mr. DeCicco said the cost of gasoline was now about 6 cents for every mile traveled, compared with 9 cents in 1973, after adjustment for inflation.
And these days, many owners of less-fuel-efficient vehicles say they gladly pay more for the pleasure of sitting high above the traffic and knowing they have four-wheel drive.
"It's perfect for my life style," said Stephen Wisniewski, a student at Rutgers University, as he filled up his red-and-gold Jeep Cherokee. He likes the extra room, the acceleration and the knowledge that he will not be stuck in the snow as he commutes from Cresskill, N.J., to school in New Brunswick. Though he watches the price of gasoline, he said, he would find it difficult to go back to a small car.
Arnold and Elda Zandonella of Tenafly own two Grand Cherokees -- a 1993 model and a 1988, which they once drove to Alaska. After driving the newer version to downtown Tenafly recently for a morning cup of coffee, Mrs. Zandonella gestured at a small Chrysler Neon on the street and said, "I couldn't see myself in one of those." As she spoke, three sport utility vehicles -- a Toyota Land Cruiser, an Isuzu Trooper and a Ford Explorer -- were parked nearby.
Her husband said of their two Jeeps: "They're built a little sturdier than cars. We feel safer in it because we sit higher up." He said he would start worrying about the price of gasoline only if it reached $2 to $3 a gallon.
Jim Kelly, a salesman for D & C Chevrolet-Geo-Honda of Tenafly, said that when customers looked at a vehicle like a Tahoe, a Chevrolet sport utility vehicle, they often ignored the sticker that says it gets 12 miles a gallon in city driving and 15 on the highway.
"They don't ask about the mileage," he said. "It's irrelevant to most of them."
Many buyers, he said, bought "muscle" cars like the Chevrolet Camaro in the 1960's and 70's. "Then they got married and had kids," he said, "and now they're buying sport utility vehicles."
The effect for most of the nation's gasoline refiners, which have seen higher costs in producing reformulated gasoline, is that they will keep running near capacity all summer to meet demand and build inventories.
Mr. Eck of Amoco predicted that gasoline supplies could tighten in July and August, but that they would remain adequate. As a result, he said, prices are likely to rise only a bit further later this summer.

HEADLINE: Gov. Wilson at Last Sets Out on the Campaign Trail, and It Looks Very Long

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: DENVER, June 24

 BODY:
Sidelined and silenced for more than two months by surgery for a benign throat growth, Gov. Pete Wilson of California finally hit the Presidential campaign trail this week, finding his voice but not much political footing.
Measured by most campaigning standards -- timing, organizing, fund-raising and, not least of all, every national poll -- it appears he has a lot of catching up to do if he is to win the Republican nomination. 
 "I can do it," was his insistent, optimistic mantra, delivered in a scratchy but improving monotone as he crisscrossed the country twice in seven wearing days of rallies, speeches and photo opportunities.
Perhaps.
But the polls indicate that thus far he has won over only two of every hundred Republican voters.
Political experts and party officials attribute that skimpy support, in part, to the fact that the Governor is a moderate running in a party dominated by conservatives. But they also say the Wilson campaign is sputtering because the Governor is off to an unusually late start, lagging badly in fund-raising, raggedly preparing for appearances and taking far too much time to set up campaign organizations in crucial states.
"People don't even know who he is yet or that he's out there, if he's out there, so he'd better get it together fast," said Ruth Griffin, the Republican national committeewoman in New Hampshire, scene of the nation's crucial first primary.
"The other candidates have been on the trail for months, some even for years," added Ms. Griffin, who has not yet sided with a candidate. "He's got his work cut out, and then some."
There was ample evidence of that in every state the Governor visited on his inaugural national swing, starting with Florida last weekend, then going on to Iowa and Texas and finally ending up here in Colorado and in New Hampshire this weekend. In between was an appearance on Larry King's television talk show, now one of the stations of all Presidential candidacies.
Only in Iowa, the first caucus state, did the Governor have a campaign organization fully in place, with office space rented, posters printed and campaign chairmen and volunteers signed up.
Elsewhere, there were a few chairmen and volunteers scattered about, but no formal campaign organizations.
Here in Denver, he boasted that he had obtained campaign money "pledges" around the country totaling more than $16 million. But aides said privately that only $4 million had actually been collected, far less than has been raised thus far by contenders like Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.
And at many stops, Mr. Wilson seemed to miss opportunities to work crowds, either because of scheduling foul-ups or because he simply chose to ignore the opportunities, passing through hotel lobbies without reaching for a single hand and departing speech sites almost headlong, again without a single handshake or a hearty back slap.
In Florida -- a state where, unlike much of Dixie, Mr. Wilson's moderate Republicanism could have some political resonance -- his visit to Miami went all but unnoticed.
His airport arrival ceremony and remarks were overshadowed by a convention of the nation's mayors elsewhere in town. They got the headlines that day -- along with Senator Dole, who, unlike Mr. Wilson, put in an appearance at the convention.
"It looks like a ragged start, as well as a late start," said Mark Goodin, a Washington-based political consultant who is a veteran of many Republican campaigns but is not involved in any of the current ones.
"The Governor can still recover," Mr. Goodin added, "because a lot of people still haven't focused on the race, and he's a savvy old pro who hails from the state with the most delegates and the most money. But he's going to have to get down in the trenches -- and stay there -- and start reaching for those hands and slapping those backs. California politicians are used to relying on television for campaigning, because the state is so big and diverse. That won't work in relatively small states like Iowa and New Hampshire -- and you have to do well in Iowa and New Hampshire."
Mr. Wilson acknowledged as much today in Portsmouth, N.H. Rather than work the back rooms and the reception circuit, his usual campaigning mode and one at which he is a master, he hit the pavement for a change, meeting and greeting in the city's streets, reaching for hands, slapping backs, retailing himself. If he did not bring a Lyndon Johnson-like zest to pressing the flesh, he nevertheless pressed on doggedly, at last doing what has to be done.
But then the Governor, in a move not likely to get him much political mileage in New England, demanded that President Clinton discard recommendations made this week by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.
The commission on Friday called for closing the Long Beach naval shipyard in California, a major blow to the already-struggling economy in Mr. Wilson's home state, which has taken the hardest hit from the military downsizing that has followed the end of the cold war. But to the surprise and relief of New Englanders, the commission did not call for closing the shipyard at Portsmouth, whose economy has also struggled in recent years.
"Don't get me wrong," Mr. Wilson added hastily as reporters began peppering him with questions about base-closing policy. "I think that Portsmouth should remain open too and that the whole situation should be restudied."
While the polls indicate that Mr. Wilson is still a little-known political quantity nationally, with more than half of all Republicans saying they do not know enough about him to have an opinion, he is not alone in that regard. And therein lies his 1996 strategy, his aides say.
"The only candidate who has thus far broken from the pack in the polls is Bob Dole," said Craig Fuller, Mr. Wilson's campaign manager. "That means second place is up for grabs, and we intend to grab it. We think we can more than hold our own early on in Iowa and New Hampshire and in places like Florida, Arizona, Colorado, New York and so forth. If Dole hasn't broken totally clear by then -- and we don't think he will have -- people will start looking for an alternative. That's Pete Wilson. Then it's on to California -- our state, the big one."
Wilson aides say the Governor will make a major push to get on the ballot in New York, the second-richest delegate purse, despite the expensive, labor-intensive petition effort required and despite the fact that Mr. Dole has already won the support of most of the leading Republican figures in the state.
Although the Wilson campaign was troubled this week with organizational and other campaign details, the message delivered by the candidate was cohesive and consistent, maybe not every Republican's ideological meat but nevertheless well thought out and well delivered, albeit in a voice still a bit scratchy.
The pitch: balance the budget, cut back welfare, enforce the death penalty, eliminate affirmative action, stop illegal immigration, defend a woman's right to abortion.
Will the message sell?
"Now that I've finally heard him, I'm willing to listen some more," Eldon Pridre, a retired oil jobber, said after the Governor addressed a meeting of Rotarians in Waterloo, Iowa. "It's early yet in the race, and he's got some catching up to do. I'm not sure he's mine. But I'm listening."

HEADLINE: Technological Curve Ball for Cuomo

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 24

 BODY:
Mario M. Cuomo, an Old World politician who has always preferred the ballpoint pen to the word processor, was haunted by technological demons today during the three-hour premiere of his live call-in radio show.
Three times during a half-hour interview, the show managed to cut off the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, a man whom Mr. Cuomo described as "possibly the next President of the United States of America." Mr. Dole finally got back on the air in time to announce, "I'm going to have to go." 
 At least outwardly, Mr. Cuomo remained calm throughout the dead air and screeching feedback that punctuated the second hour of his show. When "Emanuel" called to congratulate Mr. Cuomo on his new show, the former Governor responded drily, "Thank you very much. I hope someone out there can hear it."
A caller named Simon phoned to comment: "Sounds like you've got Dan Quayle running your phones over there."
The syndicated weekly program, a hodgepodge of Cuomo commentaries, celebrity interviews and debates with callers and faxers, is designed to present Mr. Cuomo as a liberal counterweight to conservative radio talk-show hosts like Rush Limbaugh and G. Gordon Liddy. It is broadcast from 9 A.M. to noon on about 20 stations, including WABC-AM in New York City.
The former Governor, who served three terms before losing last year to George E. Pataki, held forth on a wide variety of issues, from taxes and welfare to baseball and foreign aid. At one point, he took time out to pay homage to his mother, Immaculata Cuomo, and his mother-in-law, Mary Raffa, both of whom died in recent weeks.
Mr. Cuomo's strength on the radio, as in the Governor's office, was the power of his logic. His tone was measured and nonconfrontational, and his callers were mostly polite.
But Mr. Cuomo also quickly discovered the hazards of live radio. Taking his first call, he was ambushed by a fan of the radio host Howard Stern. Mr. Cuomo's second caller attacked him by using an Italian word for "lowlife."
And on occasion, Mr. Cuomo confronted the kind of hostility that had become familiar during the call-in shows he did while in office. One caller, Jim from Washington, an affirmative-action opponent, called to say that he was unemployed because he was a white male.
"You know what you need, what white males need, what black males need, what white females need, what black females need?" Mr. Cuomo asked Jim. "Jobs."
Jim responded: "The jobs are out there. They're not being given to qualified people. You were a big supporter of these big liberal left-wing policies that ruined New York State."
More than anything, however, Mr. Cuomo's debut was marred by the technical failures that undermined the coup of attracting Mr. Dole as an opening guest.
As a caller named Roy tried to ask Mr. Dole a question about why the Republican Party had "become so extreme," the call was interrupted by feedback.
Mr. Dole: "My view is that. . . ."
(Silence)
Mr. Cuomo: "You lost him. Hello. Don't tell me that Roy was able to dislodge Senator Dole, was he?"
A bit later, Mr. Cuomo tried to put Mr. Dole on the line with James from Cedar Rapids.
James: "Yes, I have a question for the Senator."
Mr. Cuomo: "Good."
James: "And congratulations on your show, Governor."
Mr. Cuomo: "Thank you, thank you very much. What's your question?"
(Silence)
Mr. Cuomo: "O.K., hello. Well, this is new equipment. I hope it came with a warranty. Either that, or people are going to be suing me for breach of promise."

HEADLINE: At a Base in New Jersey, The Time for Denial Is Over

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

DATELINE: BAYONNE, N.J., June 24

 BODY:
For Lori Starke, who has been an office worker at the sprawling Military Ocean Terminal here for two decades, the specter of the base's closure has been in the air for so long that "it was almost something you didn't think about if you didn't think too hard."
But when she learned yesterday that a Federal commission had recommended shutting down the base -- meaning that the Army might pull out as soon as the end of the summer if President Clinton and Congress accept the plan -- she felt as if she had been told a friend died. 
 "I thought, 'Well, this is finally it -- no more denying,' " said Ms. Starke, her eyes red-rimmed, as she drove through the base's gates to finish some work. "I just looked at my girlfriend and my eyes filled up with tears. I couldn't believe it."
For the base's 2,183 civilian employees like Ms. Starke and the 172 military personnel stationed there, the news that the commission had voted for its closure was accepted with resignation yesterday and only a glimmer of the hope that residents had held for months that some political miracle might save the base.
A statement issued by the commander of the base, which has shipped tanks, trucks and crates of ammunition to battlefields around the world, was already attempting to prepare workers for what seemed to be the inevitable. "It's not an easy decision to close an installation," the statement from Brig. Gen. Boyd E. King said. "It is a painful process for the people working and living on the base and their families as well as the local community."
June Pagan, a spokeswoman for the base, said that about 300 base employees whose sole function is to keep the Army garrison on the base running -- like food workers, patrol officers and maintenance workers -- would be hit the hardest if the base closes, because there are no plans to transfer them to other bases.
Others, like Ms. Starke, whose office keeps track of shipments of everything from Christmas trees and cars to M-1 tanks from the terminal, may be transferred to Fort Monmouth in Monmouth County or to other bases around the country.
"I can't say for sure that I'd want to go to someplace like North Carolina, but I would if I had to," Ms. Starke said. "At least I'm probably guaranteed a job. What about those other people who have kids in school and house payments?"
Several base employees and residents said they had seen the writing on the wall for several years as shipments of items like military cars to ports in Germany dropped from more than 700 several years ago to just a little more than 100 recently. And they said that the downsizing of the military and the base seemed to reflect the shrinking economy in Bayonne itself, where the base is the largest employer.
But not everyone in Bayonne will mourn the base's passing. The Mayor of the city, Leonard P. Kiczek (pronounced KIH-check), has maintained that the waterfront land on which the terminal sits, with its sweeping views of the Manhattan skyline, could provide more of a boost to the city if the land was turned over to private developers. While the Mayor's position made his name anathema to base employees, the idea has its supporters.
"I would like to see something nice down there eventually, maybe a terminal for cruises or a golf course," said Ray Fiuza, a research technician for General Foods who was getting a shave in the Roma Barber Shop on Broadway several blocks from the base. "Bayonne needs it."
But Mr. Fiuza and others, like Carmine Salerno, who owns the 33rd Street Market down the street from the barber shop, are also wary that the land may attract the kind of development that Bayonne residents will not be able to afford. "Everybody's afraid that somebody's going to come in and put up expensive town houses and advertise the view and only rich people are going to be able to pay to live there," Mr. Fiuza said. "And then what happens? Bayonne loses twice."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Giuliani Interview

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an interview with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in his City Hall office on Friday, as recorded by The New York Times.
Q. Do you believe that you encounter opposition at every turn when you try to change things like the budget and the schools? 
 A. Different degrees. Yes. The answer is yes, but the opposition on the budget and the economy is much less than on the school system. And there is much more understanding of the changes that have to be made.
I think we've changed the agenda on the budget and economy of the city. The questions now asked are the questions that we wanted to be asked. How much do we have to reduce, not how much more do we spend. Where can we find the savings? How can we put more money back into the private sector? How can we stimulate business?
We can disagree about the scope of that, but I believe that we've changed the agenda in the last two budgets on how budgets are dealt with in New York City. . . .
Q. You mentioned last week that you have to take on the establishment. Could you give a little more detail on who that is? Bureaucrats? Democratic interests?
A. No, no. Budget politics is much more partisan political: Democrats, Republicans, liberal, conservative. Because a lot of people define themselves that way based on how they think money should be spent and the need they see for a balanced budget or the need they see for more spending, social issues. Educational politics, I think, is a much more bureaucratic politics. Are you connected to the system? Sometimes I think when you get into that system it has like an illogic of its own. . . .
The Chancellor -- this was my first bit of advice to him -- made a crucial mistake in surrounding himself and steeping himself in that bureaucracy. Near the end he brought in some people like Barry Sullivan, a few others.
But you need a group, in a bureaucracy that large, of 10, 20, maybe 30 people who are your people, so that your pronouncement of direction doesn't immediately get undercut. The minute you do that, you become controversial. The bureaucracy rises up against you. They leak things on you. They try to do, they try to stop you. Because they've been there for a long time, they like the direction of the agency, they don't want it turned in a new direction.
And before you take a job like that, you have to know that you can withstand that kind of pressure. That your satisfaction is going to come in maybe looking back on it three, four, five years later and knowing, gee, I turned this place around. I was the the one -- if you're the Chancellor -- I was the one who finally got school-based budgeting. And whether they understand the significance of this now or they understand it four or five years from now, this will be a great contribution. I think that's how someone who is a reformer thinks, feels.
Q. But to get that reform, why is it necessary to challenge the power structures, like the Council, the Assembly, and now the board, rather than actually working with them? So many times we see you being critical of those groups rather than trying to work closely with them.
A. That isn't right, though. Almost everything that I've achieved, I've achieved by getting other people to agree that this is what had to be done. Very often people who started off disagreeing with me. I didn't pass two budgets on my own. That required a lot of work, a lot of compromise. It required taking the heat for proposing a lot of cuts, many of which didn't take place, but I was willing to take that heat.
Maybe when I proposed them I knew they wouldn't take place. But I knew I had to create that movement, that cover, in order to get it done. But I think, you know, after 17, 18, 19 months, people should look at the results and maybe to a large extent it works.
We brought about more change in the last 18 months than this city has had in a very long time. We've made virtually, quantitatively, the same changes that it took an outside monitor to accomplish in the mid-1970's and there's no way you could do that without controversy. It just can't happen. You can't take two, three, four billion dollars out of a budget without major controversy.
Now that we've accomplished that, and we've done it now four times, there should at least be some recognition that we can compromise, we can work with people. . . .
Q. Isn't there any room for political consensus with your opponents, as opposed to the unusually confrontational incidents that frequently occur with people who stand in your way?
A. I think there sometimes are confrontations. Most of them get resolved. And then nobody pays attention to the resolution of them. . . . If you are proposing things, and there are a significant group of political figures in the city who have consistently throughout their career opposed doing these things, they're going to oppose you when you do it.
Some of it then you can achieve by maybe proposing more of it than you really need and then stepping back. So you create a victory for them. But you're not going to get there and you never have politically -- politics is not all about harmony, it isn't all about -- specifically when you're going through an era of change and difficulty.
But I think if you look at the resolutions of most of these things they've ended up being harmonious. They've ended up being an agreement that we were able to reach eventually on what we needed. But I know that if I've got to take a billion dollars out of the budget, I can't start with taking a billion dollars out of the budget, I've got to start somewhere beyond that.
And I've got to challenge things. That's going to get a certain group of people angry at me politically. It doesn't mean we don't have a realization that we have to also then retreat to a position in which we can get it done. And I think if you are changing things, if you want to call it being a reformer, you take the heat for that.
Q. But aren't there ways in which you use controversy and criticism to get headlines and attention to the issues you're pushing? For instance, you must have been aware of the effect on the Chancellor of some of the very personal criticisms you made.
A. I'm a Republican Mayor in a city that is heavily Democratic and with at least one house of the Legislature that's heavily Democratic. Very often I have been bipartisan in my approach in order to bring over Democrats who support me. I supported the crime bill, supported Mario Cuomo, supported the assault weapon ban. I do that to try to get Democrats to then reach over to create the degree of support that you need to do the important things that have to be done.
Important things meaning the budget, the significant legislation that we passed. We passed more legislation in the City Council in my first year by an enormous factor as compared to David Dinkins in his first year, and that was a Democratic Mayor with a Democratic City Council.
So I think, I think that people aren't looking below the surface. The fact is that at times in order for me to build up public support, I've got to make the dispute public. I've got to try to get public opinion to work on the people that oppose a particular kind of change to see that maybe some of where they are has now changed. . . .
With the Chancellor, I don't -- I tried, I mean, I tried very hard to work with him. We would reach agreements on direction and then we would go back to the board and it would change. And the only way in which I could get my agenda out front was to go public with it. Otherwise I was going to sit here being blamed for their failures and there was nothing I could do about it.
Q. But often what people remember are not policy disputes but personal moments, such as your telling a 63-year-old man to grow up. That's the kind of thing that sticks in people's mind and I presume it sticks in his mind. Do you ever think back on the situation and wish that it had stayed at the policy level?
A. Sure. I wish I could have accomplished this internally. I wish I could have accomplished it in a way in which the Chancellor and I had a similar game plan which we would have when we met together and then he would stick to that because what he would have found if he did that was a Mayor who would support him. And would be there for him, and would fight for him. But what would happen is, we'd agree on what we were going to do and then he'd go back and give it back to the bureaucracy. And I only had certain options then. With the agencies I control I have different options. With the agencies I don't control, the only options that I have are to try to get public opinion turned around. And to try to persuade the person to move it in the right direction.

HEADLINE: A Shrinking Military Casts Long Shadows

 BODY:
Post-cold war reductions in the defense industry are hitting home in Bayonne, N.J., and Groton, Conn., where military jobs are a vital part of the local economies. Residents of Bayonne are coming to terms with the looming demise of the Military Ocean Terminal and its 2,183 civilian jobs. And even as employees of General Dynamics celebrated the launch of a new nuclear submarine in Groton, they expressed worry about the prospect of lost jobs at the shipyard, where 14,500 people work.

HEADLINE: Cortines Says He Quit Because Giuliani Forced a Choice Between Two Leaders

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

 BODY:
Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines ultimately decided to resign because Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was asking New Yorkers to make a choice between two leaders trying to repair the schools.
The city was asked "to choose between one R or another R," Rudy or Ray, Mr. Cortines said in a wide-ranging hourlong interview on Friday. 
 But, he said, "I don't bear him any hard feelings."
Beyond that, Mr. Cortines was reluctant to talk about their relationship, and the bruising and increasingly personal criticism that the Mayor had leveled at him in recent weeks, calling him weak, ineffective and "precious."
"He's my Mayor," Mr. Cortines said as he sat very still in his office. "I worked for him."
Later, he added, "I recognize the most difficult job in this city is being mayor, especially in these economic times."
Mr. Cortines described himself in the interview as a "sensitive person," but also said that he was thick-skinned enough for New York's raucous politics. "I've been accused of not being political," he said. "I'm extremely political. I just don't politicize every aspect of education."
When students asked him why he was leaving, "I said I've done as much as I can do," Mr. Cortines said.
The Chancellor was eager to talk about the successes in the schools and what remained to be done. Animated and passionate, he paced back and forth as he spoke, his voice rising as he described the system's potential.
He will continue speaking out on national education issues after leaving office in October, he said, but would not say where or how. He hinted that he might remain in New York, though he has three homes in California. He said he had received several job offers, but was not interested in any of them.
His mission in New York, he said, was simple: to emphasize teaching and learning in a system hampered by social and economic ills.
When he first came to New York, he said, he saw a bureaucracy that "had lost its focus." Administrators, and even some principals and teachers, had forgotten "that they are here to serve the schools."
Administrators in the central bureaucracy were hoarding information, he said, and principals were reluctant to report problems at their schools.
"Information in this system heretofore has always been a way to get someone," Mr. Cortines said. "And it's been a way to get rid of people."
One of his biggest accomplishments, he said, is that he helped make education the talk of the town. "What I've created in this system that people dislike is I have put education on the front burner in everybody's mind," Mr. Cortines said. "Everybody. You can't escape it. You can't go anyplace in this city and now people don't have an opinion."
He said that to repair the school system -- allowing parents and teachers to "take ownership" of schools -- the chancellor's office needed to highlight not only successes but also failures. He cited the arrests on Friday of a teacher accused of exposing himself, another accused of extorting $300 for a passing grade and a school safety officer charged with rape.
Mr. Cortines said he had demanded more honest reporting of school data, from test scores to dropout rates. He also created an atmosphere, he said, in which people inside the system, and parents, felt they had the right to criticize.
He said he has visited almost 300 of the city's 1,100 schools in less than two years, usually unannounced. Before each visit, he said, he consulted a report of vital statistics on each school that his staff puts together monthly.
The unannounced visits initially put fear in the principals, he said.
"The word would get around, 'Hey, the old man knows what your school looks like,' " he said.
Mr. Cortines said he would maintain the same pace during the next four months. He will continue working to cut the budget, a process that he said has hurt children. He will oversee the loss and replacement of 3,000 to 4,000 teachers and administrators who could take advantage of an early retirement plan.
He said he would continue to try to work with the Mayor. As an example, he pointed to his willingness to share the stage Friday during an awards ceremony for the Division of School Safety, which Mr. Giuliani wants the Police Department to take over.
Mr. Cortines received a standing ovation when he arrived at the auditorium at Murry Bergtraum High School in lower Manhattan. Mr. Giuliani was late, so the organizers told Mr. Cortines to deliver his speech. He got another ovation when he finished and left the auditorium, but he never saw Mr. Giuliani.
"I would have waited if he had been on time," Mr. Cortines said.
He learned during the interview that Mr. Giuliani had arrived during the Chancellor's remarks, but had stayed backstage until Mr. Cortines left.
"I didn't know that," Mr. Cortines said after a brief stunned silence. With the tiniest of shrugs, he said: "He's my Mayor."

HEADLINE: 1995 STANLEY CUP FINALS;
It's All Quiet On One Devils Front

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE 

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., June 24

 BODY:
With the Devils clinching the Stanley Cup tonight, some of their players and management figures will enjoy more media exposure as celebrities.
But it's hard to envision Lou Lamoriello, their president and general manager, making the rounds of television shows to bask in the limelight. Imagine Lamoriello sitting in a chair at "The Late Show," answering David Letterman's wise-guy questions. 
 Lamoriello might charm the studio audience and the national viewership with a cold stare and responses of: "Dave, I don't think that's any of your business" or "Look, I don't want to discuss that in public" or "I really don't think that's very funny" or "What's that supposed to mean?"
Certainly, Lamoriello deserves plenty of credit for the Devils winning their first cup tonight in Game 4, beating the the Detroit Red Wings by 5-2 at Byrne Meadowlands Arena.
Having reached the National Hockey League's final four three times in his eight years with the Devils, Lamoriello has shown the ability to recognize various streams of talent across the expanded hockey world and to mold it into one winning unit. An American from a college background, an unusual combination in his business, Lamoriello has 12 United States-born players on his 25-man roster, the most in the league. One of the first teams to aggressively recruit from Russia, Lamoriello's Devils generally dress three or four Europeans on their 20-man squad on game nights. In a league in which French-Canadian players are noticeably rare on some rosters, Lamoriello has three star players from Quebec and a head coach and an assistant coach from that province.
So why is a man so open-minded and so successful so reviled by so many? Could it be the hard-ball approach in contract negotiations that sometimes backfires and costs him extra salary payments, as it did in the case of Scott Stevens and as it will in the case of Martin Brodeur?
Could it be a management style that keeps employees timid and creates turnover in top positions? Could it be a marketing strategy that has yielded relatively low attendance until this year and a business plan that may include an imminent departure for Nashville? Could it be his dealings with local news media figures, some of whom trade support for gift-wrapped scoops but rarely get them from Lamoriello?
Consider the broadcasted opinions of Mike Francesa, a radio commentator who co-hosts "Mike and the Mad Dog" weekday afternoons on station WFAN in New York. One of the metropolitan area's important opinion-makers in sports circles, Francesa discussed Lamoriello Friday afternoon on the air when the Devils were on the verge of a Cup championship.
He called Lamoriello "an absolute clown" who is "never truthful," and he called his front-office operation "inept."
"It's a terribly run, paranoid and small-minded organization," Francesa said. "It's the worst organization I have ever dealt with."
This sort of opinion rankles Lamoriello's friends. One of them, the Rev. Thomas R. Peterson, is the chancellor of Seton Hall.
"I would say Lou is just the opposite," Peterson said, referring to Francesa's remarks. "Lou cares about people. Lou is not someone who will show great emotion. He doesn't wear his feelings on his sleeve. But he is a sensitive man, a man of great commitment, great honesty and great integrity."
Peterson first met Lamoriello when Lamoriello was a student at Providence College, and he later elevated Lamoriello from hockey coach to athletic director there. Lamoriello said Peterson is one of several Dominican priests who have been a major influence on his adult life.
"The philosophy of the Dominicans is discipline," Lamoriello said.
Peterson recalled Lamoriello as a diligent pupil in his sophomore ethics class where he tried to teach "a sense of values and of moral commitment." Lamoriello, Peterson said, is from "a fine Italian family" that stressed "family values."
But Lamoriello isn't one for discussing his family or his values or much of anything else. Although the media guide lists him as married and the father of three children, he lived alone in a hotel room near Byrne Arena for many seasons before moving to a private residence.
He said family matters are private, although he did briefly discuss his parents and his upbringing in Providence, R.I. His father was in the fish business and both parents were hockey fans. They took him to minor league games of the Rhode Island Reds. "They carried me in," Lamoriello said. "I was there before I could reach the knob on the door."
Lou became a stick boy for the team at the age of 6, he said. He later played baseball and hockey in college and moved up through the ranks.
But even a cordial one-hour interview with an accommodating Lou Lamoriello seems less like a conversation than the interrogation of a witness in a courtroom. Trying to explain his unease, Lamoriello said, "I find it uncomfortable to sit and talk like this." After another uncomfortable pause, he added: "One of the words I dislike is 'I.' "
Balding, with white hair at the temples and thick, darker eyebrows, Lamoriello, at the age of 52, still has the sturdy build and determined stride of the ex-athlete. He dresses in dark, conservative clothing.
He sat in a desk in an office that showed few personal touches. The most striking of them was a poster of Vince Lombardi behind him, over his head. In large letters alongside Lombardi's picture were the words "What it takes to be No. 1."
"I was an admirer of his fortitude and discipline," Lamoriello said.
As the conversation came into focus, Lamoriello's philosophy emerged not in spontaneous banter but in Lombardi-like pronouncements. "What I have is a line in what I do," Lamoriello said. "I'm the only one who knows what the line is. I don't move the line."
In college, he majored in math and economics. He presents himself as one who calculates. "This is a competitive business," he said. "The edge is important. It's important you keep the edge inside and not outside. You know what the edge is, not the other people.
"You don't talk to get accolades. Then it's no longer an edge. Your strengths can hurt you. If you have a problem, handle it internally, not externally. Don't be afraid to make a mistake. Always live for today, but never lose focus on tomorrow. Tomorrow comes awfully quick."
He said he is suspicious of flattery, even in the best of times. "You never know why they say it," Lamoriello said, "or what their reasons are for saying it."
When asked what he does for relaxation, Lamoriello replied, "I used to go to the movies," and "I used to read a lot of war books," and "I used to play golf," and "I used to fish."
During the 15-week lockout of the players that delayed the season, Lamoriello was one of the tough-talking spokesmen on Gary Bettman's bargaining team. "I enjoyed being part of it during a time that was a dark time," Lamoriello said. "It was a necessary evil."
Bob Goodenow, the executive director of the players association, said Lamoriello firmly believes in much of what he says. "I found him to really stake out his position and not be very flexible," Goodenow said. "He has some different perspectives from other general managers."
Brian Burke, a former player for Lamoriello at Providence, is now the N.H.L.'s senior vice president and director of operations, second in power only to Commissioner Gary Bettman.
"He still knows I'll tell him what I think," Lamoriello said.
Another friend is Steve Ryan, the former president of N.H.L. Enterprises Inc., the league's marketing arm. A management consultant, Ryan said Lamoriello doesn't fit into "a preconceived mold everyone wants him to fit into."
"He's his own individual," Ryan said. "Coming out of the college ranks, Lou's perspective and methods and style are different. He doesn't want to be one of the boys."

Yanks Getting in Shape And Can See Sox Again

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH 

 BODY:
The Boston Red Sox, showing their Achilles' heel to the rest of the American League East in recent weeks, had to wonder if any team was willing to take advantage of their struggles.
The Yankees finally are sending quiet signals that they may be ready to respond to the opening being left by the East leaders. 
 Yesterday the Yankees used the arm of Melido Perez and 11 hits -- five of them doubles -- to topple Toronto, 10-2. The victory increased their winning streak to a modest three games, equaling a season high. It is the fourth time this season that the Yankees have won three straight, but the other sets of three came in the team's first 14 games. The last time the Yankees won that many in a row was May 10-12.
More important than the little streak is the larger trend: the team is 8-5 since June 11, a noticeable turn of fortune for a team still trying to find the .500 mark.
It is also a spurt that has given the third-place Yankees hope, because it has enabled the club to whittle three and a half games off Boston's once formidable lead. The Red Sox, losers of 6 of 10, were to play at Baltimore last night. Their lead over New York was reduced to seven games with the Yankees' latest victory.
"I think our players understand the sense of urgency each game brings, especially with the number of games we are behind," Yankees Manager Buck Showalter said. "There's just not much margin for error. Trends only happen when you make them happen on the field, not because they're perceived as such."
Dion James, who collected two of the Yankees' hits and drove in three runs, said: "We're swinging the bats a lot better, but you never want to say you've turned the corner until you've turned the corner. Let's just say we're playing better."
The Jays are not, having lost a season-high five straight and giving the Yankees a chance to win four straight for the first time since an eight-game winning streak from July 29 to Aug. 5 of last season.
"Thank God we're playing somebody on a downswing," Wade Boggs said. "I'm tired of being a punching bag."
Toronto's Juan Guzman might say the same thing. The Blue Jays right-hander was rocked early and often, by the Yankees and his own defense. He allowed four runs in the third, two of them unearned, thanks to a pair of errors, one committed by Guzman himself.
Four hits also helped New York in that inning. The first, a single, was delivered by the sizzling Bernie Williams, his 16th hit in 11 games. A Luis Polonia single and Guzman's bobble of a Wade Boggs's comebacker loaded the bases with one out. James's single scored one run, and a throwing error by left fielder Joe Carter allowed a second run to score.
Paul O'Neill then continued his run-producing binge by depositing a two-run double into right field. The runs batted in brought O'Neill's two-game total against Toronto to five. He has six r.b.i. in six games.
Guzman stepped into more trouble of his own making an inning later. He opened by loading the bases with a walk, a hit batsman and an infield single by Polonia. Boggs, facing two strikes, emptied the bases with a double into the left-field corner, the first of two doubles he would hit yesterday.
"It was just nice to contribute," said Boggs, who now has six doubles. "In that situation, you're looking to get the ball into the air, maybe get a sacrifice fly. With three fast guys on the bases, they all have a chance to score."
When Mike Stanley added a run-scoring double in the fifth, the Yankees had eight runs on eight hits, an economy of effort especially appreciated by Perez, the Yankees starter.
"It's a great feeling because I can play with the batters," said Perez, who is 5-4 after having allowed only two runs in six innings, one on a home run to Carter in the second.
The Yankees' final run scored on an eighth-inning single by Don Mattingly, the first baseman's 1,000th hit in Yankee Stadium. He then left the game for a pinch-runner, to a standing ovation.
 
 
 
INSIDE PITCH
 The Yankees and Chemical Bank honored players from the Negro leagues with a daylong tribute. A flag commemorating the 75th anniversary of the leagues was also raised. It will remain on the facade of Yankee Stadium for the remainder of the season. . . . Toronto second baseman ROBERTO ALOMAR started yesterday, having finished serving a one-game suspension handed down by the league for an incident at Texas on May 17.

Knicks Need a Coach To Stay on Sidelines

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON 

 BODY:
WE really need to stop obsessing about the coach around here. It isn't the Or Else predicament people think it is. At least it doesn't have to be. Nowhere is it written that the Knicks must have a Pat Riley or a Chuck Daly on the bench. Rudy Tomjanovich is the two-time defending coaching champion of professional basketball, remember?
A year ago, Jerry Buss was scribbling zeros all over his contract offer to Rick Pitino. Buss wanted someone sexy to coach his Los Angeles Lakers. He settled for dull Del Harris, who, after being dismissed in Milwaukee several years before, circulated a personal brochure, which was the closest he had come to being colorful, like Daly, or published, like Riley. 
 Hiring Harris hasn't turned out badly for Buss. The focus shifted back to the players at the Great Western Forum, where even the stars of screen returned for the exciting Nick Van Exel and the versatile Vlade Divac and the promising rookie Eddie Jones. That's what the Knicks now need, an infusion of young talent and a coach whose ego will allow the players to emerge.
"I didn't mind it always being Pat Riley and the Knicks," Dave Checketts, president of Madison Square Garden, said the day Riley quit. He should have. It wasn't all Riley's fault because there was no charismatic star, but for every day Riley was in New York, he was Hootie and the Knicks were his Blowfish. As well as Riley did, as close as he came to winning it all, the proportion of attention, of credit, was ridiculously out of whack.
We have been conditioned for too many years by the Garden's coach-hiring practices, to the point where we tend to read the equation for success backward, from right to left. The solid organization that makes judicious personnel decisions equals opportunity for intelligent coaches. Riley didn't invent himself. Less than a decade ago, Phil Jackson was making hotel wake-up calls to his Albany Patroons and lamenting his slim chances of landing a job in the National Basketball Association because he didn't have a rabbi in the league. Now, as Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen's threepeat shepherd, he is a certified genius in suspenders. I knew him when.
Hubie Brown. Pitino. Riley. Fred Shero. Herb Brooks. Mike Keenan. Add up all the millions tossed at high-profile coaches -- the hot men of the moment -- by the Garden the last 15 years, and you get one Stanley Cup. That soon-to-be-jilted sports complex, the Meadowlands, is about to match the Garden's output, and its championship architect is the eminently unglamorous Jacques Lemaire.
Though he hasn't won anything yet, and may not be around long enough to, I can still see Buck Showalter shivering in the Yankee clubhouse, cheeks pink and raw, on a snowy opening night five years ago in Cleveland. Showalter was a grateful eye in the sky then. Who knew he would soon be the best Yankee manager since Dick Howser and Billy Martin I?
You can't buy chemistry, and you can't just proclaim the start of a new era, a 10-year run by some anointed savior who has no idea of what he's getting himself into. That would be nothing more than a public-relations cliche. The Knicks are an aging team in transition. They need a stable, organization guy who is not interested in power and resume building, who will not turn adversarial on Checketts and Grunfeld the way Brown turned on Dave DeBusschere, Pitino on Al Bianchi, Riley on anyone who didn't carry his book to church.
They need a coach who won't lose it when the time comes -- perhaps as soon as next winter -- for the Knicks to consider moving Patrick Ewing before it is too late.
Don Nelson, the most distinguished name on the unemployment list, may have been humbled by his Golden State flameout, but that doesn't mean the Ego Entrapped has been excised. Nelson has never had an All-Star center, so he would probably want to keep Ewing, whether it was right for the organization or not. If only Nelson could bring some of the smaller gems he has coached. Tim Hardaway. Mitch Richmond. Sidney Moncrief. The Knicks need players like that much more than they need a famous coach.
All you have to know about Nelson is this: When he first encountered trouble with Chris Webber, he called his old coach, Red Auerbach, for advice. That's like shopping for the latest in computer technology by going on an archaeological dig.
Auerbach to Nelson: "Tell him you'll trade him to Fort Wayne!"
Whom should Checketts hire? He's in Utah this weekend, perhaps trying to talk his old friend Rick Majerus into taking the leap from college to the pros. Chris Ford, late of Boston, has no box-office appeal but is an N.B.A. career guy who was a head coach in declining conditions for unstable ownership in a city that thinks big. Whomever the coach eventually is, here's the point: He's not indispensable. There have been a lot more Knick coaching saviors than there have been rings.

SECURITIES FRAUD
 
Crash Landing for Brennan
"Come grow with us," the ads said, and Robert Brennan's trademark helicopter hammered home the idea that First Jersey Securities, his penny-stock firm, could transform mere mortals into high fliers. For a decade, though, the S.E.C. has tried to prove that Mr. Brennan and his brokers did all the growing, while customers' accounts did a vanishing act. Mr. Brennan held them off, with one delay coming after he named a horse after a judge and the irate judge quit the case for fear of seeming biased. And all the while he built his sports empire, and his reputation as a philanthropist. But the S.E.C. kept at him, and last week Mr. Brennan's charmed life crashed into a wall: a Federal judge ruled that Mr. Brennan and his firm had engaged in "a massive and continuing fraud" and imposed damages of at least $71.5 million.
 
PUBLIC SPEAKING
 
What's That, Mr. Greenspan?
Clarity is a rare and wondrous thing. It sparkles. It illuminates. It sends all doubt scurrying to life's dusty, cobwebbed corners. So Alan Greenspan, one of the most powerful humans alive, avoids it like the plague. "I worry incessantly that I might be too clear," he said last week. Don't you worry yourself about that, Mr. Greenspan; you didn't even come close. The Federal Reserve chairman -- who could move the financial markets with a mistimed cough -- had just given a Big Speech with an unmistakable message: The Federal Reserve might lower interest rates in early July, or it might not. The economy might slip into a mild recession, or it might not. And to make his calculated obfuscation complete, he stated unequivocally that July's rate-setting meeting would be "most engaging." Any questions?
 
THEME PARKS
 
In Orlando, Real Mice
When you think of Disney and animals, you think of a grossly overworked mouse, an adorable lion or some ridiculous number of Dalmatians. Disney wants to change that, in its usual oversized way. Last week it announced plans for a Wild Animal Kingdom, at 500 acres its largest park yet, right in the thick of Disney World. It'll be a habitat for more than 1,000 animals, some of them endangered, and untold thousands of humans, all hot and grumpy. Disney overflowed with talk about preserving species and educating the public about wildlife. But if that sounds too educational, don't worry: one section will be devoted to mythical beasts, like unicorns, and another to extinct ones. (Are Disney's magicians off somewhere busily turning ancient amber into velociraptors?) As one observer put it, "They can say all they want, but this park is to make money."
 
THE DONALD
 
Did He Lose a Gold Sled?
Donald Trump has this thing about gold. It's as if he fancies himself some latter-day Midas, gleefully bestowing his touch on a sadly gray landscape. Look at the Grand Hyatt. Look at Trump Tower. And soon, like it or not, you'll be looking at something called the Trump International Hotel and Tower if you get anywhere near Columbus Circle. In its drab, pre-Trump incarnation, this was the Gulf and Western Building, but last week work began on its Trump rebirth -- same size and shape (no public scrutiny needed), but gold-tinted glass from head to toe. Never fear, though -- this is no quickie gilding: one designer is none other than Philip Johnson. Goldfinger would be impressed.
 
TOBACCO
 
A Recall Hazardous to Logic
Philip Morris recalled seven billion cigarettes last month, but now no one seems quite sure why. At first it said there was some irritant in the filters that could cause "temporary discomfort." But last week it said the filter problem was small and involved only a bad taste and odor. The irritant may have been in the packaging. But Westvaco, which supplied the packaging, denied that "minute trace amounts" of the irritant could be linked to the problem -- and, indeed, the existing packaging is not being destroyed. So let's see: it's not the filters, it's not the packaging, and the cigarettes inside, of course, continue to be harmless. What's the problem?
 
THE ENVIRONMENT
 
No Oil Rig Is an Island
The next time you agonize over insulting the environment by discarding plastic bottles, say, or junk mail, just be thankful you don't face this rather more sizable disposal problem. Royal Dutch/Shell has this old oil rig in the North Atlantic that it wants to get rid of, and it planned to sink it. But Greenpeace charged in, calling the rig -- with its 100 tons of sand, oil sludge, and radioactive materials -- an environmental time bomb. The company backed down, but then last week said it had no idea what to do with it. It could cost $70 million to dismantle it on land, vs. $16 million to sink it -- and to top it off, it wasn't clear that land disposal would in fact be safer. An Austrian financier offered to turn it into a floating casino, but that doesn't seem likely. So for now this 450-foot-long orphan wanders at sea.
 
CAR WARS
 
Wrong Side? Detroit Did It
The clock is ticking toward Wednesday, when those crippling tariffs on Japanese luxury cars could kick in, and negotiators in Geneva are doing the usual dance -- with no one likely to give in til the last minute. But here's an interesting side issue: Japan has all those Lexuses and Infinitis made with America in mind; they'd be tough to sell in Japan, because the steering wheel's on the wrong side. Japan has long scolded Detroit for trying to sell wrong-side cars in Japan, so it'll be awfully strange to say now that wrong-side Lexuses are just fine. Even a Toyota spokesman said, "It's a very funny idea." Of course, they could always call them Fords, sell them at a discount, and then blame Detroit.
 
THE BUDGET
 
A Bumpy Road Ahead?
In a family's budget, "discretionary" spending is the extra stuff, the frills -- vacations, dinners out, marble Pocahontas lawn ornaments. To Congress, though, the label is applied to things many would consider more basic: roads, schools, the environment. But these become "discretionary" because they lack law-given formulas, and are thus ripe for the Republican knife. So when House and Senate leaders agreed last week on $245 billion in tax cuts over seven years -- the final piece of the mad budget-balancing dash -- the plan included $190 billion in cuts from projected discretionary spending. A "historic step," said Newt Gingrich. "Tax cuts to those who don't need them," said Leon Panetta.
 
DETENTION
 
Capitalism as Jailer
A lot of people say the Government botches things the private sector could handle easily. But when a privately run immigration jail erupted in violence last week in New Jersey, it raised the opposite question: should human detention be at capitalism's mercy? The head of Esmor, the prison company, put the blame for the revolt on the immigration service, saying it took too long with its paperwork, and said Esmor had fulfilled all its obligations. But a former warden at the center said that he could find no doctor who'd work for the wages offered and that he'd been told that $1.12 a day was too much to pay for an inmate's meals. "They don't want to run a jail," he said. "They want to run a motel as cheaply as possible."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Does a Reporter Have the Right Stuff?

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
ON Tuesday, I face my moment of truth.
After more than 30 years as a business journalist, including more than 15 years of writing and broadcasting about personal finance, I will be put to the test. On that day, I will take the examination for certified financial planners. 
 I am petrified. This scary opportunity is available to reporters and editors thanks to the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, the Denver-based, nonprofit group that confers the C.F.P. designation.
Our test is not quite the real thing, of course. It is four hours instead of the usual 10, and we escape the normal prerequisites, such as 18 to 24 months of university courses and three years of related work experience. And if I fail, it's not fatal. I can still hang out a financial planner's shingle because there are no Federal or state licensing requirements for the nation's 50,000 to 100,000 planners.
But, still, I'm very nervous. The last examination I took was almost 40 years ago as a Navy officer. And although more than 30,000 people have earned the C.F.P. since it was initiated in 1972, the pass rate is just 55 percent.
Out of the generosity of his heart, my boss gave me three days to study at home. Day and night, I pored over the review course for the C.F.P., which, like the Ch.F.C. (chartered financial consultant) or the P.F.S. (personal financial specialist), is one of several competing and reasonably well-respected planner credentials.
How did my cram course go? Well, it was great to get back to the office.
My study text, from the College for Financial Planning in Denver, consisted of 1,000-plus pages on 175 subjects divided into six topics. In addition to financial planning fundamentals, the topics included insurance, investment, income-tax, retirement and estate planning.
Reading so much so quickly took its toll on my usually sunny disposition. I was befuddled trying to remember the ways a Section 2503(b) trust differs from a Section 2503(c) trust, for instance. Even things I knew -- say, the difference between inflation risk and interest-rate risk -- got cloudy the more I pondered them, especially at 11 P.M.
After a couple of days, my mind reeling, I decided to try some of the mock exams. I was warned that I would need a hand-held financial calculator with an internal rate of return function. But since I have no idea how to use this device, I wielded a simple calculator on these multiple-choice tests, and used whatever I could remember about fractions and equations. When in doubt, I picked the choice that was closest to my answer.
On the first 75 questions, I got 31 correct answers. I did somewhat better on the next 75, answering 36 correctly. The third series had 90 questions and I got only 32 right. But I finished with a bang, getting 60 correct answers in a series of 121.
I don't know if these scores are good enough. Tuesday's exam, to be given in Manhattan, will not be marked on a curve, but the passing score changes each time nonetheless. Trying to figure this out, I learned, courtesy of the C.F.P. Board of Standards, that a certification examination like this is "criterion-referenced," while curves are associated with "norm-referenced" educational tests.
It's a bad sign when you can't even figure out how a test's scoring works. In any case, I'll find out if I passed or failed in about two weeks. Look for the follow-up article.
And wish me luck.

CHILD WELFARE: Growing Up in New York

 BODY:
In a report, "Keeping Track of New York's Children," the Citizens' Committee for Children of New York Inc., measured the risks to children in each community board (for education, the surveys were based on community school districts). Overall, the report found, "in virtually every category, New York City children continue to fare worse than their peers at the state and national level." Low birth weight, high infant mortality, violent deaths, teen pregnancy, high drop-out rates and poverty are among the problems that disproportionately affect children in the city, according to the report. 
 Based on rankings in seven categories, the eight communities with the greatest risks are Bedford-Stuyvesant and Brownsville in Brooklyn; Mott Haven, Morrisania, Concourse and University Heights in the Bronx, and Central Harlem and East Harlem in Manhattan. Bay Ridge in Brooklyn and Rego Park in Queens rank among communities with the least risk for children.

THE COMPANY OF WOLVES
By Peter Steinhart.
Illustrated. 374 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $25. 
PETER STEINHART'S comprehensive and up-to-the-minute book on North American wolves, that most enigmatic of all endangered species, comes at a good moment. The wolf, until recently extinct in the wild everywhere in the lower 48 states, is now in the news.
After years of delay, 14 gray wolves imported from Canada were released last January into Yellowstone National Park, from which they had been ruthlessly extirpated almost 70 years ago; and one of the Yellowstone wolves has already had a litter of eight pups. Meanwhile, Canadian wolves are migrating southward on their own into northern Montana and Idaho. In North Carolina, a reintroduction of the red wolf seems to be going well. And plans are under way for a release of the Mexican wolf into the desert country of Arizona and southern New Mexico. It would seem that wolves are making a comeback. Or are we?
In his essay "Nature," Emerson implored us to develop a modern, original and inherently American relation to the natural world, "whose floods of life stream around us and through us." But of course we paid no attention, and with mad abandon wiped out indigenous prairie and forest ecosystems and many of their wild inhabitants, including the wolf, which was subject to the most resolute government-sponsored predator extermination program ever mounted. What took millenniums to destroy in western Europe, we were able to wipe out in less than a century.
Yet the wolf returns, through human agency as well as its own. Are we now ready to heed Emerson and step back from the annihilation of any form of nature that is not managed to provide immediate economic gain or recreational amusement? At this point the answer is not clear, but in the wolf we do have, to use an ecological term, an "indicator species."
Although we still remain woefully ignorant, filled with notions about wolves that date back to the Middle Ages, increasing numbers of sophisticated field studies concerning the lifeways of the wolf have been conducted, most of them since the advent of the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Accordingly, Peter Steinhart, the author of several other works on natural history, including "Two Eagles/Dos Aguilas: The Natural World of the United States-Mexico Borderlands," has set himself the task of rounding up and offering commentary on all the new wolf research (as well as some of the old), to improve our understanding of this emblematic wild creature and therefore of our relation to wild nature as a whole.
The book first puts us in the company of a pack of wolves on Isle Royale, a national park near Lake Superior's northern shore, where 12 eastern timber wolves survive; then into the lowland bogs of the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in North Carolina, where there is a raging controversy over whether the reintroduced red wolf is a true subspecies or a wolf-coyote hybrid; into the Ninemile Valley of northern Montana, where a brave Fish and Wildlife Service biologist tries to protect a pack of wolves from the depredations of ranchers; into Alaska, where the wolf, unprotected, is still mercilessly hunted from airplanes, despite laws prohibiting this form of killing.
In the course of these and other accounts, Mr. Steinhart amasses an astonishing amount of lore on the natural history of wolves. For example, in the New World wolves evolved from coyotes (not the other way around, as one might expect) about a million years ago and migrated to Eurasia, whereupon some of them migrated back. The howling of the wolf can be filled with complex meanings, and a deep voice is as intimidating among wolves as it is among humans. Adult wolves love all pups, becoming in effect aunts and uncles. While wolves from one pack will fight wolves from another, often to the death, there is no record of murder within a wolf pack. Moreover, there has been no documented case of any human being in North America ever being seriously attacked by a healthy (i.e., non-rabid) wild wolf. Wolves are smarter than domestic dogs and can solve problems, but are not trainable like dogs. Wolf-dog hybrids are a bad idea, emotionally disorganized and genetically harmful to the wolf population if released to the wild.
These days, a book about wolves is necessarily a book about politics, and "The Company of Wolves" is no exception. While giving anti-wolf people their say in his pages, Mr. Steinhart views the heated reaction to wolf reintroductions on the part of gun-toting property rights advocates out in militialand as seriously retrograde. "I suspect," he writes, "that when we argue about wolves, we are arguing about love and hate, peace and war, killing and kindness. We are arguing about our own hearts and souls." Indeed, the essential paradox of the wolf is that our response to this wildest of creatures provides a measure of our own humanity. And for that reason alone, "The Company of Wolves" is worthy of our serious attention.

HEADLINE: ART VIEW;
A Modern Master of Bottles, Scraps and Squares

BYLINE: By Pepe Karmel

 BODY:
THE NEXT TIME YOU GO TO Grand Central Terminal, take the escalators two flights up to the elevator lobby of the Met Life (previously Pan Am) Building. Turn around. There, over the escalators, is a tremendous abstract mural (28 feet high by 54 feet wide) of black, white and red strips arranged in interwoven columns. Like the Pan Am Building itself, the 1963 mural is a relic from the heyday of modernism.
There is no plaque to identify the mural, but it was done by Josef Albers, best known for the spare, geometric paintings of his "Homage to the Square" series. The Pan Am mural, entitled "Manhattan," is based on a 1928 glass painting called simply "City." A selection of these glass paintings, on view at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum through Sept. 17, throws new light on the development of an artist who is in many ways the quintessential modernist. 
 Albers was the son of a house painter from whom he inherited his skill with glass and other unconventional materials. Born in 1888 in an obscure German mining town, Albers joined the Bauhaus in 1920, the year after it was founded, and was quickly promoted from student to master. He headed the glass workshop at the Bauhaus until 1933, when it closed under Nazi pressure. His wife, Anni, a talented weaver and designer, was Jewish, and their future in Germany looked grim.
The architect Philip Johnson, then a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, arranged for Albers to be offered a job as head of a new art school, Black Mountain College, in North Carolina. Albers taught at Black Mountain and then at Yale and exhibited regularly in New York galleries. But his career as a painter didn't really take off until 1950 when he began the "Homage to the Square" series, at the age of 62.
The Guggenheim exhibition, "Josef Albers: Glass, Color and Light," originated at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice. It probably came as more of an eye-opener in Italy than it does here: the large 1988 Albers retrospective at the New York Guggenheim included an extensive selection of glass works. Perhaps for this reason it has been supplemented here by two mini-shows, one devoted to his photographs, which have not previously been exhibited, and one devoted to some of the paintings donated to the Guggenheim in 1991 by the Albers Foundation.
The glass pictures, done between 1921 and 1932, are the main event. The earliest pictures, done with bits of bottles and scrap salvaged from the town dump, are glowing, organic abstractions in the style of Klee and Kandinsky. Mounted in light boxes in a darkened room, they recall the grandeur of medieval stained glass. Abstraction serves as a vehicle for faith: in "Park," a gridded arrangement of green and blue panes, done around 1924, there's one pink box containing a Christian cross.
The next year, Albers's work underwent a dramatic change of style and technique. Instead of using found materials, he began fusing (or "flashing") thin layers of colored glass onto panes of milky-white translucent glass. Using stencils, he would then sandblast designs into the glass, etching the surface and grinding away the upper layers to reveal an underlying color. Anticipating the Minimalists, he sometimes sent his designs out to be fabricated in industrial workshops. (There are a few of Albers's preparatory studies in the show; drawn with gray pencil on tan paper covered with a salmon-pink grid, they're arguably more beautiful than the finished glass works.)
Along with this new technique, Albers adopted a new formal vocabulary of vertical and horizontal bands arranged in parallel rows, sometimes alternating, sometimes weaving one over the other. Many of his compositions from the period from 1925 to 1929 have architectural titles -- "Skyscrapers," "Factory," "Pergola" -- and they frequently resemble elevations of International Style buildings with strip windows and cantilevered floors. ("City," the prototype for the Pan Am mural, belongs to this series but is not in the exhibition.)
Not all of Albers's glass pictures are this abstract. "Glove Stretchers," done in 1928, adopts the Surrealist motif of truncated hands and the 1932 "Keyboard" shows three superimposed sets of piano keys: black on white, white on black and gray on black. It's an apt metaphor for the Bauhaus practice of challenging students with a series of design problems instead of teaching them rote theory. The problems were exercises intended to limber up their minds and fingers for the performance of more elaborate artistic compositions. This was the teaching method that Albers brought to Black Mountain and to Yale.
The wall text introducing Albers's photographs compares them to "the most celebrated voices of 20th-century photography." This seems an overstatement. For the most part they are studies of natural or architectural patterns, in the manner of Andreas Feininger and other photographers of the 1930's. Albers's best photographs are the portraits of friends and colleagues from the Bauhaus circle: Herbert Bayer, Klee and Kandinsky. The moody close-ups are eloquent reminders of an era that prized intensity of personality over mere good looks.
The selection of paintings at the Guggenheim is somewhat disappointing, particularly in comparison with the large survey of works from this series recently organized by the Andre Emmerich Gallery. Albers executed more than 1,000 versions of the "Homage to the Square," using four slightly different formats of concentric squares. Each square was painted in a single solid color, applied with a palette knife to maintain a smooth, impersonal surface.
In the 1950's, when Abstract Expressionism dominated the American avant-garde, the cool geometry of the "Homage to the Square" paintings seemed a bit old-fashioned. In the 1960's, with the rise of Minimalism and hard-edge Abstraction, Albers's paintings began to look prescient.
The canvases at the Guggenheim ring variations on closely related hues -- typically orange, red and brown. They tend to confirm the stereotype of Albers's work as pleasant but dull. In contrast, the paintings at Emmerich demonstrated how expressive his color could be. Juxtaposing browns, blacks and grays, he set cool colors aglow. A white square surrounded by blue, gray and green evoked the sensation of sky and earth more powerfully than most landscape paintings.
Albers's luminous colors and even his square format inevitably recalls the work of Mark Rothko, who began exhibiting his floating rectangles in 1948, two years before Albers began the "Homage to the Square." Compared with Rothko's large canvases, Albers's pictures look like finger exercises -- but finger exercises of genius.
In a sense, Albers's most important heir among American artists is Frank Stella, who did not even study with him. Mr. Stella's breakthrough "Black Paintings" of 1959-60 took the cool, impersonal geometry of Albers's earlier work and turned it into a demonstration of deliberate, aggressive meaninglessness: patterns that did nothing except cover the canvas.
Today, it is Mr. Stella who is called on to decorate the lobbies of corporate skyscrapers. Just as Albers's "Manhattan" expressed the 1960's dream of a vibrant but rational society, Mr. Stella's increasingly frenzied geometries provide an appropriate metaphor for the permanent revolution of today's global economy. It will be interesting to see what his pictures look like 30 years from now.

THE NEXT AMERICAN NATION
The New Nationalism and the
Fourth American Revolution.
By Michael Lind.
436 pp. New York: The Free Press. $25. 
TRY the following thought experiment: Suppose the United States to have been overrun or forcibly dismembered as a state. Would that much-invoked nation, "the American People," persist in maintaining and upholding its proud identity, as did the Poles between 1795 and 1919? Or would it become fissile and splintered, like the former Yugoslavia after 1991? If you incline to the second answer, then you are a Balkanist: one of the pessimistic tendency that sees pluribus emerging from unum in a welter of competing sectional, regional, ethnic and linguistic claims.
Against this tendency comes Michael Lind, a recovering neoconservative with a countertheory of "liberal nationalism":
"We Americans are more like our neighbors the Mexicans -- a racially diverse cultural nation -- than like our neighbors the Canadians -- a collection of two or more nationalities lacking any common Canadian culture or identity that would survive the breakup of Canada into several states. We Americans, in the liberal nationalist view, are defined by a common language and culture; and as long as these unite us, we will constitute an ethnocultural nation."
As may be inferred from the above, Mr. Lind (himself a Texan of Scandinavian provenance) has no patience in "The Next American Nation" with theories of the gene pool, "the browning of America" or any of the rest of it. For him, race and nation are related obliquely if at all. Very many Americans, I would venture, could more easily and readily picture themselves as Canadians (English or French) than as Mexicans, however Westernized. But what if Mr. Lind is correct, and the American idea actually more resembles the Mexican one? What if we all ceased to think with our epidermis?
Why, then, an opposite danger would immediately become evident to us. Instead of "Balkanization," there would be the menace of "Brazilianization," with the cracks and rifts in society running laterally rather than vertically, and with a pyramid of wealth, talent, privilege and skill that was ever more sharply apexed and whose layers (how to phrase this delicately?) got duskier as they went down. Decades ago, the Canadian John Kenneth Galbraith gave us the ironic title "The Affluent Society" for the coexistence between "private affluence and public squalor." Mr. Lind would seem to be running for the vacant position of Galbraith de nos jours.
He posits a society where the wealthy elites have been enabled, by a deft use of the tax system, the international market and the relationship between trusts and education, to arrange matters so that they live in a different country from their ostensible fellow citizens. They have their own schools, resorts, banks and information networks. They have their own private police and security systems. They have, by virtue of the "wealth primary," to which all candidates must submit, their own senators and Congressmen. To correct this plutocratic tendency, Mr. Lind advocates a bracing dose of class consciousness among the hard-working saps who, as the saying goes, "play by the rules" and are laid off or impoverished for their pains.
At present a senior editor at The New Republic, Mr. Lind is one of the few contemporary writers to have noticed the salient fact that identity politics is a perfect pretext for the traditional practice of divide-and-rule. How convenient it is, from the point of view of the oligarchs, that the saps should be tussling among themselves about second-order grievances like political correctness. Mr. Galbraith was writing about a society that, except in point of wealth distribution and the central black-white division, was relatively homogeneous. Mr. Lind depicts a fragmented culture where the winners and losers look as if they were from different planets.
How did we get here from there? He makes the case that there have already been three distinguishable American republics (not counting the American cultural nation that existed before the Declaration of Independence). Since the promulgation of the Constitution, there has been "Anglo-America" (between the years 1789 and 1861), succeeded by "Euro-America" (which ran between 1875 and 1957) and "Multicultural America," which took hold in 1972 and is the pattern of today and -- in one form or another -- of tomorrow too.
In Anglo-America, the national community was essentially Anglo-Saxon or Teutonic, with Protestantism as religion and Federal republicanism as ideology. Euro-America, by being more elastic about new arrivals, transmuted Americanism into something more European than English and more Christian than Protestant. An expanded franchise and the pressure for civil rights altered the ideology to one of Federal democracy. A "Judeo" prefix was sometimes generously added to the "Christian," without which the religious denomination would certainly have been incomplete.
Today's Third Republic is still in formation, but it has already seen a revival of the hyphenate principle. In other words, many old and new minorities prefer to emphasize their micro-diversities, while many among the majority regard that very stress as un-American and while the overclass, as we were saying, smirks all the way to the bank. Hobbes meets Babel, in other words.
Consider my own chosen profession. There is a single overwhelming power in American print and electronic media, one tycoon who is only technically -- we might now say "virtually" -- American but who has no trouble at all in getting action out of Congress, Wall Street and the Federal bureaucracy. Meanwhile, the orthodox right has but one complaint about the news media -- namely, their wanton excess of liberalism. At the same time, much of the correctness-minded left prefers to argue about the exquisite modulations of the proper mixture of epidermis and genitalia, while a surprising number of people (not without clout in a major political party) hint darkly that our organs of mass communication are directed by and for the Jews. It's enough to make a cat laugh.
In this moral and intellectual chaos, it is always interesting to ask cui bono? Let's just agree with Mr. Lind for now, and say that the transnational tycoons and the big political donors -- those who violate, as he puts it, "the separation of check and state" -- are not conspicuously numbered among the losers.
What we need, Mr. Lind argues, is a Fourth Republic that will protect the American idea simultaneously from the religious nativists and the promiscuous multiculturalists. A nation, as he says, "may be dedicated to a proposition, but it cannot be a proposition." In order to redress the general tendency to the centrifugal, a "social market contract" will be required. Essentially an update of the New Deal, it would finance Social Security and national health insurance out of progressive income and consumption taxes. Higher wages for American workers would be attained by a mixture of measures, of which the most controversial would be Mr. Lind's proposed restrictions on immigration and his suggested "social tariff" to prevent the import of cheap-labor products.
MR. LIND is a pleasure to read because he is so manifestly intelligent and because he has done a great deal of hard and consistent work. For example, as I read through the pages that marked America's transition from "Anglo" to "Euro," I thought I had caught him out. It was in 1898 -- well into the "Euro" phase -- that there occurred a vast revival of Anglophilia, linked to nativist reaction and also to American expansionism. (This was the period when Teddy Roosevelt made common cause with Rudyard Kipling, and the Vanderbilts and Astors started to marry Churchills and such.) But not long after I had marked that demurral in my margin, Mr. Lind took up this very anomaly in his narrative and discussed it with some dexterity.
There are occasional signs of haste. Mr. Lind describes the post-1865 South as "a low-wage internal resource colony for Northern capital," a formulation he likes well enough to repeat not many pages later as "an internal third world resource colony for the industrial North." But when one considers Mr. Lind's near-Stakhanovite recent output, these are small reservations to be entering.
The religious nativists, or monoculturalists, if one can capture them in that term, evince an obvious nostalgia for the First Republic. They forget that in order for Britain to become such a shining example of a solid society run by a competent overclass, it had to overcome differences among Scots, Welsh, Irish and English that were more intense, if not ultimately more sanguinary, than any North-South or black-white confrontation on North American soil. London also had to become, to its credit, the capital of the Huguenot exiles and one of the centers of world Jewry. Successive experiences of slump, social conflict, political reform and war had to be undergone for the country to become even a vestigial social democracy or welfare state. The "Saxon genius," so much revered by Thomas Jefferson and other founders and framers, had precious little to do with it.
America has thus far been incomparably more fortunate but, as Mr. Lind is quite right to admonish us, may also be living on borrowed time and credit. Its multiculturalism may very well metamorphose into an ugly tribal negation of itself, and could do so quite quickly if the economic topsoil continues to blow away.

HEADLINE: STOP NITPICKING A GENIUS

BYLINE: By FRANK CONROY; Frank Conroy, the author of "Stop-Time" and "Body and Soul," is the director of the Iowa Writers' Workshop. For five years in the 1970's, he made his living as a jazz pianist.

 BODY:
The Studio, Part I
IN THE OLD MASONIC HALL BEING USED AS A RECORDING STUDIO, WYNTON Marsalis tells the band to take a 10-minute break, steps down from the podium, comes over and gives me a hug. We sit down in the old theater seats.
"Man," he says, "I am tired of all this stuff they're writing about me. It has nothing to do with music." 
 "The dogs bark, but the caravan rolls on," I quote.
He laughs. "Hey, that's good. I'll have to remember that."
I had read various sniping reports in the media. That he was an archivist, insufficiently avant-garde. That he didn't hire enough white players or play enough music written by whites. That he was provincial. That he was insufficiently sensitive to multiculturalism (translation: not part of the current fad of "world music," whatever that is). Low-level cavils from the right and from the left, which had saddened me, since he is a musical genius, the leader of a powerful renaissance in jazz and a tireless educator of the young. Personally, he is charismatic, a lover of argument, a firm, not to say tenacious, defender of his opinions about music, politics, philosophy and everything else, very bright and mildly impatient -- all of which rubs some people the wrong way.
As both an artist and an observer of the musical scene, Marsalis is drawn to clarity. He abhors confusion. Unfortunately, a good deal of confusion continues to exist in the jazz world, partly because the old order is giving way to the new and partly because of the history of obscurantism, defensiveness and hermeticism that has prevailed for something like 50 years.
Jazz is a fine art, and the only fine art to have been developed from scratch in America, where recognition, paradoxically, has been slow in coming -- perhaps because the music emerged from black culture, from the bottom (economically speaking) up. Some protectiveness and secrecy on the part of the musicians was perhaps to be expected. Many black musicians were covetous, and some grew angry through the years as they saw white players making more money than themselves playing jazz or watered-down jazz. (It used to be said that jazz players were either black, Jewish, Italian or Irish -- very close to the truth -- and it was the blacks getting the short end of the stick from the union, the recording studios and the bookers.)
As well, jazz had an ominous side. Most players were honest, hard-working men, often subsidizing their music with ordinary jobs, known as "day gigs," but there were also drug addicts and dealers, thieves and pimps. A number of very famous players in the 1940's and 1950's ran strings of prostitutes to augment their incomes. Thus, there were people creating sublimely beautiful music while living sublimely ugly lives (strengthening the vulgar and false idea that the authenticity of the music was a function of the degree of misery in the life of the player). Public perception of jazz has been heavily tainted with notions of criminality and degeneracy, and lingers still, albeit faintly, despite the fact that conditions have changed completely.
There are jazz programs in virtually all the colleges and universities. Jazz clubs around the country are "high class" and expensive. Institutional efforts like Jazz at Lincoln Center (of which Marsalis is the artistic director, thus drawing heat from people who would like a different kind of programming) are springing up around the country. The new generation of players are, by and large, educated, cultured people in their 20's more likely to be vegetarians than drug addicts, more likely to run three miles a day than smoke cigarettes and more likely to be carrying an organ-donor card than a gun. There is a French expression, nostalgie de la boue, which means nostalgia for the gutter, and it is perhaps that preoccupation slowing down so many jazz fans, observers and writers from recognizing reality.
Jazz is American. It belongs to everybody now, black, white, Latin, to all those who have added to it and all those who have been moved by it. Fresh breezes are invigorating the music, which in turn promises to once again invigorate American culture itself. (And at this point, American culture needs all the good stuff it can get.) Heretofore, composers working from a European tradition have dipped in for a bit of spice and energy -- Ives, Copland, Gershwin and others who used jazzy effects -- but I believe the current renaissance will lead to a time when jazz is no longer marginalized, when artists working in jazz traditions will create work as strong as, and perhaps stronger than, those working from European traditions.
For a long time, jazz fans and players have been obsessed with the idea of "progress." Because of the speed and abruptness of the be-bop revolution, people were looking for something quick, and what they got, mostly, were garden paths leading to no place in particular. Progress is a dubious concept in any art -- have we had progress in poetry, in the novel, in painting or in dance? I don't think so.
The idea is inappropriately linear, less useful than the model of a kind of pulsating spiral, moving out, moving in, but over time growing larger, covering more territory. Jazz is at a point when the spiral is moving out, and all the old arguments, sports-fan mentalities, show-biz preoccupations and theoretical dogmas seem as dated as the novels of Mickey Spillane. It will take a new generation of writers to write about a new generation of players and composers, and let us hope that deconstructionists, politically correct busybodies and agenda-driven theorists will not be in their number.
For the moment, a distinction should be drawn between outdated notions of progress and modern attempts to trace and extend the organic evolution of jazz. (The basic concept from biology, that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny -- or more simply stated, that individual growth mirrors the history of the species -- is useful in music.) The way to strengthen one's ability to tell the difference between progress and evolution is to study the canon -- that music which has had the longest and deepest influence -- because the canon contains the evolutionary signposts and implies how jazz can spiral outward without losing its identity.
For instance, the canon suggests an expansion into long forms, forms of a length we usually associate with so-called classical music. One of the most important missions of Jazz at Lincoln Center is to lay down a foundation for the future of jazz by presenting important works from the canon with all the passion and intelligence that can be brought to bear.
I remember sitting all night at a Manhattan club called the Half Note listening to John Coltrane play with his famous rhythm section. I was there for the first public performance of "My Favorite Things," a superficially sappy song done by Julie Andrews in "The Sound of Music." Coltrane stated the theme, instantly making it his own through his phrasing, and proceeded to improvise in a carefully structured series of related scales and modes more and more remote from the original.
He played for almost an hour, his slender soprano saxophone heartbreakingly tender one moment, thick and angry the next, singing out cries, as it were, from many hearts. There was so much emotion, so much density of emotion, I was effectively hypnotized through the entire performance.
Later, as I thought about his ascent through the different scales and modes (over a kind of tonal drone from the other instruments), I thought I realized why he had picked that unlikely tune. It was harmonically perfect for a grand tour of related scales, with which he created what the great French teacher of composition, Nadia Boulanger, used to call "la grande ligne," a clear swooping line that arises in a piece from the beginning to the end. The inner music. Evolution.
I had never heard anything like it in jazz. To see and hear it right there in front of me, brand new, was more thrilling than I can describe. What I feel now, as I sense all of jazz on the brink of a new era, is the anticipation of the same kind of excitement.
AFTER THE 10-MINUTE BREAK, THE RECORDING SESSION recommences. The piece, "Blood on the Fields," is the largest and most daring of Marsalis's compositions to date, and the first to include voices.
I sit beside Eric Reed, a superb young pianist from Los Angeles who plays the very difficult score. Chords are not fully notated but suggested by the traditional jazz symbols, which means that Eric is free to voice them any way he wants. In order to get the best sound, he has to listen with extraordinary care to what all the other instruments are doing and decide his voicings on the spot. Sometimes the chords come four to the bar. His playing is simply dazzling.
During one sequence, he prepares the piano by placing his jacket over the treble strings, improvises a series of dancing staccato riffs, removes the jacket and plays the last chords of the section. In the small silence that follows, he turns his head to me. " 'How High the Moon,' " he says, "it ain't." He speaks the truth. It's a new day for American music.
 
The Jazz Canon (Sort Of)
JAZZ IS A WONDERFULLY OPEN AND ELASTIC MUSIC THAT HAS, IN its relatively short history, absorbed energy from myriad sources. Europe, Africa, Cuba and Latin America are where the harmonies, scales, rhythms and instruments came from. Jazz forms have emerged from gospel, marching band music, Tin Pan Alley, rags, blues, show tunes, classical music, field hollers and so on -- listed here in no particular order.
A restless music, the best practitioners of which have adhered to Ezra Pound's credo "make it new" with particular intensity, sometimes to ill effect. As one might expect in such a volatile environment, there have been plenty of fads, pan-flashes, phony theories and dead ends.
The tension between the urge to make it new and the awareness of possible dead ends creates an atmosphere in which contention thrives. For more than 40 years, I've watched and listened as jazz people yelled, screamed, shook their fists and generally lost their cool over one issue after another. Obsessions with the idea of "progress" have obscured awareness of how jazz has moved through time, of what jazz carries from the past into the emergency of the present and, indeed, what the music in fact is or should be.
Whatever he eventually came to believe, Louis Armstrong was initially deeply suspicious of be-bop, which surfaced in Harlem in the late 1930's -- an extremely important style whose harmonic complexity and contrapuntal sophistication created a new paradigm. Classical jazz, or Dixie, and modern jazz, or be-bop, were to run in parallel paths, almost never touching, for more than 50 years. Only recently has jazz moved past this schism, because the young players see it all as related music, different colors on the same palette, all to be used.
Maybe the fighting started there, with the classical jazz-modern jazz split, but it grew to the point that it sometimes felt like there was no other way to talk. To look back is to remember people arguing about issues great and small (long after the canonization of be-bop) and to remember how fans absolutely had to have a position on everything. East Coast "hot" (say, Clifford Brown) as against West Coast "cool" (say, Chet Baker). The Apollonian approach of the Modern Jazz Quartet as opposed to the Dionysian approach of the Art Blakey quintets. The so-called third stream. The Lydian Method. "Free" playing. Fusion. Acoustic versus electric. And so forth and so on. My point is not to make a complete list, but to show the pattern, the long history of arguing and nitpicking.
In part because of all this posturing, jazz fans have often not known what was happening even as it happened around them. (Some players, too, for that matter.) As a teen-ager, I went to one of those extravagant Carnegie Hall jazz shows -- one group after another for hours -- specifically to hear Charlie Parker. (Claude Hopkins, an important dance-band leader in Harlem, had told me about Bird while giving me a free piano lesson in the basement of an old Dixie club called Stuyvesant Casino.) Backed up by a small string section, Parker played like a demented angel -- but he was billed seventh or eighth; few in the audience knew of him and fewer still listened with more than half an ear.
Perhaps 10 years later, I was part of an on-going jam session in the downstairs bar of a club on Eighth Street in the Village. One night, the owner approached me as I was getting up from the piano. "You should listen to the guy upstairs," he said. "You could learn a lot." (Downstairs was a walk-in bar; upstairs was tablecloths, waiters and a cover charge -- this last waived for musicians, as was the custom in those days.)
I did indeed go upstairs, and what I heard there drastically, almost violently, opened up my understanding of what might be possible in jazz. It was possible to voice chords without playing the roots. It was possible to play an entire tune without a dominant seventh and the kinds of cycles that flow from dominant sevenths. A great deal could be accomplished by implication; one didn't have to state everything, or play all the notes of a given scale or chord. That which was left out was sometimes as important as that which was included. I listened to the trio for three nights and for most of the time I was an audience of one. Too overwhelmed to talk to the musicians myself (they seemed a bit standoffish in any case), I nevertheless tried to get some of the funky-blues musicians from downstairs to come up and check it out. They'd listen to a tune, or part of a tune, and then leave. "Cocktail music," they said. I had thought so too, but only for the first five minutes. The trio was Bill Evans, Scott LaFaro and Paul Motian, in what I believe to be Evans's first New York gig. No one came to hear them and the heartbroken owner had to let them go.
In some senses, having fans can be worse than not having them, worse at least for the musician who is trying to reconcile the music being played with the feedback from those listening to it. The Beat Generation took up jazz with enthusiasm. Kerouac, Corso, Ginsberg et al. prowled the jazz clubs listening to bop musicians and praising the emotional spontaneity of their solos, the freedom from constraints of form. They believed the "wild" sounds were direct, unfettered expressions of raw emotion -- some kind of animistic, ejaculatory jungle music. They were unaware of bop's grounding in Bach and its continuation of the reconciliation of chromaticism and tonality, let alone its neo-baroque, rule-ridden severity. So intent were the Beats in co-opting jazz into their abject romanticism they did not hear the music. Like so many others, they patronized, projected and did not hear.
IF YOU GO TO THE JAZZ SECTION OF YOUR LOCAL RECORD STORE AND pick randomly, you will get mostly music based on two short forms -- the blues (usually, but not always, a 12-bar structure) and the ballad or tune (usually, but not always, a 32-bar structure). Ballads or tunes that are particularly interesting harmonically, and are thus worked over by successive generations of players, become what are know as standards. "Going to Chicago" is a blues. "Autumn Leaves" is a standard. These forms are short and quite simple. Their simplicity becomes a virtue because it allows for greater latitude in improvisation. The original tune means very little in jazz; it is the variations that count. For instance, if we consider "I Got Rhythm" (a standard) as the theme, we quickly notice that the thousands of variations done by hundreds of jazz improvisers are a good deal more interesting than the original tune. The theme becomes a sub-subtext and very often is not even heard or recognized by nonplayers.
Many jazz musicians have also created original short-form tunes without lyrics, structurally similar to blues and standards, and written lines (melodies) and done improvisations based on those tunes. Horace Silver comes to mind. Others have taken the harmonies (chord changes) of popular tunes and written lines over them completely unrelated to the original melody, a practice that was economically, if not artistically, inevitable since melodies can be copyrighted and chord changes cannot. Charlie Parker was a master in this regard.
It has been a great delight to witness the breathtaking inventiveness with which the short forms have been explored and continuously revived. Thelonious Monk's use of space, Coltrane's exploration of modal scales, Sonny Rollins's architectural structures, Bill Evans's exquisite voicings for piano, Keith Jarrett's pressurized metrics, Miles Davis's artful elisions, Paul Desmond's musical wit -- the work of these musicians and many others suggests that the short forms will always be appropriate for jazz and that the challenge of making music with them and within them is, for all intents and purposes, infinite.
Blues, tunes and ballads had the advantage of fitting the 78 r.p.m. format used in homes and jukeboxes. Short forms were also in demand on the dance floor and on radio and thus dominated jazz during a large part of the music's history.
Even with the advent of the long-playing record, larger forms were only rarely explored. Those musicians who did move in that direction, despite economic disincentives, were acting for artistic reasons, feeling, one assumes, that a natural pressure existed inside of jazz that might allow for an expansion of the music.
In 1940, Artie Shaw wrote his "Concerto for Clarinet" with a commission from Hollywood, two sections of which have been released on CD. Section one is a crisply orchestrated B-flat blues, but section two is something else entirely. Shaw wrote blocks of ensemble music and then improvised solo clarinet in such a way as to leave one block, make a solo structure and enter the next block of tutti like a man jumping from one ice floe to another. Improvisation is a basic element of jazz, but this was a new way to use it -- improvised solo lines to connect discrete harmonic structures. (Major symphonies have recorded the work; the clarinet soloist reads the transcribed notes of Shaw's original improvisations!) The second section is short in duration, but a definite statement of Shaw's inclination to move the energies of jazz beyond the 12-bar or 32-bar forms. His early retirement from the big-band scene was due in part to his inability to find support for that experiment.
In 1943, Duke Ellington recorded "Black, Brown and Beige" -- an extended work for jazz orchestra, 45 minutes playing time, that drew from jazz conventions while directly taking on the challenge of longer than normal forms. Ellington, often working with Billy Strayhorn, is to jazz music what Shakespeare (according to Harold Bloom) is to Western literary culture -- a colossus. His influence can be clearly heard in artists as diverse as Thelonious Monk and Bill Evans, or the big bands of Gil Evans and Woody Herman. Ellington laid down a foundation so strong that its use went in all directions, from the a cappella group Take Six to Dave Brubeck. His compositions, harmonies and part-writing are so important that one simply cannot do any significant work in jazz without having absorbed them.
Fans, critics and musicians may argue about everything else, but no one would deny Ellington's centrality to the canon. He had ambitions for the music -- the early big works like "Black, Brown and Beige," "Diminuendo in Blue/Crescendo in Blue" and other compositions leading him inevitably toward the sacred music (as he called it), a kind of post-jazz experiment that preoccupied him during the later years.
There is a point at which orchestration ("the charts" in jazz speak) passes beyond being a technical matter and is better described as composition. That happens when the work is so fresh, persuasive and powerful as to break new ground. Ellington-Strayhorn, for example, followed by Charles Mingus.
As a young man, Mingus played with Charlie Parker and took part in creating the paradigm of be-bop. He worked most of his life doing combo work, first as a sideman and eventually as leader of a series of small groups. In contrast to some other leaders who tended to create a certain musical identity or style and then stick to it -- superb players like Art Blakey, Horace Silver, John Lewis -- Mingus was always in motion, pressing the edges of what was possible with five or six players.
He took chances, changing tempos, using dissonance, shouts, stray sound effects, unfamiliar harmonies and whatever else he needed to wring every ounce of musical juice out of whatever tune, blues, riff or ballad he played. That was how he made his living. At the same time, he was writing, creating post-Ellington compositions that both contained the master and opened new territory. "Duke Ellington's Sound of Love" and "Open Letter to Duke," for instance. After Mingus's death in 1979, it appeared that much of his more ambitious writing would never be played again, but that has not, happily, been the case. His magnum opus, "Epitaph," a two-hour piece of great power, was performed in its entirety, for the first time, at Lincoln Center in 1989. The piece is big, fiercely intelligent and written in such a way as to allow for the active participation of the players through improvisation. The orchestration is composition, but space is left for the instantaneous composition of others, so that no two performances will ever be exactly the same. Thus, the melding of jazz with what might be called the non-string symphony is achieved. Evolution.
Following on Mingus, we have Wynton Marsalis. Classically trained at Juilliard, jazz trained with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, Marsalis is the first artist ever to win a Grammy for both jazz and classical recordings in the same year. At 33, he is the leader of the new generation of jazz artists. He discovers young talent; they play with him, form their own groups and discover young talent who play with them, etc., etc.
It is a pyramid that grows broader and taller every year, an educational and access structure whose reach now spans the entire country. His combo work, using the short forms, has been fresh, original and extremely sophisticated, but he has also been writing long forms -- ballet music (as did Copland), an extended work called "Citi Scape" and other strong pieces.
The world premier of "Blood on the Fields" at Lincoln Center in 1994 marked the symbolic moment when the full heritage of the line, Ellington through Mingus, was extended into the present. A secular oratorio in 20 sections, "Blood on the Fields" presents a narrative about slavery in the old South. A speaking chorus introduces each section and the work is scored for jazz orchestra and three singing voices. Marsalis researched the music being played at the time and refers to it with great deftness. The result is a contemporary piece laced with the flavors of blues, marches, church music, turkey in the straw, Dixie and more. It also reflects a full awareness of Copland and Stravinsky. The libretto is earnest, veering between prose and poetry, but the music is very strong -- rich and constantly surprising. Somewhat more than Ellington and somewhat less than Mingus, Marsalis includes improvisation and spontaneous participation of the players in the grand design. He moves his harmonies and shifts his keys in ways that seem natural and yet never predictable (making great demands on the singers: "It's hard," Cassandra Wilson told me. "You're between keys sometimes").
"Blood on the Fields" is also a convenient marker for the transcendence of the old classical jazz-modern jazz schism. The new generation of jazz players and composers feels free to draw from everywhere, the more sources the better. Dixie, Bartok, be-bop, regional music -- all grist for the mill. Marsalis grew up in New Orleans and those sounds are in his ear, but so are many others. What is important about his writing is that it demonstrates how jazz conventions and jazz "feel" can retain and renew energy while expanding into large forms that contain other elements and other traditions. Jazz need no longer be marginalized, neither in its structures nor its emotional and intellectual ambitions. It is, after all, music.
 
The Studio, Part II
AT THE RECORDING session of "Blood on the Fields," Marsalis stands on the podium facing the brasses and reeds. To his left, the piano; behind him, the drums and bass. Everyone can see him clearly, even the singers behind glass in semi-soundproof booths above and behind the trumpets and trombones.
Microphones are scattered about, wires running this way and that, taped to the floor; rugs are hung over lamp shades or 2-by-4's as acoustic baffles; sheets of music spill from folding chairs, and the scene seems, at first glance, to be somewhat chaotic.
Marsalis is of medium height, with a large chest and a round face, but there is something in his physical appearance that defies direct description. A kind of stillness, or rootedness, to his frame. He seems to fill space more densely than other people, somehow. You can feel it even shaking hands with him.
He raises his arms, counts off the tempo almost under his breath and the room is filled with sound. His conducting technique (no baton, of course) is spare. Crisp, minimal movements to make cues, adjust dynamics or indicate endings, which he does by holding up his hands, palms together, moving them apart as the sound rings and then making a little flourish at full extension for cutoff and silence. He indulges in little hip swings, little shoulder drops or head noddings when the music moves him. Mostly what he's doing is listening, listening with great concentration. He is loath to stop the band and does it only when he has to.
"Hey, stupid," he says affectionately to one of the saxophone players, who looks about 17. "You are off key. You are flat. What's happening?"
The boy mumbles something about his reed and, head down, fools with his mouthpiece.
"Well, fix it up, little brother," Wynton says lightly. "Make that reed behave."
More than half the musicians at the session are in Marsalis's touring group or the groups he has used for recording. The rest are particularly fine players, both black and white, with the interpretive and improvisational skills Marsalis wants.
The prevailing mood at any rehearsal or recording session is quite important, affecting both the efficiency of the use of time and the quality of the music being played. Marsalis is very, very good at setting an informal and yet highly professional tone while the work is going on. When the time is right, there is a good deal of banter -- teasing, jokes, etc. (The white trumpet player making moues to his black colleague, trying to crack him up while the reeds play a long section, for instance. O.K. as long as it doesn't go too far.) There is a tangible sense of affection, of warmth between the musicians, including Wynton, and a sense of pride because they are all members of an elite group. It is not difficult to imagine that every man in the room feels a sense of personal authentication from the company he is keeping. Certainly there is a total absence of cynicism and very much a sense of the band working, wholeheartedly, together in what they clearly feel is an important endeavor.
The band staggers to a halt when the bass trombonist breaks off in the middle of a solo. Marsalis understands.
"O,K., O.K.," he says. "I heard it. But don't lose the low harmonics you got on the B-flat that time. I liked that texture." He raises his arms and they start again.
There are only a few odd sheets of music on Marsalis's stand. He works from memory even though the oratorio is almost three hours long. (Two flights upstairs, listening through headphones, the producer has the full score.) He also works quickly -- if a line isn't correct because of an error in transcription or interpretation, he will lift his head and simply sing it in a strong voice to indicate how it should go. He has the ability to communicate rapidly with his players and singers, talking about timbre one minute, call and response the next, or getting across subtle issues of shading, tone, color and the like as if by telepathy. It is a pure joy to watch him work.
Lunch break. Marsalis has no sooner stepped down when the sound engineer is at his elbow with some technical matters. The producer appears two minutes later for a brief huddle. The players are getting up, stretching, drifting out to the hall where Sony has laid out a buffet of sandwiches, finger food, cakes and salads. A cheerful mood prevails.
Wynton takes a seat beside me. "You want to eat?" he asks. "There's a Japanese place down the block." (Wynton likes seafood.) He leans back and it's clear he doesn't want to leave immediately.
"I know it sounds pompous," I say, "but I think this is a historic piece of music."
He smiles and looks at me. "Thank you, man." After a moment he leans his head back. "Take a look at the libretto when you get home. You write; maybe you can teach me something."
I indicate the empty bandstand. "These guys are terrific. That part toward the end, where you've got the two trumpets playing a minor second against each other? They didn't waver. No vibrato, just solid."
"Yeah. That jazzy sound. I love it."
"So many great young players coming up now. A whole wave."
"They got a ways to go before they catch up with the old guys, though. Don't know how to play slow; don't know how to play soft. Crazy about velocity. Well, velocity by itself don't mean a thing."
I nod and drop the matter. Marsalis has high standards, for himself as well as everybody else. He once told me, back when he was 23, about having started with Art Blakey a few years earlier. "I was raw, man," he said. "I mean, I didn't know how to play a ballad. Can you believe it? Had no idea whatsoever."
Now, in the studio, we look across the room where Reginald Veal, Marsalis's bass player, is running through the score for a tall, skinny white kid who I later learn is a student at Stuyvesant High. Reggie plays a long sequence while the kid watches his fingering, they converse for a moment and then the kid tries it. This goes on for some time.
"Who's that?" I ask.
"He's from a master class. And look, there he is getting a free lesson. Why don't they write about that?"
Somebody wants Marsalis and he springs out of his chair. Eric Reed is at the piano quietly playing some interesting chords. I go over and we chat about them. He's written the sequence quite recently.
Ten minutes later, Wynton seems ready to go to lunch.
"Did you see that tune of Eric's?" I ask. "Nine bars forward and then you play them backward?"
His eyebrows go up and he turns and goes to the piano.
Eric stands and Wynton sits down and looks at the music. He plays through the tune and then returns to a three-bar section that he plays several times over. Without the melody line, the score indicates D-flat 7 (flat 5/flat 9), G-minor 11, F-minor 11, E/G-flat, A-flat major 7 and E-minor 9.
"So is that a resolution?" Eric says from over Wynton's shoulder. "Technically?"
Wynton turns his head away from me and speaks rapidly to Eric. I can't catch what he says. He plays a quick series.
"Yeah, O.K.," Eric says. "I never did understand how that worked. I'm thinking of fixing it up to do on the road." And then, almost apologetically. "You know, for club dates."
Now, in this perfectly ordinary moment, I felt a kind of click of recognition, a sign of how profoundly the world of jazz has changed. It was the subtle apology, the tacit understanding that although club dates were certainly important and worth doing for reasons both musical and economic, they were no longer the apex.
For a very long time, playing the A clubs across the country was, along with recording, the ultimate goal. The final brass ring. That is no longer the case. Eric Reed, a very young and very brilliant jazz pianist, along with his whole generation, knows in his bones that the music is expanding, growing in scope and ambition, and that the future will involve a great deal more than club dates. Combo work has become a test, and a rite of passage, toward a grander enterprise. What used to be the end, in a certain sense, has become a part of the beginning.
"Let's go eat," Wynton says. And we do, taking the kid from Stuyvesant with us.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
In Japan, Some Shun Lifetime Jobs to Chase Dreams

BYLINE: By MIKI TANIKAWA 

 BODY:
SHIGENORI SASAKI had just about everything. A job at a bank, good pay, prestige and opportunities for promotion. But he did something that once would have shocked many Japanese.
He quit and took a job elsewhere. 
 "Ever since I was a college student, I wanted to do something related to U.S.-Japan relations," Mr. Sasaki said. So he found a job at Sony, in the international relations department. "Sony," he said, "made my dream come true."
Mr. Sasaki, 31, is among the growing ranks of Japanese workers in this land of lifelong employment who have followed their dreams out the office door. While American workers, both the laid-off and the survivors, grapple with cutbacks, one in three Japanese workers willingly walks away from his job within the first 10 years of his career, according to the Japanese Institute of Labor, a private research organization. And many more are thinking about it. More than half of salaried Japanese workers say they would switch jobs or start their own business if a favorable opportunity arose, according to a survey by the Recruit Research Corporation.
"People's attitude toward changing jobs has markedly changed," said Torao Tanaka, editor in chief of B-ing, Japan's biggest recruitment magazine. "In the past, we always had difficulty asking people who had changed jobs to appear for interviews, even if their new job was going well. They would feel so sorry or embarrassed for the company they left behind."
But two recent economic developments have made Japanese workers, particularly younger people, increasingly mobile. As Japan's economy boomed in the mid-1980's, many expanding companies aggressively sought experienced workers as well as entry-level college seniors. Then, when the "bubble" economy burst in the early 1990's, the same corporations were forced to cast off many employees, through buyouts and dismissals. These trends -- midcareer hirings and midcareer dismissals -- had the same result: a weakened national attachment to one job for life.
Sometimes, foreign influences further attenuate the old way. For many years, Akitaka Asaga, 38, was one of Toyota's "most dedicated employees," he said. But when he went to business school in the United States, his outlook changed. "School taught me that I really have to retrain myself as a specialist and otherwise I won't be able to survive in this world," he said. Toyota and other Japanese companies, however, shape people as generalists, not specialists.
Now, Mr. Asaga works in his chosen field -- corporate finance -- at a Ford office near Tokyo. "I had never thought that there was such a good company like Ford," he said. "My hours are considerably shorter, and I get to set the pace of my work."
But job-switching has its downside, too -- and it goes beyond the predictable risk that the new job won't pan out.
"Those who make lateral entries often face discrimination in promotion and other kinds of frustration," said Tatsuya Kubo, 37, a former Toyota employee who now works for a large securities company. Many Japanese companies, particularly large ones, "tend to favor those who rise through the corporate ranks," he said. Japanese words like Junketsu-shugi (the principle of "pure blood") and Haenuki (true born) prove the point. According to Mr. Tanaka of B-ing magazine, the advantage stems from the valuable familiarity with company culture and a wide network of allies that longtime workers can acquire.
A fickle reputation is another peril for Japanese job-changers. "Recruiters of a company would frown upon anyone who changed jobs too frequently, said Naomiki Amano, a counselor at an employment agency run by the Government. "They would question your personality."
Of course, lifelong employment is hardly dead; it serves the companies and workers' needs in many ways. But mobility is on the upswing. Mika Ishida, 32, who had three different jobs before joining Sony five years ago, said her company had been very open to job-seekers with previous experience. And the numbers show it. About 40 percent of Sony's managers have worked elsewhere.
And while that number is unusually high, it may not be long before other companies equal it, adopting the attitude of Akio Morita, Sony's retired chief executive. Mr. Morita "used to say in his address to the new recruits that they should all have a dream," Ms. Ishida said, "and if they find that it cannot be realized at Sony, they should consider leaving for a different job. Because after all, we have only one life to live."

 BODY:

CHOICES
By Mary Lee Settle.
376 pp. New York: Nan A. Talese/Doubleday. $24.95. 
 IN her large body of fiction, most notably "The Beulah Quintet," Mary Lee Settle has moved whole families back and forth through three centuries of Southern life. Though it stretches over 60 years, her latest novel, "Choices," seems like an effort at compression -- an attempt to embody Miss Settle's familiar preoccupations in the episodic adventures of one heroine, Melinda Kregg, a rebellious product of Richmond society who shares many of the author's political ideals and some of her life experiences. The novel's successes, like its protagonist's, are intermittent.
Early in the 1930's, Melinda volunteers to work for the Red Cross in the Kentucky coal country. But it's not long before she's told that her employer "won't feed nobody's been blacklisted" -- and that includes everyone who's tried to join a union. She learns more about the miners' woes from Grandma Haycroft, 324 pounds of infallible wisdom, whose "voice rolled on like a river, as rhythmic and timeless as the clock that ticked on the wall above her head." Dismissed from her job for supporting the strikers, Melinda gets a fast political education that includes violence, jail time and a demonstration of atrociousness from her own side. One Vassar-educated Communist welcomes the shooting of a 15-year-old leafleteer as a motivational bonanza.
Five years later, Melinda is repairing trucks and bandaging limbs for the Spanish Republic, whose bloody misfortunes make up the best realized stretch of the novel: "Melinda could see the soldiers asleep, in that loose-flung way of children and the dead. The neo-Moorish arches cast shadows across their faces. Some soldiers were under the trees gambling; some were grouped around a commissar, learning the alphabet; some wandered toward the village, tired of siesta."
Melinda marries her comrade Tye Dunston, an aristocratic British doctor with whom she later settles in London, where they raise a Spanish orphan named Maria. Tye is an idealistic traitor to his class who fulminates against the system ("Eighteen-year-old girls from the East End with bodies like forty-year-old women, made of white bread, marge and black tea from living on the dole!"). After the next war he will become a passionate practitioner for the National Health. It is in Book 4, entitled "England, 1939-1960," that the novel takes on a rather breakneck pace; Miss Settle appears eager to get Melinda widowed, so she can return to America for a last crusade.
Living in upstate New York in the mid-1960's, Melinda adopts a second emblematic orphan, Aiken, a young black civil-rights worker whom she puts through college. He imparts to her a long, revelatory late-night monologue much like the one she received from Grandma Haycroft 30 years earlier. Soon enough Melinda is setting out to investigate the disappearance of her young cousin, who has been teaching at a freedom school in the rural South. To perform her mission, she adopts the protective coloring she remembers from her girlhood: "She flew to Richmond and took a taxi straight to Miller and Rhoads. It was the same as it had been all her life. She entered into an atmosphere that was deceptively secure, smelling slightly of perfume and wool." The adventure is heartfelt, but a bit more plucky than believable.
Miss Settle's sleeve wears an unabashed bleeding heart ("Choices" is dedicated "to Southern liberals, past and present, wherever they may be"), but she does make honest efforts not to round up only history's usual suspects. Melinda can show sympathy for the right-wing Spanish family who owned the finca that's been taken over by the Republicans, and even for her cousin's apparently racist father. But such touches of complication don't save the novel from a schematic sentimentality. There are a number of bits recalling overdone Steinbeck, like the scene in which a Spanish refugee gives birth before crossing the Pyrenees: "The baby came easily; the woman groaned for the last time and then smiled. 'Born in Spain. He was born in Spain.' "
"Choices" contains its share of good lines ("Melinda had long since learned to watch people who said truly in front of sorry"), but for a book with its roots in the South -- "the land of metaphors," according to one character -- the arresting images are pretty thin on the ground, washed away by the sudsy stuff of television mini-series, in which the dialogue has to do a lot of thematic heavy lifting. But the novel's biggest problem is Melinda herself. Even though she's been moved to help people on "the receiving end of the whip" because she started life on "the wielding end," her progress from movement to movement seems so automatic and under-conflicted as to make the book's title not merely banal but untrue.
In a defense of the political novel, Robert Stone has insisted that it address two key questions: "How do social and political forces condition individual lives? How do the personal qualities of the players condition their political direction?" Miss Settle does a better job with the first than the second. Removed from great events, Melinda remains too much of a blank, especially for a character who insists that personal reasons are always the best ones.

2d Wave of Net Start-Ups Gets Venture Capital
 Venture capital is pouring into Internet companies and is now seeking a second generation of start-ups. The big winners are software start-ups seeking to make the Internet and the World Wide Web more hospitable. 
 In the first three months this year, Internet companies received more than $47 million in venture capital. If the trend continues, funds for this year may surpass $200 million, about five times as much as the $42 million Internet companies got in 1994. [Page D5.]
 
Summer Is Cable's Strong Suit
 A reliance on the repeat programs that generate summer profit has made the networks vulnerable to cable channels, which increasingly offer some of their most ambitious original programs during the summer. It's another example of how cable channels are hitting the networks where they are weakest. [D7.]
 
A Deficit at the N.R.A.
 The leaders of the National Rifle Association who took over four years ago point with pride to having increased membership and lobbied harder against gun control. Yet, the once financially strong organization has become a deficit-plagued operation, with bookkeeping so sloppy that some of its most stalwart members are alarmed. [A1.]
 
Advertiser-Agency Gap Widens
 The results of a survey on relationships between advertisers and agencies has, in psychological terms, found disorders that the most dedicated disciple of Freud might shrink from in dismay. It also indicates that the gap between the two sides is becoming a widening chasm. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D8.]
 
Papers Cutting the Meat, Too
 Newspaper publishers have been hearing that they should imitate the country's auto makers and give buyers what they want: the print equivalent of something more zippy to drive. Many newspapers seem to be cutting frills, reducing space for news and eliminating editions. These reduced expectations are dulling the personalities of the papers on America's doorsteps. William Glaberson: Media. [D7.]
 
Wood Chips to Silicon Chips
 When Hyundai Electronics recently announced that it had chosen land in the Willamette Valley of Oregon for a $1.3 billion plant, it joined an international roster of electronics companies that are rapidly transforming the region's economy from wood chips to silicon chips. [D3.]
 
Keeping Track of Those Channels
 For the estimated 70 percent of VCR owners who don't know how to program their machines, the next challenge will be figuring out what's on as the number of program choices skyrockets. With hundreds of channels coming, some viewers may soon be offered on-screen guides that are faster than the scrolling grids and can help with VCR programming as well. [D6.]
 
Hear, Hear! Better Sound Promised
 The recording "Mirror Ball," due for release tomorrow, promises superior sound quality while remaining compatible with compact disk players already in use, with technology from a tiny Berkeley-based company, Pacific Microsonics Inc. [D6.]
 
An Auto Showdown in Geneva
 Geneva, everyone's favorite neutral ground, is awash in a new vernacular. From the hushed offices of the newly created World Trade Organization, to the Japanese and American missions here, where the biggest trade showdown in modern times is unfolding this week, the talk is of shock absorbers, showrooms and "shaken," a Japanese term for car-inspection regulations that now rolls off the tongues of American negotiators as well as Japanese. [A2.]

Old Quotes Are Cheap Quotes
 Finding World Wide Web sites that offer free stock quotations is easy, but quotes are more than 15 minutes old. The delay, however, allows services like Prodigy and America Online to offer them for little or no additional charge. [D6.]

HEADLINE: Kiev to Queens: Plot Fit for Fiction;
U.S. Customs Agent Tells What It's Like to Run a Sting

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

 BODY:
The undercover man's perilous brush with disaster did not come while jumping out of a Cessna or water-skiing on the Riviera with a slinky blonde. It happened over Caesar salad with a few guys from Queens.
For months, Joseph King, an agent for the United States Customs Service, had been Joe Kennedy: Irish arms dealer, solicitor, broker for Iraq. That April day, at the Hudson River Club in lower Manhattan, "Mr. Kennedy" was deep in negotiations over black-market zirconium, used in nuclear reactors and cluster bombs, when a friend of Joe King sauntered into the restaurant. 
 Just as they were sealing the deal on a shipment to Cyprus, the friend made a beeline for their table, with a growing smile. "This could blow it all," Mr. King said he thought, ruining a chance to keep the nuclear material, apparently smuggled from the former Soviet Union, from falling into terrorist hands.
At the last minute, another agent who also knew the friend and was watching from nearby, unleashed an onslaught of eye contact and facial expressions. The friend, Mr. King said, "looks at me, looks at him, looks at me, and, thank god, he gets the message."
In Mr. King's brand of high-stakes subterfuge, some of the closest calls come over lunch.
Mr. King was the key undercover agent in a 13-month sting operation that, Federal officials say, unearthed an intricate smuggling scheme fit for a John le Carre novel: a collaborating Russian general, truckloads of zirconium leaving Kiev for Hamburg, clandestine meetings in Cyprus, Russian jet fighter parts destined for Saddam Hussein. Federal authorities say the case is the largest seizure ever of nuclear materials in the United States.
It was the capstone to a 27-year career. Last week, Mr. King retraced some of his steps in the zirconium case and spilled a few secrets about life under cover.
His was not a world of false mustaches, enchanting female spies, or men exchanging secret files on a park bench after one of them whispers: "The bluebird flies upside down in July."
While there was that time in March that a car bomb exploded near where Mr. King was meeting with the same businessmen in Cyprus, he is usually concerned about another enemy: overkill.
"This is not Inspector Clouseau," Mr. King said. "You don't wear disguises. You stray too far from what you are naturally and it blows up in your face."
So in his role of Joe Kennedy, Mr. King, whose native language is textbook Brooklynese, did not try to fake an Irish brogue. Instead, he made sure to slip words like "fortnight" into his conversation, and to write his dates backwards -- first the day, then the month, in the European style. When he scrawled the number 7 on a piece of paper, he crossed it with a line, as Europeans do. Joe Kennedy had to be an exactingly effortless replica of what the zirconium sellers expected him to be.
He drank enough to match their view of an Irishman. And from Mr. King's frequent vacations in Ireland, he finessed enough to answer questions about Dublin's pubs and the Brown Thomas department store.
Mr. King headlined a cast of agents and operatives who played metals brokers, an Italian inspector and an Iraqi finance ministry official. Other agents tailed the zirconium sellers to and from a mansion in Muttontown, L.I., a bank in Astoria, Queens, and the Golden Palace Hotel in Larnaca, Cyprus, and surreptitiously videotaped meetings with "video briefcases" or, for women, "video shoulder bags."
Things did not always go as planned. For weeks, Mr. King had to make up excuses not to meet with the men, stalling while the Customs Service bureaucracy processed a $66,000 "downpayment" on the zirconium. And three days before Federal officials were to arrest the men, one of them hopped a plane to Switzerland, forcing a delay.
All the while, Mr. King had to steer the sting to get the incriminating talk captured as evidence. It was risky business. Sting operations have been vulnerable to charges of entrapment, something already raised by a defense lawyer in the zirconium case. "In any undercover, there's certain things you have to hit -- and you should hit them on the tape," Mr. King said. "Years ago, the undercovers didn't wear tapes. An agent was believed."
Mr. King knows the drill well. A convivial man with a puckish, Newt Gingrich-like face who quotes lines from "Casablanca," Mr. King, 48, has worked an assortment of stings in his time. He played an Irish arms dealer in a 1993 plot to smuggle weapons to Iraq, for instance, and what he calls a "corrupt former C.I.A.-type" in a 1986 plan to sell jet fighters to Iran.
"I'm just a guy who can get along with everybody," said Mr. King, even his quarry, the people he calls "the bad and the ugly."
"He's schooled himself to be able to pass," said Robert Cozzolina, deputy special agent in charge of the New York Customs office. "It's the ability to size people up, know their weaknesses, what to play to and what to exploit. And the ability to feed them a line of blarney."
Mr. King always uses a different name, but not too different -- Joe Kelly or Jonathan Kingsley, names that let him wear his monogrammed shirts.
Joe Kennedy, a previous alias, was resurrected in May 1994. A tip had come in that an importer named Demetrios K. Demetrios, 40, of Long Island City, Queens, had nearly eight tons of zirconium in a warehouse in Woodside, Queens, and was said to be trying to sell it on the black market to the highest bidder.
Mr. King first had to consult Federal Department of Energy experts, to figure out "what the hell zirconium was," he said. Then, he had to dumb himself down for the role. "A businessman is not going to be a nuclear physicist," he said.
Joe Kennedy needed trappings: a company, an Irish law degree, a biography or "legend," as the spymasters call it. Customs agents searched advertisements in financial newspapers and paid about $2,500 for an Irish shell company called Celestine Financial Services. It had an office in Dublin and the virtue of having been around for a few years.
"We want something that was set up beforehand, so that if somebody checks, they can see it actually existed," said Robert Van Etten, special agent in charge of the Customs Service in New York. "We have shells all over the world. Some of them lie dormant for a while. You get information that somebody's looking for something, you snap them into action."
A phone line was set up to look like it was in Dublin; another phone and fax were registered to an Upper East Side address in Manhattan that ostensibly belonged to Joe Kennedy's assistant. All the telephones rang on the fifth floor of the Customs Service at 6 World Trade Center.
Joe Kennedy made his debut as a buyer for Iraq on July 14 at a meeting at the Marathon National Bank in Astoria, where a "metals broker" -- an informer -- introduced him to Mr. Demetrios and two other businessmen, Renos Kourtides, 55, and Constantin Zahariadis, 50. At the time, Mr. Kourtides, who has a five-acre compound in Muttontown, was president of Marathon National Bank. Several meetings took place there, but the authorities say they do not believe the bank was involved.
At that critical first meeting, the hidden tape recorder Mr. King wore under his clothing malfunctioned. "When we got back, we had nothing," Mr. King said. "It might have been weak batteries or maybe we put the tape too close to the two-way radios in the trunk of the car." In subsequent meetings, Mr. King had to "go back and say the things we said the first time."
In the next few months, over drinks in the lobby of the Vista Hotel, lunch at the River Cafe, coffee in the Galaxy Greek Pastry Shop in Astoria, and meetings in a fake office the agents set up in Queens, Mr. King drew out details.
Mr. Demetrios had an import-export business with offices in Greece and Moscow and, Mr. King said, claimed he had contact with a Russian general and connections in Chechnya.
Mr. Demetrios's contacts smuggled the zirconium from a military stockpile in the Ukrainian city of Dneprodzerzhinsk, Mr. King said. When asked, the businessmen said they might also be able to supply spare tires for Russian jet fighters, plutonium or even enriched uranium, the authorities said.
On the tapes, Mr. King and his colleagues repeatedly made clear that the goods were going to Iraq, the authorities said. The businessmen usually said they did not care who bought the zirconium, or they cautioned against openly stating that Iraq was the buyer.
Mr. King said he also made sure to get on tape a discussion about the possibility that the scheme could be infiltrated by undercover agents -- to show the businessmen knew they were doing something wrong.
In December, the crates of zirconium on their way from New York to "Iraq" were detained by the Customs Service, the authorities said, at Kennedy International Airport for what the businessmen were told was incomplete paper work. Instead of suspecting something was amiss, the businessmen arranged to have more zirconium shipped from Ukraine to Cyprus, where customs agents arranged for it to be impounded in early June, Federal authorities said.
The sting was apparently so credible, the authorities said, that Mr. Zahariadis asked if Mr. King could arrange to sell him oil from the Iraqi Government -- which, like the zirconium deal, would violate United Nations sanctions.
Three days before the authorities planned to arrest the men in early June, Mr. King said, Mr. Zahariadis went to Geneva to meet with prospective oil buyers. He returned on June 7, and Joe Kennedy met him at the airport for a briefing on the oil deal and the zirconium. Mr. King arranged to deliver $860,000 in cash as payment for the zirconium shipment.
The money was never delivered. The F.B.I. arrested the businessmen the next morning, June 8. They were charged with conspiring to sell the zirconium to Iraq in violation of United States law. Lawyers for the men have said they will plead not guilty.
Mr. King did not participate in the roundup.
"If you've dealt with somebody for a long time and they like you, it's like a slap in the face," he said. "I guess it's a little bit of honor among thieves."

HEADLINE: CLINTON ON SPOT ON VIETNAM ISSUE

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
Twenty-six years after he agonized over avoiding service in a war he "opposed and despised," President Clinton is moving toward the end of another agonizing deliberation over Vietnam: how and when to grant the former enemy full diplomatic recognition.
Most of Mr. Clinton's senior diplomatic, military, economic and political advisers favor the move as the next step in a four-year-old process begun by the Bush Administration, aimed at providing the fullest possible accounting for Americans missing from the Vietnam War and at advancing United States business interests in Southeast Asia. 
 Others, including the President, have hesitated, with Mr. Clinton said to feel that his personal history leaves him imperfectly suited to be the kind of "Nixon in China" figure with the hawkish bona fides to safely end a tortured chapter in domestic American politics and diplomacy.
The political risks are clear enough for a President who wrote a quarter century ago of his determination to "maintain my political viability within the system," while also avoiding military service short of overtly resisting the draft. But in recent weeks, White House aides have increasingly concluded that if Mr. Clinton does not move to normalize relations, his refusal will be interpreted as political and purely personal, creating other risks.
In this view, the fire the President would surely take from conservatives or veterans groups -- who do not support him in any event -- could be offset by praise from others, including decorated war veterans like Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, for taking a principled stand. These advisers point to the quick dissipation of the flurry of criticism that greeted Mr. Clinton's decision last year to lift the 19-year-old economic embargo against Vietnam.
"It's not 'if' anymore," a Presidential adviser said last week. "It's 'when.' This is not something that will be done with any great joy, but something that will be done because it's the right thing to do."
But in the Clinton White House, in particular, no decision is made until the President makes it, and it remains to be seen how Mr. Clinton will go about handling a final decision.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher has already formally recommended the move, and Defense Secretary William J. Perry supports it; the qualms of the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, were said to be lessening after a meeting of the three last week.
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown and many business executives have also strongly urged the move, arguing that it is the best way to insure American access to emerging markets in Southeast Asia. At least two of the President's longest-serving political advisers also favor the move.
On the other side are some family groups of those missing in action, and a virtual cottage industry of searchers who send missions to Vietnam and lobby for continued Government support in what Congressional critics view as a cynical and self-justifying exploitation of Americans' grief.
A vocal minority of veterans remain traumatized by the war and heavily invested in refighting it by questing after survivors or indulging in Rambo-esque flights of imagined revenge. But one Congressional aide who has worked on the issue for five years said it was an insult to the honor of the vast majority of veterans to suggest that they could not accept Washington's decision to move on.
Those who advocate recognition want Mr. Clinton to announce it by next month, and not wait until the Presidential campaign season gets any closer. There is some time pressure because Mr. Christopher is to attend a conference next month of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, known as Asean, at which Vietnam is to join the group, and Administration officials would like to have the matter settled by then.
At the same time, just after the Fourth of July Congressional recess, the Senate is expected to take up the State Department's budget authorization, and as part of that debate, two conflicting measures on Vietnam are to be offered. One is a resolution, sponsored by Mr. McCain and two other veterans, John Kerry of Massachusetts and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, both Democrats, urging recognition. The other, sponsored by Republican Senators Robert C. Smith of New Hampshire and Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, would withhold financing for any American Embassy in Vietnam.
Some advisers have suggested that the President wait for Mr. McCain's resolution, which is favored to pass, while others are urging that he get ahead of the issue by acting first, with Mr. McCain, who spent five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and went to the White House three weeks ago to urge recognition, by his side.
"I have long hoped that's what he'll do," Mr. McCain said in a telephone interview on Friday. "I told him I'd be more than glad to stand next to him while he makes the announcement."
Asked what he thought was holding up a decision, Mr. McCain said, "You know, this Administration is sometimes hard to decipher," but then quickly apologized: "That's kind of a cheap shot. I'm sure given his history, it's a very sensitive decision."
Mr. McCain, who supports normalization as the best way to provide a final accounting of Americans missing from the war, said that in their White House meeting, Mr. Clinton had not tipped his hand. The Senator also said he believed that normalization was the surest way to aid Vietnamese political reforms, and protect American security interests in the region by fostering a strong and economically stable Vietnam.
"His demeanor was one of wanting to be sure he had all the facts," Mr. McCain said. "I didn't sense either eagerness or reluctance. He just seemed to want to get the facts."
Veterans' groups are divided. The national commander in chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Allen F. Kent, a Marine Corps veteran of Vietnam, issued a statement this month saying: "If by normalizing relations with Vietnam we can further the process leading towards the fullest possible accounting, then the V.F.W. will support such a decision. If progress does not continue, we will demand the President and Congress withdraw our Ambassador and close the embassy."
But the American Legion's national commander, William M. Detweiler, wrote the President this month urging him "in the strongest possible terms," not to normalize relations. Mr. Detweiler said "only very minimal progress" had been made in the four main areas cited by Mr. Clinton in 1993 in determining the timetable for recognition.
Those areas are return of human remains, return of documents, field searches and investigations of M.I.A. cases jointly with Laos. Mr. Detweiler wrote, "The continual dribbling out of selected reports to American delegations clearly shows that Hanoi will only release information when doing so suits its own purpose."
Mr. Clinton, in remarks on Memorial Day while unveiling a new postage stamp commemorating P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s, spoke warmly of Hanoi's efforts, saying it was providing more cooperation "than ever before" and praising the overall effort to account for those missing in Vietnam. "There is nothing like it in all the history of warfare," Mr. Clinton said.
But groups representing families of the missing have complained that even the most recently released batch of about 150 documents supplied to an American delegation by the Vietnamese this spring does not amount to much, and the Pentagon's P.O.W./M.I.A. office acknowledged that the papers would not immediately resolve any outstanding cases.
Senator McCain noted that the United States spends about $100 million a year on efforts to account for the missing, and that there remain only 55 cases that offer even the slightest hope that the servicemen in question did not die at the moment of their initial loss and that might yet be resolved through cooperation with the Vietnamese.
Senator Kerrey, who lost a leg in Vietnam, said he supported Mr. Christopher's recommendation "as the best means to achieve to goal for which we went there a quarter century ago: the freedom of the Vietnamese people."
"We must return there, heads held high, and say proudly that we fought for the freedom of the Vietnamese people then and will continue to fight for it until it is achieved," Mr. Kerrey said in a statement. "Freedom is the best vehicle for promoting solid relations, both diplomatic and economic, between our peoples."

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
In Geneva, Diplomats Talk Of Mufflers, Not Warheads

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: GENEVA, June 24

 BODY:
First this was the city of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, where he spelled out the terms of the social contract from the cobblestone streets above Lake Geneva. In the 1970's it was the meeting place of the oil sheiks, when they seemed to hold the world's economy in their hands. During the cold war it was the site of endless arms control talks, when national power was measured in MIRV's and throw-weights.
Now Geneva, everyone's favorite neutral ground, is awash in a new vernacular. From the hushed offices of the newly created World Trade Organization, to the Japanese and American missions here, where the biggest trade showdown in modern times is unfolding this week, the talk is of shock absorbers, showrooms and "shaken," a Japanese term for car inspection regulations that now rolls off the tongues of American negotiators. 
 For foreign policy aficionados, this is something of a letdown; car parts never quickened Henry Kissinger's pulse. But one doesn't have to be in Geneva long to discover that divisions between America and Japan are the arms-control negotiations of the 90's.
Fortunately for anyone nostalgic for the simpler days of nuclear confrontation, much of the old terminology of arms talks lives on.
The Japanese press regularly denounces the Clinton Administration's threat to impose 100 percent tariffs on Japanese luxury cars as "massive retaliation." American officials talk of "containment" of Japan's economic practices: If the Japanese are permitted to exclude American suppliers from their market, the Administration warns, the rest of Asia will follow.
Even Ronald Reagan's favorite caution about the Soviets -- "trust, but verify" -- is still around. Just listen to Jeffrey E. Garten, the Under Secretary of Commerce for international trade, insist that any trade pact with Japan include a way to track exactly what kind of foreign parts the Japanese buy.
"As in arms control agreements, verification is going to be a crucial test of what we have negotiated," he said today.
And as in arms control, verification is no easy trick. At least in earlier days Washington had spy satellites hovering over Soviet silos. Satellites are less useful in determining the make of Mazda's mufflers. So the United States is talking about other means of verification -- numbers and more numbers.
Japan insists that the talk about "verification" is a semantic trick -- a backdoor way for Washington to establish "numerical targets" for how many American parts Japanese car makers must purchase. Tokyo rejects such targets, saying they constitute managed trade.
 
Trade Talks Cure Insomnia
 The problem with this new form of economic foreign policy is that its details are excruciatingly boring -- even to the Japanese, who love their car parts more than most.
Within 15 minutes of the first negotiating session here on Thursday, a member of the small army of Japanese bureaucrats who sit silently behind the lead negotiators fell sound asleep. Within an hour, two more had gone under.
"One of them had his head at a complete right angle to his body," an American official who was watching with some amazement recalled.
They were all rudely awakened in mid-afternoon, when the chair under one of the American staff members collapsed, sending him crashing to the floor.
 
Tokyo Leadership Mystery
 It's not just the Americans who are having a tough time figuring out who is running things these days in Tokyo -- and thus, who will be calling the shots as the negotiations develop. The Japanese are having the same problem.
The other day, one of Tokyo's most powerful bureaucrats, Osamu Watanabe, tripped up while engaging in a great tradition of Japanese negotiations: An endless recitation of the history of the talks thus far.
"At that point, our Foreign Minister declared . . .," he said, his voice trailing off. "You know, I don't even remember who the Foreign Minister was at the time." After all sides recovered from a long burst of laughter, his boss, Yoshihiro Sakamoto, Japan's Vice Minister of International Trade and Industry, tripped him up again.
"I asked him if he could remember who the Prime Minister is," Mr. Sakamoto recalled, relishing the memory with a grin. "And he didn't say a word."
For the record, the Prime Minister is Tomiichi Murayama, but no one maintains that he plays anything but a bit role in resolving the car dispute. "Oh no," one experienced political hand said recently in Tokyo. "This is a major issue for the national economy. It is far too important to leave to Mr. Murayama."

HEADLINE: Warren E. Burger Is Dead at 87; Was Chief Justice for 17 Years

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
Warren E. Burger, who retired in 1986 after 17 years as the 15th Chief Justice of the United States, died here today at age 87. The cause was congestive heart failure, a spokeswoman for the Supreme Court said.
An energetic court administrator, Chief Justice Burger was in some respects a transitional figure despite his tenure, the longest for a Chief Justice in this century. He presided over a Court that, while it grew steadily more conservative with subsequent appointments, nonetheless remained strongly influenced by the legacy of his liberal predecessor, Chief Justice Earl Warren. The constitutional right to abortion and the validity of busing as a remedy for school segregation were both established during Chief Justice Burger's tenure, and with his support. 
 The country knew Chief Justice Burger as a symbol before it knew much about him as a man or a judge.
He was President Richard M. Nixon's first Supreme Court nominee, and Mr. Nixon had campaigned on a pledge to find "strict constructionists" and "practitioners of judicial restraint" who would turn back the activist tide that the Court had built under Chief Justice Warren, its leader since 1953.
The nomination on May 21, 1969, immediately made Mr. Burger, a white-haired, 61-year-old Federal appeals court judge, a lightning rod for those who welcomed as well as those who feared the end of an era of judicial activism.
It was a central contradiction of Mr. Burger's tenure as Chief Justice that long after he became one of the most visible and, in many ways, innovative Chief Justices in history he remained, for many people, the symbol of retrenchment that Mr. Nixon had presented to the public on nominating him.
In fact, the Supreme Court in the Burger years was in its way as activist as the Court that preceded it, creating new constitutional doctrine in areas like the right to privacy, due process and sexual equality that the Warren Court had only hinted at.
"All in all," one Supreme Court scholar, A. E. Dick Howard, wrote in the Wilson Quarterly in 1981, "the Court is today more of a center for the resolution of social issues than it has ever been before."
While there were some substantial changes of emphasis, the Burger Court -- a label liberals tended to apply like an epithet -- overruled no major decisions from the Warren era.
It was a further incongruity that despite Chief Justice Burger's high visibility and the evident relish with which he used his office to expound his views on everything from legal education to prison management, scholars and Supreme Court commentators continued to question the degree to which he actually led the institution over which he so energetically presided.
His important opinions for the Court included the decision that validated busing as a tool for school desegregation, the one that struck down the "legislative veto" used by Congress for 50 years to block executive branch actions, and the one that spurred President Nixon's resignation in 1974 by forcing him to turn over White House tape recordings for use in the Watergate investigations. Yet Chief Justice Burger was just as often in dissent on major decisions. In that, he differed from Chief Justice Warren, who voted with the majority in nearly all important cases.
Those seeking to identify the sources of intellectual leadership on the Court usually pointed to William H. Rehnquist, another Nixon appointee to whom Chief Justice Burger assigned many important opinions, and to William J. Brennan Jr., the Court's most senior and, with Thurgood Marshall, most liberal member.
As the senior Associate Justice, Justice Brennan had the right to assign the opinion in any case in which he was in the majority and the Chief Justice was in dissent, and he often exercised that prerogative by assigning major opinions to himself, particularly in the area of individual rights.
As the years passed, Chief Justice Burger seemed to assign himself the opinions in relatively straightforward and uncontroversial cases, avoiding those in which the Court was deeply split and in which it would have required considerable effort to marshal or hold a fragile majority. As a result, his personal imprint on the Court's jurisprudence was not always readily identifiable.
 
An Innovator In Administration
 But his imprint was distinct in the area to which he gave his most sustained attention, judicial administration.
Mr. Burger liked to say that he took his title seriously. He was Chief Justice of the United States, not just of the Supreme Court, and he took as his mandate the stewardship of the entire judicial system, state as well as Federal.
An array of institutions were created under his aegis, including the National Center for State Courts, the Institute for Court Management and the National Institute of Corrections. The common purpose of those organizations was to improve the education and training of participants in nearly all phases of the judicial process, whether judges, court clerks or prison guards.
The Chief Justice turned the small Federal Judicial Center, for which he served by statute as chairman of the board, into a major center for research and publishing about the courts.
He believed that judges could be helped to be more efficient if professional management techniques were imported to the courts, from clerks' offices to judges' chambers. The Institute for Court Management set up a six-month program for training court managers and administrators.
The Supreme Court itself became one of the first fully computerized courts in the country; in 1981, the Justices all received computer terminals on which to compose their opinions.
The Chief Justice campaigned tirelessly for better pay for judges, better education for lawyers and help for the Court's ever-growing caseload. From his earliest years in office, he warned that the Federal courts and the Supreme Court in particular were becoming dangerously overworked.
In 1983, he asked Congress to create an appellate panel that could relieve some of the Supreme Court's caseload by resolving conflicting opinions among the Federal appeals courts.
 
Many Admirers, But Detractors as Well
 Judges and others interested in these long-ignored administrative issues responded with gratitude. One of the Chief Justice's warmest admirers on the Federal bench was Frank M. Johnson Jr., a Federal appeals court judge from Alabama who won praise from civil rights advocates for his orders on prison issues and other rulings.
"Warren Burger has redefined the nature of his office," Judge Johnson wrote in the early 1980's. "He has concentrated his energy not simply on exploring the subtleties of constitutional doctrine but on reforming the mechanics of American justice. More than any of his 14 predecessors, he has invested the prestige of the Chief Justiceship in efforts to make the American judicial system function more efficiently. He has used his position not as an excuse to withdraw from public affairs but as an opportunity to furnish public leadership."
But the priority that Chief Justice Burger assigned to administration also had its detractors, who complained that he trivialized his office by emphasizing the mechanics of justice at the expense of its substance.
Occasionally, too, his enthusiastic lobbying was seen as overbearing by those at whom it was directed. In 1978, for example, he became deeply involved in the effort in Congress to overhaul the bankruptcy system.
One Democratic senator, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, whose subcommittee had jurisdiction over the bill, complained publicly that a "very, very irate and rude" Chief Justice had telephoned him to object to a legislative development and "not only lobbied but pressured and attempted to be intimidating."
The Chief Justice could also be rather intimidating from the bench, particularly when a relatively inexperienced lawyer was arguing a position with which Mr. Burger disagreed. While Chief Justice Warren's favorite question from the bench was, "Yes, but was it fair?" Chief Justice Burger often asked: "Yes, but why is this case in the courts? Isn't this a matter for the Legislature to address?"
 
Working to Limit The Judiciary's Scope
 Chief Justice Burger believed in a limited role for the courts and reserved some of his sharpest criticism for those who looked to them to resolve social and political problems that, in his view, were not the province of judges. "If we get the notion that courts can cure all injustices, we're barking up the wrong tree," he liked to say.
A speech he gave while he was still a judge on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia provided a useful summary of the view he held throughout his career: "That courts encounter some problems for which they can supply no solution is not invariably an occasion for regret or concern. This is an essential limitation in a system of divided power."
Some of the more important decisions while he was Chief Justice were those that limited litigants' access to Federal court by using the doctrines of standing, mootness and deference to state courts.
He seemed to regard suits for small monetary stakes as a waste of judges' time, and many of his speeches complained about the disproportionate cost to the system of trying the lawsuits brought by prisoners or consumers over modest losses of money or property.
His questioning of one lawyer, who argued in 1982 on behalf of 168,000 consumers, each with a claim for $7.98 against the Gillette Company, was the talk of the Court for weeks. "What is the economic justification for this kind of lawsuit in the Federal courts under any circumstances?" the Chief Justice demanded.
"We are in state court, judge, in this case," the lawyer, Robert S. Atkins, replied.
"In state or Federal court?" the Chief Justice persisted.
"The problem," Mr. Atkins said, "is that if you cheat people a little bit but do it a lot, you can go free ----"
The Chief Justice interrupted to interrogate him about the proportion of the recovery that would go for legal fees.
 
Inviting Attention, Some of the Time
 Chief Justice Burger's effort to police the moral character of lawyers who sought to become eligible to argue before the Court rankled some of the other Justices and in 1982 provided a rare public glimpse of internal disagreements over the Chief Justice's administrative approach.
He singled out several applicants by name and accused them of seeking membership in the Supreme Court bar to "launder" tarnished credentials. But he failed to persuade a majority of the Court to block the admissions and provoked one Justice, John Paul Stevens, to write that the Court should grant applicants with questionable credentials a "fair hearing" before publicly labeling them as unworthy.
There were contradictory strains in Chief Justice Burger's attitude toward the public, including the press. At times he seemed to welcome and even invite public attention. He took pride in having made the Supreme Court a more attractive place for tourists to visit, transforming the cold marble ground floor into an area for historical exhibits.
Yet he alone of all the Justices refused, when announcing one of his opinions from the bench, to provide tourists and lawyers in the audience with a brief oral description of the case and the decision.
The other Justices either read aloud from a memorandum explaining the case or gave a more casual oral account. When the Chief Justice's turn came, he would simply announce that in a case with a particular name, the judgment of the lower court was affirmed, or reversed. When asked why he refused to join the others in explaining his opinions, he once said, "It's a waste of time."
He was adamant about preserving the secrecy of the Court's internal operations, even to the extent of refusing to make public the names of his four law clerks. A law firm recruiter or other member of the public who called the Court's public information office seeking a list of the current law clerks would receive the names of all the clerks except the Chief Justice's.
He mailed copies of his speeches to hundreds of journalists around the country and would telephone particular columnists to make sure his message was clear.
 
Defining the Limits Of Speech and Press
 Occasionally, usually in connection with his annual "State of the Judiciary" address to the American Bar Association, a tradition that he inaugurated, he would invite journalists for informal "deep background" briefings, sessions that were often relaxed and informative.
But he seemed to hold much of the press corps in low repute. Asked by a lawyer at a Smithsonian Institution symposium what he thought of the reporters who covered the Court, he replied, as he often did: "I admire those who do a good job, and I have sympathy for the rest, who are in the majority."
Special scorn was reserved for television, which he regarded as an intrusive annoyance. He once knocked a television camera out of the hand of a network cameraman who followed him into an elevator. He vowed that he would never allow oral arguments at the Supreme Court to be televised.
Yet he wrote the opinion for the Court in the 1981 case Chandler v. Florida, holding that a state could permit a criminal trial to be televised, even over the defendant's objection, without depriving the defendant of the constitutional right to a fair trial.
Chief Justice Burger wrote several of the Court's most important opinions interpreting the free speech and free press guarantees of the First Amendment.
His opinion in a 1976 case, Nebraska Press v. Stuart, effectively prohibited judges from ordering the press not to publish information in its possession about a crime, a confession or the like. The opinion said that judges could take less drastic steps to protect criminal defendants from negative pretrial publicity, like sequestering the jury or changing the site of the trial.
A 1973 opinion by the Chief Justice ended roughly 15 years of turmoil over the legal definition of obscenity by changing the focus to local communities, rather than the entire country.
That opinion, in Miller v. California, said obscene materials were "works which, taken as a whole, appeal to the prurient interest in sex, which portray sexual conduct in a patently offensive way and which, taken as a whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value." The Chief Justice added that it was up to local juries applying "contemporary community standards" to decide whether a particular work fit that definition.
"It is neither realistic nor constitutionally sound to read the First Amendment as requiring that the people of Maine or Mississippi accept public depiction of conduct found tolerable in Las Vegas or New York City," he wrote. "People in different states vary in their tastes and attitudes, and this diversity is not to be strangled by the absolutism of imposed uniformity."
 
Religion, Rights And Veto Power
 Chief Justice Burger was also one of the Court's most prolific writers on another aspect of the First Amendment, the clause prohibiting establishment of an official national religion. In a 1971 opinion, Lemon v. Kurtzman, he set forth the test for deciding whether a given law or government program that conferred some benefit on religion nonetheless passed muster under the First Amendment.
"First," he wrote, "the statute must have a secular legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion; finally, the statute must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion." This "three-part test," as it came to be known through later refinements and elaborations, defined the Court's approach to the establishment clause in a variety of contexts.
The 1983 decision that struck down the legislative veto, Immigration Service v. Chadha, altered the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches.
It invalidated a procedure, which Congress had incorporated into some 200 laws, permitting one or both houses to block executive branch action. The procedure, Chief Justice Burger wrote, was not within Congress's constitutional authority because it did not follow the rules the Constitution set out for "legislation": passage by both houses and presentment to the President for his signature.
The Chadha opinion in many ways summarized the Chief Justice's view of American Government. He wrote, "With all the obvious flaws of delay, untidiness and potential for abuse, we have not yet found a better way to preserve freedom than by making the exercise of power subject to the carefully crafted restraints spelled out in the Constitution."
Chief Justice Burger wrote relatively few of the Court's criminal law decisions, and some of the more important decisions on the rights of criminal suspects found him in bitter dissent.
For example, in the 1977 case Brewer v. Williams the Court ruled, in a 5-to-4 opinion by Justice Potter Stewart, that the police had violated a murder suspect's constitutional right to counsel. The police officers, knowing that the suspect was deeply religious, delivered what came to be called the Christian burial speech, musing aloud on the wish of the victim's parents to give their daughter a Christian burial. The suspect, who had previously said he would talk only after seeing a lawyer, then led the officers to the victim's body.
The majority's decision overturning the murder conviction was "bizarre," the Chief Justice wrote in a dissent that was a stinging attack on the so-called exclusionary rule barring the use at trial of illegally seized evidence.
"The result reached by the Court in this case ought to be intolerable in any society which purports to call itself an organized society," he said. "Failure to have counsel in a pretrial setting should not lead to the 'knee-jerk' suppression of relevant and reliable evidence."
 
A Conservative On Crime Issues
 The Chief Justice dissented from the Court's 1972 decision that invalidated all death penalty laws then in force. After the Court permitted executions to resume four years later, the Chief Justice grew increasingly impatient with the legal obstacles that lawyers and judges continued to place in the way of executions.
When the Court refused to block the execution of a murderer whose appeals had lasted 10 years, Chief Justice Burger wrote a concurring opinion excoriating lawyers for condemned inmates. He said the lawyers sought to turn the administration of justice into a "sporting contest."
Although Chief Justice Burger's views on criminal law did not always garner a majority on the Supreme Court, those views had probably been more responsible for his being nominated to the High Court than any other factor.
In 13 years on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, he was known as a conservative, law-and-order judge. He enhanced that reputation with speeches and articles. A speech in 1967 at Ripon College in Wisconsin came to Richard Nixon's attention after it was reprinted in U.S. News & World Report.
The White House distributed copies of the speech at the time of Judge Burger's nomination, and the Supreme Court press office handed it out for years when asked for information about his views. In the speech, he compared the American system of justice with the systems of Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands.
"I assume that no one will take issue with me when I say that these North European countries are as enlightened as the United States in the value they place on the individual and on human dignity," he said.
Yet, he continued, those countries "do not consider it necessary to use a device like our Fifth Amendment, under which an accused person may not be required to testify."
"They go swiftly, efficiently and directly to the question of whether the accused is guilty," he added.
"No nation on earth," he said, "goes to such lengths or takes such pains to provide safeguards as we do, once an accused person is called before the bar of justice and until his case is completed."
 
A Modest Start In Minnesota
 Chief Justice Burger's speechmaking style changed little in subsequent years. He often returned to the theme and imagery of the Ripon speech and often used the Scandinavian countries, which he visited frequently, as benchmarks against which to compare the American system.
Warren Earl Burger was born Sept. 17, 1907, in St. Paul. His parents, of Swiss-German descent, were Charles Joseph Burger and the former Katharine Schnittger. His paternal grandfather, Joseph Burger, emigrated from Switzerland and joined the Union Army at the start of the Civil War, when he was 14. He was severely wounded in combat and received both a battlefield commission and the Medal of Honor.
Warren Burger was one of seven children. The family lived on a 20-acre truck farm on the outskirts of St. Paul. In addition to farming, his father sold weighing scales; the family's financial circumstances were modest.
At John A. Johnson High School, from which Warren Burger graduated in 1925, he edited the school newspaper, was president of the student council and earned letters in hockey, football, track and swimming. He earned extra money by selling articles on high school sports and other news to the St. Paul newspapers.
The rest of his formal education took place in night school while he worked days selling insurance for the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York. He attended the night school division of the University of Minnesota for two years, then began night law classes at the St. Paul College of Law, now known as the William Mitchell College of Law. He received his degree with high honors in 1931.
He joined the faculty of the law school and taught for 12 years while practicing law with the firm of Boyesen, Otis & Faricy. He remained with the firm, one of the oldest in the state, for 22 years; after he became a partner, the firm was known as Faricy, Burger, Moore & Costello. He handled probate, trial and appellate cases, arguing more than a dozen before the United States Supreme Court and many more in the Minnesota Supreme Court.
He married Elvera Stromberg in 1933. They had a son, Wade Allen, and a daughter, Margaret Elizabeth.
As a young lawyer, Mr. Burger became active in community affairs. He was president of the Junior Chamber of Commerce and the first president of the St. Paul Council on Human Relations. That group, which he helped to organize, sponsored training programs for the police to improve relations with minority groups. For many years, he was a member of the Governor's Interracial Commission.
He also became involved in state politics, working on Harold E. Stassen's successful campaign for governor. He went to the 1948 Republican National Convention to help Governor Stassen's unsuccessful bid for the Presidential nomination.
 
Making the Move To Washington
 In 1952, he was at the Republican convention again, still a Stassen supporter. But he helped Dwight D. Eisenhower's forces win a crucial credentials fight against Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio. On the final day, with General Eisenhower lacking nine votes for the nomination, Mr. Burger helped swing the Minnesota delegation and gave Eisenhower the votes that put him over the top. Cheers broke out on the convention floor as an organ played the University of Minnesota fight song.
His reward was a job in Washington, as Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Division of the Justice Department. He supervised all the Federal Government's civil and international litigation. He told a young Justice Department lawyer years later that he would have been content to continue running the Civil Division for the rest of his career.
One of his assignments was somewhat unusual for the Civil Division chief. He agreed to argue a case in the Supreme Court, usually the task of the Solicitor General's Office. The case involved a Yale University professor of medicine, John F. Peters, who had been discharged on loyalty grounds from his job as a part-time Federal health consultant.
The Solicitor General, Simon E. Soboloff, disagreed with the Government's position that the action by the Civil Service Commission's Loyalty Review Board was valid and refused to sign the brief or argue the case. Mr. Burger argued on behalf of the board and lost. Among the lawyers who filed briefs on the professor's behalf were two who would precede Mr. Burger on the Supreme Court, Abe Fortas and Arthur J. Goldberg.
After two years, Mr. Burger resigned from the Justice Department, and he was preparing to return to private practice in St. Paul when Judge Harold Stephens of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit died. President Eisenhower nominated him for the vacancy, and he joined the court in 1956.
His elevation to the Supreme Court 13 years later was made possible by President Lyndon B. Johnson's failure to persuade the Senate to accept Abe Fortas as Chief Justice.
 
A Beneficiary Of the 1968 Election
 On June 13, 1968, Earl Warren had announced his intention to resign after 15 years as Chief Justice. President Johnson nominated Mr. Fortas, then an Associate Justice, as Chief Justice. But the nomination became a victim of the 1968 Presidential election campaign and was withdrawn on Oct. 2, the fourth day of a Senate filibuster that followed acrimonious confirmation hearings.
Chief Justice Warren agreed to delay his retirement, and it was clear that whoever won the Presidential election would choose the next Chief Justice. Justice Fortas remained on the Court until May 1969, when he resigned after the disclosure that he had accepted a $20,000 fee from a foundation controlled by Louis E. Wolfson, a friend and former client who was under Federal investigation for violating securities laws.
On May 21, a week after the Fortas resignation, President Nixon nominated Mr. Burger to be Chief Justice. The nomination went smoothly in the Senate, and he was sworn in as Chief Justice on June 23, 1969.
The Chief Justice and his wife lived in a renovated pre-Civil War farmhouse on several acres in McLean, Va. According to the annual financial disclosure statements required of all Federal judges, he had assets of more than $1 million. His largest investment was the common stock of the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company.
He was a gardener and a serious wine enthusiast who took pride in his wine cellar and occasionally sponsored wine-tasting dinners at the Supreme Court.
By statute, the Chief Justice is Chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution and chairman of the board of trustees of the National Gallery of Art, duties that, as an art and history buff, he enjoyed. He visited antiques stores to look for good pieces for the Court and took an active role in the Supreme Court Historical Society.
He and his wife led an active social life in Washington and spent part of nearly every summer in Europe, usually in connection with a conference or other official appearance.
Chief Justice Burger cut an imposing figure, and it was often said that he looked like Hollywood's image of a Chief Justice. He was nearly six feet tall, stocky but not heavy, with regular features, a square jaw and silvery hair.
Proper appearance was important to him. He once sent a note to the Solicitor General's Office complaining that a Deputy Solicitor General had worn a vest the wrong shade of gray with the formal morning attire required of Government lawyers who argue before the Court.
In 1976, he appeared at a Bicentennial commemoration in a billowing robe with scarlet trim, a reproduction of the robe worn by the first Chief Justice, John Jay. He later put the robe on display in the Court's exhibit area.
A book by Chief Justice Burger, "It Is So Ordered" (William Morrow), was published earlier this year. It is an account of 14 cases that helped shaped the interpretation of the Constitution.
Mr. Burger's wife died in May 1994. He is survived by his son, of Arlington, Va.; his daughter, of Washington, and two grandchildren. Funeral arrangements were incomplete today.

HEADLINE: When Digital Doesn't Always Mean Clear

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

 BODY:
Few mantras are more powerful in the information economy than the word "digital." Digital CD recordings are sharp and clean. Digital television is expected to be cinematic, interactive and free of ghosts. Digital culture, blossoming over the Internet, is arguably the social trend of the moment.
But digital cellular telephones, introduced in many markets with great fanfare over the last year, are not any of those. 
 Far from producing the clear sound that lured millions of music lovers to compact disks, the first crop of digital cellular phones has produced a litany of complaints about poor sound quality and unreliability. Several big companies, chastened by criticism, have quietly retreated from promotional efforts while they scramble to work out the bugs.
Outside technology experts say the problem is deeper than just fine tuning, and reflects an issue that eludes many consumers: The industry's drive toward digital phones has little to do with improving quality and everything to do with money.
Digital technology reduces costs and can sharply increase profit. But in an effort to get the maximum number of telephone conversations onto a single radio channel, they say, the companies have been trading off quality to gain capacity.
So far, the trade isn't selling very well.
A frequent complaint is that people can sound as if they are under water, burbling and gurgling. Others say that voices are hard to recognize, sometimes to the point that male and female voices cannot be distinguished. "Drop-offs" -- being cut off in mid-sentence -- have been at least as bad, and often worse than with traditional phones in some cities, according to dealers and consumers.
"All fluff and no substance," remarked Ronald Cain, president of Cain Security Systems in Fairfax, Va., who decided against replacing 30 traditional analog units after he tried new digital models. Mike Ross, a communications engineer in Sacramento, gave up his digital phone several months ago after losing scores of calls and being plagued by echo-chamber sound effects.
"Improving sound quality was never the reason for moving to digital technology," said Ira Brodsky, president of Datacomm Research in Wilmette, Ill. "The primary reason for going digital was to increase capacity, because it lets you carry at least three times as many customers over a single channel."
Assuming that companies work out the worst flaws of digital technology, Mr. Brodsky added, consumers would be mistaken to expect a dramatic improvement in the fidelity of sound. "The only reason for going digital is if your cellular carrier is offering you a substantial discount," Mr. Brodsky said bluntly. "There is no other reason."
In many markets, digital cellular phones are turning out to be a headache. Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, a unit of SBC Communications and one of the biggest cellular carriers in the country, has backed away from a multimedia promotion campaign in several big cities. Bell Atlantic, which rolled out digital service about a year ago, has stopped all promotion and is switching to an alternative digital technology.
McCaw Cellular Communications, the AT&T unit that is the nation's biggest cellular telephone provider, is still heavily promoting digital service and has signed up 400,000 of its 4.4 million subscribers. But it has done so offering 40 percent discounts.
Moreover, some of the phones themselves have had defects. Late last month, Motorola recalled a wide range of its digital models to fix a software glitch that created the echo-chamber effect.
"The system just wasn't adequate and the phones had problems, major problems," said Mike Anastasia, president of the Corporate Communications Service in Falls Church, Va., which sells and installs wireless car phones for corporate customers. "If I sell 10 phones and 8 come back, you know you've got a problem."
Cellular-industry executives acknowledge that digital phones are an evolving technology and say they are remedying the defects. "There is no doubt this is a technology in transition and you will have growing pains," said Nick Kauser, McCaw's chief technical officer.
All of this has had the effect of throwing more kerosene into a pitched battle in the wireless industry between two rival technologies for digital service, a fight reminiscent of the 1970's struggle between Betamax and VHS for supremacy in the videocassette business.
Cellular companies are split over which technology is best, and no one wants to invest hundreds of millions of dollars building networks around a technological framework that equipment companies might abandon.
The only standard currently available, one that is being pushed hard by McCaw and Southwestern Bell, is called T.D.M.A. -- time division multiple access.
Most big carriers, including five of the regional Bell companies, are holding out for what they say will be a newer and better technology -- called C.D.M.A., or code division multiple access, which has been years behind schedule but could become available in some markets later this year.
The key to both systems is aggressive compression technology, which boils sounds into the smallest possible trickle of data.
Like a compact disk player, a digital telephone system breaks up sound into millions of tiny samples and encodes each one as a series of ones and zeroes. Once encoded, the data can be reconstructed later into audible sound. The difference between cellular phones and CD players, however, is in the amount of data used to capture a single sound.
In reproducing the full resonance of an orchestra or rock band, a CD player scans 44,000 digital sound samples a second -- more than 300,000 bits of data a second. By contrast, T.D.M.A. digital cellular systems process about 1,000 samples or 8,000 bits of data a second. C.D.M.A. systems are expected to process as much as 13,000 bits a second, though their average processing rates are lower.
Industry executives say they are confident that digital technology will become popular as it matures. "The progress is good," said John T. Stupka, president of Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems. "My best guess is that digital will be the product of choice some time in 1996."
Executives at Air Touch Communications in San Francisco, which is planning to fire up the country's first commercial C.D.M.A. system later this summer, said their newer technology would eliminate many complaints by offering better filters against background noise, better error correction and smoother transitions as callers move around a city. "This will give consumers much better sound quality and better service," said Amy Damianakis, a spokeswoman for Air Touch.
But there are embarrassments. Mr. Kauser, McCaw's chief technical officer, found himself cut off repeatedly by loud blasts of static the other day, just as he was defending digital phones while talking over one.
"I don't know what that was," he said in frustration. "Maybe a reflection off a building. Remember, we have not dominated wireless to the point where we can guard against everything."

HEADLINE: Only Defendant to Fight Charge in NASA Case Wins Sympathy

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, June 25

 BODY:
The only person to demand a trial on charges from a 19-month Federal investigation into bribery and kickbacks involving NASA contracts has won the sympathy of many in this city where the Johnson Manned Space Flight Center has long been a bulwark of the local economy and ego.
Many people here say the Government went too far in trying to expose corruption among officials and contractors at the space center. 
 "The Government used reprehensible tactics," said John Crenshaw, an aerospace consultant who became entangled in the inquiry but was not indicted. "They bullied people and then violated their civil rights."
At issue in the trial is whether the defendant, Dale Brown, a former financial officer of a small contracting company, gave $500 to an agent posing as an associate of an Army procurement official to try to win a Government contract, as prosecutors contend, or as a result of an abusive undercover operation that confused him to such a degree that he felt he had to make the payment to save his company.
Unlike 12 others, including his former partner, who made plea agreements after being charged in the F.B.I.'s 19-month investigation, Mr. Brown pleaded not guilty to one count of bribery. If convicted of giving the $500 to the agent to win the contract, Mr. Brown could be sentenced to 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Final arguments and a decision by the jury of eight women and four men are expected early this week.
Looking bruised but unrepentant, Mr. Brown testified in Federal District Court here that an undercover F.B.I. agent posing as a rich Atlanta investor all but took over his company, Space Inc., with grandiose promises of financing its pursuit of NASA contracts.
As testimony came to a close on Thursday, Mr. Brown's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, whose clients have included the Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, moved for an immediate acquittal on the ground of entrapment, arguing that Mr. Brown was a victim of "outrageous Government conduct." The judge said he would rule on the motion on Monday.
Mr. Brown's defense has characterized the investigators as luring NASA officials and contractors by using such tactics as having an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Hal Francis, assume the identity of John Clifford, who was supposed to be the director of a company seeking contacts with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Testifying for the Government, the majority owner of Mr. Brown's company, Leonard Neal Jackson, told how Mr. Francis bought 49 percent of the company in March 1992 and began paying its expenses.
In January 1993, Mr. Francis suddenly stopped paying the two men's salaries, complaining that Space Inc. had failed to win any contracts. Laying out a final demand, the undercover agent said he would stop paying the firm's expenses unless Mr. Brown and Mr. Jackson won a contract at a Pennsylvania arsenal. In a taped conversation, the agent says paying the money is "something that could make or break Space Inc. -- get it done."
Under cross-examination, Mr. Jackson, who pleaded guilty in September to one count of bribery and conspiracy, told how a loyal Mr. Brown agreed to make the payoff for him. In the most emotional testimony in the two-week trial, Mr. Jackson broke down on the stand saying that he entered a guilty plea so the Government would agree not to indict his wife, Karen, who was officially the owner of Space Inc.
"I couldn't face not paying $500 in entertainment money to let everything go down the drain," Mr. Jackson said. "Since I didn't know what would happen to my child, I felt I didn't have a choice." Although Mr. Jackson signed a plea agreement in September, the sentence he receives is contingent on his assistance to the prosecutors.
The Government contended that Mr. Brown was an aggressive ladder-climber well aware he was bribing a Government official. During cross-examination, an assistant United States Attorney, Ed Gallagher, asserted that Mr. Brown had prepared falsified financial statements for his company and agreed to be paid his salary in cash to avoid paying taxes. Mr. Gallagher argued that Mr. Brown was predisposed to commit a crime and that the Government merely "extended opportunities" for him to violate the law.
The defendant's supporters say the targets of the 19-month investigation were top NASA administrators, not small contractors. The investigation did not lead to charges against any top officials.

HEADLINE: Magazines Go Niche-Hunting With Custom-Made Sections

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY 

 BODY:
In their continuing search for new revenue sources, magazine publishers are increasingly customizing their editorial content for specialized groups of readers.
The publishers are using a technique known as selective edit, in which special editorial sections are inserted into magazines sent to targeted lists of subscribers. Publishers can then charge these subscribers more and raise ad rates for advertisers who want to reach the readers. 
 "I remain optimistic about it as the primary vehicle for those of us who are providing magazines at this point," Norman Pearlstine, editor in chief of Time Inc., told a group of magazine executives recently.
These sections, which are generated by the editorial side of the publications, differ from "advertorial" sections that are provided by advertisers and inserted into magazines.
Last fall, Sports Illustrated, a Time Inc. magazine, introduced N.F.L.-Plus, a four-page insert bound into some copies during the football season. About 800,000 subscribers paid an extra $5.20 a year for inserts about their favorite divisions or teams. A Seattle Seahawks fan living in New Jersey, for instance, was able to request more detailed coverage of the team than was available in the regular magazine.
Sports Illustrated introduced its first selective-edit section, Golf Plus, in January 1994. The magazine sent direct-response questionnaires to all its subscribers, after which the publication was able to identify 400,000 hard-core golfers and learn about their playing habits, golf equipment and other juicy tidbits dear to the hearts of advertisers.
These subscribers now receive at no extra cost a 16-page Golf Plus insert every week from January to September, with occasional inserts the rest of the year. Unlike N.F.L.-Plus, which derives its revenue from subscribers who pay an extra fee, Golf Plus is supported by advertisers who hope golf fanatics read ads as intently as articles.
Selective edit is similar to selective binding, a technique that has been used for years for zoned advertising inserts. Car companies, for instance, advertise their most expensive models in copies going to high-income zip codes. Ads for less expensive cars appear in copies going to less affluent neighborhoods.
Among the reasons for selective edit are to strengthen circulation, increase subscription renewals and cut down on the expense of attracting new readers. Mr. Pearlstine said most of the revenue growth at Sports Illustrated, which has a circulation of 3.15 million, had come as a result of selective-edit sections.
An executive at Time Inc., a division of Time Warner, said subscribers getting Golf Plus had a 15 percent higher renewal rate than readers who did not receive the insert.
"We spent a couple of million dollars," David L. Long, publisher of Sports Illustrated, said about the investment in Golf Plus, "In its first year it was profitable. We made money and all costs were recouped."
The magazine is looking at other possibilities, including inserts for fans of hunting, basketball, hockey, tennis and auto racing. The project is on hold, however, until after the 1996 Summer Olympics.
Money, another Time Inc. magazine, may introduce selective edit next year, though it has not decided which subjects are appropriate or if the sections will be subscriber-driven or advertiser-driven.
Child magazine, which has a data base that includes the birth dates of the children of its subscribers, sends its readers monthly editorial inserts pegged to the ages of their children. Jayne Jamison, group publisher at Gruner & Jahr, the unit of Bertelsmann A.G. that owns Child, said renewals had increased 5 percent since the sections began in 1993.
In 1992 Newsweek introduced four eight-page editorial sections to increase circulation revenue during the advertising recession, but dropped the project after a year. Last year Newsweek reintroduced sections on money and science into the regular magazine after advertisers expressed interest.
In the process, Newsweek learned a lot about what its readers were willing to pay -- or not pay -- for.
"It was probably one of our most successful internal research studies," said Greg Osberg, vice president and general publisher.
 
Customized Content
 In 1993 Sports Illustrated sent all of its subscribers a questionnaire about golf habits. The response enabled the magazine to identify 400,000 hard-core golfers and to develop a special editorial insert for them called Golf Plus. The 16-page section is placed in the middle of the magazine and marked with green bars at the top of each page. Golf ball icons are scattered throughout the section as well.

The Italy We Want?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOLOGNA, Italy

 BODY:
In the transformed politics of Italy the newest voice is that of Prof. Romano Prodi, leader of a center-left coalition. His is a politics of ideas -- ideas that do not fit neatly into old notions of left and right.
"We need competition, privatization, decentralization," Professor Prodi said in an interview. That is a prescription for sharp change in a country with a tradition of state ownership of business and national bureaucratic regulation. And the ideas have a resonance beyond Italy. 
 "When you have people who are intelligent, free and independent," Professor Prodi said, passion in his voice, "you can't direct them from the center. It's a problem everywhere in the world. When China grows up, you'll see what the regions do to Beijing!"
A professor of economics at the University of Bologna, Mr. Prodi went on a leave of absence just four months ago to create and lead the Committee for the Italy We Want. It is not a party but an umbrella group supported by, among others, elements of the old Christian Democrats and the more liberal former Communists.
The newly formed group astonished the experts by dominating regional and provincial elections this spring. When Italy has a national election, perhaps as early as October, Professor Prodi will be the main alternative to Silvio Berlusconi, the tycoon turned politician, as prime minister.
The election will likely offer a choice between two broad coalitions instead of the many parties that have marked Italian politics for 50 years. "We would be like the rest of Europe," Professor Prodi said. "That's why I went into politics -- for normality."
He is an academic who has met a payroll. In 1982 he was called in to rescue Italy's largest publicly owned company, IRI, which was near bankruptcy. In seven years as chairman he turned it to profit, shedding more than a fifth of its 550,000 employees and selling off steel and banking and automobile subsidiaries.
His emphasis on market competition and decentralization may sound to Americans like Newt Gingrich, but there is a great difference. He wants to make government more effective, not destroy it.
For example, while Republicans in the U.S. Congress are slashing funds for education and scientific research, Professor Prodi makes improvement in those areas his first priority. He said a high standard of education is, for any country, "the condition of survival in this modern world."
"Mass education is the great public responsibility," he said, "much more important for a country than elite universities. Everyone must have the right to participate in the race.
"I really worry when I see in the United States, especially in the big cities, the degradation of schools. Parts of the population are outside the possibilities of development."
Similarly with health and welfare. Professor Prodi said he would decentralize them and lighten the bureaucratic hand, "but I don't have in mind to destroy protection for the third of the population that is less fortunate."
As part of the emphasis on competition, the coalition's policy is strongly pro-European. And Professor Prodi said the Asia challenge called for the creation of an Alantic-European Union market.
Today, northern Italy has one of the highest standards of living in the world. But that won't last, Professor Prodi said, unless the educational and scientific system is reformed: "We won't have the level of productivity to maintain our way of life."
Professor Prodi is himself a product of the new internationalism. He was educated in part at the London School of Economics, and he has spent time at Stanford and Harvard. He has served on the international advisory boards of General Electric, I.B.M. and Goldman Sachs.
A Catholic, 55 years old, he comes across as a person quite without self-importance. He rides a bicycle and has a modest office around the corner from Bologna's cathedral.
The idea of a professor rising to the highest level of politics in a few months clearly tickles him. But it could only happen, Professor Prodi said, "in a period of transformation" -- the corruption scandals that in the last three years have destroyed this country's major parties.

Reading Bill's Mind

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
My '96 campaign has begun. Running the country, which they won't let me do, now gives way to running for re-election, where I call the shots.
My Grand Strategy is to run above party, to secure the Perot anti-deficit vote, then to scare Democrats into coming along by painting the party in power as extremist. 
 My campaign inner circle is in place: strategist Dick Morris and pollster Doug Schoen, my alter ego Gore and his man Jack Quinn, manager Harold Ickes, adman Bob Squier, Gov. Evan Bayh, with Leon Panetta the bridge to government. Hillary's not in the meetings this time.
We're off to a good start. The Senate's Foster rejection was a 10-strike -- showed me loyal to the end, and reminded every woman I'm pro-choice and the Republicans are anti-abortion. That wedge splits Republican women away from the party.
And the Supreme Court got me off the hook on the Republican's wedge issue, affirmative action. Come Bastille Day, I'll have a nonracial set-asides policy based on helping poor communities -- giving poor white men a break. No rigid numerical hiring goals, no layoffs favoring the unqualified, but extra efforts for women and minorities. Sure it's a straddle -- but good glass-ceiling rhetoric will show women I'm with them.
I have the jump on Republicans, and on whoever my Democratic challenger will be, in advertising. My "inoculation" commercials are ready, making me immune on crime by pushing for more cops and fighting the N.R.A.'s repeal of my assault weapons ban. If Republicans want to fiddle with the crime bill this summer, they'll have a hard time hitting me on midnight basketball.
I've begun to plant the seeds of "the Republican recession." When Dole-Gingrich took over in January, unemployment and inflation were way down, the economy was booming -- now if it all falls apart, it's their fault. That's why I've been saying "yes, but" to spending cuts since the State of the Union, and why I stick to my middle-class tax cut -- later, I can blame their extremism for any recession. Or credit my moderation for continued prosperity.
When the budget negotiations get down to the short strokes in October, should I cave or take the "train wreck"? I'll get the best deal I can -- eight years, resisting some education cuts -- but I won't close down the Government. I'm now against bickering and gridlock; so are most people.
I know, Democratic leaders in Congress -- Bonior, Kennedy, Obey, the whole rear guard -- will keep hollering I've sold out our liberal birthright. But they led the party down the road to its worst defeat.
So I'll deal with the New Democratic Party in the Senate, where John Breaux is the shadow minority leader and Joe Lieberman the whip. (Actually, Newt Gingrich is our whip, and will be in charge of my turnout in '96.) That core of a dozen, with Republican moderates, plus help from organized labor in return for my trade war on Japan, gives us the filibuster power to resist cloture.
But I need a cost-free new idea to steal the legislative spotlight. The Republican weakness is welfare reform, where the teen-age mother cutoff is too cruel and the work requirement costs too much. Maybe there's a way to provide welfare through employers -- Republicans would have to buy welfare privatization. And then I could forget the expensive job training and make-work programs, and concentrate on child care direct to kids to free welfare mothers for their first jobs.
That's the new, independent Clinton -- the Great Facilitator. At home, balance the budget someday without pain, creative but cheap welfare reform, crime prevention, big push to deport illegal immigrants, save California from offshore drilling. Abroad, Chris sets me up to broker a Mideast deal with Syria, and I keep our boys out of unpopular wars -- while charging both political parties here with being isolationist for cutting foreign aid.
Am I euphoric? It's better than being irrelevant and droopy. If it's Dole, I run again as the challenger against the old incumbent; if it's Gingrich, I'm the moderate against the extremist; if it's Wilson -- no, the Christian Coalition won't let the Republicans pick Wilson.
I can lick 'em by joining 'em. Now if I only knew what those damnable Whitewater prosecutors were up to . . .

HEADLINE: Governor Pataki's Watershed

 BODY:
Gov. George Pataki has promised time and again that he will save the 2,000-square-mile watershed that supplies eight million New York City dwellers and one million upstaters with drinking water. As a down payment on that promise, he is mediating talks between city officials who want to keep the watershed clean and upstate developers who think the city has no right to meddle in their lives. That is more than any of his predecessors in Albany have done, and he deserves credit for it.
Still, talk is one thing, results another. The worst possible result of these closed-door discussions would be a rhetorically correct statement in which the antagonists agree to "put past differences aside" and "embark on a new era of cooperation." Such diplomatic double-speak cannot substitute for a detailed agreement that would do two things. 
 First, it would reaffirm the city's right to regulate economic development in the watershed -- a right it has long had but never really exercised. In unglamorous terms, that translates into a veto over the siting of septic tanks and waste treatment plants. Second, the agreement would contain an announcement that the city will start acquiring land now to provide protective buffer zones near the reservoirs and the streams that feed them.
Anything less will be boilerplate justifying further delay. But delay is not an option. In December 1993, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency told the city to clean up its water supply in three years or build a filtration plant. City Comptroller Alan Hevesi estimates that such a plant will cost $4.5 billion, plus annual debt service of $365 million and operating costs of $145 million. That is a financial punch neither Mayor Rudolph Giuliani nor Mr. Pataki can easily absorb.
The watershed includes 100 sewage treatment plants that discharge wastewater into the streams feeding the reservoirs. Most need upgrading or replacement. There are also 128,000 septic tanks, thousands of acres of farmland and hundreds of miles of roadways. All of this adds up to tons of toxic waste, producing visible algae in the reservoirs and invisible microorganisms that water-drinkers would just as soon not think about.
The city may someday have to filter its water. But that is no reason not to impose controls over the watershed. Marilyn Gelber, the city's Environmental Protection Commissioner, notes that filtration has not prevented cryptosporidium and other parasites from infecting the drinking water of cities that have spent huge sums on state-of-the-art filtration systems. "Engineering," she says, "can't do everything." In other words, a watershed overloaded with pollutants spells trouble, no matter how much money is thrown at it.
Ms. Gelber has been fighting a good fight on behalf of the city's consumers. She also has $750 million in dedicated funds to upgrade sewage treatment plants and septic systems, pay farmers to reduce agricultural pollution and acquire some 80,000 acres of land at market prices from willing sellers. But she needs help. She needs permits from the State Department of Health to impose sewage regulations. She needs permits from the State Department of Environmental Conservation to begin acquiring land around the reservoirs. In short, she needs Governor Pataki.
Mr. Pataki has concluded that watershed protection cannot proceed without the cooperation of local residents. Hence the discussions now under way. But he has to start somewhere. He has to let the meetings run their course, and then make a two-part announcement.
Part one is that upstaters -- many of whom contributed handsomely to his gubernatorial campaign -- will henceforth honor larger public interests by relinquishing their assumed right to develop their land. Part two is that New York City will underwrite this act of environmental virtue with $750 million in real dollars. That is a lot of money in a time of fiscal constraint. But it beats spending six times as much on a filtration plant that might not work anyway. In any case, it is a fair exchange. The Governor should go for it.

Teaching Hospitals

 BODY:
New York's teaching medical centers are in financial crisis, buffeted by the efforts of the state and Federal governments to cut hospital payments and health maintenance organizations seeking big discounts. A study by the United Hospital Fund, a research and philanthropic group, shows how five of the city's academic medical centers - Montefiore, Mount Sinai, Columbia Presbyterian, New York Hospital and New Your University - operate in circumstances much different than other U.S. hospitals. They have higher occupancy rates and longer average legnths of stay and they care for more Medicaid patients. Chronic deficits have forces the centers to take on more and more long-term debt; debt per certified bed at the five hospitals was 22 percent higher than for other U.S. major teaching hospitals in 1993.

HEADLINE: In California, Tax Increase Draws Foes

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 26

 BODY:
In what many are describing as a watershed vote in one of the most conservative areas of the country, the residents of Orange County are expected to go to the polls on Tuesday and reject an emergency tax increase to help lift the county government out of bankruptcy.
Polls have shown that, as the vote draws nearer, more and more residents are saying they will not support the proposed half-cent increase in the local sales tax, to 8.25 percent. The expected "no" vote is being interpreted as both a statement on the attitude toward taxes and on the credibility of the county's Republican-dominated power structure, which has said the tax is a critical step in extricating the wealthy county from bankruptcy and avoiding deeper financial problems. 
 Polls in The Orange County Register, the leading local newspaper, now have the sales tax increase losing by a lopsided margin, with 53 percent of respondents rejecting it and just 31 percent in favor. In March, when the proposal first came up, only 45 percent were opposed and 48 percent were in favor. The remainder of residents in both polls were undecided.
A rejection could send ripples far beyond the clubby green hills of the county, which lies just south of Los Angeles. Many experts have warned that it almost certainly will mean the largest default ever in the municipal bond market, with the county unable to repay investors in more than $1 billion of bonds that come due this summer.
Such a default could cast a pall throughout the market, forcing other municipalities in California to pay a slightly higher interest rate for their borrowings. Some experts are warning that it could also lead to further drastic reductions in Orange County's budget. Earlier sharp budget cuts have forced libraries to be closed, some school programs to be eliminated, and health and welfare services to be trimmed.
There have been many arguments put forward by the opponents of the tax increase, but the most persuasive seems to be that it would place more money, and power, in the hands of the same politicians who got the county into its financial mess. Orange County was forced to file for bankruptcy last December after its treasurer lost $1.7 billion from reckless investments in the bond market. The treasurer, Robert L. Citron, was forced to resign and subsequently pleaded guilty to five felony counts related to the losses.
The initiative places the additional tax revenues in the county's general fund, for the supervisors to use as they see fit, rather than earmarking it for specific purposes such as repaying debts.
"If you read the initiative, it is self-defeating," said Anita Mangels, a Republican political consultant who is not affiliated with either side of the issue. "The money will be spent by the same supervisors who lost the money to begin with."
"It's not that the people here hate government," she added. "It's not that they are being irresponsible about repaying the county's debts. They don't trust the people in office with that money."
Jim Toledano, chairman of the county's Democratic Party, surprised many other Democrats by coming out against the tax. He described a "no" vote as "a vote against business as usual in this county."
"It's the first step toward a restructuring of the whole power structure," he said.
Perhaps the most worrying outcome of a rejection is that it would leave the county, which is the largest municipal government ever to file for bankruptcy, in even greater disarray. Even those who have been fighting noisily for a rejection of the sales tax increase have failed so far to outline a clear and acceptable alternative plan for either repaying the county's debts or slashing budgets so the government can live within its means.
"We don't have an overall Plan B, but we continue to do research," said Robert Poole, head of the Reason Foundation, a libertarian group that has fought for a sharp reduction in the size of the county government.
Proponents of the sales tax increase, which includes most of the business community, have argued that, unpleasant as it may be, it will spare the county even greater costs down the road. The county's credit rating would be ruined for years if there was a default on the bonds, they have argued.
The tax increase is expected to raise about $130 million a year.
Some businessmen have said they agree that the county government should be reduced in size and even that some of the politicians should be replaced, but without defaulting on the county's bonds.
"In my view, both sides are correct and we need to downsize, but it's a question of which forum we do it in," said Gary Hunt, a senior executive of the Irvine Company, the county's largest real estate developer. "We should not restructure the government on the backs of the bondholders. Let's do it at the ballot box later on."
William J. Popejoy, a businessman who became the county's interim chief executive after the bankruptcy, said today he was resigned to a loss.
"The situation doesn't look good, no matter how you slice it," he said. "But I don't know what the damn debate is all about. The only way we can pay off our debts is with the sales tax."
He added, nonetheless, that he was already thinking of alternatives.
"Win or lose, what we have to try and do is form a coalition to come up with something else," he commented. "There are some plans we're working on. Whether or not we can do that, I don't know."

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Cuba Refuses to Free Nixon Nephew

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
The State Department said today that Cuba was holding the passport of Donald Nixon Jr., nephew of the late President Richard M. Nixon, and was preventing him from returning to the United States.
Last Friday, Mr. Nixon's wife, Helene Nixon, asked the State Department and several members of Congress to help her husband, asserting that he was being detained by Cuban officials. 
 The Cuban Foreign Ministry denied today that it was detaining Mr. Nixon, although it said the Cuban Government did not want him to leave the country until it finished investigating his relationship with Robert L. Vesco, who was recently arrested by the Cuban authorities after living in Havana for a dozen years. Mr. Vesco fled the United States in 1972 to escape charges that he had bilked mutual fund investors of more than $200 million in what was then the largest financial fraud in history.
On Sunday, Mr. Nixon told ABC News that Cuban officials had accused him of money laundering, espionage and drug trafficking.
Christine Shelly, a State Department spokeswoman, said: "We are not aware of specific charges having been brought against Mr. Nixon by the Cuban Government. He did inform the U.S. interests section that Cuban authorities were holding his U.S. passport."
Mr. Nixon has long had close ties with Mr. Vesco, and for a while in the 1970's lived in Costa Rica with Mr. Vesco shortly after the financier became a fugitive.
In 1975, Federal prosecutors in Detroit said they were looking into Mr. Nixon's activities as part of an investigation into whether Mr. Vesco was involved in drug smuggling.
Congressional aides said Mr. Nixon was in Cuba as part of an effort to work with Mr. Vesco to manufacture an anti-AIDS drug that the United States has not approved for use.
At today's State Department briefing, Ms. Shelly said she could not comment on whether Mr. Nixon's business dealings in Cuba violated the 32-year-old economic embargo against trading with Cuba.
A lawyer for the Nixon family, Ernest Ching Jr., told the Orange County Register over the weekend that Mr. Nixon has been under house arrest for about three weeks. Mr. Nixon has been staying in Mr. Vesco's house in Havana.
Mr. Ching did not return several phone calls to his office today.
According to biographies of Mr. Vesco, White House officials arranged for the President's nephew to take a job with Mr. Vesco's Geneva-based mutual fund in 1971 after they grew worried that his life on a hippie commune and his wild antics could embarrass his uncle.
Mr. Nixon has been close to Mr. Vesco for more than two decades. In one biography, a Vesco associate described their relationship this way: "Vesco uses Don as an errand boy."
Mr. Vesco was also friends with the President's brothers, Edgar and Donald.
In 1973, Mr. Vesco was indicted for making an illegal $200,000 contribution to President Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign, but was never tried because he became a fugitive.

HEADLINE: Resales of Homes Jumped by 4.7% in May

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
Home resales increased 4.7 percent in May, as falling mortgage rates finally helped draw more buyers to the real estate market, the National Association of Realtors said today.
The gain, the second of the year, was bigger than expected and brought national resales to an annual rate of 3.55 million units. Sales increases were reported in every region of the country except the Northeast. 
 "The setting is ripe for a housing rebound," said Anthony Chan, chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio. "We have lower mortgage rates and lower prices."
The increase of 4.7 percent, however, represented only a partial rebound from April's decline of 6.4 percent.
Consumer spending, the fuel for about two-thirds of economic activity in the United States, is clearly under stress. The economy lost 101,000 jobs in May, while consumer spending, adjusted for inflation, fell one-tenth of 1 percent in April.
Additionally, Americans' incomes showed the smallest increase in five months during April, while household debt levels continued to grow. That suggested Americans were finding it more difficult to shoulder the costs of owning a home.
However, slow inflation is helping consumers buy homes, said John Tuccillo, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. "Inflation is essentially absent from this economy, so incomes will continue to gain on house prices, and affordability will increase," he said.
Meanwhile, mortgage rates have moved lower. The average rate on a 30-year fixed loan declined to 7.91 percent in May from 8.32 percent in April, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY'S BUDGET: TAXES;
Whitman Delivers Cuts Year Ahead of Schedule

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 26

 BODY:
But can she afford it?
From the beginning of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's wonderful adventure in tax cutting 18 months ago, the skepticism that she met with was rarely about money and mostly about politics. Cutting the income tax rate by 30 percent over three years was dismissed by over-confident Democrats and even some Republicans as a political impossibility, an interruption in the ever-increasing flow of money from Trenton to the suburbs and the cities that had continued unabated, through Democratic and Republican administrations alike. 
 Today, Mrs. Whitman delivered her promise in full and a year ahead of schedule, and her soaring popularity has answered any doubts about the politics of tax cutting. But now she is faced with a more nettlesome question that has come closer than any merely partisan division to scuttle her plans: will state revenues be sufficient to cover the $247 million in lost income taxes under the cut?
Several Democrats and even some of Governor Whitman's fellow Republicans insist that the answer is no. "I do not believe the revenues will be there to pay for it," Senator Robert E. Littell, the Republican chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said last week of the tax cut, which will take effect in January, and will save taxpayers $616 million for the 1996 tax year.
Like other skeptics, Mr. Littell points to the following uncertainties:
*New Jersey and the rest of the country's economies show signs of slowing down, which would immediately depress income from business-sensitive taxes, the only taxes to show a healthy growth so far this year.
*Even without an economic slowdown, the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services reports that the Governor's Treasury Department has overestimated revenues for the coming fiscal year by $380 million, a gap in forecasting that the State Treasurer has yet to explain away, despite his assurances that it would not be a problem.
*With both the Republican-controlled Congress and President Bill Clinton agreeing to cut Federal spending to balance the budget by the next century, the $5.8 billion in Federal money New Jersey receives per year is in jeopardy. As Assemblyman Joseph J. Roberts Jr., a Democrat from Camden, pointed out in debating the tax cut today, "a 5 percent reduction in Federal aid would open up a $250 million hole in the budget."
*The Internal Revenue Service has notified the state that it has concerns about $769 million taken out of the state employee pension fund in 1992, before Mrs. Whitman became Governor. The Governor's refusal to release the letter has only increased the Democrats' claim that she is concealing a demand for the money to be repaid.
These questions hanging over Governor Whitman's moment of triumph would be much smaller if she had stayed with her original plan and drawn the cuts out over three, instead of two years, said Donald Linky, director of the Public Affairs Research Institute, a nonprofit fiscal watchdog.
"The decision to go with the full implementation a year early has clearly put the administration on the defensive," Mr. Linky said. "She is going to have to keep a very careful eye on short-term spending and I think that may distract them from doing the long-term analysis of their plans that they would have had more time for under the three-year plan."
Mr. Linky also raised questions about the Whitman budget's reliance on savings from turning over the management of more than two dozen state operations to private contractors. It is still an untested idea whose true savings potential might have been more carefully explored with a few trial cases if the Governor had not been in such a rush to act, Mr. Linky said.
For example, the administration hoped for important savings by putting management of the New Jersey Veterans Home in Paramus, which costs the state $18.5 million a year, in private hands. One bid came in at more than the state's operating costs, however, and two others promised savings of just half a million dollars, a meager sum considering the political costs to legislators from angry public employees, who face displacement by the privatization plans.
Despite these warning signs, Governor Whitman has never publicly wavered in her confidence. The budget has a $500 million surplus to cushion any surprises, she says, and the Republican Congress has promised that any cuts in aid to the states will be accompanied by greater freedom on how to spend it.
In addition, the Governor has agreed to Mr. Littell's creation of a special reserve fund to cover any cuts in Federal dollars that could not be offset by changing the way the money is spent. And she has agreed to postpone for another year some $68 million in business tax cuts she had wanted to take effect with the new budget. With these nods toward fiscal prudence, administration officials say, why should anyone doubt the state's ability to pay for a highly popular income tax cut?
The answer will start to take shape in about a month, when state officials are scheduled to travel to Wall Street and open their books to the bond rating companies.

HEADLINE: Carlingford Journal;
Cattle Barons They're Not, but the Irish Do Nicely

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY 

DATELINE: CARLINGFORD, Ireland

 BODY:
In Irish mythology, Queen Maeve led a huge army over the mountains near this quiet village in what is known as the Cattle Raid at Cooley, to capture the greatest brown bull in Ireland.
She lost the battle but managed to take the bull, which had been her husband's property. In the plains around this hamlet of 600 people, in view of the Cooley Mountains, broken on high by Maeve's Gap, the legend of the bulls is very much alive, and so is the cattle business, one of Ireland's most important moneymakers in an economy still heavily dependent on agriculture. 
 About 14 percent of the Irish still live off the land, more than double the European Union average. And Ireland, with twice as many head of cattle as its human population of 3.5 million, exports about 2 million steers a year, a business that brings in more than $1 billion.
The result for Carlingford, and the surrounding Cooley Peninsula, about 50 miles north of Dublin and 12 miles south of the border with Northern Ireland, has been relative prosperity in a country that has serious economic problems and an unemployment rate of about 16 percent, double the European average.
And the cattle business, as well as dairy farming, sheep and crop raising, provides most people here a relatively prosperous life, reasonable hope that their children will not have to emigrate to Britain or America to make a living, a slower erosion of traditional religious beliefs and the preservation of folklore still un-hyped and not marketed for the questionable benefits of tourism.
"It's a medieval village with a natural, clean environment, basic rural living," said Jim Thornton, an official of the Irish Farmer's Association and a resident of Carlingford, founded by Vikings more than 1,000 years ago and studded with the ruins of Norman castles.
Many Irish people feel that as the European Union pushes modern life more and more toward the western edge of Europe, it is important to maintain some of the old ways as a matter of national pride and identity.
Mr. Thornton said he tells his eight children, ranging in age from 12 to 24, that, unlike young people in most other parts of Ireland, they will not have to leave the area to find jobs, because there is work here, on farms, in a few small factories, and at the small, active port on Carlingford Lough that ships out much of Ireland's cattle to Arab countries.
"They won't get filthy rich," he said, "but they'll make a good living."
Noting that the average industrial wage in Ireland is about $23,000, he said, "With a wee bit of astuteness, they can live a comfortable life style," dealing with ordinary rural concerns, like the large crow that has begun to build a nest in the Thornton chimney, or whether his 12-year-old son, Brian, should believe Paddy Reilly, the caretaker at what is called the Jumping Church.
The church is a crumbling 11th-century gray stone structure with a graveyard wall that is said to have jumped three feet backward to exclude from the sacred burial ground the body of an excommunicated person, in 1715.
Interviewed in the graveyard, Mr. Reilly talked about that legend and added another, pointing to low hills in the distance, where, he said, lived "Garret's underground army." The army would rise, he said, when a red-haired man with six fingers on one hand managed to pull a magic sword out of the ground. "Then they will rise and free Ireland," he said.
Brian Thornton said he had heard the story. "He told us it had to be a fella with two thumbs," he said, grimacing skeptically.
The story is less believed than reports about Ladywell, a natural spring that rises in the countryside next to a statue of the Virgin Mary. Every Aug. 15, the feast of the Assumption of Mary, hundreds of people pray at the well and bless themselves with its water, some hoping for physical cures.
Some of them say that if the holy water is taken home and put on the fire, the water will not boil, perhaps annoying the Devil. There are no tourist tours to the church or the well, and most people here, unlike those in much of Ireland, do not think that they need tourism to survive.
But they do need the cattle, and the cattle farmers, now thriving, still have anxieties, about declining price-support subsidies from the European Union, and disruptions by animal rights legislation and militants, still not active in Ireland as they are in Britain. The subsidies, for putting beef in storage, are scheduled to decline in coming years, and the cattle industry also faces cash penalties for suspected cheating.
The European Union has demanded that the Irish Government pay about $160 million in fines because its meat packers cheated, illegally marketing high-grade cuts of meat it had been paid to store. The Government, the cattlemen fear, might put a tax on them to pay the fine.
Raymond O'Malley, a 43-year-old farmer whose family has 350 head of Simmental beef cattle, said droughts in South America and Australia in recent years, as well as hefty European subsidies, had kept Irish cattle profits up.
Mr. O'Malley, who said he works about 14 hours a day, said of the cattle: "I have loved them since I was a boy. You get to like them. You brought every one of them into the world. You made sure they sucked their mothers in the first four hours of life, so they got the antibodies in her milk, otherwise they would die."
He said that the changing economics of the business would eventually suppress farms smaller than his 500 acres and that his son would probably have to keep 1,000 head to make a living.
And sometimes, he said, resting in a field with a dozen hungry cows watching him, "You ask yourself: Why? In a few years, they'll be gone, you'll be gone."

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY'S BUDGET: THE DEMOCRATS;
Outmaneuvered on Taxes, Opposition Searches for a Strategy

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 26

 BODY:
Since the modern State Constitution was passed here in 1949, New Jersey Democrats have largely dominated state government. Then 18 months ago, with the election of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, the Republicans took control of the executive and legislative branches for only the second time in 45 years, leaving the Democrats in search of a strategy that will give them a leg up for the State Assembly races this fall.
 But if Democrats had a unified plan of action, it did not surface today during the Legislature's passage of bills to cut income tax rates by 15 percent. Indeed, 12 of the 28 Democrats in the Assembly joined the Republicans today in voting for Governor Whitman's tax cut. 
 And Democratic votes were crucial to pass the income-tax rate cut in the Senate. The bill passed on a 27 to 9 vote with 21 needed for passage. Republicans supplied 20 votes with Democrats providing the comfortable winning margin. Seeing the Democratic support, the Republican leadership allowed two of its Senators from urban areas, Senator Richard J. LaRossa of West Trenton and Peter A. Inverso of Hamilton, to abstain.
Republicans hold a 52 to 28 majority in the 80-member Assembly and, given the popularity of the Republican Governor and the continued absence of any unifying statewide controversy, it is unlikely that the Democrats will close the gap on their rivals, much less regain control of the House.
The tax cut, which is scheduled to take effect in January, will enable Governor Whitman to make good on her pledge to cut tax rates by 30 percent, a year earlier than her self-imposed deadline of three years. Completion of the tax-cut program will be the centerpiece of the Republican drive to retain its lopsided Assembly majority, which essentially has turned Democrats into spectators over the last two years.
Assemblywoman Loretta Weinberg, a Democrat from Teaneck, who voted against Mrs. Whitman's tax cut, saying it will lead to higher taxes in the future, said today on the floor, "I regret to say there is no single Democratic position on this tax cut.
"Some of my members believe that any tax cut is better than none at all."
"Others oppose this concept," she continued, "but they know the realities of big-money politics in the media age, and they will vote yes because they know they could be unfairly branded in an upcoming election." She added that still others will abstain for fear of "being caught between a rock and a hard place."
The tax cut passed the Assembly by a vote of 63 to 14. Democrats provided all the opposing votes. Besides the 12 Democrats who voted for the cut, two, including the Assembly minority leader Joseph V. Doria of Bayonne , abstained.
With no easy response to a tax cut delivered by a popular Republican Governor, B. Thomas Byrne, the state Democratic chairman, said the party's candidates in the fall will have to convince voters that cutting tax rates while the budget is growing is irresponsible and certain to produce higher local property taxes in the near term and higher state taxes eventually in order to balance future budgets. "Many people don't realize that the budget has gone up by $1 billion during Whitman's tenure," he said.
"I've always said we could reasonably support a tax cut that was fair and paid for, but this neither," he said. "Each round of elections more and more Democrats are coming around, and lately some Republicans have been saying the latest cut should have been delayed until we have a clearer picture of the economy and state revenues."
The Senate minority leader, John A. Lynch of New Brunswick , has been one of the most outspoken critics of the Governor's economic policies and has sharpened his attacks in recent weeks.
"Revenues are flat, spending is up 8 percent and the Governor declares a dividend by pushing through a cut in tax rates," he said today. "How do you do that?"
"They're cooking the books and the issue is, do we have the courage to go out and make that case to the public?"
Mr. Lynch and Senator Bernard F. Kenny, a Hoboken Democrat, have gone to court to try to force the Whitman administration to release a letter from the Internal Revenue Service, regarding some changes in the state's pension system. Those changes, enacted by Gov. Jim Florio with the cooperation of the Republican Legislature two years ago, were portrayed as an accounting change that would help the state present a balanced budget.
Mr. Lynch said that the state could eventually be forced to come up with $1 billion to satisfy the I.R.S. and that legislators had a right to see the letter before being asked to vote for the budget or the tax cut. Mrs. Whitman has said the letter is merely an invitation to discuss the pension changes, and her legal advisers say the accounting procedures will pass muster.
But Mrs. Whitman has refused to make the letter public and has defeated the Democrats' court challenge at the trial level. Late last week, after reading the letter, a two-judge panel of the Appellate Division of Superior Court said it should be made public. The administration won a stay of that ruling while it pursues an appeal. The seven-member New Jersey Supreme Court conferred today by telephone and sent the matter back to the trial court for additional fact-finding. A decision on releasing the letter is not expected for at least few weeks.
Mr. Lynch said that if the state must come up with increased tax payments to the I.R.S., even if they are stretched out over a few years "this could be the straw that breaks the camel's back." He said that by the middle of 1997 the state could be looking at a budget gap of more than $4 billion when the diversion of hundreds of millions in pension payments ends and the bill for the state takeover of the court system comes due.

HEADLINE: Lockheed To Eliminate 12,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The Lockheed Martin Corporation announced a sweeping consolidation plan yesterday that would close plants and field offices, eliminate 12,000 jobs and ultimately save the company $1.8 billion a year.
The planned cuts are a painful byproduct of the merger, completed in March, between the Lockheed Corporation and the Martin Marietta Corporation, a combination that created the nation's biggest military contractor. 
 Arms makers have been merging and cutting back rapidly after the cold war as they compete for shrinking Pentagon funds. Analysts said Lockheed Martin had few options, given the sharp cutbacks in military spending.
"Management had no choice but to make these cuts," said Peter Asiritis, an analyst who follows the military industry for CS First Boston.
For the most part, the cuts were in line with expectations, but investors did not react positively yesterday. On a day when most military-related stocks took a beating, the shares of Lockheed Martin shares fell $2, to $61.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Lockheed Martin, which has been based in Bethesda, Md., since the merger, said the plan would be largely completed over the next two years and would cost $1.7 billion. The company, which took a pretax charge of $165 million in the first quarter to cover consolidation costs, said it would take a $525 million charge in the second quarter.
About 5,000 of the workers set to lose their jobs will be let go this year, a Lockheed Martin spokesman, Charles Manor, said yesterday. Another 3,000 postiions will be cut in 1996, with the remaining 4,000 to be spread over the following three years.
The job cuts are in addition to 7,000 announced by Lockheed and Martin Marietta earlier this year, before the merger.
Taken together, the 19,000 workers represent more than 11 percent of the combined work force, which stood at 166,000 at the beginning of the year.
As a result of the consolidation, Lockheed Martin said it planned to close 12 plants and laboratories, as well as 26 field offices whose work overlaps, in the United States and abroad. The moves would eliminate about 7.7 million square feet of unneeded capacity, the company said.
Although the operations to be closed stretch across the country, and include Lockheed's former headquarters at Calabasas, Calif., analysts said the area around Philadelphia, including southern New Jersey, would be hit hardest.
Lockheed Martin said it intended to close two plants in that area, one in East Windsor, N.J., and another in Valley Forge, Pa. The East Windsor plant has 3,100 employees, while the Valley Forge plant has 1,800. Both plants design and manufacture spacecraft.
In a statement, Daniel M. Tellep, Lockheed Martin's chairman and chief executive, said the consolidation plan was a "continuing adaptation to the sharp reductions in Department of Defense and NASA budgets."
Over the last 10 years, spending on military procurement has declined more than 70 percent in real terms, Mr. Asiritis of CS First Boston said.
Norman R. Augustine, Lockheed Martin's president, has said the spending cutback is the economic equivalent of three Depressions for his industry.
The spending cuts have put more than a million defense workers out of work. Before the reductions are completed, another 600,000 to 700,000 may lose their jobs, Mr. Asiritis said.
Analysts said the private sector was bearing a disproportionately large burden in the move to a smaller military. "Politically, it is much easier to let the private sector do the restructuring, because they have shareholders to answer to," Mr. Asiritis said. "In the public sector, making these sorts of decisions is like pulling teeth."

Prices Down On Treasury Securities

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday for the second consecutive day as investors grew nervous about the strength of the economy following a bigger-than-expected gain in sales of existing homes in May. The pickup in the data raised questions about how fast the economy is slowing and whether or not the Fed will put off an interest rate cut in July.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 24/32 of a percentage point, to 1142/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 6.54 percent, from 6.49 percent on Friday. 
 Traders had expected 3.44 million annualized units versus a 3.39 million rate in April. What they got instead was a 4.7 percent gain, to 3.55 million units on an annualized basis, right behind Friday's much stronger-than-expected durable orders report and that added a bit of uncertainty about the Fed policy outlook.
Overnight weakness in Europe set the tone to a weak opening of the United States market, which later fell further on the housing report. The overnight weakness was attributed to stronger-than-expected German inflation data last week, which killed any hopes of a near-term interest rate cut by the Bundesbank, and the intensifying political crisis in Britain brought on by Prime Minister John Major's resignation and call for elections.
The domestic Treasury market also took a cautious tone ahead of today's auction of new two-year notes and tomorrrow's auction of five-year notes, as supply weighed on prices. In when-issued trading late yesteray the two-year notes were being offered at a price to yield 5.66 percent, up from 5.57 percent on Friday; the five-year notes were being offered at a price to yield 5.87 percent, up from 5.80 percent.
Other negatives weighing on the market included the approaching deadline for the trade talks between the United States and Japan, and threat of sanctions if talks fail. Analysts said that the market had largely ignored the idea of a trade war, but with the clock winding down that might have to be factored into prices.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist for Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, said yesterday's housing data were important to the market given that movements in existing-home sales often ledd future movements in real personal consumption. "The outcome offers a rare window of what consumption might do during the third and fourth quarters of this year," he said.
And since consumption accounts for nearly two-thirds of the nation's overall gross dometic product, it is something not easily ignored by the markets, Mr. Chan said, even though market activity will be dominated by the results of the Treasury's auction this week.
Mr. Chan said that Treasury rates have fallen from 7.93 percent at the beginning of the year to around 6.52 percent at present. This, he said, represents a gain of about 141 basis points for those participants that have been holding long maturities since the beginning of the year. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
"Consequently, anytime that bond markets overseas take a hit, there is a risk that some players will unload their Treasury holdings to offset losses in their markets," Mr. Chan said. "Markets often assume that politicans will resort to higher government spending or easier monetary policy to hold on to political power. The implications are that higher inflation can result in greater gilt losses which might precipitate even more Treasury sales to offset more losses." Gilts are British Government securities.
At the Treasury's auction of new bills yesterday, average rates declined for the third week in a row. Traders said the results of the auction were as expected.
The average rate for a three-month bill was 5.35 percent, down 11 basis points from the previous week, but in line with the recent gains as the market continued to factor in a rate cut by the Fed in July. For a six-month bill the rate was 5.34 percent, down eight basis points.
The following are the results of yesterday's regular weekly Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
 (000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.648	97.300	Discounted Rate	5.35%	5.34%	Coupon Yield	5.51%	5.58%	High Price	98.658	97.310	Discounted Rate	5.31%	5.32%	Coupon Yield	5.47%	5.56%	Low Price	98.648	97.300	Discounted Rate	5.35%	5.34%	Coupon Yield	5.51%	5.58%	Accepted at low price	47%	25%	Total applied for	$49,455,618	$51,529,225	Accepted	$13,683,208	$13,681,939	Noncompetitive	$1,315,072	$1,170,658	
Both issues are dated June 29, 1995. The three-month bills mature on Sept. 28, 1995, and the six-month bills mature on Dec. 28, 1995.

Dollar Rises Against the Pound As British Leader Is Challenged

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most European currencies yesterday, benefiting from political uncertainty in Britain and an economic report suggesting that interest rates in the United States may remain unchanged.
The dollar was little changed against the Japanese yen. Traders are reluctant to make large bets on the dollar against the yen as Japanese and American negotiators make a last-ditch attempt to strike an agreement on automotive trade. 
 The British pound fell to a six-week low against the German mark and a three-week low against the dollar, after a member of the British Government, John Redwood, who is Secretary of State for Wales, resigned to challenge Prime Minister John Major for leadership of the Conservative Party. Mr. Major announced on Thursday that he was resigning his leadership of the party and would then seek to be re-elected.
The move by Mr. Redwood, the first Conservative to challenge the Prime Minister, raised questions yesterday about whether Nr, Major's decision would backfire on him.
"The fact that Major won't have as easy a ride getting selected gave the market a little shake," said Bob Gruber, a senior currency salesman at Chemical Bank..
The pound dropped as low as 2.1969 marks, its lowest since May 11, and was last quoted at 2.2043 marks. The pound also fell to a low of $1.5819, its lowest level since June 2, when it hit $1.5802. In New York, the pound settled at $1.5852, down from $1.6066 on Friday.
The dollar was also stronger against the mark, rising to 1.3907 marks, from 1.3863 marks on Friday. The dollar edged up to 84.36 Japanese yen from 84.26 yen.
The dollar was also supported by a report from the National Association of Realtors that showed a stronger-than-expected rise of 4.7 percent in sales of existing homes last month.
That report "made people rethink whether the Fed will ease in July and boosted the dollar," said Charles Spence, director of currency sales at Standard Chartered Bank in New York.
Many traders have been expecting the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee to lower rates when it meets July 5 and 6. Lower interest rates often hurt the dollar by making bank deposits denominated in dollars less attractive.
As for the yen, its path is dependent on the trade negotiations. The United States has set a deadline of midnight tomorrow to reach an accord or else it will impose 100 percent tariffs on Japanese luxury cars.

Sony Displays Flat-Screen TV Employing a New Technology

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 26

 BODY:
Seeking to become competitive in the market for flat screens, the Sony Corporation today displayed a new technology for producing flat television sets that can hang on a wall.
Sony said it hoped to begin selling 25-inch television sets using the technology in the autumn of next year. It did not say how much they would cost. 
 Sony is a leader in conventional television sets and computer displays using its Trinitron cathode ray tube. The Japanese company has produced more than 100 million Trinitron color televisions since introducing the technology in 1968.
But Sony has lagged behind many of its Japanese competitors in the development of flat screens that might one day replace the bulky cathode ray tube. Sony is not even a participant in the fast-growing business of making liquid crystal displays for notebook computers.
To get back into the race, Sony has turned to others. Its new "plasmatron" display is based on technology developed by Tektronix Inc. a Wilsonville, Ore., company, and then refined by Sony. The approach seeks to combine the best features of two existing types of flat screens -- liquid crystal displays and plasma displays.
Active matrix liquid crystal displays, now used for advanced laptop computers, use a separate transistor to control each picture element. The screen is essentially a giant semiconductor chip made on glass and is difficult to make free of defects. Many engineers believe it will be impossible to economically manufacture active-matrix screens larger than about 15 inches.
Plasma displays use ionized gases that are excited by an electric voltage and create light for the image. Plasma technology can be used to make screens of 40 inches or even larger. But Sony says the picture is not as clear as with the liquid crystal technology.
Sony's technology uses a liquid crystal display to create the image. But instead of controlling each picture element with a transistor, Sony controls the pixels with plasma. The ionized gas essentially acts as an on-off switch.
Sony said the screen could be produced using less precise technology than the advanced semiconductor techn ology needed for active-matrix liquid crystal displays. That should result in lower costs. But the company gave no information regarding costs or prices.
Sony will have to play catch-up with the existing plasma technology. Fujitsu Ltd. is already selling 21-inch plasma displays and expects to begin making 42-inch displays at about the same time as Sony begins selling its 25-inch screens.
In a separate development, the Sanyo Electric Company said it would begin selling a television set that would let consumers watch television shows in three dimensions.
The television set can convert two-dimensional images, from a broadcast, videotape or laser disk, into three dimensions by dividing the pictures into left-side and right-side images. Viewers wear special glasses to see the three-dimensional effect.
The new television set, 33.5 inches wide by 22 inches high, will be available only in Japan starting next month at a price of 380,000 yen, or about $4,500.

Another Peril Averted

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
Last time, you recall, I promised to discuss Presidential politics today but -- lucky, lucky you! -- it now seems we can skip it. I know, I know: You planned to skip it anyhow. I was hoping to skip it myself. Discussing Presidential politics on a sweet day in June, as Lyndon Johnson once said of the jokes at the Gridiron Dinner, is "about as much fun as throwing cow flops at the village idiot."
You never heard of the Gridiron Dinner? It's your basic old-fashioned showbiz roast in fancy dress. Once a year Washington media swells throw a white-tie party for America's biggest shots and entertain with good-fellow-type insults. 
 You know who Lyndon Johnson was. Of course. Long-ago President.
You may not know Howard Kurtz, however. He is the party to thank for saving us from talking Presidential politics today. Mr. Kurtz covers the news media for The Washington Post, and in Sunday's paper he discussed Presidential politics so adequately that nothing remains to be discussed.
In summary he said: With the election still 16 months off, talking Presidential politics is silly.
So why is it already such a hot-news item in Washington? Because news people down there, being not so hot at covering complicated stuff like Medicare and Medicaid, prefer to cook up the fun kind of story they love -- that's why.
"The race is on! Seabiscuit slow out of the gate! Gramm Cracker faltering at the first turn! On The Dole widening early lead, but he's not home yet, folks . . ."
Here I paraphrase most ham-handedly Mr. Kurtz's elegantly composed message. He will doubtless write to complain. Everybody does. It's gotten so you can't do anybody a rank injustice in a newspaper column anymore, or commit a thunderingly obvious error without hearing about it.
(Yes, Senator Arlen Specter, you are indeed a Republican moderate, and are making a commendable struggle to keep moderation alive in the Grand Old Party, and it was, therefore, unjust of this column to say that Republican moderates were being eaten by the right-wing crocodiles.)
(And yes, New York Times, it was wrong of this column to assert that the progress of the super-cyber-tele-cable-phoni-communications bill had been largely unreported by the press when, in fact, the Times reporter Edmund Andrews had for months done a tireless, first-rate job of reporting it.)
O.K., back to not discussing Presidential politics. I was tempted to do it only because I sometimes live close enough to Washington to catch the local fevers. These are transmitted through strange weekend television shows that seem to be watched by everybody in Washington and by nobody everyplace else.
Each show assembles four or five people with press passes and such aggressively held political views that they seem like paid agents of the Democratic or Republican Party. The day when even the dimmest reporter had too much self-respect to shill openly for a political party seems to have gone out with the linotype machine.
Those who know this scene say most of these birds have minimal interest in the news business anymore but, like all those bystanders who find themselves caught in the O. J. Simpson case, are shooting for big paydays in the lecture and publishing industries. Since TV glory requires a memorable character, you see these media star-yearners playing political slapstick on TV.
If you live within a 50-mile radius of Washington these shows are essential to the well-tempered weekend. After two or three, the viewer tends to agree with the shows' assumptions that vital matters are being discussed or, more likely, shouted about.
Television does this to people. The mind quickly stops struggling, then accepts whatever is being served on the menu. Like bean soup in the Senate dining room, the one subject always on the menu of these TV shows is Presidential politics. Weekend after election, they dwell on what Tuesday's election means for elections two years, four years, fourteen years from now. As Mr. Kurtz suggests, sure it's dumb, but it's more fun than government.
