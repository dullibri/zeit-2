HEADLINE: Weeklong Wonders: Quickly Qualifying to Drive a Bus

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
As Janet Lucci steered a 27,000-pound city bus down Bay Parkway in Bensonhurst, a passenger started yelling that she was driving too slowly.
"I'm gonna be late for work!" he shouted. "Speed it up, will you, honey!"
Ms. Lucci did not speed it up. It was her first day ferrying passengers and a 40-foot vehicle through the mean and unpredictable streets of New York, and she was taking no chances. 
 Before last week, Ms. Lucci, a 41-year-old former delicatessen owner, had never driven anything larger than a delivery van. But in just two days of classroom training and five days of driving an empty bus with an instructor, Ms. Lucci and the 37 other students in her class had gone from crashing into curbs and hitting telephone poles to picking up passengers and stopping on a dime.
Unlike airplane pilots, subway motormen and railroad engineers -- all of whom must train for months or even years before they are allowed take the controls with real people aboard -- New York City bus drivers are expected to master the fine points of the trade in less than a week.
 
A Horn and a Brake
 Despite the apparent pitfalls, the decades-old system seems to work pretty well: the Transit Authority reports very few accidents involving first-time bus drivers. Experienced drivers ride along with rookies for their first few weeks, and transit officials said that new drivers who have problems receive additional training.
But for a rookie, driving a bus for the first time is still a little scary. "I was really nervous at first because things happen that are beyond your control, like a car darting out or a person running into the street," Ms. Lucci said. "More than anything else you have to drive defensively."
Calvin Worrell, a 23-year-old college student who drove a B-60 bus from Williamsburg to Canarsie last week, greeted passengers on his maiden trip with a friendly hello but found his best friends to be his horn and his brake. He used both frequently. He honked his horn at pedestrians, and he honked at cars that came too close to the bus.
"Whenever I'm unsure what someone will do, I hit my horn to warn them I'm coming," Mr. Worrell said. "You can never be too careful." At the corner of Himrod and Wilson Streets, a truck stopped suddenly in front of the bus, and Mr. Worrell stamped on the brakes, sending passengers flying around the bus. A woman screamed. Another gasped.
William Bennett, a 22-year veteran driver who was on the bus to supervise Mr. Worrell, told him not to worry because "sudden stops sometimes happen." "Overall, he's a good driver because he's very conscientious," Mr. Bennett said.
Not everyone who applies to become a city bus driver makes it through the training. Applicants must first take a civil service test, pass a medical exam and drug test, obtain a learner's permit to drive a commercial vehicle and have a good driving record.
Last year, the Transit Authority was sharply criticized for hiring bus drivers with poor driving records and for failing to monitor drivers who may be medically unfit to operate buses.
As a result, the investigation by the inspector general of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority found, people who should have been disqualified as drivers under state regulations were hired and were later involved in serious bus accidents.
State regulations require that a bus driver applicant must not have more than three moving violations and no suspensions within three years of the application date.
 
Fear of Flying
 Transit Authority officials said the agency had now installed a computer link with the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles' data base to insure that they have up-to-date records of applicants' driving histories.
Transit officials said that an average of two to three people in every 30- to 40-member class do not become drivers, often because they are physically incapable of operating the bus -- like one woman who was too short to reach the pedals.
"Some people are just too afraid, and they never get the hang of it and end up dropping out before we tell them they are not cut out to be drivers," said Michael Donovan, a Transit Authority bus instructor. "But I am happy that we have this," Mr. Donovan said, pointing to a hand brake. "Otherwise, I'd have a very upset stomach with the way some students drive."
On an isolated Soundview Avenue in the Clasons Point section of the Bronx, Mr. Donovan teaches students to drive a city bus by having them make "zigzags" -- alternating from one side of the street to the other. At the end of the street the students turn the bus around and head back the other way. "This is a little boring at first but it will help you get a feel for how to handle it," he said, holding tight to the hand brake that he uses to stop the bus if a student goes too close to the curb.
 
300,000 Miles a Day
 Driving a city bus is not like driving a car. Obviously. Getting that across is easy -- getting the students to operate a bus correctly is not always so. For example, Mr. Donovan tells them that the proper way to steer a bus is to "push and pull" the steering wheel instead of using the "hand over hand" method that most people use to steer a car.
The demand for drivers has waned in the last year because service has been scaled back. But New York City's bus system remains the nation's largest, with more than 3,600 buses driven by 8,000 drivers on 220 bus routes in five boroughs. The buses carry 1.5 million passengers and travel about 300,000 miles on a typical day.
Transit officials said that in recent years the authority has received a record number of applicants for bus driving jobs, which they attribute to the weak local economy. In the first seven months of 1991, the Transit Authority hired 335 new bus operators, compared with 664 in all of last year. Beginning bus operators earn about $24,000 a year, with drivers reaching the maximum, $34,000 a year, after three years at the wheel.
Ms. Lucci said she tries to ignore passengers like the man who wanted her to drive faster and cars that try to outrun the bus. She recalled the advice of another instructor, John Grass: "Don't get mad at people who try to race you or cut you off. You and you alone are in charge of the bus.
"Those cars are like ants to you. You can crush them with your big bus, but you better not."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
A Publisher Turns Its Final Page

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Battered by debts and the most severe advertising slump in years, Family Media Inc., the publisher of Discover, Health and five other magazines, announced yesterday that it would close its doors immediately. The shutdown is considered the largest failure of a media enterprise since the recession began a year ago.
The closing ends more than a year of speculation in the media and advertising industries over the fate of the New York publisher, whose magazines covered health, science, sports and home improvement. 
 While the closing underscores the severity of the publishing recession, which has claimed a newsstand full of victims like 7 Days, Fame and California, it also provides fresh evidence that American business is coming back to earth after the debt-amassing 1980's.
 
'Returning to Reality'
 "Like real estate, like banking, like retailing, we are returning to reality after a hyped-up decade," said Myrna Blyth, the publishing director and editor in chief of The Ladies' Home Journal, which was owned by Family Media from 1982 to 1986.
But "magazines with a strong franchise, that deliver to their readers and deliver for their advertisers, should remain strong," she said. "The weak ones will fall by the wayside."
Especially weak, industry executives say, are publishers in the same predicament as Family Media: competing against bigger companies with deeper pockets and wider holdings.
Family Media's closing will put 209 people out of work, most, if not all, in New York City. In addition to Discover and Health, the closing affects Golf Illustrated, Homeowner, 1,001 Home Ideas and Tennis Illustrated, formerly known as World Tennis, as well as Your Family, a magazine distributed through doctors' waiting rooms.
In a memo read to surprised employees yesterday morning at the company's headquarters at 3 Park Avenue, Robert E. Riordan, the chairman, wrote, "Due to the continual downturn in advertising, and an economy which hinders the ability to borrow new money, we are unable to continue our operations effective today."
While discussions are continuing to sell the company's holdings, Mr. Riordan wrote, "We have come to the conclusion that even if any of these negotiations were to reach fruition, it would still not allow us to continue."
A spokeswoman for Family Media, Leslie Jay, said neither Mr. Riordan nor Bruce Barnet, the president, would respond to questions. An interview with Mr. Riordan, scheduled for yesterday, was canceled.
Mr. Riordan's other media holdings are believed to be unaffected. These holdings include FM Business Publications, New York, a publisher of four trade magazines; a printing plant in Atlanta, and a direct-marketing operation in Florida.
 
Steep Level of Debt
 A front-page article in this week's issue of Advertising Age reignited speculation that Family Media would go out of business. The trade publication reported that the privately held company had an overall debt of $60 million to $70 million. The debt, considered steep for a publisher whose advertising revenues last year totaled an estimated $60 million, was taken on as Mr. Riordan bought titles like Discover and spent lavishly to introduce and reintroduce titles like Model and Savvy Woman, both of which have already succumbed.
"The problem was not just the magazines," said James R. Guthrie, executive vice president of the Magazine Publishers of America, the industry's trade association. "On balance, the magazines are doing as well as, or slightly above, the average."
Mr. Guthrie attributed part of Family Media's problem to timing. "Timing is everything, and the times changed too quickly for some," he said. "What we are looking at here is the residual effect of someone trying to do so many things at once in the halcyon days of magazine advertising, which ended in 1989."
 
A Frenzy of Activities
 After selling The Ladies' Home Journal to the Meredith Corporation for a profit estimated at $84 million, Mr. Riordan, who founded Family Media in 1976, became engaged in a frenzy of activities: buying Discover from Time Inc., seeking to become a power in women's fashion publishing with Model and Taxi, and even buying a yacht, which he rechristened the Savvy Lady and sent plying the waters around Manhattan to entertain potential advertisers and their agencies.
"If the bank is knocking at your door, you don't have a chance," said Paul DuCharme, vice president and director of print media for the Grey Advertising agency in New York. That is especially true, he added, for "stand-alone and small publishing companies with secondary or tertiary titles."
"They're in a lot of trouble right now," he said.
Among the stronger companies that industry executives said could gain advertising and circulation in the wake of Family Media's misfortunes are Rodale Press and the Reader's Digest Association, whose Prevention and American Health magazines, respectively, compete with Health.
The executives also mentioned the Times Mirror Company, whose Golf magazine competes with Family Media's Golf Illustrated, and The New York Times Company Magazine Group, whose Golf Digest and Tennis magazines compete with Golf Illustrated and Tennis Illustrated.
 
Speculation About Buyers
 Mr. DuCharme expects other publishers to buy some of Family Media's titles, but perhaps only on a circulation liability basis -- that is, subscribers to the Family Media magazines would start receiving copies of the buyer's magazines.
One industry executive, who asked not to be identified, said Discover might already have been sold to a long-rumored suitor, the Disney Publishing unit of the Walt Disney Company. A telephone call to Disney Publishing was not returned.
At Family Media's offices yesterday, the scene was "awful," said one employee, describing how colleagues were crying and struggling to learn the details of their severance and benefits packages.
"The human toll of a story like this is never told," said the employee, who asked not to be identified, "but people gave up a lot to work here. It was a sweatshop at times, but we created some great magazines." Health, for instance, recently won an award from the American Pyschiatric Association -- due to be presented next week.
The sweatshop reference spoke to Mr. Riordan's well-established reputation in the industry as a publisher whom admirers called lean and mean, but whose detractors contended skimped on expenses that other publishers deemed necessary. One former employee, who asked not to be identified, said that in producing Model, Mr. Riordan asked staff members to use "girls from your neighborhood" for photo layouts instead of hiring professional models.
"We have to be out of the offices by Friday," the employee said, "but it's bring-your-own-boxes."

HEADLINE: New York City Embraces Notion Of Selling Cheaply Priced Bonds

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
On Monday, a Wall Street bond broker suggested to Mayor David N. Dinkins that New York City sell municipal bonds in denominations as small as $250.
A good idea, city officials said. So good, in fact, that the city was already working on a similar plan. 
 "We have been talking at the staff level about a payroll-deduction plan for city employees," said Michael W. Geffrard, deputy executive director in the city's Office for Economic Development. "But for the fact that we had other fires to fight, we would have implemented some sort of plan by now."
Mr. Geffrard expects that sales of so-called mini-bonds through payroll deduction will start within a year. In addition to the city's 250,000 employees, Mr. Geffrard said, the base of potential buyers could be enlarged if big corporations joined the program.
 
Reaching Smaller Investors
 City officials and analysts said the bonds, which would be free of city, state and Federal taxes, would help the city borrow the money it needs, perhaps at a lower cost. In traditional bond sales, the minimum purchase is $5,000, and securities firms concentrate on selling to large institutions and wealthy individuals.
"The mini-bonds are a way for the city to reach a group of investors who are not being reached by the Wall Street firms," said Robert C. Apfel, an adviser to local governments and president of the Fiduciary Communications Company. "Sometimes government officials become so concerned about keeping the Wall Street firms happy that they forget all about the little people who would also buy their bonds."
The proposal for mini-bonds offered to Mayor Dinkins on Monday, in a day of meetings with the public, came from James A. Lebenthal, chairman of Lebenthal & Company, who had previously discussed the idea with city officials.
Unlike the pending city plan, his idea does not involve payroll deductions, but calls for the city to hire securities firms to sell non-interest-bearing bonds at low prices, which would be worth much more when they mature. For example, a bond sold now for $232.63 could be worth $500 when it matures in 10 years, equaling a yield of 7.8 percent over that period.
"The idea depends on mass marketing," Mr. Lebenthal said. Because the profit margin in small-sized bonds would be so small, he said "it's not economical to use traditional brokers."

HEADLINE: Ex-Head of Peru Denies Charges in B.C.C.I. Case

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Indignant, scornful and plaintive, Alan Garcia, the former President of Peru, rejected accusations today of any personal wrongdoing in his country's dealings with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
Mr. Garcia, who returned on Monday from a month's stay in Paris and Brussels, called a news conference today to formally denounce Peruvian legislators who have accused him of profiting illegally while he was in office from mid-1985 to mid-1990. While Mr. Garcia was President, Peru placed more than $250 million of its reserves with the Panamanian office of B.C.C.I. in return for relatively little, investigators say, referring to a modest interest rate and line of credit. 
 Last week in New York, a state grand jury indicted B.C.C.I. on money laundering and bribery charges, including one count that said the bank paid $3 million in bribes to two former Peruvian central bank officials in return for the country's cash reserves. The funds were eventually withdrawn and no money was lost when the bank's offices were seized last month.
Mr. Garcia left Peru on July 3, two days before regulators around the world shut down the B.C.C.I. offices. He said he spent the month abroad trying to get more documentation to refute charges of accounts in foreign banks. His remarks today were his first since the indictment, which has reignited one investigation of corruption and spurred new ones.
 
Accusers Called 'Delinquents'
 Mr. Garcia said today that he had made no decisions on placing the money. He characterized those making allegations against him as "delinquents," "liars," "scandal mongers," "purveyors of calumnies" and "frauds," and predicted that he and his party would emerge victorious.
"The insinuations about the involvement of ex-President Alan Garcia with the reserves of Peru, I want to say to everyone that this is a new lie that comes from the same falsifiers and delinquents who have already demonstrated to the entire country to what point they have no scruples and are willing to invent documents and change testimony," Mr. Garcia said.
Mr. Garcia said he had successfully rebutted accusations that he had hidden $50 million in foreign bank accounts by producing letters from officials at each bank that said he had no accounts there. He said the attack on him was really an effort by members of smaller political parties in Peru to weaken his American Popular Revolutionary Alliance, called Apra, Peru's largest political party.
 
'One Gunshot'
 "This has nothing to do with the ex-President of Peru," Mr. Garcia said. "Apra continues to be the political alternative to the current Government. I have always told people that one gunshot is much cheaper than all of this scandal." In other words, if his political opponents want to debilitate his party, Mr. Garcia said with his characteristic bravado, eliminating him is the easiest way.
The banking accusations against the 42-year-old Mr. Garcia come as he fights for his political life. In April, a special commission of Peru's House of Delegates released reports by two private American investigators that listed bank accounts they said Mr. Garcia held, totaling $50 million.
Commission members said that there was more evidence in the United States but that it was available only if the Peruvian Congress lifted Mr. Garcia's immunity from prosecution, which is bestowed on all former Presidents here.
 
A Malpractice Charge
 Within weeks Mr. Garcia and his Apra allies had effectively discredited those reports by producing the letters he mentioned today. He also succeeded in getting the State of Florida to charge one of the investigators with malpractice.
Indeed, members of the Peruvian Congress began talking about a return of Mr. Garcia to power in 1995 and the demise of his political nemisis and head of the investigative commission, Fernando Olivera.
The only issue that hung over Mr. Garcia's head at that point was that Peru had maintained large deposits in B.C.C.I.'s Panama office at a time when the office was experiencing difficulties. And even there Mr. Garcia's aide, Jorge del Castillo, was able to effectively argue that such decisions were made by the autonomous central bank and that Mr. Garcia had nothing to do with them.
There are three investigations under way into Peru's ties to B.C.C.I. Panama and they will inevitably encompass Mr. Garcia's actions.
The investigation by the House of Delegates is likely to continue for a while. Members of that commission testified last week before a United States Senate subcommitee about Peru's central bank deposits with B.C.C.I.
On Tuesday evening, the Peruvian Senate also voted to form a commission to look into the Peruvian central bank's dealings with B.C.C.I. Panama. Mr. Garcia, who as a former President is a member of the Senate for life, said today that he told his colleagues, "Do what you have to do, and do it quickly," a reference to what Jesus told Judas before he was betrayed.
Finally, the Peruvian Attorney General, Pedro Mendez, said he was conducting an investigation of the two Peruvian officials accused by the New York grand jury of receiving bribes from B.C.C.I. -- the former central bank president, Leonel Figueroa, and the former general manager, Hector Neyra. The indictment named the bank, not the former Peruvian officials.
Mr. Garcia denied having any contact with B.C.C.I. and said he had never put pressure on the central bank to put the country's reserves there. He reiterated that the reserves were placed in B.C.C.I. Panama to avoid retribution by multinational banks after Peru declared a moratorium on almost all of its debt payments several years ago.

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Fell in June

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Consumer credit fell 3.0 percent in June, the sixth decline in seven months and the largest drop since January, the Government said today. At the same time, automobile loans were down for the sixth straight month and credit card spending slowed.
"People are more cautious," said Michael K. Evans, who heads an economic forecasting firm in Washington.
The Federal Reserve said consumer credit fell by a seasonally adjusted $1.83 billion in June after a revised $1.33 billion drop in May. That decrease, 2.2 percent, was more than twice as large as the $626 million decline first estimated a month ago.
The June drop was the largest since installment loans fell 3.5 percent, or $2.14 billion, in January. Installment loans this year grew only in April, when they posted a 1.9 percent gain.
 
Delaying Big Purchases
 Consumer credit includes all consumer loans except mortgages and home-equity debt. It helps finance much of overall consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
Michael P. Niemira, an economist with Mitsubishi Bank in New York, said the recent declines in installment loans "reflect the recession's impact on spending patterns more than a desire to pay down credit outstanding."
Except for the brief spurt in April, installment loans have fallen every month since December, when they dropped for the first time since February 1989.
 
Fewer Loans for Cars
 Loans for automobiles continued to provide a drag in June, declining 10.2 percent after a 13.9 percent decrease in May.
The recession has been especially difficult for the automobile industry, with the last increase in borrowing for new vehicles in December, when it advanced 3.6 percent. Still, automobile sales rose in June, indicating that customers were buying less expensive cars and making bigger down payments.
The growth in revolving credit, which includes credit cards, slowed to 2.2 percent, from a 6.9 percent gain the previous month. Mr. Evans, the economic forecaster, said the decrease reflected lower retail sales in June.

HEADLINE: VETO BY WEICKER BLOCKS 3D BUDGET

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. vetoed a budget for the third time today, but in a scornful veto message he offered legislators no clear options except to override it or give up their opposition to an income tax.
"The whole Coalition III is a gimmick," he said, referring to the name given to the third budget without an income tax passed by a coalition of Republicans and Democrats. "Actually, gimmick is the kind word for what is the shame and scandal of our generation." 
 Legislative leaders said they were hopeful that the State Senate and the House would vote to override the veto and force upon Mr. Weicker his first budget as Governor. With Mr. Weicker's veto speech hardly calculated to win over opponents, legislators said some who had voted against the budget would now vote against the veto to put at least a temporary end to the five-week stalemate.
 
'Doesn't Hurt Anymore'
 "There is a point at which people have bashed their heads against a wall so long that it doesn't hurt anymore," said Senator Kevin B. Sullivan, a Democrat from West Hartford who has supported an income tax. That point, he said, had been reached.
The State Senate and the House can override the Governor's veto with two-thirds majority votes. The latest budget was approved by a 19-to-17 vote in the Senate and a 77-to-70 vote in the House.
There appeared to be little chance that the veto risked a shutdown of state offices like that in the first week of July, when Mr. Weicker furloughed 20,000 employees because his second veto left Connecticut without a budget at the start of the fiscal year.
This time the Governor said he was open to adopting another temporary spending measure to keep the government going, if the legislature failed to override his veto. Legislators said that lacking such a measure, he could continue to keep offices open by executive order, as he has this week.
Mr. Weicker, in a speech broadcast live at noon, said he was vetoing the $7.6 billion plan before him because it was $623 million out of balance, hurt the poor and middle class by expanding the 8 percent sales tax, raised business taxes amid a recession, and did not start paying off a billion-dollar deficit from the last fiscal year.
He accused some legislators of voting for the patchwork plan for political gain, and others of voting for it out of exhaustion, to end a deadlock that has left Connecticut the only state without a budget, more than five weeks into the fiscal year.
 
'The Wink of an Eye'
"Yes, it would be easy for me to sign this budget, devised in the wink of an eye on scrap paper and cocktail napkins, and then stand back to watch it crash and burn," he said. "I do not wish that ill on its proponents. I will not visit that ill upon the state."
Mr. Weicker's veto message was aimed at the public, rather than legislators. With a large chart behind him, he described how the budget's more than $800 million in higher taxes and fees would affect a family with a $43,500 annual income, taking more from them in sales taxes, gasoline taxes, a fee on a home-equity loan used for college expenses and a higher tax rate on a grandmother's dividends and interest income.
The choice, he said, was not between an income tax and no tax increase at all, but between a tax plan that worked and one like this that not only struck at those already paying high taxes but also would require more taxes to balance it later this year.
"I came to this office because the people of Connecticut broke the political mold at election time," concluded Mr. Weicker, who was elected last November as an independent governor without a political party. "I will not accept the old creative-accounting mold at budget time. We have the honest numbers. On with the honest job."
 
No Long-Term Solutions
 But the Governor's harsh gibes at the General Assembly won votes only for an overriding of his veto, if any votes at all. "It wasn't a real friendly type speech," Representative Richard J. Balducci, the House Speaker, said with a grimace.
After working with Mr. Weicker on several income-tax plans, Mr. Balducci said, he would vote for a second time to override a veto.
But unlike the last time, he said, if he voted against the veto, he would also actively lobby other House Democrats to vote with him.
This budget offered no long-term solutions, he said, but it had passed the legislature three times and would slow the state's slide into debt until legislators, cooled off, could return in the fall to repair it.
Representative Edward C. Krawiecki, the Republican minority leader in the House, said, "The issue is clearly in the lap of the Speaker."
Legislators have long lost patience with Mr. Weicker's criticisms of their plans. The income-tax proposals that the Governor has supported would be $600 million out of balance by now and require higher taxes because the state's finances have worsened without a budget, Mr. Krawiecki said, adding that the Governor's insistence on quickly paying off the debt was a ruse to justify the need for an income tax. It was time for the Governor to offer a solution rather than sit judgment on them.
 
Eroding Tax Revenues
 "If the Governor has a better way of doing business, I would ask him to put his proposal on the table," Mr. Krawiecki said.
After all, he continued, "a budget could have been adopted in June, one could have been adopted in July, and now one could have been adopted in August."
Connecticut accumulated a $937 million deficit in the last fiscal year as spending continued to increase while the recession ate away at sales-tax and corporate-profits tax revenues. What has been clear for months is that a billion dollars in new and replacement revenues had to be found, in any budget, to avoid a similar deficit this fiscal year.
In February, Governor Weicker proposed a first-ever tax on wages as the solution, and by May positions had hardened into nearly their final form. The Democratic leadership in the House had supported his plan, but Democratic leaders in the Senate joined with Republicans in an anti-income-tax majority.
Today, Mr. Weicker said a budget that worked, not an income tax, was the issue.

HEADLINE: Jim Crow's Ghost; Savannah and Civil Rights -- A Special Report;
Ways of Older South Linger In City of Thomas's Boyhood

BYLINE: By MARTIN GOTTLIEB with PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAVANNAH, Ga.

 BODY:
In January 1964, a half-year after this seductive, unhurried river city banished its segregated lunch counters and water fountains, a triumphant Martin Luther King Jr. arrived here to hail the passing of Jim Crow.
The moment, later captured in a local photo exhibition proudly entitled "We Ain't What We Used to Be," is still remembered as one of the purest and sweetest in the often sorrowful 250-year history of blacks in Savannah. 
 Blacks here today clearly are not what they were when Clarence Thomas, President Bush's nominee for the Supreme Court, grew up in the city 30 years ago -- second-class citizens in a world where segregation had the force of law.
But in place of the clarity of Dr. King's visit, there are sobering ambiguities these days that underscore how long and hard the black struggle for equality has been in Savannah and how resistant the problems have been to solution.
The civil rights movement and the Great Society have changed aspects of life here forever, banishing the humiliating dual society and leading to advances in health, literacy and political representation.
There have also been tragic disappointments -- alarming increases in violence, teen-age pregnancy and drug abuse; an unforeseen collapse of black business activity after integration; a failure to convert political gains to economic ones that has left the black unemployment rate exactly where it was in 1960 -- twice that of whites.
But the most striking reality may be other aspects of Savannah's institutional life that have remained unchanged -- the absence of blacks from the city's financial leadership and the de facto segregation, which still determines where people live, socialize and pray. It often leaves prosperous parts of Savannah, like the successfully rebuilt tourist Mecca of River Street, full of white faces, and the shabbiest parts of town peopled by blacks.
The solutions offered by Judge Thomas, who now sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, are starkly different from those of traditional civil rights groups. A conservative Republican, Judge Thomas calls for a renewed up-by-the-bootstraps ethic and opposes many Government programs, including various forms of affirmative action. While the civil rights groups have been supportive of black self-help efforts, they have long pushed for government initiatives that the judge considers destructive.
"Those who attempt to capture the daily counseling, oversight, common sense, and vision of my grandparents in a governmental program are engaging in sheer folly," he said in an address before the Heritage Foundation four years ago.
To some outsiders, Judge Thomas's views and standing as a black Republican mark him as a turncoat to the gains of the past three decades; to others, they offer a refreshing sense of clarity.
 
Between Past and Present
 But the world he grew up in this city of twisted oaks, elegant brownstones and mean hovels -- a world that for blacks as well as whites tends to be more conservative than that of other cities -- suggests something else. His views reflect a piece of the subtle interplay between past and present, resistance and accommodation, and integration and self-reliance that have played out in the black community here over centuries like a symphony's recurring themes.
Judge Thomas's bootstrap conservatism is appealing to some blacks at a time when the social fabric is so threatened that they think life may in many ways be harder now than it was in the 1950's.
"When I first moved to Savannah 10 years ago, I thought it was the nicest place in the world to live," said Jacquelyn Cleveland, a black high school teacher who grew up in a Brooklyn housing project. "But as I've lived here, the city has begun to fall apart -- there's such a big gap between the haves and have-nots. There's more opportunity, but less acceptance of authority." Referring to the Court nominee's call for self-reliance, she said, "I have no problem with Thomas."
For others, like Howard Alls, a 32-year-old lawyer who ran for mayor unsuccessfully this year, Judge Thomas offers no solutions, just an insidious call to forget the legacy of more than 200 years of racism.
"People complain about the lack of success that black males have, but it's like crippling someone and then complaining about the way they walk," he said.
Still, for those of either view, Judge Thomas has crystallized the degree to which blacks are looking back on the civil rights revolution of the 1960's and assessing why the gains have not been greater.
Reflecting on the days of segregation, Otis Johnson, a civil rights veteran and former alderman, said: "For the average black in Savannah, they are doing the same kind of work they would have done. They may be economically worse off. They haven't received the education where they can advance. Politically, there are elected officials in all areas, but they are in the minority. Socially, this community is still basically segregated. I think we need a period of reassessment."
 
Beginnings
Slavery Yields To Jim Crow
 James Oglethorpe founded Savannah in 1733 as a humane farming community built around symmetrical urban squares where slave labor was outlawed. Twenty distinctive shaded squares remain, but the prohibition against slavery lasted only until 1750, and the slave trade became one of Savannah's leading businesses.
For Savannah's blacks, who now make up more than half the population of 140,000, history in different ways has repeated this story of inflated expectations and dashed hopes in which almost every opened door has led to a brick wall.
A month after he completed his March to the Sea here in December 1864, for example, Gen. William T. Sherman issued Field Order 15, giving confiscated plantation land to newly freed blacks. Six months later, after Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, President Andrew Johnson rescinded the order. Jobs that went to blacks after the Civil War were soon taken by whites, and by the end of the century Jim Crow reigned.
For years, the blacks in Savannah held themselves together through self-reliance and racial solidarity.
Early in the century, Savannah had active chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and Booker T. Washington's National Negro Business League. Until the Depression, there were seven black banks and a thriving business district with two movie theaters, variety stores, confectionery shops and other businesses. Of the black banks, only one survives.
When Clarence Thomas came to Savannah in 1955, he was 7 years old. He was sent to live here with his grandparents after a fire destroyed the family's wooden shack in Pin Point, a lush tract of ramshackle homes on the marshy banks of what is now called Moon River. The unincorporated community, seven miles from town, remains a caricature of a self-reliant -- or underserviced -- enclave, where the county first provided running water about four years ago, according to residents, and still does not provide street lights, household garbage pickup or even fire-protection service.
Judge Thomas's grandfather, Myers Anderson, a bull-necked man who worked seven days a week as a purveyor of ice, wood, cinderblocks and real estate, became the judge's role model.
Through another black entrepreneur, Sam Williams, Mr. Anderson became involved in St. Benedict the Moor Roman Catholic Church, where Clarence Thomas attended grade school and came under the influence of Irish nuns, whom he still venerates, and the N.A.A.C.P.
Myers Anderson regularly attended the organization's Sunday afternoon meetings. Otis Johnson recalls them as a deep ritual through most of the 60's and remembers Clarence Thomas accompanying his grandfather on occasion. Besides the meetings, huge voter-registration drives and sit-ins at lunch counters, the city was consumed by a 16-month boycott by black people of its main shopping boulevard and daily marches.
The Establishment in Savannah had always been tightly knit. Trying to avoid bloodshed, it formed a group of 100 -- which some pointedly called "The House of Lords" -- and entered into negotiations with black representatives that minimized violence and in 1963 led to the relatively quiet desegregation of restaurants, theaters, hotels and public facilities. Litigation later forced a more contentious desegregation of the county's schools.

 
Progress
Federal Money Changes Lives
 The changes wrought by this upheaval and an era of Federal programs are indisputable. The Hill-Burton Act subsidized the financing in the mid-1950's of Memorial Hospital, Savannah's first regional hospital, and led to an eventual overhaul of the antiquated and segregated health system. With the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965, infant mortality rates, particularly among blacks, began to plummet.
Peter Scardino, a urologist and former Savannah Medical Society president, said the Federal programs led to an increase in his patient load of one-third within a year and, with all his patients able to pay for the first time, a doubling of his gross income.
There were improvements in education, although the public schools have some of the lowest achievement levels in Georgia. In 1960, blacks attended school an average of only seven years in Chatham County. By 1980, the figure had increased to 11.1 years, nearly the same as the average for whites.
There were other breakthroughs. Perhaps the one that achieved the greatest national attention was the use of Federal housing funds by a local organization to extend efforts to rehabilitate the city's beautiful stock of old housing to include black neighborhoods.
On a personal level, the city is filled with people, from the higher reaches of government to the hard-pressed residents of the housing projects, whose lives have been helped by the sorts of programs that might draw Judge Thomas's suspicion. Henry J. Moore, an assistant city manager who got his first administrative experience under a government job-training program in Maryland, is now in charge of all the Federal funds coming into the city. Carolyn Coleman, a resident of the Yamacraw Village housing project, recently saw her daughter graduate from college. She was the first member of the family to go to college, thanks partly to the Federal Upward Bound program.
Most pointedly, there is Emma Mae Martin, Judge Thomas's sister, who was the subject of some of the most exasperated statements he was quoted as making at a conference of black conservatives in 1980: "She gets mad when the mailman is late with her welfare check. That is how dependent she is. What's worse is that now her kids feel entitled to the check, too.
In an interview in her weather-battered yellow frame house in Pin Point, Mrs. Martin said that she had been forced onto welfare periodically after her husband abandoned her and her small children and she became too sick to work. But, she said, she had only remained on the program once for a sustained period. This was between 1977 and 1981, when an aunt asked her to care for her when she became sick. She said the aunt had taken in her family, including Clarence, in the early 50's after their house burned down.
"It was one of the things I promised her because she didn't want to live in a nursing home," Mrs. Martin said.
When the aunt died, Mrs. Martin inherited her house in Pin Point and, rather than become dependent on welfare, returned to work. She now is a cook at Candler General Hospital, which had been for whites only until the early 60's.
Notwithstanding the seeming harshness of his quotes about her welfare involvement, Mrs. Martin said she and her brother are close. "He understood why I had to be on it," she said.
But there are bleaker stories in Savannah as well, stories of despair, stories of drugs -- crack use is at epidemic proportions -- and stories that end in death: the murder rate this year is on a record-breaking pace.
The economic statistics are sobering. All indications are that income for blacks remains as little as 60 percent of that for whites. At best, a handful of blacks are on the board's of local corporations or partners in major law firms.
Politically, blacks hold three of eight City Council seats, but have never come close to electing a mayor or controlling City Hall, something that many politicians say is a result of an inability to put aside differences and unite behind a single candidate.
While three of the five candidates in this year's Democratic mayoral primary were black, none made the runoff, in which Mayor John Rousakis came from behind to win by carrying virtually every black precinct.
Socially, more than 60 percent of black children are born to unwed mothers, three times the rate of a generation ago. The rate for whites has skyrocketed, too, but still does not reach 15 percent. Meanwhile, in many neighborhoods residents are afraid to be on the streets. On the block of 32d Street where Clarence Thomas grew up and where his mother still lives in a neat lime-green house, there are four abandoned buildings. Neighbors say they keep their distance because of late-night drug dealing.
The city has attempted to combat the problems with a variety of programs, many aimed at helping black neighborhoods and businesses, but the effectiveness of these is a matter of bitter contention.
Some whites, looking at the slow pace of black progress, blame a local paternalism. "I think there is a fear on the part of the powers that be -- they don't want any change because it would change their lives," said Betti M. Sands, former head of a now-defunct Savannah urban research institute who now heads the United Way in Fresno, Calif.
More common is a view that the black experience mirrors the slow pace of change here in general. Arnold Tenenbaum, president of Chatham Steel Company, said: "One of the big gaps here is that there is not a substantial black business middle class. He says it is naive to think self-help is an adequate remedy for Savannah's blacks.
"Absolutely, there is a role for whites," he said. "I would not want to be a young black person trying to escape from poverty and all the other conditions associated with that on my own."

 
Lessons
Winding Road, Hard Journey
 No black person in Savannah would want to go all the way back. Still, for many who grew up or live in Savannah, Judge Thomas's views strike a responsive chord, not necessarily as a rejection of the civil rights agenda but more as a voice for deeply rooted values often left out of the public discourse.
Of course, not everyone is impressed. "How you going to pull up by the bootstraps when you don't have any boots?" asked Sam Williams, the entrepreneur who was the friend of Judge Thomas's grandfather.
City officials and community leaders complain that Reagan-era Federal cutbacks, rather than Federal programs, are exacerbating social problems. City officials say that community development and job-training funds have been cut nearly in half over the past decade.
"It's very discouraging," said Lee Adler, a Savannah banker and leading preservationist. Speaking of a severely cut-back Federal housing program, he said, "The Section 8 funds are very hard to come by, and without them you can't really do anything for low-income people."
But Judge Thomas's views resonate with those of many black Savannahians who share a social conservatism, a belief in self-help and a frustration with the loss of black businesses and local role models.
"I think the old giveaway programs from the Federal Government have not made us strong enough to go ahead on our own," said Willie Brown, an alderman and unsuccessful mayoral candidate this year.
Veronica Mars, who heads the tenants' association at the Yamacraw Village housing project, does not share Judge Thomas's hostility toward government programs, but she likes what she hears about his religious background and what she believes is his opposition to abortion.
"The biggest mistake they made was when they took God out of the schools," said Ms. Mars. "If you ask me where the answers are, I'd say they're in prayer."
Even for many veterans of the civil rights movement, there is a sense that blacks have come to rely too much on government.
"I share a lot of his views," said Otis Johnson, the former civil rights leader and alderman who now heads the Chatham-Savannah Youth Futures Authority, which works with troubled youths. "In a large segment of the community, we have developed a dependency syndrome. You can't keep blaming someone else for all your problems."
Carlton Stewart, who attended Catholic school with Clarence Thomas in Savannah, followed him to Holy Cross and Washington, reflected: "His grandfather had his business, mine had a bakery. Most of those black businesses have gone. It's like our communities have been taken over by others, and those not taken over have been left to decay."
 
On Doors and Bootstraps
 To some, that view of the problems may be accurate, but the prescription -- a vague call for self-help -- fails to take into account the systemic racism that still blocks opportunities for blacks. Similarly, the notion that the son of a crack-addicted 14-year-old mother simply needs to find a way to pull himself up by his bootstraps strikes others as hoplessly naive.
"It's fine to say affirmative action and desegregation and those kind of things are not the answer to solving the problems of the black community, but what does Judge Thomas suggest instead?" asked Diane Harvey Johnson, a former state representative who owns a marketing and consulting firm. "I can't say that just because I'm making it, all other black people ought to do the same thing. That's very unrealistic."
There is little new about Savannah's doors opening partway to blacks and then, in important ways, closing tight again. What is new is the degree to which what is happening in this old port city, serenely emblematic of the Old South, is happening everywhere.
There are the stores and jobs that have fled from moribund Broughton Street downtown for the outlying malls. There are the sweaty manual jobs like those in Pin Point's abandoned crab-packing plant giving way to those that are out of reach for high school dropouts. There is the flow of drugs and the disastrous increase in teen-age pregnancy.
Back in the civil rights era, some cynics in the South used to say that the Mason-Dixon line really begins at the Canadian border. True or not, more than ever Savannah's quandary mirrors the nation's.
"You would have thought things would have progressed more than they have," Myers Anderson's old friend Sam Williams said the other day. "I really didn't think it would go on like this."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Democrats' Distress Grows As Presidential Field Shrinks

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug 7

 BODY:
Democrats struggled today to adjust to the last thing they needed six months before the Iowa caucuses: an already tiny Presidential field that keeps shrinking.
As expected, Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th announced in Charleston, W.Va., today that he would not seek the 1992 Democratic Presidential nomination. That announcement, just three weeks after Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, took himself out of the race, combined with the demurrals of other Democratic heavyweights to create a frustrating, embarrassing pattern for the party. 
 While the West Virginia Democrat struggled to cast his decision as a personal one, it left a clear public perception that one leading Democrat after another was looking at the 1992 campaign and deciding that George Bush could not be beaten.
"Am I frustrated?" asked Phil Angelides, chairman of the California Democratic Party. "Absolutely."
"The role of an opposition party is to offer alternatives," said Mr. Angelides, who argued that the Bush Administration had real vulnerabilities.
Representative Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, said, "This is no longer an entertaining situation. This is becoming a serious problem."
Senator Rockefeller's withdrawal is expected to open new opportunities for those who seem eager to run, like Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa. It is also expected to heighten the pressure on Senator Al Gore of Tennessee and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York to enter the race.
In the modern world of nominating politics, this is remarkably late for a novice to mount a Presidential campaign, particularly one against a popular President. Both Mr. Gore, who ran in 1988, and Mr. Cuomo are widely considered to have the name recognition, political base and fund-raising potential to jump into the race late and mount a formidable campaign.
"In previous Presidential campaigns, people were now dispatching their state campaign managers with well-defined plans," Mr. Torricelli said. "I'm not certain there's anyone now considering a race other than Mario Cuomo who could make up for the lost time."
While Mr. Gore is considering a race, Mr. Cuomo has repeatedly said he had neither plans nor plans to make plans for a Presidential campaign.
Still, the New York State Democratic Chairman, John Marino, suggested today that Mr. Cuomo had time. "An Al Gore, a Lloyd Bentsen, a Cuomo, people who have recognition and some base, that kind of person can wait longer than most people say is traditional," Mr. Marino said. "I didn't think the process was so bad in 1960, when it was much more confined."
 
The Price of Delay
 The party has an enormous stake in these collective personal decisions. In the South and elsewhere, Democratic leaders worry about the impact of a weak Presidential ticket on House and Senate candidates. And they worry about the party's image in general.
"If we don't have folks attracting folks to their campaign and therefore to the party, we pay a long-term price," said James Ruvolo, a member of the Democratic National Committee from Ohio.
Mr. Ruvolo and others have argued that candidates interested in 1996 should be out running in 1992, and there is an undercurrent of annoyance about those who choose to sit this race out.
"I don't put Jay in this category," Mr. Angelides said, referring to Mr. Rockefeller, "because I think he wrestled with it. But I would say that for those people who would lead us in 1996: now is when we need leaders."
Still, the Democrats have a recent history of repudiating their failed nominees, a fact that weighs heavily with many potential candidates.
Mr. Rockefeller, who began actively exploring a Presidential candidacy in May, asserted that he believed that President Bush was beatable. But he said he lacked the time to both mount a campaign and plan a Presidency. But Mr. Rockefeller's effort to cast his decision as purely personal was greeted with some scorn by the Republicans. "It's another big-name Democrat who got all prepared, got up to the starting gate, blinked and backed out," said Charles Black, a top Republican strategist strategist, "which certainly speaks to what they think their prospects of winning are."
 
Some Signs of Life
 Despite Mr. Rockefeller's withdrawal, there is some stirring in the party. Mr. Harkin has been rousing the party faithful, while Mr. Clinton seems to be moving ever closer to candidacy. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia is testing the waters, and former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts is carrying the banner as the party's only announced candidate. The Rev. Jesse Jackson is also still thought to be considering a race.
Some Democrats had felt in recent weeks that they were finally drawing some blood from the White House over domestic issues; the President himself seemed slightly rattled by it last week. And today, Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, declared, "One less candidate in the primaries will not erase the fact that this country and our economy is drifting from bad to worse and George Bush doesn't have a clue how to fix it."
Still, it is shaping up as a strangely spare field for the Democrats. And as the clock winds down, the heavyweights -- Bentsen, Cuomo, Gephardt -- are demurring, and a promising newcomer, Mr. Rockefeller, is now joining them on the sidelines.

BYLINE: By Peter M. Nichols

 BODY:
It's getting harder to find a good $25 movie these days -- a new one, that is. Prices of $90 and more for new titles do not bother video store customers who only rent films. But for those who occasionally like to buy a hit film at a low price when it is first released on video, the supply has dried up.
With the exception of "Home Alone," which is to be released Aug. 22 at $24.98, big hits in the $25-to-$30 range are not being released the way they used to when "Pretty Woman," "Batman," "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," "Lethal Weapon 2" and "Total Recall" came out 
 In fact, all the hits in theaters this summer -- "Terminator 2: Judgment Day," "Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves," "Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear" and "City Slickers" among them -- will probably be released early next year at about $95.
Some dealers see a shift in studio strategy. "They're backing off on titles they should be selling," said Ken Dorrance, owner of three Video Station stores in Alameda, Calif., and a board member of the Video Software Dealers Association. " 'Terminator 2' will do $200 million at the box office by the time it goes on video," he said. "When it does go on video, it should also be on sale. A couple of years ago it would have been."
Mr. Dorrance also said that the two-stage pricing schedule used by the studios has been accelerated. In the first stage, the movie does its turn as a rental. "From a cost standpoint, it should be released for sale then at $59 or $69," Mr. Dorrance said, "but because the studios want to make the most from rental, they add an extra $20 or $30." The effect is to increase rentals and inhibit sales until the film's best renting days are over.
Three or four months later the sale price is lowered, he said. "In the past that usually has come six months or a year later. Now we see the gap narrowing."
Customers don't want to buy everything, he said, giving "Misery" and "L.A. Story" as examples of films that he thought would not sell well. But he said that if the price had been lower, many of his rental customers would have bought "Kindergarten Cop," "Look Who's Talking Too" and "Edward Scissorhands." Mr. Dorrance also reported strong demand for a moderately priced "Dances With Wolves," which is to be released as a rental on Aug. 28. "If they just came out with one sales title a month, it would whet the buying appetite," he said.
 
NEW VIDEO RELEASES

 
New Jack City
1991. Warner. $92.99. Laser disk, $29.98. 1 hour 41 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
The flamboyant and very cool crack kingpin Nino Brown (Wesley Snipes) tries to hold things together while staying just out of range of rivals and the police. Mario Van Peebles's film hauls out every gimmick of the drug-film genre, but he directs "with as much flash and energy as this weary formula will allow" (Janet Maslin).
 
Scenes From a Mall
1991. Touchstone. $89.95. LD, $39.99. CC. PG-13.
Perhaps only Southern California could produce a couple like Nick (Woody Allen) and Deborah (Bette Midler). She's an exuberant, prominent psychiatrist; he's a neurotic lawyer who represents sports stars who endorse sneakers. In one afternoon together at a shopping mall they manage to run through personal confessions, life crises, a breakup and a reconciliation. Though awfully thin at times, Paul Mazursky's film is redeemed by the performances, which rescue a "peculiar but, finally, very engaging comedy" (Vincent Canby).
 
The Rock and Roll Collection: Dick Clark's Golden Greats
1991. MPI. Four tapes, $99.95. 4:00. No rating.
Fifty-six performances strong, here is a history of rock-and-roll from the 1950's to the 80's. Numbers by the Beach Boys, Buffalo Springfield, Steppenwolf, Jim Croce, Jackie Wilson, Otis Redding, the Mamas and Papas, the Everly Brothers, Three Dog Night and James Brown are among the memorable renditions, all introduced by the neatly tailored Mr. Clark.
 
28 Up
1984. Fox Lorber. $79.95. 2:16. No rating.
In 1963 the British director Michael Apted worked on a documentary about the aspirations of a group of 7-year-olds from various racial, social and economic backgrounds. Since then he has visited the same group every seven years to see if their lives have lived up to the dreams they had as children. Here they are at 28 and relatively upbeat, if not altogether pleased with themselves, in a vivid film that is "alternately hugely funny and extremely moving and, even more remarkable, comparatively optimistic about the human condition" (Canby).
 
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead
1990. Buena Vista. $92.95. LD, $39.99. 1:59. CC. PG.
Tom Stoppard's hit play of 1968, adapted for the screen, looks at "Hamlet" through the eyes of a couple of fall guys, played by Gary Oldman (Rosencrantz) and Tim Roth (Guildenstern), brought to Elsinore to cheer up their old school chum, the Prince of Denmark. They specialize in windy philosophizing well above their station. On stage that's fun, but on screen "so many words can numb the eardrums and weigh upon the eyelids like old coins" (Canby).
 
PLAYING IT STRAIGHT
 Film documentaries aren't the best-represented genre in video stores, but many fine tapes are available. Here are some examples.
COMMON THREADS: STORIES FROM THE QUILT -- AIDS victims tell their stories, narrated by Dustin Hoffman. 1989. HBO. $39.95. 1:19. CC. No rating.
GATES OF HEAVEN -- Errol Morris's study of questionable doings in a California pet cemetery. 1978. RCA/Columbia. $79.95. 1:25. No rating.
GREY GARDENS -- A reclusive mother and daughter, relatives of Jacqueline Onassis, hide out in the Hamptons in a film by David and Albert Maysles. 1975. Maysles Films. $79.99. 1:34. No rating.
HARLAN COUNTY, U.S.A. -- Coal miners and their families battle management through a 13-month strike. 1976. RCA/Columbia. $29.95. 1:43. No rating.
HEARTS AND MINDS -- Peter Davis's hard-hitting film about the Vietnam War won an Oscar. 1974. MPI. $19.95. 1:52. No rating.
NANOOK OF THE NORTH -- With spectacular photography Robert J. Flaherty's silent film classic chronicles the perils of Eskimo life on Hudson Bay. 1922. Home Vision. $29.95. 1:09. No rating.
SHOAH -- Claude Lanzmann's exhaustive examination of the Holocaust is told through the memories of survivors, former Nazis who ran the death camps and other witnesses. 1985. Paramount. $299.95, five cassettes. 9:30. No rating.
STREETWISE -- Seattle street kids grub and battle and love one another amid danger and extreme deprivation. 1985. Starmaker. $59. 1:32. No rating.
THE THIN BLUE LINE -- The murder of a Texas policeman gets a long second look in another harrowing film by Errol Morris. 1988. HBO. $89.99. 1:46. CC. No rating.

Cuba Moves Forward On 2 Wheels

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
THE first thing a visitor notices in Cuba is that there are no traffic jams. This makes it very easy to get to the venues of the Pan American Games.
The reason there are no traffic jams is that there are very few private cars. Because of the economic blockade imposed by the United States, the last generation of American cars is 32 years old now, and showing it. 
 During the eternal quest for truth in sport, I have seen every car I ever owned, wobbling along the streets of Havana:
The 1951 Plymouth my mother used to teach me to shift. That 1955 Pontiac that broke down while I was covering a football game in Pennsylvania. The red 1953 Studebaker I used to park with a girlfriend at the edge of La Guardia, to watch the propeller planes. Saw all those cars.
Driving down the back streets, one can see old Fords and Chevies up on cinder blocks outside boarded-up buildings, a dozen years of dust and cobwebs on them. Their owners probably live near Calle Ocho in Miami now.
Most cabs are Soviet-built Ladas. Today's driver, Gustavo Mesa, told me his Lada is "muy fuerte," very strong, but when I asked him where he will obtain parts in the future, he gave an expressive shrug. The Soviets have problems of their own these days.
But Cuba will keep moving. On all the main roads are signs that say: Atencion! Ciclos en la Via" (Careful! Cycles on the Road.) Bicycle lanes are being marked.
At first, I thought this was mostly a device for recreation. Cubans, who proudly talk about their medical care and the relative health of children, have been urged to take exercise, led by Fidel Castro himself.
Also, nobody can miss the significance of Cubans winning gold medals, not just in track and field and boxing but also in canoeing and kayaking, two sports not normally associated with a Caribbean island.
But the bicycle signs are not for sport. Cuba is getting back to basics, commuting to work on the humble bicycle. Soviet cars are out. Chinese bicycles are in.
I became fascinated with the concept of bicycles the other afternoon, when my driver took it as a personal affront that cyclists were in the road. It is true they showed as little regard for the right-of-way as any messenger in my beloved hometown of New York.
"They don't respect the law!" roared my driver, swerving to try to hit a cyclist, unsuccessfully, I am glad to report.
Sensing that the sheepherder vs. cattle rancher border war was just as spirited as anything in the Pan American Games themselves, I visited a bicycle assembly station yesterday morning, on a quiet street far from downtown.
At the Technological Institute they have a rudimentary assembly line, students working for wages during a two-week vacation, but as part of their training the rest of the year.
The parts came from wooden boxes with English and Chinese markings on them, straight by ship from China.
The bikes for men, named "Forever" and "Flying Pigeon," weigh around 60 pounds. The bikes for women, named "Phoenix," weigh around 36 pounds, and cost 130 pesos, roughly $25-$30. There are no gears, and they have hand brakes and thick tires.
"We assemble them here, but they are sold at the place of work," said Floro Queseda Urria, the director. "The managers decide who can use them. This guarantees they will get to work."
Since the Chinese bikes began arriving in early January, Urria said his school alone had assembled and distributed 36,400 of them.
When asked about the reasons for stressing bicycles, he said in Spanish: "We are a small country. We have 2 million people in the city and they have to get to work. We do not want to depend on others for gasoline, so we are in a position to be independent. Also, we have to think about air pollution."
One of the students was Alain Villazon, age 17, who recently bought one of the bikes he had assembled, paying the 50 percent workers' discount. ("I got a good one," he said with a smile.)
Villazon is now able to cycle about six miles each way to work, and on the weekends he cycles 20 miles from his home to the beach. He also attended the Cuba-United States basketball game last weekend, another long haul.
"It's better than taking the wa-wa," he said, using the Cuban word for the laborious, fume-spewing buses.
Pedaling a heavy bicycle for long distances is the near future for the workers of Cuba. But from all this hard work will come muscles, and perhaps new members of elite Cuban cycling programs, and soon, who knows, more gold medals for Cuba. As if they need more.

The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council have decided to continue sanctions against Iraq, but agreed today to allow Baghdad a one-time exception to sell up to $1.6 billion worth of petroleum, with part of the money to be used to buy food and medical supplies.
Along with the permission to sell the oil comes a tough set of restrictions that would keep the revenue out of Iraqi hands and make sure that others, including the United Nations and countries with war-related claims against Iraq, are paid first. 
 "The United Nations has Iraq spread-eagled against the car and is going through its pockets," a Western diplomat said. "Iraq will never touch any of this money."
 
Iraqi Leaves in Anger
 The head of Iraq's mission to the United Nations, Abdul Amir A. al-Anbari, sat in on the deliberations by the permanent members today but left the meeting in anger after a short while and told reporters that Iraq would denounce the decision.
"Iraq won't accept it both as a matter of principle and as a matter of practice," Mr. Anbari said.
He said the proposed oil sale had become so time-consuming and complicated that "it is simply not going to help us."
 
'It Benefits Non-Iraqis'
 "It benefits non-Iraqis rather than Iraqis," he said. "For all practical purposes, it allows Iraq to buy not one sack of rice or one sack of grain."
There could be room for negotiation on how the rest of the oil money is divided between United Nations expenses and what would go toward food and medicine.
But Western diplomats said there would be no negotiation on the 30 percent chunk for compensation -- which already represents a compromise United States -- or on giving any of the money directly to Iraq.
 
Extent of Need Questioned
 Security Council members including the United States say they are certain Iraq needs some help, but they question how much. Baghdad had asked to sell $2 billion worth of oil solely to pay for humanitarian aid, but refused demands for a detailed acounting of its gold and foreign currency reserves.
Western diplomats, noting the continued Iraqi importation of goods such as liquor and American-brand soft drinks since the Persian Gulf war ended, have questioned just how desperate Iraqi needs are.
After a week of discussions, the permanent members agreed on a resolution drafted by France that would allow Iraq to pump and sell -- in three installments -- $1.6 billion worth of oil over the next six months.
One demand in the draft resolution is that the Government of Iraq on the first of each month provide the Secretary General with a statement of its gold and foreign currency reserves.
How much oil Iraq can sell is to be determined by the Security Council after the Secretary General submits a report on the level of Iraq's humanitarian requirements, but the total for the six months cannot exceed $1.6 billion. At current oil prices, that would be about half a million barrels a day, about a sixth of what Iraq produced before the war.
The draft resolution must still be voted on by the full 15 members of the Security Council, and officials said the vote would occur Friday or early next week. Although some members had favored easing the sanctions further, it is unlikely that the vote will go counter to the decision of the five permanent members -- the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France.
A diplomat who sat in on the Security Council deliberations and spoke on condition that he not be identified said any chances of Iraq's getting easier terms were dashed this week with revelations that Baghdad had secretly extracted small amounts of plutonium and had lied about a biological weapons research plant.
 
U.S. Threatens Iraq
 President Bush and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney have repeatedly threatened to use military force against Iraq if it did not make full disclosure of its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs.
Under the draft resolution, Baghdad would be allowed to sell its oil directly on the open spot market for six months from the date of passage of the resolution. But proceeds from the oil would go into an escrow account controlled by the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar.
Officials said 30 percent of the oil revenue would be placed into a compensation account to pay governments and individuals who have filed claims against Iraq over war-related losses.
The draft resolution said some of the money would go to meet United Nations costs in Iraq. Those costs include inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Special Commission that was established to check for weapons of mass destruction, the transfer of all Kuwaiti property seized by Iraq and half the expenses for redrawing the border between Iraq and Kuwait. The United Nations would use the balance of the revenue, expected to be a least half, to buy food and medicine and would monitor the distribution of the goods.
 
Figures Are Unspecified
 But the resolution does not specify a dollar figure or the percentage of revenue that is to go toward compensating the United Nations or to be spent on the humanitarian aid. Diplomats said those expenditures would have to be determined after they get some feeling for how much work has been done and needs to be done.
Iraq, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, had a prewar daily oil quota of 3.1 million barrels.
Persian Gulf crude was selling at $16.50 a barrel at the end of July, but the price varied according to the field that produced the crude.
The reaffirmation of the sanctions -- contained in the so-called cease-fire resolution, number 687 -- means that an international ban will continue on the sale of weapons to Iraq and that United Nations observers and inspectors will remain there. The Security Council's permanent members decided Monday at a private meeting to keep the sanctions in place, but that decision was not made public until today.
Under Resolution 687, adopted April 3, the Security Council must meet at least every 60 days to reconsider the sanctions against Iraq. At its first meeting on June 3, the Security Council also refused to remove the sanctions.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations reported in July that "Iraq's population is facing a massive famine as a result of the war and a poor harvest."
The F.A.O. said Iraq needed $2.64 billion over the next year to purchase food and $500 million more to rebuild the agricultural sector, replacing machinery, irrigation and drainage systems, fertilizers and animal feed damaged or destroyed during the war.
Even in normal years, the agency said, Iraq produces only about a third of its food needs, with the remainder coming from imports of more than $2 billion annually.

HEADLINE: THE CITY GARDENER;
Rural Retreats (In New York) To Better Enjoy the Summer

BYLINE: By LINDA YANG

 BODY:
NOT everyone in town bolts to greener pastures when summer's hot winds blow. There are city gardeners who devote their all to an urban patch.
Susan Rowland's jungle-like rooftop terrace is in Brooklyn, more or less in the shadow of the Williamsburgh Bank tower. Michael Straus's English-style backyard is in lower Manhattan, more or less in strolling distance of Chinatown. And neither gardener hankers for the hinterlands. 
 "This is our country retreat," said Ms. Rowland, a painter and sculptor. "We like summer in New York."
Ms. Rowland and her husband, Tony Sifton, moved to their loft in downtown Brooklyn five years ago in the middle of a June heat wave, so an awning seemed essential. Along with providing respite from summer's sun, she said, the awning "keeps us away from other people's eyes."
It also marks an area for al fresco dining and living.
Her original idea was to cover the 30-by-40-foot expanse of black tar roofing with soil and make a field. "I fantasized that birds would plant seeds and we'd have a meadow," she said. Which, of course, was impossible. Especially when she realized that the roof might collapse.
A more practical solution was the wood deck that now obscures the tar and helps distribute the weight of dozens of plant containers, including some she sculptured. The deck was built in sections that theoretically are removable, and in low steps, "to keep the area from looking too flat," she said.
To the Italianate backdrop of the Williamsburgh tower, the couple added some spidery, Italianate landscaping of their own. The first species planted were distinctly vertical in outline: narrow white birches, skyrocket junipers and a crab apple and viburnum pruned to an upright shape.
These were followed by small areas with themes. The subtle distinctions are now blurred, but still there is a "plaza center" (a black terra-cotta pot filled with water that reflects bromeliads and papyrus), a "prairie" (with rustling stands of zebra grass and maiden grass), and a 4-foot wide, 10-foot-long perennial border (two dozen species, including monarda, coneflower, Montauk daisies, lambs' ears and helianthus, which flourish in beds with 8 to 12 inches of soil).
"I have an inability to let nature have her way," Ms. Rowland said, "and I love pruning to alter a plant's normal look."
The urge to prune led her to carve a field juniper into a lollipop topiary, to strip leaves off a viburnum to create a "garden window," and to manipulate a five-foot-tall black pine "like a bonsai."
"But I really go for fragrance," she said. Favorites include heirloom roses like Marchioness of Londonderry, a light pink hybrid perpetual that dates from 1893 and flowers sporadically from spring through frost, and Bishop Darlington, a 1926 hybrid musk whose single pale apricot flowers add aroma all summer.
Lilies, white Madonnas and crimson and white Rubrums, add their scents too. They are grown in small pots and moved into view as they start to bloom. In autumn, the pots are buried in soil and covered with hay to protect against frost.
Vines insure privacy. The brick parapet walls and a trellis are covered with a mix of yellow honeysuckles, white moon flowers, clematises and climbing roses like America, Zephirine and New Dawn.
Across the East River, Michael Straus's backyard is a small, sunny space behind a Federal period house. "I wanted a four-season garden that looked like it could be at the edge of a meadow," said Mr. Straus, a lawyer. He was standing in the center of a mix of coreopsis, phlox, bell flowers, black-eyed daisies and rosemary.
"You can see that my goal was English cottage style," he said.
The combination of perennials, herbs and shrubs is a creation of Phillip Watson, a landscape designer he hired three years ago. Mr. Watson, the owner of Washington Gardens, a Fredericksburg, Va., nursery, commuted six hours each way by truck.
"It's hard to believe," Mr. Straus said, "but after Phil designed the garden plan, I realized it would actually be more economical to have him also bring all the soil materials and plants from Virginia -- and do the planting, too."
Mr. Watson said, "Retail prices in Virginia are cheaper than wholesale prices in New York."
"Since I knew this client intended to do all future maintenance chores himself, it was important to choose easily cared-for plants," he continued. "My idea was to arrange them so they looked like they'd always been growing here. They also had to be species that would survive his business trips away."
The first order of business was coping with the steep slope around a bedroom addition that occupies nearly half of the 60-foot-long yard. Designed by Andrew MacNair, an architect, it was also planned to be a sitting room and office. "So what is seen from inside is important," Mr. Watson said.
Multiple levels now temper the nearly four-foot change of grade and insure a smooth transition from indoors to out. Two retaining walls, built of bluestone and brownstone found on the site, divide the 23-foot-wide garden into three broadly rectangular terraces.
Wide steps and a gently curved stone path link the three levels. "The steps, terraces and curving path not only solve the grade problem," Mr. Watson said, "but add a sense of depth and dimension. They keep this long, narrow site from feeling like a railroad car and make it possible to have a bit of mystery. I think it's good when you can't see everything in a garden at one glance."
The lowest level, a shady stone patio, is brightened early in spring by the scores of small flowering bulbs that appear between the stones. Among these diminutive daffodils are Tipit, Baby Moon and Jenny. Tulips include Waterlily, Tarda, Sweet Harmony and New Design, with its variegated foliage.
The uppermost level, the furthest from the house, is the sunniest portion. A green wall of fastigiate yews adds a year-round backdrop for masses of colorful summer bloomers as well as a specimen weeping mulberry, which flowers but does not bear messy fruit.
The mulberry is surrounded by an evergreen ring of dwarf Hicks yews. In summer, hostas and golden lamium add another circle of color.
The cracks between the winding stone path on the upper levels are filled with fragrant herbs -- a mix of creeping gold oregano and the creeping thymes Pink Chintz and Elfin.
These tiny crack fillers keep the weeds under control and also perfume the summer air around a stroller who crushes them.
"Sequence and timing are the secret of the color in this garden," Mr. Straus said. "Just like a good comedy."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Fed's Worry Over Money

BYLINE: By Sylvia Nasar

 BODY:
PEOPLE often talk about monetary policy as if Alan Greenspan were punching buttons on the electronic control panel of a Boeing 747. In truth, however, the Federal Reserve chairman is doing something more akin to guiding a hang-glider by shifting body weight -- skilled improvisation at the mercy of the elements.
Mr. Greenspan is trying to nudge down inflation and keep the recovery going by controlling the money supply. But steering the nation's money supply has rarely been harder. And even gauging its present course is tricky. 
 Judging whether money is easy or tight is always tough when the economy is emerging from recession. Inflation often looks better than it really is, while, thanks to trailing data, business and consumers often look worse. That leads to the classic mistake of providing too much stimulus long after, in retrospect, the recovery has taken off.
Nowadays, there are two additional circumstances that compound the problem of reliably gauging whether the Fed is on course: the fact that savers have more alternatives to banks and the restructuring of the savings and banking industries. Consider M-2, the Fed's current favorite measure of money. It lumps together assets that are ready to spend, like currency and checking accounts, with savings: passbook savings, small certificates of deposits and bank money market funds.
Money, of course, can be used to buy additional goods and services or to bid up prices.
Money has been growing at a worryingly meager rate since last fall: 2.6 percent, right at the bottom end of the target range the Fed announced last February. "It is unusual for money to grow so slowly during a recovery," said Anatole Balbach, research director at the St. Louis Fed. "It says essentially that the recovery is going to be a slow one." In fact, the Fed decided to nudge interest rates down further this week for the first time since April, the month many economists believe the economy bottomed out.One explanation -- favored by the Treasury and the White House -- is that monetary policy has not been as easy as is suggested by the sharp decline in short-term interest rates since last fall. Short-term rates are the lowest they have been in 14 years and the lowest of any industrialized country.
There are strong reasons for thinking, however, that there is a different explanation for a good deal of the sluggishness. Looking at the different components of the money supply, the weakness is concentrated in bank and savings deposits and in types of deposits that are highly sensitive to interest rates.
Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch, argues that virtually all of the money's unusually slow growth stems from the fact that consumers aren't rolling over their certificates of deposit. "Nearly all the other components of M-2 are behaving normally for this stage of the business cycle," Mr. Steinberg said.
Since the end of June, the money supply has fallen by around $11 billion. As it happens, consumers have cashed in, on a net basis, some $11 billion worth of C.D.'s. It is not hard to figure out why, either. Rates on C.D.'s, above 8 percent last winter, have plunged to around 5.5 percent. These days they are even lower than passbook savings rates.
What are consumers doing with their money? They mostly are pouring it into mutual funds that offer higher returns. In recent months, bond mutual funds have swelled by $7 billion a month and stock mutual funds have grown by roughly $4 billion a month. Funds outside the banks, of course, are not counted in the money supply. "While M-2 stalled, the public's financial assets have continued to expand," said Robert V. DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers.
The question is why money growth has not stalled in other recoveries, since short-term rates have typically fallen far more in recessions than long-term rates. Consumers today have both a greater incentive and more opportunity to move their savings out of banks and savings institutions. In contrast to today's rock-bottom short-term interest rates, such rates were around 8 to 9 percent when the last recession ended, producing impressive returns -- at least in terms not adjusted for inflation.
Besides, alternatives to C.D.'s and NOW accounts were simply not as abundant. Back then, according to Mr. Steinberg, bond mutual funds amounted to a puny 1 percent of the consumer savings that are counted in the money supply. Today they equal a respectable 15 percent.
Moreover, banks and savings and loans have not been willing to raise rates to keep the business. In addition, when healthy institutions buy sick savings and loans they are acquiring additional deposits, tamping their appetite for other funds. And commercial banks as a whole are more anxious to shore up their capital/asset ratios than to expand their liabilities, which include deposits.
More critical, the part of money that is most closely tied to spending, M-1, has been growing at a brisk 8.5 percent clip in the past six months -- about in line with increases in past recoveries.
Nonetheless, the Fed was not inclined to dismiss the possibility that the economy was softer than expected, even though the evidence on that score, including a weak job market, is mixed. "We know some of the sluggishness of money growth is a signal of the weak economy, said Art Rolnick, research director of the Minneapolis Fed. "We can't know how much. We just have to make a guess."
Fortunately, the Fed's inflation-fighting credentials are such that it can afford to err on the side of ease. The bond market, a critical barometer of inflation fears, greeted the Fed's easing move warmly, pushing long-term rates down.

HEADLINE: Retailers Say July Sales Were Generally Listless

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
With the notable exception of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the industry leader, most United States store chains yesterday reported listless sales for July, a transitional month when summer goods typically are cleared out for back-to-school items.
Other than Wal-Mart and the specialty retailer the Gap Inc., sales were "pretty meager," said Walter Loeb, a New York-based industry consultant. 
 Bruce Missett, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company, said, "You go from gargantuan numbers for the Gap and Wal-Mart to a sluggish trend for all the other retailers."
 
40% Gain for Wal-Mart
 Wal-Mart, which also reported record profits and revenues for its fiscal second quarter, posted a 40 percent rise in July sales, to $3.36 billion from $2.40 billion in July 1990. At stores open at least one year, sales were up 13 percent.
The Gap said it sold $153 million of merchandise at its clothing stores, an increase of 34.2 percent from the $114 million sold a year earlier. Same-store sales, considered the best comparison of year-to-year performance for the industry, were up 14 percent.
But at most other major chains, the news was disheartening.
Sears, Roebuck & Company said overall sales fell 1.4 percent in July, to $2.49 billion, while sales at stores open a year or more were down 2.1 percent. The J. C. Penney Company said July sales fell 2.2 percent, to $984 million, and sales were off 3 percent on a same-store basis.
 
Sales Up at May and K Mart
 The K Mart Corporation and the May Department Stores Company each posted July sales increases of four-tenths of a percent at stores open at least one year. Over all, K Mart's sales were up 4.7 percent, to $2.36 billion, while May's were up 8.6 percent, to $657 million.
Analysts said one reason for the subdued July business was that the weather was hot in May, so that consumers started their summer shopping early and had bought most of their summer merchandise by June.
Analysts also noted that buying picked up at the end of July and in the first few days of August as fall merchandise began to arrive for the back-to-school season. "In the last week there's been a pickup, particularly evident in specialty apparel and department stores," Mr. Missett of Morgan Stanley said.
 
Back-to-School Business Expected
 Analysts predicted back-to-school business this fall would be brisker than last year, when consumers, gripped by uncertainty in the wake of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, battened down spending.
"Business should look better in August and September and for the rest of the year compared with last year's results, which were depressed by the gulf crisis," said Edward Johnson of Jones & Ryan's Johnson Redbook Service.
Kurt Barnard, publisher of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report, added: "The July data clearly indicate a bottoming out of the retail recession. We can look forward to a gradual, modest upturn."
 
Quarterly Report by Wal-Mart
 Wal-Mart, which is based in Bentonville, Ark., and took over the title this year as the nation's biggest retailer, said its profits for the second quarter had surged 26.7 percent, to $345.9 million, or 30 cents a share, from $272.9 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales jumped 37.1 percent, to $10.34 billion from $7.54 billion.
Wal-Mart's share price rose 75 cents yesterday, to $48.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
K Mart, which said its second-quarter earnings would exceed last year's level, saw its share price gain 25 cents, to $46.125, after it announced the slim rise in sales.
Among other retailing stocks, the Gap jumped $3 a share, to $39.25; Sears was down 62.5 cents, to $41, and J. C. Penney gained $1.625, to $51.875.
 Following is a list of the July sales of the other largest retailers. The dollar figures are not listed for the same-store sales because some retailers do not report them.
Dayton Hudson Corp.: Up 7.3 percent, to $1.06 billion; same-store sales up 2.7 percent.
Melville Corp.: Up 20.0 percent, to $665 million; same-store sales up four-tenths of 1 percent.
Woolworth Corp.: Down 3.2 percent, to $691 million; same-domestic-store sales down 1.5 percent.
The Limited Inc.: Up 14.0 percent, to $398 million; same-store sales up 1.0 percent.
Mercantile Stores Co.: Up 3.0 percent, to $155 million; same store sales up 1.6 percent.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Platinum Prices Lose $7.50; Gasoline at Summer High

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The platinum market took another downward spin yesterday. Prices of platinum futures are now poised to drop below $350 an ounce for the first time in more than five years.
Gasoline futures soared to their highest level of the summer on the New York Mercantile Exchange, lifting the energy market amid scattered reports of refinery problems. 
 As pessimism grows about industrial demand for platinum, prices settled $7.50 lower on the New York Merc. The contract for delivery in October ended at $350.90, the lowest settlement of a near-term platinum contract since Feb. 4, 1986.
Silver also fell. Silver for September delivery ended 4.3 cents lower, at $3.927 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The August gold contract rose 60 cents, to $357.20, on the Commodity Exchange.
Platinum traded as low as $350 in a thin market dominated by trade selling, analysts said. The selloff partly reflected fears that the Japanese, who are big investors in platinum, would continue to liquidate precious metals, analysts said.
Although there was no market-moving news yesterday, platinum traders have grown wary of developments indicating lower demand. Those include the development of automobile catalytic converters that substitute other metals for platinum. The auto industry accounts for about 40 percent of world consumption.
The United States' sluggish economic recovery is also a drag on platinum because a slow economy implies slack demand for industrial materials.
The platinum market has also been shocked recently by signals that the Soviet Union is positioned to sell large amounts, if necessary, for hard currency and by proposals that the United States sell some of its strategic metal reserves.

Dollar Rises on Concerns Over Mideast and Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced today in light trading dominated by concerns over interest rates and strife in the Middle East.
Analysts said there was little news to influence currency trading, and most investors were adjusting their holdings in advance of today's release of producer price figures for July. 
 There was a flurry of buying on news that Turkey had begun new raids against Turkish Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq, but "it turned out to be not that big an event," said Walter Simon, a vice president with Bank Julius Baer & Company.
The dollar tends to rise when fighting breaks out in other countries because the currency is viewed as a relatively safe investment.
Traders were waiting for the producer price numbers to see if inflation moderated enough last month for the Federal Reserve to push interest rates lower again. The Fed already took steps to nudge rates downward earlier this week.
A drop in rates likely would prompt traders to sell the dollar because it, like all currencies, is supported by higher interest rates.
Mr. Simon said the market expected the producer prices report to show that prices rose by one-tenth of 1 percent in July.
"Most people are thinking that if it's anything like that, it's better to own marks than dollars at this moment," he said.
The dollar rose to 136.15 Japanese yen in New York from late Wednesday's 136.00. In overnight trading in Tokyo, the United States currency fell 0.55 yen, to 135.45 yen, and in London, it was quoted at 136.45 yen.
The British pound lost ground against the dollar. Sterling fell to $1.7065 in New York, from $1.7130 late Wednesday, and to $1.7005 in London from $1.7125.
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's prices, included: 1.7140 German marks, up from 1.7105; 1.5010 Swiss francs, up from 1.4985; 5.8330 French francs, up from 5.8180; 1,284.00 Italian lire, up from 1,280.00, and 1.1465 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14705.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Investors Deal a Costly Blow to Maxwell

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Just as Robert Maxwell is planning to try to sell common stock in the United States, there are signs that investors may be getting nervous about at least one branch of his far-flung publishing empire.
A preferred stock issue of Official Airline Guides Inc., a subsidiary of the Maxwell Communication Corporation, failed to find buyers in an auction last week. As a result, the company will pay an extraordinarily high interest rate on the issue, and some stockholders who want to sell are being forced to hold on to it. 
 In an interview last night, Mr. Maxwell said the company had no financial problems, asserting that the auction failed because of a lack of communications about expected bids. "All my people say it was a snafu between us and Merrill," he said. Merrill Lynch & Company co-managed the original offering with Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Mr. Maxwell said he had no problems with Goldman, Sachs, but added that it was pointless to try to fix blame for the failed auction. "It really is, to our knowledge, nobody's fault," he said. He forecast that when the next auction is held, on Sept. 20, "it will be successful."
The failed auction came at an unfortunate time for Maxwell Communication, which said last month that it was considering spinning off its American operations, including Official Airline Guides and the book publisher Macmillan Inc., and selling stock in them. Mr. Maxwell said last night that he expected to announce firm plans about the American operations "very shortly."
Mr. Maxwell said there was "no possibility about being scared about the credit" of Official Airline Guides. He said that the company had no debt and that there was no reason to be concerned about the $2.15 billion debt of its corporate parent, Maxwell Communication.
But there were at least some indications that nervousness over the Maxwell empire played a role in the failed auction, which took place last Friday but received little attention until this week. The issue is a private placement, and the results of the auction were not widely disseminated.
The security in question is a $75 million issue of auction-rate preferred stock, which is set up to allow holders to sell out every seven weeks as a new auction is held to establish the dividend rate. It is the practical responsibility of the original underwriters to round up bids, but they have no obligation to bid if buyers cannot be found.
In past auctions of similar issues, when unusually high rates resulted from an auction problem, buyers have rushed to snap up the securities in after-market trading. But two traders said they were aware of no such trading in this case. That could indicate investor hesitation to buy the Maxwell paper.
Officials of both Goldman, Sachs and Merrill Lynch declined to comment on the auction. But Robert Kantowitz, a managing director of Merrill Lynch, said, "Merrill intends to continue to expand the investor base for the O.A.G. issue, and we would assume and hope that Goldman, Sachs would do the same."
Several traders said there were rumors in the market that Merrill Lynch had left the impression with both Goldman, Sachs and the company that it would be submitting more bids than it did.
The possible common stock offering in Maxwell Communication's American operations has been widely viewed as resulting from a need to reduce the company's debt. Maxwell's stock, traded in London, has fallen 14 percent over the last three months since a sister company, Mirror Group Newspapers P.L.C., went public. The Mirror offering was at first described as oversubscribed, but it has since run into investor hostility. The shares now trade 15 percent below the offering price.
The Daily News of New York, also owned by Mr. Maxwell, is not part of Maxwell Communication and would not be included in such an offering.
The structure of the Official Airline Guides preferred stock offering is supposed to provide ample protection for holders. Martin Maleska, the senior vice president for acquisitions for Maxwell Communication, said he believed it deserved at least an A rating, and could not understand why it was rated a notch lower, at BBB+, by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Mr. Maleska said figures for the first six months of 1991, which have not yet been disclosed, would show that both Official Airline Guides' revenues and operating earnings were lower than a year earlier. But, he added, there were more than enough profits to cover the preferred dividends. He attributed the lower earnings to a drop in tourism resulting from the Persian Gulf war. Official Airline Guides is the dominant provider of airline schedule information to travel agents and computerized reservation systems.
The rules of the preferred stock issue provide that since there were not enough bids, the rate for the next seven weeks is set at 150 percent of the rate on 60-day commercial paper, for a rate of 9.03 percent. Because corporate buyers pay low taxes on preferred stock dividends, that is a very high rate. The underwriters had told investors they expected a rate of 8.5 percent or less.
In the two previous auctions of the Maxwell paper, on April 26 and June 14, the rates had come in at nearly 140 percent of the commercial paper level. That meant the auctions succeeded, but the rates were still well above the rates fetched by companies with similar securities ratings, including the Chrysler Financial Corporation and a number of utilities. Those issues have generally brought rates no higher than 110 percent of the commercial paper rate.

HEADLINE: Oakland Tribune May Close Unless Gannett Settles Debt

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
Robert C. Maynard, the owner of The Oakland Tribune, announced yesterday that he would be forced to close the California newspaper on Wednesday unless the Gannett Company, which sold him the paper in 1983, agreed to terms that would eliminate a $31.5 million debt remaining from the sale.
Mr. Maynard said Gannett has thus far refused his offer of $2.5 million to settle the debt. He said such a deal was essential in order for him to secure financing that would enable The Tribune to continue publishing. The $2.5 million would come from an investor Mr. Maynard declined to identify, who would then invest more money in the paper. 
 "This is hardball time," said Mr. Maynard, one of the nation's few black newspaper publishers. In a statement sent by fax to many newspapers, Mr. Maynard said Gannett "is killing The Oakland Tribune for no reason we can understand."
 
Gannett's Response
 In a statement, Gannett said yesterday that Mr. Maynard had not provided it with details "to determine the merits of any offer." But the company did not say whether a $2.5 million offer was acceptable.
The company also noted, "Although The Tribune has been in default with regard to its obligations to Gannett for at least five years, we have continued to assure Mr. Maynard that we would not take action that would trigger a bankruptcy filing and don't intend to."
John S. Reidy, an newspaper analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said Mr. Maynard's ultimatum put Gannett in an embarrassing position because the giant newspaper company would not want to be blamed for the closure of one of the few minority-owned newspapers.
Indeed, it has been a source of corporate pride at Gannett that the company made it possible for Mr. Maynard to buy The Tribune by granting him the loan he is now trying to retire.
"They would look better having the paper survive," Mr. Reidy said.
 
Missed Interest Payments
 Gannett sold the paper to Mr. Maynard, and a partner who owns 20 percent of it, for $17.5 million. Mr. Maynard estimates that he has paid about $6 million in interest. But Gannett has allowed him to miss recent interest payments and the debt has ballooned to $31.5 million.
Like Oakland, The Tribune has been depressed for many years, and Mr. Maynard said the current economic doldrums made it impossible to continue without refinancing. He said the paper had lost about $2 million so far this year.
The Tribune has won many awards in recent years, including a Pulitzer Prize for photo coverage of the 1989 Northern California earthquake. But its circulation has been flat at the 1983 level of about 150,000, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
Last year, Mr. Maynard said the paper would close unless there were severe reductions in labor costs, and he reduced them by 25 percent through wage cuts and layoffs.

HEADLINE: Recovery Gasps for New Orders

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The Will-Burt Company, a parts maker in Orrville, Ohio, senses the beginnings of an economic recovery. Various customers -- a nearby Volvo truck factory, for example, and AMF Bowling Inc. -- are purchasing a few more fenders, doors, bumpers and finely machined parts. As the pace picks up, Harry E. Featherstone, Will-Burt's chief executive, finds himself with a week's supply of steel. But he wishes the stockpile were smaller. "I'd like to order steel daily," he said.
Such thinking helps to explain why the heralded recovery from the recession is having trouble getting off the ground. Much depends on whether Mr. Featherstone and thousands of other American executives conclude, more or less simultaneously, that sales are again brisk enough and sustained enough to warrant restocking. When they do, economists say, the jump in production needed to satisfy the surge in new orders will give the economy a kick out of recession.
 
Not This Month
 
 "There will come a moment when people will decide that they don't have enough in their warehouses," said Robert Barbera, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Hutton. "But that moment has not arrived yet."
Almost certainly it will not arrive before Labor Day, interviews with executives, industry experts and economists indicate. Across many industries, sales are indeed rising, but many of those interviewed said they lacked confidence that any improvement would endure. What is more, even if they become confident, summer is the worst of times to fire up a recovery through inventory rebuilding.
Retailers, for example, normally postpone major apparel orders until late August while they test the appetite for the new fall styles with pre-season sales. Most major chain stores reported yesterday that July sales of summer goods were listless. [Page D2.]
Similarly, auto sales have clearly outstripped production in recent weeks, but in July and August manufacturers phase out one year's models and begin to make the new lines. While they do so, production is held below par. Then, before setting new production schedules, auto makers must gauge the demand for 1992 models, said Joel Pitcoff, an analyst at the Ford Motor Company.
 
Just-in-Time Strategy
 Finally, the American economy faces an obstacle in this incipient recovery that did not hinder stockpiling after previous recessions. A surge in orders would undoubtedly prompt Mr. Featherstone's company to stockpile some steel. Nevertheless, he and many others are becoming increasingly adept at the new strategy of just-in-time delivery: moving products quickly from the factory to the customer, with the shortest possible stay in a warehouse.
Mr. Featherstone, for example, notes that Caterpillar Inc., a big customer, has eliminated a 500,000-square-foot warehouse in Aurora, Ill. "They want us to hold their inventories and make shipments to them weekly and even daily," he said. "But we are also going in the direction of not holding costly inventories."
Because of the recession, thousands of American companies took to selling from their existing stockpiles, rather than ordering new merchandise they might not have been able to sell. They have lived largely off their stockpiles for nearly nine months now, although the liquidation rate has fallen lately, the Commerce Department reports. Selling from inventory rather than making new merchandise contributed to the recession.
 
Companies Still Liquidating
 Now, with sales somewhat improved, production is beginning to rise as companies cautiously reorder. The big question, though, is whether the new production will increase to the point that the selling from stockpiles finally ceases in this third quarter. If so, that would be enough to end the recession, economists say.
"You don't need a vigorous restocking to drive the recovery," said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "All you have to do is stop liquidating."
But many of the executives and industry experts interviewed did not think the inventory liquidation would end before the fourth quarter. And recent surveys conducted by the National Federation of Independent Business, representing small companies, and the National Association of Purchasing Management, representing mostly major corporations, suggest a similar conclusion. In both surveys, substantial percentages of companies said they were still liquidating their inventories.
 
Gillette Cutting Inventory
 At the Gillette Company, liquidation is likely to remain the order of the day until October, said Milton L. Glass, the company's vice president for finance. Nevertheless, since June, Gillette has been selling more razors and razor blades to retailers. The retailers' inventories had fallen too low to meet the demand from consumers, and for two months retailers have been restocking, Mr. Glass said. But Gillette itself is not. Quite the contrary, it is selling to retailers from its own factory inventories, without increasing production.
"Our inventories had built up in April and May, and in June they were on the high side," Mr. Glass said. "Now, we are switching them to the retailers."
Like many of their compatriots, Gillette executives remain skeptical about how long the stronger orders from retailers will last. "You are going to have to wait until October before you can say whether there is a genuine consumer-led recovery or this increase in retail orders is just a flash in the pan," Mr. Glass said.
 
Commerce Department Data
 Some economists optimistically pin their hopes of a production surge on Commerce Department data that show inventories nationwide to be at an unusually low level -- 3.01 months of stocks on hand if production stopped dead today and sales continued at their current pace. That is a decline from 3.06 months last year, on the eve of the recession.
But while inventories nationwide might be very low, the Commerce Department figures can obscure some important variations. While some major industries are still selling from stock, others are not. Sales of household appliances, for example, have risen sharply and, with inventories lean, production has shot up. Such production increases, in turn, prompt companies to rehire workers or pay more in overtime, and those new wages help pump up the economy.
The steel industry, however, built up stockpiles early this year, partly in anticipation of a strike at the USX Corporation that did not materialize. Sales then fell, leaving manufacturers and distributors with too much on hand, which has suppressed production, said Walter Carter, a steel industry specialist at DRI/McGraw Hill, an economic consulting firm.
"We are still in the relatively early stages of reducing the stockpile," he said, adding that the rest of 1991 might be spent in trimming away two million tons of stored steel products.
 
Some Industries Holding Back
 Some industries with lean inventories nevertheless prefer to hold back production until short supplies drive up prices. That is the case among makers of linerboard, the heavy cardboard-like material used to make shipping cartons. Linerboard stockpiles are down to less than six weeks' supply, said Timothy McKenna, a spokesman for the Union Camp Corporation, a major maker of linerboard. But the priority is to get the price toward where it was last January: $370 a ton, compared with $320 today.
Other, less tangible factors are also discouraging the inventory rebuilding that played a major role in recoveries from past recessions. One is low inflation. Companies stockpiled in the past to avoid paying much higher prices for raw materials, parts and finished goods a few months later. Inflation today, however, is running at a low annual rate, under 3 percent, as measured by the Consumer Price Index.
"No one is tempted to buy in anticipation of price increases," said Albert T. Sommers, a senior economist at the Conference Board, a business research organization. "This failure to restock in turn helps to keep prices down."
Imports are also a much greater source of inventories than a decade ago -- a trend that pushes up production abroad but not at home.
"With production now globalized, companies can 'outsource' overseas as well as domestically," Richard B. Berner, a senior economist at Salomon Brothers, wrote in a recent article. "As a result, imports now substitute for domestic inventories."
Finally, the credit crunch inhibits stockpiling. Keeping 10,000 pairs of shoes on hand means a retailer must borrow money to buy the shoes and store them until they can be sold to consumers, and then repay the loan. Bankers themselves say they are more cautious than they were in the 1980's about providing such financing. That caution has meant, for example, that the shoe manufacturer and the economy are often deprived of the wealth that comes from producing the extra shoes.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
30-Year Bond Prices Drop After Auction

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Investor demand for the Treasury's $12 billion of new 30-year bonds was weaker than anticipated yesterday, sending prices down modestly on long-term issues.
The slack demand, which some traders said was a reaction to the brisk rise in bond prices the past week, became apparent soon after the 1 P.M. bond auction. By late in the day, bond prices fell slightly more than a half-point, raising the yield of the just-auctioned 8 1/8 percent bonds to 8.21 percent late in the day from an average of 8.15 percent at the auction. 
 The outstanding 8 1/8 percent Treasury bond was offered late in the day at 98 27/32, down 17/32, to yield 8.23 percent, compared with 8.18 late Wednesday. Before yesterday's decline, the price of the 8 1/8 percent Treasury bond had increased by more than 2 1/4 points since July 29, when its yield was 8.39 percent.
The decline in prices was confined to bonds due in five years and longer. Among shorter-term issues, prices were stable to slightly higher, with the Treasury's new 6 7/8 percent notes due in 1994 ending the day unchanged at 99 30/32 to yield 6.90 percent. Rates on Treasury bills fell a few hundredths of a percentage point, with the three-month issue ending the day at 5.37 percent.
The weakening bond market cut short an early rally in the stock market yesterday, sending the Dow Jones industrial average down 12.75 points to close at 3,013.86. [Page D6.]
One clear sign that some securities dealers were awarded more of the bonds than they expected, or desired, was that some bonds were awarded with a yield as high as 8.19 percent, an unusually wide spread.
"We had a lot of supply on top of a rally that reduced yields on intermediate notes nearly half a percentage point," said William Brachfeld, head of government securities at Daiwa Securities in New York.
As long as economic data continue to show that inflation is weak and the economy sluggish, Mr. Brachfeld said, yesterday's decline "is just a case of temporary indigestion." But he warned that if economic data showed either a rise in inflation or a more robust economic recovery, it would quickly deter investors.
Economists generally expect that this morning's report of producer prices for July will show no change, or even a slight decline. Some traders then expect that bond prices could recover some of yesterday's losses.
Some Treasury bond traders at firms that also handle corporate bonds said the prospect of a heavy supply of corporate issues next week might also have added to the market's downturn, although demand was good for the $3.2 billion of corporate bonds offered in the past week.
"If the bond market had held at its best levels, there could have been $4 billion to $5 billion of new corporate issues next week," said Lindley B. Richert, head of MCM Inc., a New York firm that monitors corporate securities markets. Because of yesterday's decline in bond prices and increase in yields, he said, new issuance will be much lower, because many corporate treasurers are still willing to wait for rates to come down.
The Federal Reserve's announcement of a $200 million decline in the M-2 money supply measure had little effect on yesterday's trading. The decline, which left M-2 $20 billion below its level of June 17, has reduced its growth rate since the fourth quarter to the bottom of the Fed's 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent objective.
Weak money supply growth, plus signs of a sluggish economy, low inflation and the declining trend in interest rates the past few weeks encouraged the Fed to ease monetary policy a notch on Tuesday. Analysts expect the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market to average about 5.5 percent, down from the 5.75 percent rate that has prevailed since late April.
William Griggs, an economist at Griggs & Santow, a New York advisory firm, said the weak money supply was "reflecting some of the current weakness of the economy," as well as the preference of people to use their cash, rather than keeping it in banks with low interest rates. The interest rates at many banks are the lowest since the late 1970's.
"Some of the weak growth in bank accounts that are included in money supply measures also reflects the financial problems of the banking system," Mr. Griggs added.
Although there was a deposit run yesterday at Citicorp's Hong Kong branch, bankers said there were no signs in the wholesale markets that Citibank or any other large New York bank was having difficulty raising funds. But the episode in Hong Kong and rumors of other troubles were taken seriously enough that at least one New York bank arranged for extra staffing on its liability management desk last night and today.
New York banks have been striving the past year to reduce their reliance on funds borrowed in the wholesale markets, and have tried to limit those borrowings to long-term customers.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Off a Bit

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell slightly in the last week in July, the Labor Department said today in a report that drew a mixed reaction from private economists.
The department said that for the week ended July 27, 400,000 Americans filed first-time claims for unemployment benefits, a drop of 4,000 from the week before. The report marked the second consecutive weekly improvement, but analysts were split on the implications. 
 Some argued that the further decline in claims showed the economy was gradually gaining strength, but others said the slight change was further proof that the economic recovery had faltered. "This is just further evidence of a stalled recovery," said David Wyss, chief financial economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, a Lexington, Mass., consulting firm. "We are in the summer doldrums."
Other economists, however, were impressed that since peaking at 543,000 in late March, claims have generally been on a downward path.
"We are in the early stages of a slow, weak recovery," said Irwin Kellner, chief economist at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company in New York, pointing to the declining claims as confirmation of that.

HEADLINE: Tax Delinquencies in New York Rising Again

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
Property-tax delinquencies in New York City are rising again, as they did during the 1970's, when the city last underwent an economic crisis. But city officials do not expect a recurrence of the wave of the abandonments that destroyed neighborhoods across the South Bronx the last time around.
Many of the new delinquencies are in commercial properties in Manhattan, including a number of buildings owned by some of New York's leading real-estate families. 
 City officials see the increase -- 38 percent in the 12 months ended June 30 -- as a result of the real-estate slump and the reluctance of banks to lend to developers. Landlords unable to pay their bills are in effect using the city as a bank: "borrowing" money by not paying property taxes.
According to the Department of Finance, between June 1990 and June 1991 property-tax delinquencies rose by $86 million, to $315 million, or 3.64 percent of the total tax levy. That is the highest level since 1980, but still a long way from the postwar peak of 7.5 percent that was reached in 1976.
Of that $86 million increase, 70 percent is owed by owners of commercial buildings, and nearly 20 percent of the total is owed by owners of Manhattan office buildings.
The finance department's list of those who are delinquent on their property taxes, water or sewage charges includes some well-known names: real-estate developers like Alex di Lorenzo 3d and Harry Macklowe; the Barbizon Hotel; the Prince George, the former welfare hotel, and Bob Guccione, the publisher of Penthouse magazine.
"It says something about the state of the economy," said Carol O'Cleireacain, the city's Commissioner of Finance. "The real-estate market is in dreadful shape."
The fact that the city's list of delinquencies includes prominent business organizations has Ms. O'Cleireacain relatively unconcerned by this increase in delinquencies. She views it primarily as a cash-management issue. Others are less sanguine: they see the increase, and the big names involved, as a sign of desperation.
"This is further evidence that New York is hurting badly," said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York.
During the Manhattan real-estate boom of the 1980's, many property owners were sufficiently optimistic about the future to refinance their buildings, taking out larger mortgages on the assumption that property values and rents would keep on rising. But with 20 percent vacancy rates now common in Manhattan properties, and property taxes escalating, many owners are not getting enough cash from their buildings to cover their mortgage, maintenance and tax bill.
"The cash flow is no longer there on which millions of dollars were lent," said Joel Picker, a lower Manhattan leasing agent for the Galbreath Company. A recent survey by the consulting firm of Hamilton, Rabinovitz & Alschuler found that the number of buildings where operating costs exceeded income increased by 70 percent last year, to almost 10 percent of the 560 buildings that were studied.
 
Vacancies Surge
 "Every owner has a problem building," said Mr. Spinola, of the Real Estate Board, which paid for the consulting firm's study.
Consider the problems that have plagued 2 South William Street, the elegant nine-story office building that was built in 1892 and is home to Delmonico's restaurant. In the last 18 months, the vacancy rate has soared over 30 percent, as a law firm, an executive search firm, a brokerage firm and a computer company have all either moved to cheaper quarters in Brooklyn, gone under or taken space in newer office buildings in Manhattan, the building's rental agent said.
Although a representative of the owner, J. D. Branmaur Inc. refused to comment, the agent, Richard Marcus, said that a building like 2 South William Street can only command rents in the range of $15 a square foot, but has operating costs of $5 to $6 and taxes of $3 to $4 a square foot. When financing costs are thrown in, there is precious little left. According to the Department of Finance, the building's taxes went unpaid for more than a year and the arrears were only cleaned up in June.
Landlords facing temporary cash shortgages used to ask their banks for short-term lines of credit. But these days few banks are willing to lend to the real-estate industry.
 
An Alternative Banker?
 In the absence of bank loans, the city often becomes the only alternative. Unlike commercial banks, which foreclose on properties fairly promptly, the city waits at least 12 months before initiating foreclosure proceedings. There is then a four-month grace period during which owners who come up with the money can get their buildings back. And the city is willing to negotiate a return of the property to an owner for another 20 months after that.
As a reward for its patience, the city has been charging a hefty 19 percent interest rate. But many property owners are willing to pay the price.
Ms. O'Cleireacain says the city generally collects about 95 percent of what it is owed within two years.
A spokesman for Mr. Macklowe said that within the last two weeks, the developer settled a $2 million delinquent tax bill that dated to January. The city said it has no record of that payment but acknowledged that there is a delay in its processing.
And Joseph Neumann, who is reckoned to be the third-largest owner of rentable office space in Manhattan, recently paid back $1.8 million on a building that had been in arrears for more than a year. A spokesman for the company said that in the last two weeks Mr. Neumann had also repaid $2.357 million on two downtown buildings that the city said had been delinquent since January. The city's records do not yet reflect those payments.
"We've been cutting our costs left, right and center," said Charles Herzka, a vice president at Broadway Management, which manages Mr. Neumann's properties. "We saved up the money and we paid our taxes."
Ms. O'Cleireacain said the rise in delinquencies has not heightened the city's own financial problems. For starters, the city is collecting handsome interest payments -- albeit not all upfront. But Ms. O'Cleireacain says this does not pose a serious cash-management problem for the city. The numbers are small in relation to a $29 billion budget.
And since there are always a certain number of slow payers, she simply builds that factor into her revenue forecasts. At the same time that there are new delinquents, the city is collecting payments from old ones who are finally ready to settle their debts.
Still, not everyone views this new trend with quite so much equanimity. Mr. Spinola says it is hardly a healthy sign when some of New York's most prominent real-estate developers have no choice but to borrow at 19 percent from the city.
"Other buildings could go into default," he said, "and the city could end up owning office buildings."
Such a dire scenario seems unlikely, because banks that hold the mortgages on those buildings are likely to intervene rather than let those properties revert to the city. The Glick Organization, for instance, recently defaulted on a property on East 14th Street and the bank which repossessed it, Fidelity New York Federal Savings Bank, is now responsible for repaying $626,624 in delinquent taxes.
 
814 Buildings Claimed
 Still, the finance department's records indicate that nearly 80 percent of the 48 largest delinquent properties are overdue by more than one year. And the number of buildings that the city has actually been forced to take over rose to 1,586 in 1990, from 930 in 1989. So far this year, the city has claimed 814.
And many real-estate experts are not optimistic about a quick recovery in the office market. David Shulman, a real-estate analyst at the Wall Street firm of Salomon Brothers, forecasts that when discounted rents for sublet space are taken into account, the "true" vacancy rate could rise to as high as 25 percent in the future.
Property taxes are also likely to aggravate building owners' problems. The Dinkins administration already has built into its financial plan for the next three years property-tax increases of about $1.6 billion. And some real-estate experts think if the finance department re-assesses buildings to reflect the decline in property values, real tax-rates will have to be raised again to compensate for the shortfall that would otherwise result.
Typically, when the city raises property-tax rates, as it did recently, commercial property owners are insulated because they can pass those increases directly onto their tenants.
But in a market where owners are having to offer rent-free periods, generous renovation allowances and other inducements just to attract tenants, many owners have had no choice but to absorb the tax increases themselves. Ms. O'Cleireacain thinks that is one reason the Real Estate Board became such a vociferous opponent of the city's latest round of tax-rate increases.
"I think it was coming out of their own pockets," she said of owners.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Free-Trade Accord Is Enticing Canadian Companies to U.S.

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Aug. 8

 BODY:
In 1847, Daniel Massey left New York State for Newcastle, Ontario, where he created the small farm implement company that became Massey-Ferguson Ltd., one of Canada's industrial giants.
Now the company, which changed its name five years ago to the Varity Corporation, has won Government and stockholder approval to move to the United States. It has incorporated itself in Delaware and is moving its corporate headquarters from Toronto to Buffalo. 
 Varity is just one of hundreds of companies abandoning Canada to move south of the border in the wake of the Canada-United States free-trade agreement that took effect in early 1989. Some, like Thompson Transport and St. Lawrence Starch, are Canadian; others, like Toro, Wang, Celanese and Burlington Industries, are subsidiaries of American companies. The businesses are attracted by lower American wages, more modest personal and business taxes and cheaper real estate. And the trade pact reduces the cost for American companies selling in Canada.
 
'Bottom-Line Decision'
 "It's a bottom-line decision," said Donna Nason, manager of Canadian business development for the Greater Buffalo Chamber of Commerce, which is among the legion of American cities and states that have set up what the Canadians view as raiding operations here. Besides Varity, Buffalo has attracted 86 other Canadian companies since July 1987. "The Canadian companies are looking at costs, and like what they see on our side of the border," Ms. Nason said.
The phenomenon of companies shifting operations to the United States affects all of Canada, from British Columbia to the Maritime Provinces, but is felt most acutely in Ontario, which accounts for nearly half of the country's manufacturing employment.
For Varity, the move affects only 40 people, employees in its headquarters staff, of which about a quarter are going to Buffalo. But other companies are shifting plants, sales forces, warehouses and distribution centers. Labor officials say that altogether about 200,000 jobs have been lost as a result of the shift of operations south.
The signing of the trade pact was generally seen as a boon to the Canadian economy -- an agreement that would open up access to the American market, which is 10 times the size of the Canadian market. But the agreement is also proving to have negative effects -- including the flight of business -- as critics of the pact had predicted.
The new trade relationship has also been marked by a growing stampede of Canadian shoppers across the border in search of cheaper gasoline, cigarettes, whisky, clothing and other bargains. The number of cross-border shopping trips in May was up 19.6 percent from a year earlier, according to Statistics Canada, the federal data collection agency. And unofficial estimates suggest that Canadians are spending as much as $2 billion a year in their cross-border consumption sprees.
But for many workers, the most immediate problem is the departure of companies.
The economic dislocation is "at least as wrenching as the U.S. Rust Belt experienced in the early 1980's," said Andrew Jackson, the senior economist at the Canadian Labor Congress, the umbrella organization for Canada's trade unions. "It's been a real shakeout here."
The free-trade pact, he said, has given United States companies "practically unrestricted access" to the Canadian market. Before, he said, a company based in the United States faced substantial tariffs and other regulations that tended to make it tougher for them to sell in Canada. Many American companies set up subsidiaries here to allow them to slip inside the protective walls. The bulk of Canada's foreign investment is American, with a growing amount from Japan.
 
Policies Called 'Shortsighted'
 But others note that the southern migration of business has been accelerated by the severe Canadian recession and by "shortsighted" Government regulatory and social policies.
"Our cost of capital and labor is too high," said Stephen Van Houten, president of the 2,500-member Canadian Manufacturers Association, adding that the country now faces "a severe problem of competitiveness."
He said high interest rates had lifted the Canadian dollar to levels that were hurting exports.
In the first quarter of 1991, for example, bank lending rates in Canada averaged 11.58 percent, compared with 9.19 percent in the United States, according to the International Monetary Fund. That was an improvement from 1990, however, when the average rate in Canada was 14.06 percent, compared with 10.01 percent in the United States, I.M.F. figures show.
 
Labor Wage Gap
 Canadian businesses have also watched their labor costs rise faster than those for American businesses. The average hourly manufacturing wage in the United States in 1987 was $9.91, slightly above the wage rate in Canada, which was equal to $9.42 in United States currency. But by last April, the Canadian wage had risen to the equivalent of $12.97, while the American wage had moved up to only $11.10.
Canada has begun to try to fight back. This year the federal Government replaced an old manufacturers tax with a lower goods-and-services tax that is refunded when goods are exported. Government officials hope that when the economy recovers, corporations will be more inclined to stay in Canada.
But while hundreds of companies have packed their bags, Varity's decision has attracted more than the usual attention because of the company's standing as a national symbol and the $400 million in Canadian taxpayers' money that was pumped into the enterprise over the last 10 years to help it stave off bankruptcy.
 
Job Guarantees
 A $3.6 billion-a-year producer of auto parts, diesel engines and farm equipment, Varity announced its intention to pull out of Canada more than a year ago. That precipitated negotiations with both the federal and Ontario provincial governments, and led to an accord in October.
The arrangements guarantee that the 1,200 workers in the Canadian plants will keep their jobs until 1993. In addition, Varity must pay $50 million to the provincial and federal governments and to former workers and invest $3.5 million in the Woodstock, Ontario, auto parts plant of its Kelsey-Hayes division.
Despite these arrangements, the shareholders' final overwhelming approval of the move last week touched off reactions of disappointment from provincial and federal leaders.
"I regret the way that this has happened," said Premier Bob Rae of Ontario, a socialist. He also said he regretted having to make the deal that allowed it to happen.
A spokesman for the Finance Ministry in Ottawa grumbled, "Obviously, no one is very happy about it."
There was a more muted reaction from Bill Terry, director general in the Ministry of Industry, Science and Technology, who said the company had met "all the conditions" of its agreements and was "within its rights."
 
Not a Protest, Company Says
 The company, which became one of Canada's pre-eminent multinational enterprises before it was threatened with bankruptcy in the early 1980's, insists that it is not rejecting Canada. Victor Rice, its British-born chairman, told the shareholders that the move was "not in any way an act of protest or defiance."
"We shall always cherish our heritage as a pioneer of Canadian industry and a participant of long standing in Canada's economic development," he declared.
Mr. Rice said that even though his company lost $29.7 million (United States) in the quarter that ended on April 30, he expected Varity to be profitable for the full year.
Company executives added that Canadian operations had shrunk to represent only about 5 percent of Varity's global business. About 40 percent of the employees are already in the United States and the rest are chiefly in Germany, Britain, Italy, France and Spain.
Moreover, the company complained, Canadian incorporation had led Wall Street stock analysts and institutional investors to ignore its shares. Shareholders recently approved a 1-for-10 consolidation in the company's shares. The newly consolidated shares closed today at $25.50, up 75 cents each; before the shares were consolidated, they were trading at $2 to $3.
Now that the move is on, Varity will turn its attention to other pressing matters. The next task, Mr. Rice says, is to reduce its debt of more than $1 billion.

HEADLINE: Study Says Fees Are Often Higher When Doctor Has Stake in Clinic

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Aug. 8

 BODY:
Doctors' ownership of laboratories, diagnostic imaging centers and physical therapy clinics tends to increase the use and cost of such services without improving access to care for poor people or residents of rural areas, a Florida state agency reported today.
A study done by the agency also found that more than 45 percent of the doctors practicing in Florida, 8,500 of 18,250 doctors, have invested in joint ventures to which they can refer patients. 
 The investments have generated intense debate in Florida and other states, with some people asserting that there is a potential conflict of interest whenever doctors refer patients to clinics in which the doctors have invested.
 
Hard Numbers for First Time
 The Florida study, eagerly awaited by health officials around the country, is the first to document how pervasive such investments are, and how they can add to health-care costs.
The Federal Department of Health and Human Services has adopted rules to limit such investments by doctors paid through Medicare and Medicaid. The results of the Florida study are likely to bolster efforts by members of Congress and officials in other states to adopt broader restrictions on investments by doctors in health-care businesses. But such investments are so widespread that a complete ban would be extremely disruptive, doctors warn.
The study here, by the Florida Health Care Cost Containment Board, adds an ingredient largely missing from the national debate: concrete data, based on a statewide survey of 2,200 clinics and other health-care businesses. The Florida study is far more comprehensive than any done by the Federal Government or other states, but its results are consistent with findings from a more limited survey by the Federal Government in 1989.
James J. Bracher, executive director of the Florida agency, said at a news conference that clinics and laboratories in which doctors had invested had higher costs than businesses offering the same services but not owned by doctors. In addition, he said, there was evidence that the doctor-owned joint ventures were used more frequently, used less-skilled workers and offered limited access to the poor.
In Florida and elsewhere, joint ventures for doctors have proliferated in the last five years. The trend is particularly strong among imaging centers, which diagnose abnormalities in the spine, knees, brain and other parts of the body with techniques like magnetic resonance imaging, CAT scans and X-rays.
Proponents say the joint ventures raise capital for expensive, sophisticated equipment, make it more convenient for people to obtain the latest medical procedures and give doctors more control over the quality of services.
But the critics say there is a conflict of interest whenever a doctor refers patients to laboratories and clinics in which the doctor has invested.
 
More Tests at Higher Fees
 The Florida study is based on 18 months of research done under contract with the board by Jean M. Mitchell, associate professor of economics at Florida State University, and Elton Scott, associate professor of finance at the university.
They reported that investments by doctors had relatively little effect on the cost or quality of services at hospitals and nursing homes, ambulatory surgery centers and agencies providing health-care services to people at home. But they said, "Results clearly indicated problems in either access, costs, charges, utilization or quality of health-care services for clinical laboratories, diagnostic imaging and physical therapy centers."
For example, Mr. Bracher said, clinical laboratories owned by doctors perform "almost twice as many diagnostic tests per patient" as similar laboratories with no physician investors. "The average charge in a full-service joint venture lab is $43 per patient, as compared with an average charge of $20 per patient" in the other labs, he said.
Likewise, the study says that physical therapy centers owned by doctors typically schedule more visits for each patient but use fewer licensed therapists, so there is more revenue derived from each patient.
"A physical therapist employed by a joint venture facility treats an average of 20 patients per day, whereas in the typical non-joint venture facility a physical therapist treats an average of 12 patients per day," the study says. It concludes that the doctor-owned centers "provide a lower quality of care," in part because workers spend less time with each patient.
Florida doctors say they would oppose a ban on investments by doctors in health-care businesses. But some doctors acknowledge that there have been cases of abuse and say they would welcome official guidelines. "There needs to be some state legislation that establishes guidelines for physician investment in joint ventures," said Donald S. Fraser Jr., a spokesman for the Florida Medical Association. Another spokesman for the group, Gerald M. Soud, said, "We don't dispute the findings, but we want to analyze the data."
Dr. Charles P. Hayes Jr., a kidney specialist in Jacksonville, Fla., said the high volume of medical tests and procedures here could be explained partly by the presence of a large elderly population and by doctors' desire to protect themselves against lawsuits alleging medical malpractice. "We may have a sicker elderly population than other parts of the country because a lot of them move down here for their health," he said.
The Florida study surveyed 160 diagnostic imaging centers and found that 92.5 percent of them were owned wholly or in part by doctors. "The study shows that profits for diagnostic imaging centers are higher than for all other types of joint ventures," Mr. Bracher said.
The study compared Florida imaging centers with those in the Baltimore area, which are less likely to be owned by doctors who refer patients for examinations. Doctors ordered about 20 magnetic resonance imaging procedures for each 1,000 Miami residents, as against 12 for each 1,000 people in the Baltimore area.
 
Lawmakers' Interest
 The study does not makes no recommendations, but the board will submit proposals to the Florida Legislature in a few months. "This is a hot topic in Florida and much of the nation," Mr. Bracher said. "Because of the amount of local and national attention this study has generated and the need to avoid widespread speculation about the findings, we thought it was best to go ahead and release these preliminary findings."
The findings indicate that laboratories owned by doctors "perform more tests per patient, have higher charges and provide a lower quality of services" than laboratories having no investments by doctors, the report says.
The study notes that proponents say joint ventures promote access to new health-care technology for people in isolated rural or urban areas. "This does not appear to be the case in Florida, however, as none of the joint venture facilities are located in medically underserved areas," the study says. Thus, it concludes, in Florida "joint ventures do not increase access to rural or underserved indigent patients."

Meggett Does Everything, Except Agree With Giants

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MENTOR, Ohio, Aug. 8

 BODY:
How much is Dave Meggett worth?
The Giants and Meggett -- an offensive threat as a running back, pass receiver, punt returner and kick returner -- are so far apart in contract negotiations that he might not play this year. 
 George Young, the Giants' general manager, and Harry Hulmes, the assistant general manager, are here with the team as it practices with the Cleveland Browns for Saturday night's preseason game. Tony Agnone, who is Meggett's agent, and Howard Shatsky, Agnone's associate, are in Baltimore.
The Giants have made one offer and Agnone has made one counteroffer. Shatsky said by telephone that he talked this morning with Hulmes. He said Hulmes told him the Giants did not plan another offer now.
Meggett's original two-year contract expired after last season. As a fifth-round choice in 1989, he received base salaries of $75,000 that year and $90,000 in 1990, plus a signing bonus of $37,500. The Giants said they also paid him $200,000 in incentives.
Meggett became a Pro Bowl kick returner as a rookie. He has won All- Pro honors in his two seasons, and his versatility as a runner-receiver-returner has prompted other teams to search for players just like him.
In May, the Giants offered a new contract. According to Agnone and Shatsky, they offered Meggett $1.025 million over three years.
The agents called the offer insulting. They did not make a counteroffer until last week, a three-month wait that Young considered insulting.
The 18-page counteroffer asked for $1.7 million over two years. That consisted of salaries of $700,000 this year and $800,000 in 1991 plus a $200,000 signing bonus.
Young said he considers those numbers outrageous. Meggett's agents feel that, in effect, they are telling the Giants that Meggett should receive makeup money because he had achieved more than expected.
In 1989, the Giants also drafted Myron Guyton, the free safety, and Howard Cross, the tight end. In the last two weeks, they negotiated new contracts that will pay Guyton $450,000 and Cross $400,000 this year.
Agnone said Meggett was prepared to sit out the season, although he said he did not think that would be necessary. Young said he would try to get Meggett signed, but added, "I don't have any idea if we can get it done."
The Giants still have six players unsigned and absent, and one other signed but holding out. Young's negotiating history suggests that he will work on the less problematic contracts first, so serious work on the Meggett contract may not begin until close to the regular season.
In Monday night's preseason opener against the Buffalo Bills, the Giants replaced Meggett with Stephen Baker returning punts, Dave Duerson returning kickoffs and Lewis Tillman as the third-down back. They will continue in those roles for now.
Meanwhile, Meggett sits and waits.
"He's one of the most exciting players in pro football," Agnone said. "You pay him like the star he is."
"We're not playing football anymore," Young said. "We're just playing economics."

HEADLINE: Restaurants

BYLINE: By Bryan Miller

 BODY:

 
Onda
 Among the scores of restaurateurs who are trying to reel in elusive patrons with the alluring bait of economy, Len Allison and Karen Hubert may be the most eccentric. The former owners of Huberts on Park Avenue, which closed last year, moved downtown to smaller and less costly quarters, hired a bare-bones staff and opened a restaurant that defies a simple label.
What do you call a place that on one menu offers shrimp with radish pudding and Chinese sausage, goat cheese lasagna, Indonesian-style veal-shank stew, and roast chicken with lemon -- the United Nations? They call it Onda.
The mahogany-lined rectangular dining room is as offbeat as the food. Bronze candle sconces and little religious paintings line the walls while the Shirelles coo over the sound system. Well-spaced tables are draped in paper, reinforcing the relaxed theme. Servers are casually attired, taking a cue from the gregarious manager, who comes to your table wearing a plaid sport shirt, a nascent beard and a little gold fish dangling from one ear. Hey, this place could be fun.
And it is fun if you order the right dishes, but doing that takes some investigation. Many of the menu items have two prices, one as an appetizer, one as a main course. This is a good idea for those who like to mix and match. An appetizer of sauteed tenderloin of pork is pleasing, the thin slices of meat served on skewers with a spicy peanut sauce and a cooling cucumber salad. Roasted peanuts resurface in a melange of Chinese rice-stick noodles with butterflied shrimp, tofu and bean sprouts. It's a lively combination, on the sweet side, with good textural contrast. The sweet tooth is sated again in the soft-shell crabs with a sweet-hot sauce of fish stock, sake, red pepper and chili pepper.
A nice communal munchie is the crisply fried baby calamari with pungent tamarind sauce. Pastas also can be a starter or a main course. Lasagna with sun-dried tomatoes, bound with a mortar of dense goat cheese, was too heavy and assertive. You might instead try the pansotti, a Ligurian ravioli that is filled with spinach and enlivened with a pastelike sauce of ground walnuts and herbs.
Onda has a small but well-selected wine inventory. Prices are very modest across the board. You might try the fruity, dry 1988 Chinon from Domaine de la Chapellerie ($19) with succulent roasted quails that are oddly paired with a Chinatown-style egg roll filled with cabbage, carrots and Chinese greens. Roasted chicken with a parsley puree under the skin, asparagus and lemon garnish is deftly done. It is crisp outside and moist within, sitting in a clear lemony broth.
Another good choice is a twist on osso buco, sinewy but tender veal shank with a rich, sweetish caramelized onion sauce and toasted polenta sticks. The indelicate Indonesian veal-shank stew, however, is overpowered by coconut milk. The Chinese-style roasted duck is probably the best effort of all, served with bok choy and water chestnuts.
Seafood does not fare so well. Fried red snapper Thai style with scallops and roasted sweet pepper is colorful but bland, and the highly perfumed steamed flounder with ginger and scallion has nothing over what might be served at a run-of-the-mill Cantonese restaurant.
The ingenuous summer desserts are more fun than throwing your sister into a swimming pool. The banana splits reminded me of my teen-age pigouts on a Jersey Shore boardwalk, and the hot fudge sundae is just as excessive, sans bananas. Chocolate rum espresso cheesecake is every bit as iniquitous as it sounds. Lemon pound cake was crumbly dry on one tasting, better the next time.
Onda's funky international approach to budget dining may not be to everyone's taste. But if the idea of a culinary Cook's Tour intrigues you, it can be recommended.
 
Andiamo
 When Andiamo opened in 1987, it was the biggest thing to hit the Lincoln Center area since Luciano Pavarotti first strolled up to the footlights. This stagy northern Italian restaurant boasted a first-rate chef, an energetic staff and a stylish loft setting.
Nearly four years later, it is still going at a relatively brisk pace. The original chef, Frank Crispo, moved on last year and was replaced by his second, Gregory Godon. Mr. Godon's menu is similar in style to his predecesor's, if perhaps just a little less consistent.
Andiamo is hidden down a corridor behind a casual streetfront spot called Cafe Bel Canto, under the same ownership. At the entrance is a soaring loft with a balcony reached by an iron staircase. Track lights illuminate abstract paintings, and a papier-mache saloon pianist is frozen in mid-song on a wide platform at the back of the room. Tables are generously separated, and conversation tends to float away in this soaring space. Nonsmokers may be pleased to know that smoking is prohibited anywhere in the restaurant.
Two upbeat starters are the mussels steamed in a subtle tomato-cream broth, and the mild, beefy-tasting venison carpaccio, which is seared outside, then sliced and served with tomatoes, red onions, cucumbers and provolone. Fried calamari, served over mixed greens and deep-fried spinach, would have been fine had they not lingered backstage too long, arriving flaccid.
One dish could not be passed up, for it sounded too outlandish: prosciutto, fresh figs and peach-flavored whipped cream with mint garnish. After sampling it, my table of four voted 3 to 1 in favor. (I was in the majority.) While the whipped cream was superfluous, the combination wasn't bad at all: minimally sweet, with a hint of peaches. Agnolotti filled with lobster and porcini and served in a mushroom-cream sauce sounded like a sure winner, but the filling could have been bread crumbs for all the flavor of mushrooms and lobster that came through. The sauce was the best part. A rich, fork-tender duck confit is served on greens and beets.
Andiamo's wine list is rich in selections from virtually all over Italy. A good selection of American chardonnays is available, as is a sampling of red Bordeaux. Prices are about average. The service staff is still knowledgeable and hard-working.
Pastas are uneven. A formidable-looking mountain of penne with pesto and sliced almonds has a snowcap of deep-fried leeks. Underneath all this was hidden a fillet of salmon. The whole assembly was like one of those Pentagon test missiles that do expensive swan dives into the ocean: both are made of quality parts, but when assembled they just don't fly. Whole-wheat pappardelle came with flabby, unappetizing sweetbreads in a shiitake cream sauce, and the chef's variation on spaghetti puttanesca, with sausages and tomato, was overwhelmed by salty black and green olives. One of the best pastas sampled was angel hair with briny clams and shrimp and scallops in a good shellfish broth tinged with saffron.
Among seafood offerings, a special of red snapper over spinach with a sauce of lobster broth was delicate and flavorful. Sauteed halibut steak, another special, was perfectly cooked and accompanied by roasted corn and fresh peas. Tuna encrusted with sesame seeds, fennel seeds and crushed red pepper over couscous and a sesame oil vinaigrette was overpowering; the tuna was lost amid the fireworks. Lamb chops, served with white beans, tomato and green beans, are nicely done, as is a grilled sirloin steak with garlic, black peppercorns and roasted vegetables.
If you crave something sweet before the opera or symphony, chocolate layer cake on a chocolate-latticed plate with coconut ice cream should do the trick. Creme brulee with raspberries is pleasing, better than the undistinguished gelati and pallid fruit sorbets. Fried banana slices come with walnuts and Jack Daniels gelato, which is boozy but unbalanced. Instead, try the tuile cone filled with gelatin-thickened Marsala cream and ringed with fresh fruit.
While not so harmonious as it once was, Andiamo is still worth noting when you look for dinner before or after Lincoln Center performances.

Jews Return to Visit Wartime Refuge

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:

20/20
Hidden Jewish Children Of the Holocaust
Produced by Abby Rockmore; Victor Neufeld, executive producer; Stone Phillips, correspondent. At 10 tonight on ABC.
 Tonight's moving edition of "20/20," at 10 on Channel 7, focuses on two of the thousands of Jewish children whose parents found refuge for them among non-Jews before they themselves were taken to German concentration camps. Renee Osten, who now lives in New York City, returns to the Roman Catholic convent in Toulouse, France, where she spent the last two years of World War II and meets again one of the nuns who risked their lives for Renee and other Jewish girls. Henri Weinstock, who now lives in Vermont, embraces the Belgian schoolteacher who rescued him and scores of other Jewish boys. 
 In the report's strongest moments, the survivors tell Stone Phillips of their feeling of abandonment. They could not understand why their parents were deserting them. Mr. Weinstock says that if he and the other boys who found refuge in a Catholic boarding school had known that their parents had been taken to the camps, "it would have driven us mad."
After almost 50 years, the memories still cut deep. Mrs. Osten tells tearfully of seeing her parents' being taken away on German trucks and refusing to look at her and her older sister, who had spent the night at a Christian neighbor's home. The parents' sacrifice, the courage of those who cared for the children, the survival of some in a time of the slaughter of so many are of course heartening. But, as Mr. Phillips reminds viewers, Mr. Weinstock and Ms. Osten were among the fortunate ones.
 
'Mini Dragons'
Channel 13
Tomorrow at 6 P.M.
 "Mini Dragons" is a four-hour set of programs on "the hottest economies on earth." The news in this interesting report is that the hot spots -- South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong -- may be cooling off in some ways and heating up in others.
The opening hour offers a picture of changes in South Korea through five people who represent different, sometimes conflicting interests: the head of one of the multi-national companies that dominate the country; the owner of a small garment factory who is finding it hard to keep up with the competition; a woman who has been imprisoned for trying to organize unions; a farmer's son who wins a place at Seoul University, and a government planner who is trying to get a deeply divided nation working together.
Their stories reveal the pressures building up in a society that owes its success to an unstable combination of tough government and big business on the one hand and low-paid workers on the other. Frequent strikes and protests have forced increases in wages -- to about $10 from $2 for an 11-hour day in a small garment factory -- that are making it difficult for many businesses to compete with Indonesia and Thailand where labor comes even cheaper.
Along the way, one gets a feeling for the group solidarity that seems to be basic to Korean society. Loyalty to the family becomes loyalty to the university, the corporation, the political movement. A busload of new employees of the billion-dollar conglomerate Ssangyong, to which they will devote their entire working lives, sing "It's dazzling . . . our future. Let's work!" Less happy workers sing: "Let's crush labor exploitation."
That farmer's son has hardly arrived at Seoul University before he is participating in a rally. "I belong here," he says proudly. "I'm part of this university."
The hour, somewhat amateurishly introduced and summed up by Yue-Sai Kan, a popular television personality in China, is anything but a rah-rah travelogue. It leaves the impression that the economic miracle is turning into a social nightmare.
Also covered in tomorrow's four-hour stretch (the Channel 13 schedulers are at it again): political changes in Taiwan; Singapore's efforts to sustain its economic momentum, and the future of capitalist Hong Kong as part of a Communist China.

HEADLINE: Review/Theater;
Growing Up With Faith That Miracles Happen

BYLINE: "The Good Times Are Killing Me," initially produced by Second Stage, has reopened at the Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Manhattan. Following are excerpts from Frank Rich's review, which appeared in The New York Times on April 19.

 BODY:
The wonderful thing about children is that they believe everything is possible. What makes Lynda Barry's first play a happy occasion is that she captures the innocent abandon of childhood with the wit of a mature writer, but without letting go of the uninhibited child still lurking deep within herself.
Ms. Barry's uneven but highly promising comedy, "The Good Times Are Killing Me," is about Edna Arkins, a pre-adolescent girl of the mid-1960's who believes, for the duration of elementary school anyway, that miracles like movie stardom and racial harmony are to be had for the asking, no matter what obstacles parents might place in the way. Ms. Barry, a syndicated cartoonist ("Ernie Pook's Comeek"), is just as free-spirited as her heroine in her first effort at writing for the stage. Like Edna, Ms. Barry at her best would rather hop, skip and jump than walk a straight dramatic line between any two points. 
 The evening has the rambunctious style if not the campiness of a John Waters movie like "Hairspray" in which the rituals of growing up, the increased racial segregation of rock music and the accelerating civil rights movement all converge on the streets of a changing blue-collar urban neighborhood. Sociological sea changes and intimate familial episodes are both defined by pop songs, whether the singers be Johnny Mathis, Paul Anka, James Brown, Elvis Presley or, in one loopy interlude, Julie Andrews in "The Sound of Music."
Mark Brokaw, the production's impressive young director, is in perfect tune with the playwright's jukebox approach to the traditional memory play. As Edna remarks that a song can make "the past rise up and stick in your brain," so old songs (and old "American Bandstand" or "Soul Train" dances) rise up in fragrant patches to accompany the script's remembered anecdotes about variously beloved and thorny relatives and neighbors. "Good Times" sometimes seems to be touring the early chapters of its heroine's biography with the same ease with which one might pass in and out of distant radio stations while turning a dial. Upbeat episodes like Edna's budding friendship with a black girl next door, Bonna (Chandra Wilson), are as gracefully and economically revisited as such heartbreaks as a father's desertion. Life, by turns romantic and bitter, just keeps popping in and out of the doors that line the set's row-house facade.
As acted by Angela Goethals with a fetching precocity that never turns bratty, Edna is a winning guide to her wonder years. Ms. Goethals is moving, too, when she and her sad-faced kid sister (Lauren Gaffney, another fine child actor) turn their house's basement into a "Record Player Nightclub" that, though conceived as a joyous imaginary refuge from their parents' marital travails, becomes a mausoleum for lost love.
While not as fully written, the story of the black family next door is just as well acted, particularly by Ms. Wilson and Kim Staunton. Even when the writing lacks fine detail, one still feels Ms. Barry's kinship with black characters whose deferred dreams are touched by, but not really redeemed by, such revolutionary phenomena as "A Raisin in the Sun," "To Kill a Mockingbird" and the Black Panthers.
"Good Times" begins to dwindle when the author takes the issue of race relations head on rather than elliptically. Act II devolves into a diagrammatic tale of the gradual parting of Edna and Bonna during the seventh grade, and the girls' story all too heavily symbolizes the larger tale of racial separatism on the eve of the riots of the late 60's. Suddenly a previously free-form play leans on a contrived plot twist -- an exclusionary teen-age party -- and takes to making points didactically. By the final half-hour, the writing has become as formulaic and glib as the television specials on racial tolerance that the play has previously mocked.
Young audiences -- and this is a play sure to earn the respect and laughter of young audiences -- will not mind the faults too much, for the author never patronizes her young characters even when her storytelling becomes a bit numbing to those of parental age. While the failings of "The Good Times Are Killing Me" are real, they are those of breadth, not depth. Lynda Barry's engaging debut as a playwright is anything but cartoonish.

HEADLINE: Black Progress Found, But Poverty Continues

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
More black Americans than ever moved into the upper middle class in the 1980's, but one-third remained locked in deprivation, a private demographic study said today.
And despite a doubling of the proportion of affluent blacks -- those with family incomes of $50,000 or more -- blacks remain the most isolated minority in the United States, according to the report by the Population Reference Bureau, a nonprofit educational group that reports on population trends. 
 The report was prepared by demographic researchers and specialists using Federal statistical data and material from academic sources.
"Evidence points to two African-American communities: one of middle-class and affluent blacks who took advantage of the increased opportunities provided by the civil rights movement, the other of poor, largely urban blacks who remain socially and economically isolated from the American mainstream," said Taynia L. Mann, an author of the report.
The increase in the number of affluent black families since the late 1960's was one of the few positive trends noted in the report.
It said that in 1989, one in seven black families had an income of $50,000 or more. That compared to only one of 17 black families who had similar incomes, adjusted for inflation, in 1967.
The number of affluent black families doubled in the 1980's, and virtually quadrupled since 1967, the report said. The number was 266,000 in 1967, and more than a million in 1989, it said.
The report said one in three white families was affluent by that same measure in 1989, up from one in six families in 1967.

HEADLINE: Only 50 Great Books of the Last 50 Years?;
Besides Orwell

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I must take issue with Russell Baker, who argues in "Looking for Giants" (column, July 27) that books of the past "had more weight back then." 
 Certainly, the books of the 1892-1942 period that Mr. Baker mentions carried great weight and were responsible for important social changes. Likewise, however, it is not hard to find books of the last 50 years (besides George Orwell's "1984") that have been similarly important.
As I peruse my modest bookshelf, I come upon Ralph Ellison's "Invisible Man" and Claude Brown's "Manchild in the Promised Land," both of which alerted Americans to the plight of our black citizens;
John Hersey's "Hiroshima," whose searing depiction of Hiroshima after the atomic bomb surely played a role in preventing world leaders from using such weapons again;
"The Other America" by Michael Harrington, which informed a prosperous nation of its serious social and economic problems;
Joseph Heller's "Catch-22," which did more than slip a new term into our language;
"The Feminine Mystique" by Betty Friedan, which helped jump-start the women's movement;
"The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers" by Paul Kennedy, which cautions us on our tendency to overextend ourselves militarily and neglect domestic needs.
My list is by no means exhaustive. Indeed, it includes only books by Americans. I am sure other readers -- with longer bookshelves -- can add to my list.

HEADLINE: FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;
Banking Companies Offer Variety of New Financings

 BODY:
Various banking companies announced plans this week for new financings to take advantage of low interest rates.
The Mellon Bank Corporation of Pittsburgh said yesterday that it planned to issue $150 million in a new series of preferred stock through an underwriting group led by Merrill Lynch. 
 Frank V. Cahouet, chairman, president and chief executive, said the 9.60 percent dividend on the stock was Mellon's most favorable since 1989.
Also yesterday, the Union Planters Corporation, a bank holding company in Memphis, said it planned to sell $15 million of cumulative preferred stock at $25 a share, with an increasing dividend rate. The rate will increase 50 basis points, or one-half of 1 percent each year for three years, after which the issue becomes callable. The initial rate will be determined when the issue comes to market.
Jack Parker, chief financial officer, said that increasing the preferred dividend rate yearly gave the bank an incentive to redeem the shares. Proceeds will be used to increase Tier I capital because of its $75 million proposed acquisition of Fidelity Bancshares, a Tennessee savings institution.
Earlier this week, the Norwest Corporation said it had placed $175 million in convertible preferred shares privately with institutional investors. Norwest, based in Minneapolis, said the proceeds would be used for general corporate purposes.
Meridian Bancorp Inc. of Reading, Pa., announced plans on Tuesday to offer 2.5 million to 3 million shares of common stock, adding to the 40.5 million shares outstanding. It said it planned to make a public offering, following the filing of a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about Aug. 15. The company's share price closed yesterday at $18.
Capital Bancorporation, a Cape Girardeau, Mo., bank holding company of 17 units, sold 1,030,195 common shares yesterday through Paine Webber, Inc., at $14.50 a share. One million of the shares were newly issued, while 30,195 were offered by stockholders.
J. P. Morgan & Company, the New York banking organization, offered $150 million of 12-year noncallable subordinated notes yesterday priced at par and bearing a coupon rate of 8 1/2 percent. The lead manager for the notes, which mature Aug. 15, 2003, was the First Boston Corporation.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 14, 1991, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Friday about new financings from banking companies referred incorrectly to an offering of convertible preferred shares from the Norwest Corporation. The offering, which was announced at $175 million and then raised to $200 million, was a public offering, not a private one.

HEADLINE: Study Says Fees Are Often Higher When Doctor Has Stake in Clinic

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Aug. 8

 BODY:
Doctors' ownership of laboratories, diagnostic imaging centers and physical therapy clinics tends to increase the use and cost of such services without improving access to care for poor people or residents of rural areas, a Florida state agency reported today.
A study done by the agency also found that more than 45 percent of the doctors practicing in Florida, 8,500 of 18,250 doctors, have invested in joint ventures to which they can refer patients. 
 The investments have generated intense debate in Florida and other states, with some people asserting that there is a potential conflict of interest whenever doctors refer patients to clinics in which the doctors have invested.
 
Hard Numbers for First Time
 The Florida study, eagerly awaited by health officials around the country, is the first to document how pervasive such investments are, and how they can add to health-care costs.
The Federal Department of Health and Human Services has adopted rules to limit such investments by doctors paid through Medicare and Medicaid. The results of the Florida study are likely to bolster efforts by members of Congress and officials in other states to adopt broader restrictions on investments by doctors in health-care businesses. But such investments are so widespread that a complete ban would be extremely disruptive, doctors warn.
The study here, by the Florida Health Care Cost Containment Board, adds an ingredient largely missing from the national debate: concrete data, based on a statewide survey of 2,200 clinics and other health-care businesses. The Florida study is far more comprehensive than any done by the Federal Government or other states, but its results are consistent with findings from a more limited survey by the Federal Government in 1989.
James J. Bracher, executive director of the Florida agency, said at a news conference that clinics and laboratories in which doctors had invested had higher costs than businesses offering the same services but not owned by doctors. In addition, he said, there was evidence that the doctor-owned joint ventures were used more frequently, used less-skilled workers and offered limited access to the poor.
In Florida and elsewhere, joint ventures for doctors have proliferated in the last five years. The trend is particularly strong among imaging centers, which diagnose abnormalities in the spine, knees, brain and other parts of the body with techniques like magnetic resonance imaging, CAT scans and X-rays.
Proponents say the joint ventures raise capital for expensive, sophisticated equipment, make it more convenient for people to obtain the latest medical procedures and give doctors more control over the quality of services.
But the critics say there is a conflict of interest whenever a doctor refers patients to laboratories and clinics in which the doctor has invested.
 
More Tests at Higher Fees
 The Florida study is based on 18 months of research done under contract with the board by Jean M. Mitchell, associate professor of economics at Florida State University, and Elton Scott, associate professor of finance at the university.
They reported that investments by doctors had relatively little effect on the cost or quality of services at hospitals and nursing homes, ambulatory surgery centers and agencies providing health-care services to people at home. But they said, "Results clearly indicated problems in either access, costs, charges, utilization or quality of health-care services for clinical laboratories, diagnostic imaging and physical therapy centers."
For example, Mr. Bracher said, clinical laboratories owned by doctors perform "almost twice as many diagnostic tests per patient" as similar laboratories with no physician investors. "The average charge in a full-service joint venture lab is $43 per patient, as compared with an average charge of $20 per patient" in the other labs, he said.
Likewise, the study says that physical therapy centers owned by doctors typically schedule more visits for each patient but use fewer licensed therapists, so there is more revenue derived from each patient.
"A physical therapist employed by a joint venture facility treats an average of 20 patients per day, whereas in the typical non-joint venture facility a physical therapist treats an average of 12 patients per day," the study says. It concludes that the doctor-owned centers "provide a lower quality of care," in part because workers spend less time with each patient.
Florida doctors say they would oppose a ban on investments by doctors in health-care businesses. But some doctors acknowledge that there have been cases of abuse and say they would welcome official guidelines. "There needs to be some state legislation that establishes guidelines for physician investment in joint ventures," said Donald S. Fraser Jr., a spokesman for the Florida Medical Association. Another spokesman for the group, Gerald M. Soud, said, "We don't dispute the findings, but we want to analyze the data."
Dr. Charles P. Hayes Jr., a kidney specialist in Jacksonville, Fla., said the high volume of medical tests and procedures here could be explained partly by the presence of a large elderly population and by doctors' desire to protect themselves against lawsuits alleging medical malpractice. "We may have a sicker elderly population than other parts of the country because a lot of them move down here for their health," he said.
The Florida study surveyed 160 diagnostic imaging centers and found that 92.5 percent of them were owned wholly or in part by doctors. "The study shows that profits for diagnostic imaging centers are higher than for all other types of joint ventures," Mr. Bracher said.
The study compared Florida imaging centers with those in the Baltimore area, which are less likely to be owned by doctors who refer patients for examinations. Doctors ordered about 20 magnetic resonance imaging procedures for each 1,000 Miami residents, as against 12 for each 1,000 people in the Baltimore area.
 
Lawmakers' Interest
 The study does not makes no recommendations, but the board will submit proposals to the Florida Legislature in a few months. "This is a hot topic in Florida and much of the nation," Mr. Bracher said. "Because of the amount of local and national attention this study has generated and the need to avoid widespread speculation about the findings, we thought it was best to go ahead and release these preliminary findings."
The findings indicate that laboratories owned by doctors "perform more tests per patient, have higher charges and provide a lower quality of services" than laboratories having no investments by doctors, the report says.
The study notes that proponents say joint ventures promote access to new health-care technology for people in isolated rural or urban areas. "This does not appear to be the case in Florida, however, as none of the joint venture facilities are located in medically underserved areas," the study says. Thus, it concludes, in Florida "joint ventures do not increase access to rural or underserved indigent patients."

HEADLINE: Your Taxes;
States Collecting For Many Causes

BYLINE: By Robert D. Hershey Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Once the Federal Government introduced its political campaign checkoff, which since 1967 has allowed taxpayers to designate $1 of their taxes for Presidential races, it was perhaps inevitable that tight budgets and interest-group activism would combine to make the idea almost irresistible to states.
With North Dakota the last to fall into line, each of the 40 states with a broad-based personal income tax now has at least one checkoff box. In all, there are 125 programs, or an average of more than three for each state, according to a survey by the Federation of Tax Administrators. Most of the state checkoffs are taxpayer donations, rather than a diversion of tax money. 
 Since 1988, 16 programs have been added in 10 states, with Massachusetts installing the first in the nation to benefit AIDS patients; Arkansas, Mississippi, Utah and West Virginia adding educational checkoffs, and California, Illinois and Oregon providing the opportunity to help fight Alzheimer's disease.
The other two dozen causes include the arts, the United States Olympic Committee, the homeless, drug education, historic projects, child abuse, the aged, Vietnam veterans and trees.
Alabama and California have eight checkoff programs each, while Idaho and Rhode Island have six each; only seven states have just one.
"The most popular by far is non-game wildlife," said Ronald W. Alt, senior research associate for the federation. This category, which includes land preservation, is on the tax forms of 37 states, including New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Eighteen states have a political checkoff.But while the money raised by state checkoffs isrelatively small -- $30.1 million in 1989 -- the practice seems here to stay. Louisiana, dismayed by the unwieldiness of 12 checkoffs, eliminated all of them from 1988 returns. By 1990, however, the state had three.
"With declining state resources and growing social demands, voluntary donations gathered through the income tax are likely to be seen as a potential source of revenue by an increasing number of causes," the federation predicted.
 
 Debating the Luxury Tax
 For the better part of two years -- until it reversed course in the 1990 budget agreement -- the Bush Administration adamantly opposed tax increases. Now it is against a tax cut, one that many people contend would benefit the economy, not to mention an important political constituency of the Administration.
At issue is the luxury tax imposed last autumn on high-priced boats, aircraft, jewelry, furs and automobiles, a tax estimated by the Joint Tax Committee to raise almost $1.5 billion over five years -- and comforting to many politicians because most taxpayers would view it as a tax on the rich.
But the numbers projected, a growing number of critics charge, largely disregard changes in people's behavior, including the fact that lower demand for these items puts those who make and sell them out of work. According to two Republican members of the Joint Economic Committee, Representative Olympia Snowe of Maine and Senator Connie Mack of Florida, the luxury tax will cost 9,400 jobs in the yacht, airplane and jewelry businesses alone this year. They say the Government will lose nearly $5 for each $1 the tax generates.
More than 250 members of Congress have co-sponsored repeal measures -- half a dozen have been introduced -- said Walter E. Huizenga, president of the American International Automobile Dealers Association.
But the Treasury has said it does not favor repeal "at this time," noting that the luxury tax has been in place for barely half a year and that the economy has been in recession. It is thus "too early to assess what the tax's impact will be in terms of effect on the industry, revenues realized or difficulty of administration."
The unstated reason, however, is undoubtedly the fear that any tampering might begin to unravel the budget deal.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher; Gold Prices Also Advance

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished higher yesterday against most major currencies in light trading despite new evidence of moderating inflation that suggested interest rates may be headed lower.
Gold prices were also higher. Gold for current delivery in New York rose $1.20 an ounce, to $358.40, on the Commodity Exchange. And the Republic National Bank in New York quoted an after-hours bid for gold at $358.50 an ounce, up $2 from late Thursday. 
 The United States Producer Price Index fell two-tenths of 1 percent in July, following a decline of three-tenths of 1 percent in June, the Commerce Department reported.
The inflation news seemed to suggest that price increases would remain subdued in coming months, which would give the Federal Reserve leeway to cut interest rates to help invigorate the economy.
Lower rate expectations would normally depress the dollar because rate declines reduce the potential yields that foreign investors would receive on dollar-denominated securities.
 
Behind the Rise
 Yesterday's rise in the dollar "caught a lot of people by surprise," said John McCarthy, chief currency dealer at Algemene Bank Nederland in New York. But he said there had been interest in buying the dollar since it sank earlier in the week toward 1.7 German marks.
Christa Bleyleben, a vice president for foreign exchange at the Bank of Boston in Boston, said some traders had already incorporated the possibility of lower United States interest rates and higher German rates into the price of the dollar.
She said the dollar's decline from 1.8 marks over the last two weeks showed that traders recognized that "the economy is not out of the woods yet and that there may be some delayed recovery here." A rise after that kind of a decline is not unusual, she said. The dollar finished yesterday in New York at 1.7288 German marks, up from 1.7140 late Thursday.
Dealers said there was also considerable dollar buying yesterday to cover short positions.
Before the price report was released, the dollar had risen by 0.85 yen, to 136.30 yen, in Tokyo. It finished at a higher rate of 136.80 yen in London after the release of the report. In New York, the dollar rose to 136.55 yen, from 136.15 late Thursday.
In London, the pound fell to $1.6965 from $1.7005 late Thursday. In New York, the pound fell to $1.6945 from $1.7065.
Late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Thursday, were: 1.5145 Swiss francs, up from 1.5010; 5.8805 French francs, up from 5.8330; 1,295.50 Italian lire, up from 1,284.00, and 1.14655 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4650.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 17.66, to Below 3,000 Again

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average fell below the 3,000 level yesterday for the second time this week, closing at 2,996.20, down 17.66 points.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was relatively low at 144.07 million shares, down from 163.9 million on Thursday. Declining issues outpaced advancing ones by 868 to 695. 
 For the week, the Dow dropped by 10.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell yesterday by 2.20, to 387.12, while the American Stock Exchange's composite index fell 0.61, to 365.98. In over-the-counter trading the Nasdaq composite index was off 1.08 at 508.31.
 
Gains Soon Eradicated
 A better-than-expected report on the inflation front yesterday morning on a drop of two-tenths of a percent in the Producer Price Index for July lifted stocks but the gains were soon eradicated.
Birinyi Associates, which follows program trades, said all five made yesterday were sell programs, with a combined time of 41 minutes, during which the Dow fell by a cumulative 35.35 points.
Paul J. Kronlokken, a technical analyst for Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis, said the stock market went full circle, with the full breadth down most of the day. "Initial reaction to the producer price figures was good for stocks, behind a bond market rally," he added. During the day the market attempted a couple of rallies, but fell short each time.
Early gains were erased as investors began fretting over this week's quarterly refunding, particularly the sale of the long 30-year bond, which did not do as well as the three-year and 10-year note auctions.
"On an intra-day basis the market found support with the Dow at 3,010," Mr. Kronlokken said, "but 3,000 is a psychological level, and you always find some resistance above or below."
Technology and health-care stocks made early gains, but gave them all back toward the close, he noted.
In reporting the drop of two-tenths of a percent in producer price figures, the Labor Department attributed a good portion of the decline to a steep fall in gasoline and food. Without those often volatile components, the core rate rose by two-tenths.
Wall Street economists had expected the index to be unchanged with the core rate up by two-tenths of a percent.
Among the most active stocks yesterday, with 2.96 million shares traded, was Westinghouse Electric, which fell 1 1/2, to 22 3/4. Westinghouse had announced that the chief financial officer of its troubled Westinghouse Credit unit had resigned.
Deere fell 7/8, to 50 7/8, as Shearson Lehman Brothers lowered its 1991 earnings estimate for the company, to $1.35, from $1.70. Deere's fiscal year ends Oct. 31.
 
Outlook Depresses G.M. Stock
 General Motors fell 1 3/8, to 38 1/8. Jacob T. Battenberg 3d, a G.M. vice president, in a talk to security analysts, said the auto maker did not expect North American operations to return to profitability in the next two to three years. He added that the company would lose money in North America until auto sales returned to 15 million units a year.
USX-Marathon rose 1/8, to 28 3/8. Paul Ting, an Oppenheimer analyst, said he had been briefed on the potential size of an oilfield Marathon discovered in Tunisia. "It's very bullish for the company," he added.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
A Top Officer Leaves Westinghouse Credit

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The Westinghouse Electric Corporation said yesterday that the top financial officer of its troubled credit subsidiary, which took a nearly $1 billion charge against earnings last year, had resigned to pursue other interests, including a possible post with the parent company.
The executive, Laurence A. Chapman, 41 years old, resigned from the Westinghouse Credit Corporation at his own initiative, a spokesman said. The resignation was effective immediately. Mr. Chapman had been in the post since mid-1988, the spokesman said. 
 A native of England who became a naturalized American citizen, Mr. Chapman had been with Westinghouse for 10 years and before that had been a senior executive with the Royal Bank of Canada. Mr. Chapman asked Westinghouse's public relations department to decline requests for interviews.
James W. Meighen, 47, executive vice president of investment policy and portfolio management, will assume Mr. Chapman's post immediately and will also retain his previous responsibilities.
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Westinghouse shares fell $1.50 yesterday to close at $22.75, on heavy volume of nearly three million shares.
The credit subsidiary, which is part of Westinghouse's financial-services operation, is one of the nation's largest such operations. It lent heavily to commercial real estate developers, as well as to leveraged-buyout firms that took on heavy debt. In addition, it had about $650 million in marketable securities, most of which were high-yielding junk bonds. When the economy turned sour, analysts said, so did many of Westinghouse Credit's loans and bond holdings.
Albert E. Turner, an analyst who follows Westinghouse for Duff & Phelps Inc. in Chicago, estimated that 90 percent of Westinghouse Credit's loan portfolio involved either commercial real estate, now in a severe downturn, or lending to leveraged-buyout firms. "You tend to get into businesses that you think you're good at," he said. "And they looked good at it for a few years."
In February, Westinghouse took a $975 million charge against its earnings in the fourth quarter of last year, about $925 million of which applied to Westinghouse Credit.
Analysts said they would not be surprised if Westinghouse had to take further charges against earnings because of the troubles at the credit unit, perhaps even in the range of several hundred million dollars.
The financial-services operations, including the credit unit, reported a loss for last year of $844 million because of the restructuring charge, in contrast to an operating profit a year earlier of $164 million. The unit's revenue rose 13.2 percent last year, to $1.2 billion, from the previous year's $1.06 billion. The financial-services operation also owns United Federal Savings, a medium-sized savings and loan in Galesburg and Peoria, Ill.
Last month, Westinghouse reported a 50 percent drop in second-quarter earnings to $127 million, or 41 cents a share. It said the financial-services operation's revenues were down slightly, but its profits were "sharply lower" from the second quarter of 1990.

HEADLINE: Increase in Bridge Upkeep Is Planned

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Beneath the 79th Street bridge on the Gowanus Expressway in Brooklyn, workmen wearing bright orange vests recently demonstrated a well-known solution to New York City's bridge crisis: they connected a hose to an 8,000-gallon water truck and washed the underside of the bridge, removing dozens of pounds of debris that would have led to widespread corrosion.
For decades, engineers have warned that deferring the maintenance and cleaning of bridges would cause the structures to deteriorate rapidly and eventually cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in emergency repairs and major reconstruction. 
 But transportation officials have continued to slash budgets for bridge maintenance and cleaning, especially in hard economic times and also because the Federal Government provides funds for bridge reconstruction and not for maintenance.
Now it finally seems that New York State is taking some of the necessary steps -- like cleaning bridges on the Gowanus Expressway -- to reverse this trend.
 
Priority for Prevention
 State transportation officials said this week that they planned to spend 20 times more than they did five years ago to maintain and clean state-run bridges in New York City.
Officials of the New York State Transportation Department said they would spend between $40 million and $50 million in fiscal 1991 on bridge maintenance and repair, compared with $20 million in 1990. The state spent $1 million to $2 million on such programs in fiscal 1987.
"We have completely redefined our priorities and put preventative maintenance at the top of the list," State Transportation Commissioner Franklin E. White said in a recent interview. "Deferring maintenance makes no sense. It is the equivalent of eating your children."
The effects of decades of neglect can already be seen in New York City. About 50 percent of the 662 state-run bridges in the city and 56 percent of the remaining 842 operated by the city are considered structurally deficient and unable to carry the loads for which they were designed.
 
Reconstruction Delayed
 Bridges built by the state are maintained by it, and the same is true for the city. To pay for the substantial increase in bridge maintenance, the state plans to spend less on bridge reconstruction; some severely deteriorated bridges that were scheduled to be rebuilt will have to wait.
Michael Francese, director of the State Transportation Department's New York City office, said the state's bridges were deteriorating so rapidly that "the quickest way to turn things around is to pump as much money as possible into maintenance and repair."
Mr. Francese said the state's new maintenance program would concentrate on cleaning and painting bridges every 12 years and repairing joints, bearings, cracks, drains and crucial vertical structural members.
In the long term, preventive maintenance will save the state hundreds of millions of dollars, Mr. Francese said, citing a 1990 study by a consortium of civil engineering professors that found the city and state could save $5 on reconstruction for every $1 spent on maintenance.
 
Ruinous Effects of Salt
 The 842 city-owned bridges, including the four major East River bridges, are maintained by the city's Department of Transportation. While the city is spending more on preventive maintenance than it has in the past, officials cut the planned expansion in bridge maintenance this year to help offset swelling budget deficits.
When a bridge is not painted and maintained regularly, its steel parts are exposed to water, salt and debris, and this causes them to corrode internally. The primary cause of corrosion is the salt that is spread to melt snow or that comes from the water below.
Salt mixes with water and seeps into the bridge's reinforced concrete, which acts like a rigid sponge. Then the salt decomposes, and the resulting chloride ions attack the reinforcing steel bars. The rust that forms on the bars causes them to expand, spalling (flaking or chipping) the concrete above the reinforcement.
For other bridges outside of New York City, the state has increased its budget for bridge maintenance to $60 million for fiscal 1991, from $25 million five years ago.

HEADLINE: Short-Term Rates Slip; 30-Year Yields Up

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Short-term interest rates fell slightly yesterday following a Government report of a decline in producer prices in July. But the good news on the inflation front was of little benefit to the long-term market, where interest rates rose a notch as securities dealers, still burdened with a heavy supply of new 30-year Treasury bonds, pushed prices down.
Among Treasury notes auctioned earlier this week, securities dealers said investor demand had been strong, and the supply of unsold notes was not burdensome. The 6 7/8 percent issue due in three years was offered at 100 3/32, up 5/32 to yield 6.84 percent, well below the 6.92 percent average yield at Tuesday's auction. 
 The 7 7/8 percent issue due in 2001 was offered at 99 12/32, up 3/32, to yield 7.97 percent, a slightly higher yield and lower price than Wednesday's auction, when the yield was 7.94 percent.
 
 Not Enough Demand

The new 8 1/8 percent Treasury bonds due in August 2021 closed at about 98 3/32, down 3/32 to yield 8.22 percent, up slightly from the 8.21 yield late Thursday. After the Labor Department report of a decline of two-tenths of a percent in the Producer Price Index for July, the long-term bond improved to about 99 7/32, but there was not enough demand for that gain to be sustained.
In the short-term market, the rate on three-month Treasury bills fell to 5.32 percent from 5.37 percent, as traders said demand benefited from a decline in overnight interest rates yesterday and hopes that the low inflation report would encourage the Federal Reserve to reduce short-term rates.
Nervousness about deposit runs at Hong Kong branches of both Citibank earlier this week and the Standard Chartered Bank yesterday were widely discussed in the market but did not seem to result in any signficant flight to the quality of Treasury bills. Analysts noted that there was no increase in Eurodollar deposit rates that would suggest a drop in investor confidence in large banks.
 
Not Seen as Fed Signal
 Although the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market fell to 5 1/4 percent yesterday, many analysts said the drop was not a signal that the Fed was trying to ease monetary policy more than expected earlier in the week. On Tuesday, when the Fed signaled an easing move by temporarily buying Treasury securities, analysts immediately concluded that the Fed was encouraging a decline of one-fourth of a percentage point in the overnight funds rate, to 5 1/2 percent from 5 3/4 percent.
Louis v. B. Crandall, a market analyst at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, estimated that the decline in the funds rate yesterday was temporary. He noted that after the overnight bank loan rate rose to a peak of 30 percent late Wednesday, the Fed "overcompensated" and supplied extra reserves through temporary purchases of securities for customer accounts.

HEADLINE: Iraq Rejects U.N. Draft Resolution Allowing It to Sell Oil to Buy Food

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Iraq today rejected a draft United Nations resolution that would let it sell a limited amount of oil to buy food and medical supplies.
"The draft resolution does not provide the financial resources, even at a minimal level, to meet the needs of our people in terms of food, medicine and important humanitarian equipment," the Iraqi News Agency quoted Prime Minister Saadun Hamadi as saying. 
Mr. Hamadi said the resolution would deny Iraq sovereignty over its natural resources and bring Baghdad under the control of other countries.
The draft would allow the sale of up to $1.6 billion worth of embargoed Iraqi oil over six months. Much of that amount would be available for food.
 
War Reparations
 The rest would be used to pay war reparations, cover the cost of destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, pay half of the expenses of a United Nations commission demarcating the Iraq-Kuwait border and reimburse the United Nations for overseeing the return of looted Kuwaiti property.
The Baghdad Government would not control any of the money, which oil purchasers would deposit directly into a United Nations escrow account.
Mr. Hamadi said the "colonialist powers" were not concerned with the suffering of the Iraqi people but wanted to solve their own financial problems at Baghdad's expense.
The American representative at the United Nations, Thomas R. Pickering, sought to play down Mr. Hamadi's statement. "I would say stand by for further word," Mr. Pickering told reporters in New York.
 
Investigation of Nuclear Program
 In Baghdad, the head of a United Nations team looking for evidence of an Iraqi nuclear weapons program said today that Iraq's uranium enrichment program was not for peaceful purposes.
David Kay, the leader of the fourth nuclear inspection team to visit Iraq, said the secrecy surrounding the program and the methods employed made no sense for a peaceful program.
But he stopped short of saying whether he thought Iraq had produced a bomb.
Under the terms of the Security Council's cease-fire resolution, Baghdad must disclose and dismantle its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq has said its nuclear programs were for peaceful research. The United States has accused it of lying to conceal a secret nuclear weapons program and has threatened fresh military strikes if it does not come clean on nuclear secrets.

HEADLINE: A Revamping at Alcoa As Pressures Mount

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum producer, said yesterday that it was broadly reorganizing itself for the second time in five years in a continuing battle against the industry's problems of low prices and deep price discounting.
The changes at the Aluminum Company of America will eliminate two layers of management and give more autonomy to the company's 25 worldwide business units, covering everything from smelting to bottle cap production. Industry experts said the moves were clearly the latest efforts by Alcoa's chief executive, Paul H. O'Neill, to change the corporate culture of the Pittsburgh-based company. But they were mixed on how effective his actions would be. 
 Mr. O'Neill, 55 years old, said his objective was to fashion a leaner, more productive and energetic company that could make money even during a recession.
 
New Quarterbacks
 In an interview yesterday, Mr. O'Neill said the plans would "change the flow of power from the traditional path in corporations." He added, "This gives business-unit leaders the responsibility to, in effect, be the quarterbacks."
The company said it was responding to the increasing competition in the aluminum industry, in which slashing operating costs had become even more of an obsession in the recent years of deep price cutting by rivals like Reynolds and Alcan. Analysts added that Mr. O'Neill, who in 1987 became the first outsider to head Alcoa, was determined to raise the low earnings Alcoa posted in the last two years.
Alcoa said yesterday that the positions of president and group vice president had been eliminated. Instead, there will be three executive vice presidents whose role will be to advise the heads of the 25 business units. The company said that no layoffs were planned as part of the reorganization.
Alcoa previously had three operating groups: metals and chemicals; aerospace and industrial products, and packaging systems, all headed by group vice presidents who reported to the president and chief operating officer, C. Fred Fetterolf. Mr. Fetterolf, 63, retired last week in what he characterized as a disagreement with Mr. O'Neill over "business principles." Neither he nor the company would elaborate. The business units reported to group vice presidents.
Many industry experts had doubts that Alcoa's reorganization of executives could have much effect in a cyclical business whose fortunes are tied, more than anything, to the worldwide price of a commodity like aluminum.
"This is more of a fine-tuning than anything else," said Robin G. Adams, president of Resource Strategies Inc., a metals consulting firm based in Exton, Pa. "I don't think there were any glaring weaknesses in their organizational structure."
But Mr. O'Neill clearly believes there is a correlation, saying that improvements in the culture and structure of companies like General Electric had contributed to their financial success.
"Structure can make a big difference," he said. "We will reduce the amount of time it takes to make a decision and I am convinced that as a result we will make better decisions. Effectively, there is no one left between the business unit head and me."
 
Demand Is Down
 These are difficult times for the aluminum industry. Demand has fallen, particularly in the important automotive and construction industries.
In the more robust days of the last few years -- aluminum prices reached a peak of $1.65 a pound in 1988 and were as high as 93 cents last September -- earnings have been strong. But prices for the first half of this year have fallen, to about 68 cents a pound in the first quarter and to around 60 cents in the second.
Alcoa reported net income of $178.2 million for the first six months of this year, down 43 percent from the period last year. But while Alcoa's earnings have plunged, the company's major North American rival, Reynolds Metals, reported a 51 percent drop for the first half and the Canadian-based Alcan Aluminum lost money in the same period.
Mr. O'Neill has sought to refashion Alcoa's corporate strategy ever since the company's board ousted his predeccessor, Charles A. Parry, and brought him to Pittsburgh from the International Paper Company, where he was president. Mr. O'Neill immediately dropped the company's diversification into such high-technology areas as advanced composite materials and ceramics, which were pursued by Reynolds Metals.
Mr. O'Neill has also linked the compensation of employees and dividends to company profits. Workers in aluminum operations split up to 17 percent of any return on assets above 6 percent. At the same time, senior managers' increases in compensation are tied to meeting a number of performance goals, including such nonfinancial areas as energy conservation and safety.
 
'Open to New Ideas'
 "We have seen a positive change in the years Mr. O'Neill has been here," said an official of the Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workers Union. "There is the feeling that he is listening and is open to new ideas." The union official refused to be identified.
Not all of Mr. O'Neill's decisions have met with such acclaim. Late last year, he stunned the industry by deciding to go against the accepted practice of price discounting. That decision proved costly, with Alcoa losing as much as $100 million in sales and several percentage points in market share, industry analysts say.
Mr. O'Neill defends the decision, saying that Alcoa has regained whatever market share it lost. Moreover, he said, "I thought it was an ideal time to see if it was possible for us to take a different posture from the industry pattern of the past."
While analysts disagreed on the effects of the changes announced yesterday, Peter Anker, a metals analyst with the First Boston Corporation, gave high marks to Mr. O'Neill's plan.
"It is an indication of a desire to do something to make the company more responsive to customers," he said. "We're seeing more of that these days in American industrial enterprises: trying to get companies back to providing service to customers."

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Fell 0.2% in July

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Prices almost always behave better after recessions. The Government's latest inflation report shows that they are doing so now.
Producer prices dropped two-tenths of 1 percent in July, the fourth decline since February. "There's not much inflationary pressure in the economy," said David Wyss, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill. 
 Gains on the inflation front have generally followed the pain of recession. It is not unusual for producer prices to decline early in recoveries, as wholesalers and manufacturers keep trimming inventories. This time, better weather for growing fruits and vegetables and ample supplies of oil have been driving down food and gasoline prices, too.
 
The Fed Is Pleased
 The Federal Reserve, which eased interest rates last Tuesday, welcomed the report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics as another sign that inflation was subsiding. "The conditions for lower inflation are in place, and we're starting to see some progress," said David W. Mullins Jr., vice chairman of the Fed. But the bond market barely budged.
Better-behaved prices give the Fed more maneuvering room. "Good inflation news allows the Fed to ease without disturbing the bond market," said William Dudley, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
So far this year, the oft-quoted prediction of Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, that inflation would wind up about one percentage point below its pre-recession rate seems to be materializing. The broadest measure, the fixed-weight G.N.P. deflator, went from a 5 percent annual rate in the winter to around 3 percent in the spring. Wages have been rising slowly, and commodity prices have been weak.
What is more, "the fundamentals are in place to make substantial progress," Mr. Mullins said. The factory-utilization rate is below 80 percent, unemployment is 1.5 percentage points higher than a year ago, and the recovery seems to be anemic. Money-supply growth over the last year has been modest.
But economists and Fed officials caution that good inflation news is not likely to tempt the Fed to abandon its cautious stance. "It's important to keep money growth at a moderate pace," said Lee Hoskins, president of the Cleveland Fed.
And Mr. Wyss said, "The Fed has room to loosen, but they won't want to use too much of that too soon."
For one thing, last month's decline in producer prices mostly reflected much cheaper fruit and vegetables and less expensive gasoline. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the index was up two-tenths of 1 percent, and it was 3.3 percent above a year ago. "The core rate is still higher than the Fed would like," Mr. Wyss said.
 
 Some Worries Persist

Further, the rise in producer prices, which exclude services, is typically about one percentage below the rise in overall prices. "I'm still worried about service-sector inflation, which is still in the 5 to 10 percent range," said Harvey Rosenblum, research director at the Dallas Fed. With the Fed aiming, as Mr. Greenspan has said, eventually to nudge overall inflation down to a rate between five-tenths and 1.5 percent, the Producer Price Index would ultimately have to bobble around zero.
Bond investors, Mr. Mullins said, were apt to remain skeptical for a while. "It will take more than a couple of good numbers to convince investors that inflation is moving down permanently," he said. "We will have to produce more evidence of progress."
But additional reassuring news may not arrive immediately, said Donald Ratajczak at the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University. Gasoline prices have been climbing this month, and a Midwestern drought has sent the futures prices of many agricultural commodities higher. Mr. Ratajczak expects the Producer Price Index to show an increase next month. In the meantime, tax increases may cause a rise in the July consumer price report that is due out next week.

HEADLINE: Home Prices Sag, but Not Enough for Many

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CENTRAL ISLIP, L.I., Aug. 7

 BODY:
As home prices dropped on Long Island, Thomas and Patricia Nolan of Farmingdale scoured the real estate ads for a house in their price range.
They are still looking. Prices are lower, but not low enough for them to be able to get together a down payment and get out of the apartment they are renting. 
 "I could probably afford a mortgage, but how do you get the down payment?" asked Mr. Nolan, a New York City transit police officer with two children.
Despite the much-touted drop in housing prices, thousands of low- and middle-income residents like the Nolans throughout the metropolitan region are still cut out of the market, housing experts say. On Long Island in particular, where median housing prices are the 10th highest in the nation, listings would have to fall thousands of dollars more before such residents could afford a house.
Their best hope for homeownership rests with low-cost housing programs run by government or nonprofit organizations for people or families whose income is between $20,000 and $60,000. But there are not nearly enough units planned or under construction to meet the need, despite aggressive efforts by some Suffolk County towns and the interest of private builders looking for any work they can get during the recession.
"The price decline hasn't done anything," said Peter J. Elkowitz, program administrator of the Long Island Housing Partnership, a not-for-profit group in Happauge. The three-year-old organization has planned or developed hundreds of single-family homes and town houses for first-time buyers at subsidized prices under $80,000.
Partnership officials could not estimate how many Long Island residents continue to be priced out of the housing market. But "everytime we advertise, we get swamped," Mr. Elkowitz said.
A 72-home development planned by the Partnership for the community of North Amityville in Babylon has attracted more than 300 applications. Other subsidized housing programs on Long Island are routinely oversubscribed.
The Town of Islip's College Woods development in Central Islip, the largest suburban affordable housing program in the state, attracted more than 1,100 applications for 100 homes in June 1990, said George Gatta Jr., who is the executive director of Islip's Community Development Agency. This year, it received more than 900 applications for 150 homes.
"It's still absolutely, definitely the American dream, and they're all, one way or another, trying to find it," said Nancy C. Manfredonia, executive director of the Central Islip Civic Council, a nonprofit organization deeply involved in College Woods.
 
Plenty of Work
 Strong demand for low-cost single-family housing continues throughout New York State.
"We could spend $50 million with no problem," said Juan Villanueva, director of the New York State Affordable Housing Corporation. The agency now distributes $25 million annually for housing subsidies statewide, and has supported construction of nearly 1,100 units since 1985. In all, about 1,400 such units have been built in Long Island since 1985, the Long Island Regional Planning Board estimates.
The reason the recent price declines have offered such scant relief is that they are falling from such heights. Median home prices on Long Island fell 10.5 percent between 1988 and 1991, to $156,100 from $174,400, according to the National Association of Realtors, a Washington-based trade group.
But the median income for a family of four on Long Island is $54,500. Since a common rule of thumb is that a family cannot support a mortgage that is more than twice its gross income, many people remain well out of range.
"Once you get over $100,000 or $110,000, you're dealing with people on my waiting list," said Nina Stewart, East Hampton's housing director.
Most of the new affordable housing projects on Long Island are being constructed in Suffolk County. Since 1985, for example, nearly 900 state-subsidized units have been have been complete or planned in Suffolk, compared with 31 in Nassau.
"I can't paint a rosy picture for you," said Raymond H. Malone, Nassau's Commissioner of Housing and Intergovernmental Affairs. Mr. Malone ascribed the lagging effort in Nassau to lack of buildable land and the high cost of the land that is available. The county has concentrated instead on subsidizing rehabilization efforts for renter and owner-occupied housing.
But Peter Klein, a builder active in low-cost housing programs and former president of the Long Island Builders Institute, said this effort was not enough. He called Nassau's record "an abysmal failure."
"Most of what has been done is lip service," Mr. Klein said. "The need is there. The political will isn't."
Suffolk County has much more undeveloped land. Some of the affordable housing programs have taken advantage of that, but the College Woods development in Central Islip is a revitalization effort using land in a once blighted, crime-ridden neighorhood known as Carleton Park.
"If you picked the worst neighborhood in New York City, that's what it was like," Mr. Gatta said.
Hundreds of old houses are being knocked down, to be replaced by about 370 new ones in styles like ranch and colonial. More than 30 families have already moved in amid the dust and noise of a major construction project. The highest price is $100,000, after a $25,000 state subsidy; the project's income limits are $28,000 to $57,000.
The Nolans of Farmingdale entered a lottery this spring to buy a house in College Woods, but ended up on the waiting list.
Caroline and Thomas Dieso have been luckier. They entered the first College Woods lottery and already are living in a three-bedroom, two-bath home that cost $99,000, which works out to $823 a month in mortgage payments, taxes and insurance.
Until last January, the couple rented an apartment in East Islip. A single-family home at market prices was out of the question, Mrs. Dieso said.
 
'Commitment to Keeping People'
 "We weren't thinking about it at all because it was too expensive," she said. "We could never have afforded a $1,200-a-month payment."
One of Long Island's most active housing programs has been run by the Town of East Hampton, which has sponsored or built 240 houses, most in the last six years, Ms. Stewart said. East Hampton has only about half of one percent of Long Island's population, but has been responsible for about 17 percent of the affordable housing built.
"The town really has made a commitment to keeping people who grew up there," Ms. Stewart said.
Joining in the effort to promote low-cost projects are many developers who would have been less interested a few years ago in programs that typically limit how much a builder can make.
"It's better to make 10 percent of $90,000, then 20 percent of nothing," said Mr. Villanueva, of the state affordable housing agency. "They have to stay busy."
A Riverhead program to build 21 subsidized homes attracted proposals from 15 builders, said Andrea Lohneiss, the town's community development director.
"You're not going to get rich doing this, but you're not going to get hurt either," said Mr. Klein, whose company, Klein & Eversoll Inc., won the contract.
Participation can help a company's image, he said. And "it has the additional benefit of doing something socially gratifying."

HEADLINE: Decade of Rep. Smith: Fluke to Tactician

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
When Christopher H. Smith came to Washington a decade ago as a 27-year-old Representative, he was widely considered a political fluke, an anti-abortion zealot who lucked into his seat when the incumbent was indicted in the Abscam scandals.
"I learned very early on what I am, who I am and it's not unsettled by that type of cheap shot," said Representative Smith, who has beaten the odds in repeatedly winning re-election in his heavily Democratic New Jersey district. "Most politicians have had some break." 
 Now the six-term Republican, the chairman and tactician of the House Pro-Life Caucus, is on the verge of gaining increased national attention as the field marshal of White House efforts to sustain a promised Presidential veto of legislation to allow federally financed family planning clinics provide advice about abortion.
Mr. Smith says he has been prepared for prominence by his House Bible study class, a bipartisan group of 10 representatives. "In what can be a very ego-building job, it makes you see very clearly that you're no different from anybody else," he says. "There's a very heavy emphasis on living humbly and living your philosophy of doing unto others as you would have them do unto you."
 
'Could Become a Test'
 But the national attention likely to be lavished on Mr. Smith also may create new difficulties for him in his Central New Jersey district, which, like the country, generally supports abortion rights, according to several polls. The New Jersey chapter of the National Abortion Rights League already is planning to make him a target in next year's election, as are some other groups advocating abortion rights.
"He could become a test of abortion politics," said Stephen Salmore, a political science professor at Rutgers University's Ea gleton Institute and a frequent consultant to Republican candidates.
Although Mr. Smith has sought to broaden his legislative interests, abortion remains his passion, making him "the point man" in the the anti-abortion movement's leadership that includes fellow House Republicans Robert K. Dornan and William E. Dannemeyer, both of California, and Vin Weber of Minnesota.
"We all take leads on different issues," Mr. Smith says, modestly describing the movement's leadership as a collective. But nudged he compares the coterie of leading anti-abortion legislators to a basketball team.
He sees himself as "the playmaking guard, sometimes taking the shot and other times passing, but stealing the ball as often as possible." Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, he said, is "the slam dunker;" Mr. Dornan "the shooting guard;" Mr. Dannmeyer "a forward," and Mr. Weber in "the backcourt."
 
'He's the Mistake'
 But Mr. Smith dismisses suggestions that his leading role in fighting abortion makes him vulnerable at home. He notes that he repeatedly has been attacked by abortion rights groups but has still won re-election with steadily rising majorities. And his district is ideal for an incumbent, forcing candidates to buy time in two of the country's most expensive media markets, New York and Philadelphia. That combination has discouraged many potential opponents.
"He's the mistake that will be there for the next 20 years," Mark Setaro, a lawyer, said after he lost to Mr. Smith last year.
Further, Mr. Smith distanced himself from down-the-line conservatives by amassing a centrist voting record on issues other than abortion. He was one of the first Republicans to break with the Reagan Administration on domestic affairs like health care and the environment and opposed it more than half the time in six of its eight years, according to Congressional Quarterly publications.
He has been an outspoken advocate for Soviet and Romanian dissidents and votes frequently with Democrats on economic, foreign and cultural issues.
 
'A Pure Spirit'
 "Chris Smith is a pure idealist," says Mr. Hyde, who is widely considered the father counselor to opponents of abortion rights. "He's a real inspiration, tenacious. Just when you get cynical here, along comes Chris Smith, eyes bright, ready to take on the goliaths. He's a pure spirit, an idealist.
But critics say he is little more than a political willow without deep roots beyond opposition to abortion. They note that he broke with the Reagan Administration in 1986 and voted to impose sanctions on South Africa. But the same year he voted against a resolution seeking the release from prison of Nelson Mandela, the leader of the African National Congress.
"I would like to see a pluralistic South Africa, the complete abandonment of apartheid," he said in explaining that he did not consider the black leader a political prisoner and accusing the Congress of terrorism. While he supported South African-backed Angolan rebels and United States-financed Nicaraguan rebels, he said he could not overlook Mr. Mandela's refusal to renounce armed struggle until economic sanctions were given an opportunity to force the South African Government to abandon apartheid. "Taking tires, filling them with gasoline and burning people alive, is barbaric."
 
'Almost a Jekyll and Hyde'
 But the lightning rod for most criticism remains his hard-line, unwavering stance that all abortion is murder and all abortionists are murderers. "He's almost a Jekyll and Hyde: a fairly tolerant guy, compassionate, open minded on almost any front," said Representative Les AuCoin, Democrat of Oregon. "But suddenly when it comes to choice, it's something else. A look comes in his eye. He almost looks like he's been electrocuted. His eyes bulge and the rhetoric changes."
Mr. Smith dismisses such criticism. "For 11 years, I've been hearing I'm a right-wing zealot: I'm a moderate conservative," he says.
Tension between Mr. Smith and Mr. AuCoin has become palpable since an abortion debate three years ago. The Oregonian noted that Mr. Smith's efforts to ban all abortions would force his daughter to suffer through a pregnancy if she were impregnated during a rape. In what he describes as "an effort to make an abstract decision real," Mr. AuCoin asked Mr. Smith, who is married and has four children, what he would do if his daughter became pregnant because of a rape.
 
Preparing for Class
 Mr. Smith argues the question was an effort to inflame and notes that few pregnancies result from rape. "Killing the baby doesn't undo the crime of the father," he says. He adds that if one of his daughters were raped, he would try to prevent conception through "high estrogen therapy." The difference between his procedure and RU-486, the so-called abortion pill that he has staunchly denounced, "is a question of intent," he said, adding, "You can't tell within an hour, a day, even several days whether an egg has been fertilized."
Mr. Smith says he came to the abortion issue in 1972 while preparing for a class at Trenton State College when he read an Associated Press story about a fetus that had survived an abortion. "It got the wheels turning about where were those child's rights," he said.
After he graduated from Trenton State, he went to work in his family's wholesale sporting goods business and took the plunge into the political arena the following year, managing the unsuccessful 1976 Senate primary campaign of a Democrat, Steve Foley. "I found I could work 12 to 15 hours a day, get up and do it again," he recalled. The next year, he became executive director of New Jersey Right to Life.
 
Campaign in '82
 But elective politics called. He switched parties but lost in 1978 as the token opposition to Frank Thompson, a veteran Democrat who was chairman of the House Administration Committee. But he won in 1980, when Mr. Thompson was convicted of bribery and conspiracy in the Abscam scandal and later served two years in prison.
Mr. Smith, conventional wisdom said, had fallen into a two-year Washington sojourn through luck. When he ran for a second term in 1982, State Senator Joseph Merlino never took him seriously, broadcasting a commercial showing a young actor hitchhiking to Washington and being kicked down the Capitol steps. "Another politician gone bad," said the voiceover in a takeoff of the 1939 classic "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."
But the Representative struck back with the film's star, Jimmy Stewart, who endorsed Mr. Smith as representing the lead character's "honesty and integrity." Mr. Smith returned to Washington.

HEADLINE: SALOMON BROTHERS ADMITS VIOLATIONS AT TREASURY SALES

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Salomon Brothers, one of the dominant buyers of Government securities, yesterday suspended the two executives in charge of trading these issues and admitted to violating Government rules.
The violations, a big embarrassment for this prominent Wall Street firm, include exceeding the 35 percent limit on the portion of a Treasury issue any one buyer can purchase, and using the names of customers without authorization. 
 Salomon said its actions had caused the Government no losses. But some Federal officials have recently said questionable trading practices could discourage investors from participating in the Treasury-securities market, raising the Government's cost of borrowing. Some traders at other firms who asked not to be identified said the Salomon's activities in May left them with large losses.
The Treasury securities, bills, notes and bonds of various maturities, are sold by the Government to finance the growing budget deficit and become part of the national debt. The big dealers buy the securities from the Government to sell to investors.
 
Federal Agencies Investigate
 The Treasury Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve and the antitrust division of the Justice Department all began investigating Salomon's activities before yesterday's announcement. The firm said that it was cooperating.
In a two-page statement, the firm spoke of finding "irregularities and rule violations" in three Treasury securities auctions, in December 1990 and February and May this year. Through such actions, a firm could profit by squeezing the market -- controlling a large enough share of the securities to raise the prices for others whose trading strategy obligates to buy them under certain circumstances. Salomon has not admitted to creating a squeeze.
 
Calls for More Regulation
 The $2.2 trillion government securities market is one of the most lightly regulated securities markets in the United States -- free from many of the regulations that apply to brokers and traders in the stock market.
The Salomon case is already generating some calls from Congress for increased regulation. But before Salomon's admission, several regulators said they did not need new powers.
The market was rife with rumors that a squeeze occurred in May. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury both later agreed, but at the time they did not imply that there was any wrongdoing. It is not known if those officials knew then whether the 35 percent rule had been violated. Dealers said yesterday that there was no such talk of squeezes in the two other cases Salomon cited.
Salomon's admission sheds light on a market where a handful of huge dealers dominate trading of more than $100 billion a day. Traders on Salomon's cavernous trading floor swap billions in securities at a time, often moving the market, nudging interest rates and muscling competitors aside. Squeezes in some cases are considered just an ordinary part of the game.
"What some people call a squeeze is just the way the market works," said William M. Brachfeld, the head of fixed-income trading at Daiwa Securities America Inc. and chairman of the Primary Dealers Association, which includes the leading dealers in this market.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, concurred in a June letter to Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, that "squeezes are not all that unusual."
An S.E.C official said yesterday that any legal action in this case was at first likely to concern fraud in the use of customer names to buy more than 35 percent of the securities in a Treasury auction.
The unauthorized use of customers' names and the recording of possibly false sales from these customers might violate fraud statutes, the official said.
The immediate focus, he said, is less likely to be a market squeeze or its impact. Some Federal officials have minimized the damage from such a squeeze. John P. LaWare, a governor of the Federal Reserve, told Congress in June, "I don't think that anyone involved in it was significantly damaged by it." But a bond dealer said yesterday, "A tremendous amount of money was made and lost in May." A Treasury official declined to discuss what the penalty might be for violating the Treasury's 35 percent limit.
 
Suspensions at the Firm
 Salomon did not name the two mananging directors it suspended. But employees at Salomon and other dealers in the bond market said they were Paul W. Mozer and Thomas Murphy. The two were not discharged, indicating that their fate will depend on the results of the investigations by Salomon and the Government. Two lower-level employees were also suspended, Salomon said.
Attempts to reach the two executives were unsuccessful. "These were individuals acting on their own without the knowledge of management," said Robert Baker, a Salomon spokesman. Mr. Baker said Salomon had uncovered the irregularities itself and informed the Government.
The announcement shocked many within Salomon and the broader investment community. "I'm stunned," one Salomon employee said. One bond market analyst who asked not to be named said: "This is misuse of the names of the clients and that is a no-no. That goes beyond a squeeze."
 
Use of Unauthorized Accounts
 The Salomon statement said the firm submitted bids for four-year Treasury notes in December 1990 and five-year notes in February this year "using the names of persons who had not authorized such bids." Then Salomon purchased those bonds from the customers. Together with the separate amount that the firm bought under its own name, the total purchases exceeded 35 percent of each of the two issues.
Salomon did not say how much of each issue the firm bought.
In the third case, in an auction for two-year notes in May, Salomon said that through an apparent oversight, it had failed to report some securities it already held when it bid for, and purchased, 35 percent of the new issue. Again, the investment bank exceeded the limit. The securities were brought in the "when issued" market, where securities are traded for several days in anticipation of the actual Treasury auction.
The firm said it was still trying to determine if it also violated the 35 percent limit in May by the same method as in the other two cases.
 
Investigation Continues
 Salomon said it was continuing its own investigation and had discovered other irregularities that it did not divulge in the statement.
Some dealers in the bond market said yesterday that they feared that the Salomon case might cause the Government to tighten its regulations, making investors more reluctant to buy and trade. "If there has been a transgression, that should be dealt with," said Mr. Brachfeld of Daiwa. "But we should not interfere with the Treasury market and make the Treasury pay a higher price because this is paid for by the taxpayers."
But Representative Markey, whose subcommittee oversees this area, called yesterday for "improvement in the regulation of the government securities market."
Officials from the Fed and the Treasury have said the Treasury may review its auction regulations, but they did not ask for more authority. The chairman of the S.E.C., Richard C. Breeden, said he did not need more power to deal with manipulation of the Treasury securities market. But he advocates extending to the Treasury market the rules governing the stock market. Some of these rules would not cover the practices at issue in the Salomon case.

Markets
Salomon Brothers suspended two top traders in Treasury securities and admitted to violating Government rules by purchasing more than the 35 percent of an issue allowed any one buyer and by using customers' names without authorization. Both actions could be used to "squeeze" the market, forcing up prices. [Page 1.] 
 Stocks fell below the 3,000 level, as the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 17.66 points at 2,996.20. [42.]
Short-term interest rates fell slightly after a favorable Government report on inflation. But in the long-term market, burdened with excess bonds, interest rates rose. [42.]
The dollar finished higher against most currencies. Gold also rose. [43.] Cattle prices snapped back from three-year lows. [43.]
 
 The Economy
Producer prices dropped 0.2 percent in July, the fourth decline since February, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The Federal Reserve welcomed the report as another sign that gains on the inflation front were following the pain of recession. [33.]
The Justice Department announced its first indictment involving a scheme that court records show was financed by B.C.C.I. A Jordanian businessman and his accountant were indicted. [36.]
A bankruptcy judge extended an order freezing B.C.C.I. assets in the United States, despite objections from state and Federal regulators involved in liquidating the bank's assets. [36.]
 
 Companies
Alcoa announced a broad reorganization, part of its continuing battle against deep price discounting in the industry. Paul H. O'Neill, chief executive of the world's largest aluminum producer, said he wanted to fashion a leaner, more productive company. [33.]
Delta Air Lines offered to put up $200 million to help Pan Am reorganize around its Latin American division. It said its two-step package would be worth $904 million to creditors. [33.]
Thousands of panicked Hong Kong depositors lined up to withdraw their money from the venerable Standard Chartered Bank, one of two banks that issue Hong Kong currency. The run followed a two-day panic at Citibank Hong Kong. Officials were angry. [33.]
Drexel Burnham Lambert's settlement with creditors was approved by a Federal district court judge, despite objections from former employees, including Michael Milken. [33.]
Prosecutors decided to forgo a fourth GAF trial and drop stock manipulation charges against the company and a top executive, setting back the Government's pursuit of Wall Street crime. [33.]
A Boston bank moved in court against Trans World Airlines, putting a snag in the carrier's effort to reorganize its finances. The Shawmut Bank, the trustee for more than $250 million in T.W.A. debt secured by 189 takeoff and landing slots, sought to have the slots turned over to the bank. [35.]
Great American Bank was seized by Federal regulators. The San Diego-based savings and loan association had a long downward spiral because of bad real estate loans. [34.]
The newly appointed chief of Mutual Benefit Life Insurance, which was seized by New Jersey regulators, announced his resignation. Stephen J. Carlotti cited personal reasons. [35.]
Chase Manhattan expanded into the Connecticut market, by acquiring Citytrust, a Bridgeport-based bank, and Farmers & Mechanics Bank in Middletown, which were declared insolvent by regulators. Chase paid $13 million in cash and agreed to take over $2.2 billion of assets and $2.5 billion of deposits. [35.]
 
 Today's Columns
The checkoff proves popular on tax returns. Since the Federal Government introduced its political campaign checkoff in 1967, 40 states have adopted a checkoff box. Your Taxes. [34.]
A fledgling California company patented technology for a cheap pocket-sized device to let pay-per-call "900"-number telephone services transmit pages of written data. Patents. [34.]

HEADLINE: China and Japan on Path to Better Ties

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 9

 BODY:
As the money flows in and the grand invitations go out, relations between China and Japan are about to reach a two-year flourish, a virtual return to normality, with the three-day visit of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu beginning on Saturday.
Mr. Kaifu will be the first leader of a major industrialized country to visit China since the army crackdown on the democracy movement left at least hundreds dead and thousands wounded two years ago. 
 But while China has been able to build stronger relations with Japan than with any other industrial country in the last two years, those ties are more fragile than they appear.
Relations are marred by a minor territorial dispute and by rivalry for influence over Asia, but, more important, by a history of hostile memories that even the younger generation of Chinese refuses to forget.
 
Resentment Toward Japanese
 "I hate Japanese people," said a Government official in her 30's, who is well educated and has visited Japan. "I was not even born then, but I have read about what happened. I know what they did."
Many Chinese are not at all embarrassed about making comments about Japanese that on the surface sound racist. Expressions for the Japanese war invaders include "Japanese devils" and "dwarf bandits."
Chinese history books and films play down the death toll of Maoist political campaigns and economic mistakes -- more than 20 million people died in a policy-induced famine at the beginning of the 1960's -- but emphasize the atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers. The most famous is the Rape of Nanjing in 1937, when by some estimates 300,000 Chinese died.
China has reacted with fury to periodic suggestions that the reports of the massacres were greatly exaggerated. People's Daily, in one of a series of articles bearing on Mr. Kaifu's visit, carried a report this week on the publicity in New York of a film documenting the incident.
 
Issue of Japanese Compensation
 Some Chinese scholars and even some of China's elderly, retired leaders are trying to revive the issue of Japanese compensation for civilian losses during the Japanese invasion and occupation of China. When China and Japan normalized relations in 1972, the Chinese Government abandoned further claims for official compensation, but these scholars say civilian compensation should still be granted.
In a recent essay in an internal publication for Chinese officials, a scholar, Wu Jiandong, argues that total civilian compensation, adjusting for various factors, could amount to $600 billion. For now, however, it seems very unlikely that the Government will take up the cause.
The leftover animosity from the war does not seem an obstacle to warmer official relations. In addition to Mr. Kaifu's visit, a sign that relations are essentially back to normal came when Beijing recently extended an invitation to Emperor Akihito to visit China next year to mark the 20th anniversary of normalized relations between the two countries.
Japan has not yet responded to the invitation. China never invited Emperor Hirohito, who ruled during the war between the two countries in the 1930's and 40's.
For the most part, the closer ties are a result of greater commercial and investment ties, and of Japan's lack of interest in punishing China for human rights abuses. By some accounts, Japan is seeking warmer relations in part because it would like Chinese support to get a permament seat on the United Nations Security Council.
An unofficial Japanese delegation visited China recently and discussed the prospect of another large low-interest loan linked to support for Japan's bid for a Security Council seat, a Chinese official said. The official said the Chinese Foreign Ministry declined to discuss the issue further and turned down a request that another delegation visit Beijing to discuss the matter.
The Japanese Embassy here denied that Tokyo is seeking a Security Council seat.
The Japanese Government has extended billions of dollars in special-interest loans to China for various infrastructural projects that will mean substantial contracts for Japanese companies. Over the next four years, the equivalent of about $6 billion is expected to be lent to the Chinese as part of a comprehensive loan program.
China has also asked the Japanese for a jumbo energy loan, a request that some Japanese news reports say is as high as $5 billion to $6 billion. The loan is on the agenda for the talks this weekend, People's Daily has reported.

HEADLINE: Cutting Corners on Road, America Takes a Vacation

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SOUTH OF THE BORDER, S.C.

 BODY:
David and Susan Haggerty did not go on vacation last year, but this summer the Phillipsburg, N.J., couple rented a bungalow near St. Petersburg, Fla., to spend a week at the beach. They and their two young daughters visited Sea World in Orlando and Busch Gardens in Tampa, but they also took steps to economize:
Instead of sleeping in motels on the way down and back, they camped, with a tent and sleeping bags. And instead of eating out each night, Mrs. Haggerty cooked many of their meals. 
 "We just felt like this year we needed to get away for a while," Mr. Haggerty, a truck driver, said in a brief rest stop here on the way home. "And this way we didn't have to spend a fortune."
 
Vacation on a Shoestring
 In looking to economize, the Haggertys have lots of company this summer, with much of the nation still reeling from the recession. Interviews at popular vacation destinations and on stopovers, from the Space Needle in Seattle to Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, N.J., turned up many vacationers who said that for the first time in years they were carefully watching their spending, passing up attractions they considered too expensive and generally scrutinizing expenses.
At the Space Needle, the 520-foot-high observation deck in downtown Seattle, a visitor, Joan Myers, who is an industrial marketing consultant from New York, said she chose to vacation in Washington because she wanted to hike and camp out, while also saving money.
"It's a lot cheaper than spending $80 a night on a tiny hotel room," Ms. Myers said, adding that she never gave hotel room costs much thought in the past.
The travel industry says those who are vacationing on a shoestring have it better than many of their fellow Americans. The Arthur D. Little management consulting firm recently reported that one in four Americans said in a survey taken in late July that they were not planning to take a vacation this year, as against one in five who said so in May. The main reason is "economic constraints," the nationwide survey found.
"The Government may be saying the recession is over, but consumers apparently don't believe it," said Harry Foden, the head of Arthur D. Little's travel, tourism and hospitality consulting practice.
As always, millions of Americans are taking summer vacations. But for many the trips are shorter than usual in duration and distance. Most are traveling by car. And when the travelers get where they are going, 42 percent are staying with family and friends, according to projections by the United States Travel Data Center, a not-for-profit research center in Washington. That is the highest level recorded, up from 40 percent last year in the biggest jump in at least a decade.
Much of the increase stems from attempts to economize, according to Scott Dring, a Data Center spokesman.
A decrease has been noted in air travel, according to the nation's airlines, which reported a 2 percent drop in passengers in June, usually one of the most heavily traveled months, as against June 1990.
In other areas, impressions of less-expensive travel trends abound.
"Our unscientific conclusion is that people are making shorter trips," said Sally Branca, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. "They're driving from Ohio to the Jersey shore, for example, instead of flying to California."
A good place to take unofficial soundings of the nation's annual migration is here at South of the Border, a roadside oasis just off Interstate 95, the heavily traveled highway that stretches from Maine to Florida.
About 300 miles from the Florida state line and just over the border with North Carolina, the sprawling spectacle is smack in the middle of the nation's most popular vacation destination: the Southeast, where about 30 percent of all vacationers are expected to visit this summer.
 
A Lure in South Carolina
 From its beginnings as an 18-by-36-foot beer stand in 1949, South of the Border has grown into a roadside hamlet of 14 shops, 7 restaurants and food stands and recreational attractions that operators say has attracted more than 100 million travelers. The complex, which boasts its own post office and zip code, does $30 million a year in business, luring motorists with its big orange-yellow-and-black billboards, 120 of which line the interstate between Virginia and Georgia.
It is also possible to get married and spend a honeymoon here or to buy a $1,500 unicycle in its Rodeo Drive giftshop. But the biggest attractions seem to be fireworks, which are banned in many states, as well as lewd sweatshirts and matchboxes and wooden back scratchers, ceramic mugs and assorted other doodads and gewgaws.
Yet for all South of the Border's ingenuity in coaxing money from visitors, this year and last are the only ones in the history of the privately owned company that sales have not increased. "We're off 11 percent in June and July, and about 7 percent this month," said Alan Schafer, the 77-year-old founder. "People are traveling, but they're pinching pennies. This year they're just squeezing money."
Evidence was ample among the tourists who stop here each day -- as many as 25,000 on some days, according to Mr. Schafer.
On a recent morning Julio Calderon, a maintenance worker from West New York, N.J., pulled in with four young children, headed for Deltona, Fla. Being able to stay with friends and traveling by car made the vacation affordable, he said. "But even driving is expensive," he added. "Tolls, gas, everything gets higher day by day."
Betsy Schneider of Columbia, S.C., also planned a driving vacation, to visit her family and friends on Long Island for a week. "We had to drive, because the cost of air fare for a family is tremendous," Mrs. Schneider said, as she and her two young children prepared to tee off at the miniature golf course, the "Golf of Mexico," before beginning the final leg of their journey home.
 
Lodging Does Well
 One part of the travel industry that appears to be prospering, at least on weekends from late June through Labor Day, is the lodging industry along lengthy stretches of I-95 between towns. After arriving in Alexandria, Va., on a Saturday night, Mrs. Schneider was unable to find an available motel room. "So we had to keep driving all night," she said, until they arrived in Fayetteville, N.C., at 5:30 the next morning, about 300 miles away.
According to travel industry data, many family vacationers appear to be less than well-heeled.
"Traffic has been good, but customers aren't buying near as many T-shirts or trinkets," said Sherry Hoard, manager of "The Thing," a roadside rest stop and museum on Interstate 10 near Benson, Ariz. The highway is heavily traveled by motorists between Texas and California.
People still flock to Busch Gardens, in Tampa, but Jim Doherty, who drives a tour bus for Carefree Travel of Englewood, Fla., said his company's business has fallen off.
"We had 25 people today, and two years ago we'd have had 40 to 45," Mr. Doherty said, while awaiting his charges in the 102 degree heat. Pointing to a sign listing admission at $27.50 for everyone 3 years of age or older, he added, "They're killing themselves with these prices."
Mr. Doherty added that many of his customers economize by eating at the many fast-food restaurants outside the park.
 
Two Big Parks See a Drop
 Attendance is off at Walt Disney World at Lake Buena Vista, near Orlando, and at Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., while revenues for the theme parks and resorts fell 12 percent for the quarter ending June 30, compared with the same period in 1990.
But it has increased at a number of the nation's parks and attractions, and dramatically so at Mt. Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota. "We're up about 30 percent over last year," said Mike Pflaum, the chief ranger. He attributed a "good share" of that increase to the 50th anniversary celebration of the memorial's completion.
That anniversary has had a big impact, too, on the Wall Drug Store in Wall, S.D., a roadside institution that trumpets on billboards all along Interstate 90 free ice water, five-cent coffee and buffalo burgers.
"The other thing that's helped our business was the movie 'Dances With Wolves,' " said Ted Hustead, the founder, whose pharmacy, once a small emporium, now stretches three-quarters-of-a-block and employs 235 people. "I think we have sold more Western books, jewelry and art this yearthan in the history of the store."
But even high attendance figures sometimes mask apparent weaknesses in the economy. For example, while visits to Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona were up 7 percent in June, the latest month for which figures were available, compared with June 1990, many visitors might have gone elsewhere if the economy had been more robust.
"We find a lot of people from Southern California coming up here rather than going to long and exotic destinations," said Jane Gillespie, sales director of Grand Canyon National Park Lodges. "And our numbers of visitors from Arizona are down, because employment in the state is down, so not as many people are traveling."
Similarly, officials of the Six Flags Corporation, of Arlington, Tex., say attendance is up at its seven theme parks, including Great Adventure in New Jersey. "Theme parks tend to rebound in recessionary periods," said Abby Wieland, manager of marketing service for Six Flags, "because it's an option that families will choose rather than a two-week vacation."
 
 
 
A FAMILY TRIP? $209.10 A DAY
How much does it cost to travel by car?
 The answer depends on how luxuriousthe accommodations on the car trip and how distant the destination.
 But the American Automobile Association suggests that a family of four, including two adults and two children, budget $180 for each day for lodging and meals, plus $9.70 per 100 miles for gasoline, oil, tires and maintenance, with the car averaging 21 miles per gallon.
 Typically, the cost of gasoline for a family, which can travel comfortably about 300 miles a day by car, would be $29.10, for a total travel bill averaging $209.10 per day, the association says.
 This estimate, up from $198.20 a year ago, includes lodging costing $84 a night, based on rates of approved accommodations lsts in the association's TourBooks.
 It suggests figuring on $96 a day for meals, not including tips and cocktails.
 Also not included are road and bridge tolls, admission fees, amusements, recreation and shopping.

HEADLINE: Bush Announces Proposal for Wetlands

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
President Bush today announced a new proposal for managing the nation's wetlands and set off an immediate debate between the Administration and environmentalists who criticized it.
The first outlines of the program were disclosed last week, when the White House made public its new definition of a wetland, saying it would mean millions of acres of such ground would be opened to development while the most sensitive areas would still be protected. 
 In a statement issued today in Kennebunkport, Me., where Mr. Bush is vacationing, the White House said adopting the new policy was vital to "slow and eventually stop the net loss of wetlands," thus fulfilling promises Mr. Bush made in the 1988 campaign.
 
'An Important Role'
 "The plan seeks to balance two important objectives: the protection, restoration and creation of wetlands and the need for sustained economic growth and development," President Bush said in the statement.
"Wetlands serve an important role in flood control," he said. "They help filter waste from water. They provide an important habitat and breeding ground for fish, birds and animals and they are an important recreational resource."
But national environmental groups said Mr. Bush had sided with development interests, and they accused him of abandoning the pledge he made in the 1988 campaign that there would be "no net loss" of protected lands. They said the new policy was a reversal that would put huge expanses of marshes, low-lying forest and other sensitive land at risk of development.
 
Environmentalists Critical
 The Environmental Defense Fund, a national environmental group based in New York, estimated today that 33 million acres, a third of the total wetlands across the country, would lose protection under the policy.
Jay D. Hair, a biologist and president of the National Wildlife Federation, said in a statement issued by the group's Washington headquarters, "The Administration's new wetlands policy represents a death sentence for millions of acres of this critical American resource."
But Dean Kleckner, the president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, the nation's largest farm group, praised the Administration's new policy as a "common sense" step toward giving farmers relief from of regulations they disliked.
It may not be known for 18 months which side is correct.
By that time, it will be known through a procedure of hearings, public comment and regulatory review by several agencies exactly how much land will be put under permanent protection.
The proposals will be published for public comment and must be submitted to Congressional review.
The policy would establish new criteria for reviewing the value of wetlands as a natural resource, establishing three categories. Those lands deemed as having the highest value would be given the most protection, while the least valuable would be opened to development. The extent to which the middle category would be protected is undecided.
But the exact acerage in each of these categories as well as the strictness of the rules for their use will not be known until the process is complete in late 1993.
The program proposed by the President is intended to clarify what is covered by the Federal Clean Water Act of 1972.
Under the act any effort to fill in, build on or alter the landscape of a wetland is prohibited without a permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers. It also requires the Government to establish the policies for managing wetlands.
Mr. Bush's program promises quicker Government decisions for companies seeking to develop wetlands, more money for their purchase by the Government and a proposal to amend the Clean Water Act to prohibit the draining or dredging of wetlands. The aim of the amendment would be to protect thousands of acres in Louisiana that are now being drained or dredged by the oil and gas industry.
The current system of protecting wetlands raised a wave of protest from industrial companies, farmers, home builders, and developers when it was put into effect in January 1989 as the Government's first attempt to clarify wetlands policy.
The old policy, developed by scientists and technical experts from the Agriculture and Interior Departments, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Corps of Engineers, established a definition for wetlands so broad that 100 million acres came under protection overnight, double the amount that the Government had previously considered wetlands.
The 1989 program was based on a definition that said a wetland was any ground that had mucky or peat-based soils, were havens to specific plants and had water within 18 inches of the sruface for at least seven days during the growing season.
Under the program, much of Vermont and Maryland suddenly was regarded by the Government as wetlands. Farmers were prevented from plowing river bottom lands their fathers and grandfathers had cultivated, and home builders filling in apparently dry ground were prosecuted after the Government deemed the land a wetland.
The National Wildlife Federation and other important environmental organizations supported the 1989 policy, saying it was the first time the Government had recognized the importance of preserving lands that serve to protect areas from floods, filter pollutants and act as homes for wildlife and fish.
The policy announced today is based on a new definition that identifies a wetland as having saturated surface soil for 21 consecutive days in the growing season or standing water on it for 15 consecutive days of the year.
 
Increase in Acreage Seen
 In an interview today, Michael R. Deland, the chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said the President's proposals were meant to preserve Mr. Bush's campaign pledge by protecting lands "that have traditional characteristics of wetlands."
"When someone in the environmental community says the Administration is rolling back, it is important to recognize that a greater number of acres will be characterized as wetlands than were protected before 1989," he said.
Mr. Deland said few Presidents had done more to safeguard wetlands than had Mr. Bush.
Federal spending for research, enforcement and purchases of wetlands has grown to $480 million this fiscal year from $295 million in fiscal 1989, and the Administration has asked for $710 million in fiscal 1992, the White House said. Over the last three fiscal years, the Interior Department has purchased 332,000 acres of wetlands, according to Government figures.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Gains for Black Middle Class

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
More black Americans than ever moved into the upper middle class in the 1980's, but one-third remained locked in deprivation, a private demographic study says.
And despite a doubling of the proportion of affluent blacks -- those with family incomes of $50,000 or more -- blacks remain the most isolated minority in the United States, according to the report, issued Thursday by the Population Reference Bureau, a nonprofit educational group that studies population trends. 
 The report was prepared by demographic researchers using Federal statistical data and material from academic sources.
"Evidence points to two African-American communities: one of middle-class and affluent blacks who took advantage of the increased opportunities provided by the civil rights movement, the other of poor, largely urban blacks who remain socially and economically isolated from the American mainstream," said Taynia L. Mann, an author of the report.
The increase in the number of affluent black families since the late 1960's was one of the few positive trends noted in the report.
It said that in 1989, one in seven black families had an income of $50,000 or more. That compared with only one of 17 black families who had similar incomes, adjusted for inflation, in 1967.
The number of affluent black families doubled in the 1980's, and virtually quadrupled since 1967, the report said. The number was 266,000 in 1967, and more than a million in 1989, it said.
The report said one in three white families was affluent by that same measure in 1989, up from one in six families in 1967.

HEADLINE: About Hannibal's Color, No One Really Knows;
The Mahdi and Gordon

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Contrary to Prof. Sidney Halpern (letter, July 20), Mohammed Ahmad, the Sudanese Mahdi (died 1885), was not "primarily involved" in perpetuating and profiting from the East African slave trade. The Mahdi's mission, as he explained in his voluminous letters and proclamations, was to create a worldwide Islamic dominion before the Last Day. To that end, he displayed astute political judgment, as well as a genuine concern for the well-being and unity of his followers, many of them non-Arab Sudanese. The Mahdi's mission began and ended with the liberation of the Sudan from 60 years of Turkish-Egyptian rule. Sudanese slavery did not grow appreciably in his time. 
 Gen. Charles Gordon had indeed attempted to suppress the slave trade while governor of Equatorial Province (1874-76) and governor-general of the Sudan (1877-80). However, en route to Khartoum for the last time in 1884, he revoked his earlier abolition of slavery to appease the Sudanese, who were going over to the Mahdi.
While, as Mr. Halpern states, the British Empire was not "universally execrable," that hardly justifies Britain's (and Europe's) disruption of African society, economy and polity on behalf of Western interests. Into the 20th century, slavery was quietly permitted in Africa by colonial regimes concerned primarily with "stabilizing" the continent and exploiting its resources.

HEADLINE: Really Doing Something About That Damp or Wet Basement

BYLINE: By JOHN WARDE

 BODY:
Chronically damp or wet basements are a common problem. According to statistics published by the American Society of Home Inspectors, a nonprofit professional association, about 60 percent of the houses in the United States have moisture problems.
 There is no foolproof cure, but homeowners who learn the causes and the remedies can probably have repairs made that are both effective and economical.
 The chief causes of basement wetness are flowing water, hydrostatic pressure and condensation. Moisture enters the basement from outdoors. Flowing ground water enters through cracks or other openings in the foundation; moisture in saturated solid masonry (as well as through cracks and other openings) because of the natural pressure the soil exerts against the foundation. Or moisture forms when warm indoor air comes into contact with cooler basement walls.
 
 
 
Prepare, Then Repair
 If you have been living with a wet or damp basement, you are probably familiar with the simple remedies. For preventing moisture entering from outdoors, the remedies include patching cracks and sealing openings, making sure to take care of certain details.
 -- Gutters should work properly.
 -- Make sure that splash blocks or underground drain pipes are directing water away from the foundation.
 -- Basement window wells should drain properly be are kept clear, or covered with plastic domes.
 -- Dense foliage, shrubbery and deep flower gardens next to the foundation should be kept to a minimum.
 -- Landscaping around the foundation should be graded to allow surface water to flow away from the building.
 To prevent indoor condensation, dirt floors in a basement or crawl space should be covered with polyethylene sheeting; cold-water pipes, well-pressure tanks and air conditioning ducts should be wrapped with insulation; clothes dryers and bathrooms containing showers should be vented to the outdoors and dehumidifiers should be installed.
 If you have not tried all of these, you should. They often work, especially in combination; and except for grading the ground around the foundation, which generally involves hiring professional landscapers with earth-moving equipment, these measures cost relatively little.
 But what if the simple solutions fail? A wise first step is to have the problem evaluated by a building inspector. These are listed in the yellow pages. Members of the American Society of Home Inspectors, which tests a screens applicants and set criteria for membership, usually charge $100 to $150 for a basement inspection lasting about an hour; included is a written report with suggestions for repairs. (For a free list of society's members in your area, get in touch with the organization at the address in the brief listing that appears with this article.)
 The professionals are likely to recommend redirecting water away from the foundation walls or the walls base, which is called the footing. That also relieves hydrostatic pressure.
 Redirecting water away from foundation walls involves exterior excavation. Depending on the depth of the foundation and factors like the amount of shrubbery that has to be moved, exterior excavation can cost around $15,000 for an average house, said Bob DiCello, the president of the National Association of Waterproofing Contractors another nonprofit association, and Irwin Weinberg, its director.
 Rerouting water away from the footing also can involve exterior excavation, but that can often be done from inside the basement, for about a third of the cost, Mr. Weinberg says.
 Fortunately, procedures involving interior excavation are effective much of the time. In fact, Mr. DiCello said, exterior excavation is generally necessary only if signs of moisture are found higher than two feet from the basement floor.
 When foundation walls are involved, the task after excavation is lining their outer surface with either cement mortar or asphalt-saturated felt, both of which are then covered with hot coal tar, (these are the traditional methods of basement water-proofing) or attaching a combination of innovative drainage fabrics called geotextiles, and panels called geo-composites. Some manufacturers of these products appear in the accompanying listing.
 
 
 
Effect of Drainage Fabrics
 The traditional method is to try to seal the foundation masonry, something that is not always possible. The drainage fabrics and panels prevent water from reaching the foundation, and are often a more effective solution. They also relieve hydrostatic pressure by providing a cushion or an actual air space between the foundation and the surrounding soil, and some products insulate the foundations which greatly reduces condensation and lowers heating bills.
 Both methods rely on footing drains -- perforated ceramic, fiber or plastic pipe or plastic channels, embedded in gravel around the footing. The drains remove water that is sinking through the soil from above and running down the foundation walls of drainage material. They also relieve hydrostatic pressure coming from below, which can force moisture through the seams where the foundation walls, footing and basement floor join. (This is the most common site of leaks.)
 If footing drains alone are necessary, they can be installed from inside the building by breaking through the perimeter of the basement floor with a jackhammer. The reason the cost is less than that of exterior excavation is that less digging is involved. Footing drains installed by exterior excavation generally are connected to storm drains. Those installed by interior excavation are usually connected to pump.
 After getting an inspector's evaluation, get bids from at least three basement waterproofing contractors. These, too, are listed in the yellow pages; or contact the National Association of Waterproofing Contractors for a free list of members in your area.

 BODY:
AFTER GEN. H. NORMAN SCHWARZKOPF stormed home in April, he began doing public appearances at a rate that made people worry. Was the hero of Iraq barreling down the overexposure trail blazed by Mary Lou Retton? Would he sell out to the highest bidders and give his gruff nod of approval to Jell-O Pudding Pops and Sneaker Tamers? Commentators grumbled that it was wrong for a fighting man of historic stature to be seen posing with Mickey Mouse (at Tampa's Red, White and Blue Troop celebration) or lining up with the Ziegfeld girls from Broadway's "Will Rogers Follies" (at New York's Operation Welcome Home parade). "Doonesbury" pictured him on "The Tonight Show," itemizing a schlocky schedule that included appearances on "Hollywood Squares" and "the Miss Hooters Contest in Tampa."
But there's a crucial difference between palling around with Mickey -- for free, and to the squealing delight of the troops and their kids -- and signing up to tape an "I'm Going to Disney World!" television advertisement. Do the first and you're a good guy. Do the second and you may be reviled as a greedhead. Schwarzkopf's handlers (his literary agent, Marvin Josephson, and his speaking agent, Bernie Swain, a partner in the Washington Speakers Bureau) know that the nation would shrink back in horror if Schwarzkopf comes off as an opportunist. Which may be why, after Aug. 31, when the general retires from active duty, we'll be getting a quieter, less visible Schwarzkopf, content to stick, for the time being, with the lucrative-yet-classy life of big-ticket writing and speaking. 
 If he wanted to, of course, he could cash in grotesquely. Experts in advertising and marketing agree that Schwarzkopf is the biggest thing to come along in years. "This guy is unique," says George Lois, a senior partner in the New York advertising firm of Lois/GGK. "He's a winner, a man's man, America pumped up, everything this country has prayed for. If he wanted to, he could make a trillion bucks."
But Schwarzkopf's Big is an unfamiliar Big, fraught with hazards. There's no one to compare him with, so no one knows what he could get away with. "Guys are trying to figure that out," says Lois, "and they're gulping all the way."
"If I were advising him," says Don R. Epstein, president of a New York speakers' bureau that represents Tom Wolfe and G. Gordon Liddy, "I'd say to consider relationships only with the world's most conservative corporations -- the Xeroxes, the I.B.M.'s. Not hawking the product, but hawking the good will of the company." Wouldn't smooth corporate spokesmanship squander his personality? I ask Epstein. "Not necessarily. You could use him so his personality comes out. Like in a humorous TV commercial where he says, 'Boy, if instead of having to send my messages on motorcycles, I'd had faxing via Xerox -- whango!' "
Schwarzkopf's first civilian assignment is to crank out his autobiography (sold to Bantam Books in June for a reported sum of more than $5 million) A.S.A.P., before the fickle American people forget why they idolize him. In the meantime, he will deliver a carefully regulated number of speeches, mostly to business groups. His fee is top-secret (rumor puts the minimum at $50,000 per speech). Venues and dates are secret, too, and a conversation with Josephson or Swain on these subjects proceeds with the chatty ease of a film-noir police interrogation.
"I won't talk about fees, and I won't talk about specific engagements," Swain says curtly. He'll only reveal that the general will talk to three or four groups a month, tops, on "topics like applying the lessons of the war -- the fabric of America, the can-do attitude -- to other aspects of American life, social or economic." Josephson insists that the general has no interest in endorsements.
So for now, the only way to be near Schwarzkopf is to nip at his fatigue hems, and all the endorsement action is in the iffy world of vicarious association. America West airlines has been boldest here, launching a $20 million campaign with Jonathan Winters impersonating Schwarzkopf. Others are feasting on smaller crumbs. Last spring, for example, Schwarzkopf told People magazine that steak, shrimp and salad are among his favorite foods. The seismic wave from that remark is still rippling through the PR world. Gallagher's, a New York steakhouse, contacted Schwarzkopf's wife, Brenda, and learned that the general's favorite steak is a Roquefort-stuffed filet mignon. It quickly slapped a "H. Norman Schwarzkopf Filet" on the menu and claimed increased filet mignon orders of 3,000 percent. Frenex Distributors, a subsidiary of France's largest Roquefort producer, presented Gallagher's with a tiny guillotine (the traditional Roquefort cutter) engraved with Schwarzkopf's name. The next step, says a Frenex spokesman, is to take "Schwarzkopf's Secret Weapon" to France.
When I called shrimp and salad trade associations, they weren't aware of Schwarzkopf's tastes, but in the background I heard the unmistakable whoop of deck sirens. A spokesman for the Texas Shrimp Association said she would commission a "Shrimp Schwarzkopf" recipe for Shrimp Tales, a bimonthly newsletter. Harry Seifert, vice president of the Atlanta-based Salad Manufacturers Association, said, with martial crispness: "Now that you've mentioned it, yes, certainly we'll exploit it. We'll invite him to visit our convention, at the luxurious Fontainebleau hotel in Miami. It just makes an awful lot of sense to me that if he eats a lot of salads he's able to do the things he can do."
Prior to last spring's welcome-home events, E. J. Brach Corporation, the Chicago candy giant, came to the aid of a group of Plant City, Fla., seventh graders who were building a 5.5-foot-by-8-foot American flag for Schwarzkopf -- out of jellybeans glued to a plywood backing. Brach donated 60,000 jellybeans, including a custom-designed "navy blue" bean developed by Brach's pigment scientists. Schwarzkopf's reaction, incidentally, foreshadowed his current M.O. and exposed a weakness his handlers may not have considered. Despite repeated invitations, he never went to see the flag, leaving the youngsters sobbing in their gluepots. And yet the same week this story was reported in The Tampa Tribune he did find time to speak to 900 lawyers from the Hillsborough County Bar Association, which gave him the Liberty Bell Award, "the association's highest award for nonlawyers." The general should remember: racking up trophies and glorious honors is O.K. But there is such a thing as turning one's back on the little people.

BEST NIGHTMARE ON EARTH
 A Life in Haiti.
 By Herbert Gold.
 Introduction by Jan Morris.
 303 pp. New York:
 Prentice Hall Press. $19.95.  
 Driving south in Haiti one day in the spring of 1986, I passed a great 18-wheeled tractor-trailer speeding north, heard a volley of automatic weapons fire, and, craning my neck to look back, witnessed an absurd and amazing tableau: three tap-taps -- the brightly colored little pickup trucks that are Haitians' main means of transport -- were careering along at the truck's rear, their snouts glued to its bumper, and on their red-painted hoods five skinny and ragged men were crouching, rocking and teetering like contestants in a log-rolling contest as they looted the trailer of its sacks of flour and condensed milk, all the while bobbing and weaving to avoid the trailer's big metal doors flapping and crashing in the wind and the gunfire raining down on them from the truck cab far ahead, where a khaki-uniformed army guard, his face contorted with anger, clung to the cab door with one hand and fired his rifle wildly with the other.
Haiti, as I learned that day, is a land of amazements. As he tells us in "Best Nightmare on Earth: A Life in Haiti," Herbert Gold was fated to learn the same lesson some three decades before, when he met in Paris "the teasing, laughing, flirting, Haitian bride of a black American friend" who informed him that she had grown up a stone's throw from the National Palace. "Haiti," asked Mr. Gold, already hooked, "has a National Palace?" Indeed, it has had several: the enormous tridomed neoclassical structure that, all gleaming white pillars and porticoes, floats in the swelter of today's Port-au-Prince like a ghostly mirage, and all of its various ghostly predecessors -- including the one that, one boiling August night in 1912, suddenly consumed itself in an enormous fireball, dragging the president and several hundred of his soldiers down to hell along with it.
The successor of that unfortunate gentleman endured barely nine months before expiring in his turn, apparently the victim of poison, and his funeral collapsed into chaos when two generals began shelling the cathedral: they were fighting over the succession. It was not the first time; for Haiti possesses not only a palace but also a vast and teeming history stretching back to its glorious independence from France, in 1804, when a half-million illiterate blacks defeated Napoleon's crack troops in what would be the only successful slave revolt ever recorded. Since then, while its Caribbean neighbors remained wards of colonial powers, a succession of home-grown dictators and tyrants has ruled the land, including one king, two emperors, and nine presidents for life. They gained the palace by insurrection, revolution, coup d'etat, and left it the same way: two were assassinated, one executed, one committed suicide (King Henry: he used a silver bullet) and 20 odd were violently overthrown. All the while, independent Haiti, which under France had been the wealthiest colony in the world, underwent a slow, inexorable economic decline, sinking into the swamp of incessant political turmoil to become the poorest country in the hemisphere and one of the poorest on earth.
A young writer named Herbert Gold stumbled onto this unlikely panorama during the early 1950's, when he sailed into Port-au-Prince on a white Panama Lines ship. Broke after finishing his first novel, with a wife and two young daughters to support, he had remembered the laughing, flirting girl in Paris and gone to his hometown library in Cleveland, where he uncovered an available fellowship at the University of Haiti. He planned to lecture on American literature, stay a year and a half, have adventures; in the event, his lectures were canceled after the first one -- he had made the mistake of declining, honestly but impolitically, to place Haiti's premier novelist on a level with Tolstoy, igniting a diplomatic incident -- and he spent not the anticipated 18 months but "a part of every next day and night of my life." He became, that is one of the "fraternity of Haiti fanatics," a diverse lot whose numbers wax and wane according to the political weather, and whose unofficial headquarters was then and remains today the Grand Hotel Oloffson, a great gingerbread palace on a hill that had served early in the century as the summer residence of a short-lived Haitian president (a man who distinguished the office mainly by his manner of leaving it: in pieces, torn limb from limb by his infuriated constituents) and later as a hospital for the United States Marines, when they occupied the country from 1915 to 1934. Visitors find themselves becoming Haiti fanatics for many reasons: they are drawn to the sad beauty of the mountainous, ravaged country; or they are entranced by the creativity, comeliness and extraordinary bearing of its people (who often seem, by their very gait, to express their proud knowledge of Haiti's long-past national glory); or finally they are mesmerized by the unfolding political history itself, which, depicted as the endless struggle for freedom of a beautiful people doomed by despotism and corruption and tyranny, has all the fascination and improbability of grand operatic tragedy. Mr. Gold could not have chosen a better time to join the ranks of Haiti fanatics. In the early 1950's, the country's coffers were relatively full from wartime exports, and the ruler was the "laughing, drinking, womanizing President Paul E. Magloire." A staunch anti-Communist, Magloire was popular in Washington -- Time magazine "depicted him as a Haitian Eisenhower" and put him on its cover -- and though, as Mr. Gold puts it, he "occasionally killed opponents and certainly didn't confuse himself with concepts of free speech or honest government," his rule is remembered by many Haitians with some fondness, for not only did he murder few (particularly when set beside the man who succeeded him), but the relatively prosperous economic times during his first years in power helped sustain a burst of creativity in the arts, especially in painting, that began during the late 1940's and came to be known as the Haitian Renaissance.
Haiti, notes Mr. Gold, "is poor in all natural resources but the energies of imagination," but it took a political movement, begun under the black nationalist president whom General Magloire had overthrown, to set free those energies by healing the wound that from the beginning had cut through Haitian culture, dividing the highly sophisticated, predominantly mulatto elite that spoke French, attended Mass and followed Parisian fashion, from the illiterate peasants who knew only Creole, practiced voodoo and lived their daily lives as their ancestors had done in West Africa four centuries before. Mr. Gold came to know many of the most important figures of the Renaissance, including the poet Felix Morisseau-Leroy and the painters Enguerrand Gourgue and Andre Pierre. Mr. Pierre, a voodoo priest, had begun his career by decorating his own temple outside the capital. He can still be found there, working his canvases and swigging clairin, the harsh Haitian rum.
Even more than the painters and writers, however, it is the sensual discovery of Haiti, the surrender to its colors and rhythms and smells, that dominates the early chapters of "Best Nightmare on Earth." Mr. Gold writes like the novelist he is, roughing in scenes and characters with a few economical strokes: Port-au-Prince from the bay is "a low jumble of thick-walled colonial buildings and corrugated tin sheds nearby, and the smoking slum of La Saline, then the irregular slopes with spots of gardens, cloud-shrouded mountains rising into the distance above the town"; the old neighborhoods climbing the lower slopes are lined with "gingerbread dream houses which seemed to be made of spun wood"; the drums that "rocked and rolled us to sleep [are] as soothing as low thunder, and no more ominous."
After great effort, Mr. Gold persuades a voodoo priest to reveal for him a portrait of the great snake god, Damballa Ouedo, which no unbeliever may see, and is at last rewarded with a glimpse of a "photograph . . . dog-eared, frazzled, and woebegone, of Harold Stassen." He spends his afternoons taking coffee and chatting with a "Circle of Philosophers" headquartered in Kenscoff, a mountain village high above the capital, the Haitian Switzerland, then gets lost in the maze of streets near his house. "I would stop and ask for the street by name. No one knew it. Then I asked where the new white man lived, and was led home immediately by people who had never seen me before."
The evenings are spent drinking and dancing, and not infrequently he and his friends cross paths with fun-loving stalwarts of the regime -- from the General President himself, whom he spots in a nightclub surrounded by bodyguards, with his personal bottle holder stationed behind his chair, to powerful underlings like Col. Marcaisse Prosper, the chief of police who bore a diamond question mark on his tie and who was well known for his effeminate manners, his lavish mansion (worth millions and built on a $350-a-month salary) and his eager brutality.
The sexual commerce between Haitians and white visitors is also a theme of Mr. Gold's book, from the American expatriate fashion photographer who acquired the habit of marrying lovely Haitian girls when they were 11 or so and divorcing them when they grew too old (about 14), to the homosexual pimp with his salon full of pet monkeys and young Haitian boys in tight jeans, to the American ladies Mr. Gold dubs "the minglers" for their habit of circulating evenings in the Oloffson, casting a covetous eye on the attractive Haitian officers who line up at the bar in their dress uniforms like fruit ripe for the picking.
At home, Mr. Gold's houseboy becomes possessed by Ougoun Feraille, the voodoo god of war, and manages to recover only after a visit to his neglected mother and an offering of rum and cake at the local temple. Following a game of tennis, Mr. Gold's partner, a millionaire representative of American companies in Haiti, discovers on the front seat of his Buick a chicken, plucked and painted blue: a serious curse. The man collapses to the ground, his mouth foaming in rage. "You don't believe in black magic," Mr. Gold says to him, once the man has recovered. His friend shrugs. "Of course I don't. But it's bad for business if people know I've been cursed."
To believe isn't the point; the spirits of voodoo, a complicated and beautiful religion long trivialized abroad as malign mischief with pins and little dolls, inhabit the Haitian hills, dominate the Haitian consciousness from infancy. Mr. Gold writes: "The Haitian parent still warns his family against the werewolves that cruise at dusk in automobiles without license plates, leaping out to gobble up the souls of unlucky children. Kids at a birthday party automatically choose the piece of cake farthest away on the plate -- why be turned into a zombie? A woman of the elite makes fun of the baka, the loupgarou, those imps, werewolves, and malevolent spirits of the dead, and the tricky voodoo loa, gods; she was educated in Paris and had an automatic dishwasher in her kitchen; but one evening, this lovely and witty person told me she saw with her own eyes a peasant woman kneeling and praying in a field, carrying a plate in her joined hands. A star shook itself loose and fell into the plate."
Mr. Gold's two small daughters, he discovers one day, have secretly learned to speak Creole (a rich amalgam of various African dialects, French and a sprinkling of English); their servants and their neighborhood friends instinctively address them in "the natural language of children." One day, the mother of one of their favorite little friends comes calling:
" 'You like our daughter?'
" 'Very much.' She was a lovable little girl, her hair done in braids with an assortment of ribbons.
" 'Please take her with you when you go. Give her a chance.'
"We explained that this was not possible, we could not separate her from her family, it was inconceivable to us.
" 'I love my daughter very much. I am willing to let her go home with you. I give my permission.'
" 'Please,' we said. 'It's impossible.'
" 'She will learn to clean your house. She is a good girl. If she does her work well, you could also send her to school.'
" 'Please.'
"Our neighbor gazed at us with grief. . . . Puzzled, just wanting information, she asked: 'You are racists, Monsieur et Madame?' "
Mr. Gold would have much to learn about the exigencies of race in Haiti. Ever present yet rarely discussed before strangers, the racial stratification of the society is at once the poisoned legacy of the French and a creation deeply, uniquely Haitian. An acquaintance of Mr. Gold denounces the American's new-found tennis partner, who happens to be blue-black in color, maintaining that the man owes his wealth and influence solely to his light skin. A young mulatto woman, daughter of a president, remarks during a sailing party that there are no "Negroes" in her family, asserting that she descends "from an infinite series of mulattoes."
Color in Haiti is not only skin; it is also "good hair," the right nose, the various facial characteristics that mark their bearer as a sacatra, a marabou, a grimaud, a sang-mele, or any one of the dozens of other racial categories worked out in colonial days. One constant, though, is the urge of an ambitious black to "put a little milk in his coffee," and an influential black man in particular is in a position to trade his power and position for a lightening of the family bloodline through marriage.
A mulatto -- the word describes a person who is endowed not only with a particular skin color but a certain place in the class hierarchy -- will be raised by black servants, will very likely have his first sexual experience with a black housemaid, will patronize black prostitutes during his early manhood; but it is very bad form at best, and disgusting at worst, for a highly placed mulatto to marry a black (and for a wealthy mulatto woman to do so, unless the groom is powerful indeed -- a minister or president -- is thought to be particularly offensive).
In a multitude of ways, the politics of race has propelled Haitian history; it certainly was a key to the rise of General Magloire's successor, Dr. Francois Duvalier, a self-professed "country doctor" and amateur ethnographer (specializing in voodoo) who was elected over his aristocratic mulatto businessman opponent in 1957, after almost a year of political chaos. (General Magloire, brought down by a general strike after several farcical attempts to cling to the palace, departed for three decades of exile in New York, having taken care to squirrel away, in the fashion of prudent Haitian rulers, $10 million or so of government funds in his offshore accounts.)
The Duvalier years, though much written about, still have their horrors to reveal, and Mr. Gold tries to do them justice. "Impossible to darken that night," as Graham Greene wrote in "The Comedians." Dr. Duvalier, an unsentimental black nationalist (with the inevitable mulatto wife), seemed benign enough: a doddering, mumbling little fellow, owlish behind his thick black spectacles, who favored black suits and black homburg hats and cryptic pronouncements about the country's true African character that few Haitians could decipher and fewer still comprehend.
Soon after being elected, however, (with the help of powerful army officers, who thought they had found a malleable puppet), Duvalier built up a personal militia called the Tontons Macoute; its foot soldiers were illiterate blacks from the slums -- ruthless, merciless and loyal only to Papa Doc. Clothed in ragged denim, red neckerchiefs (for the war spirit, Ougoun) and the inevitable black glasses, the Macoutes rooted out the doctor's opponents, or suspected opponents, with a thoroughness and brutality unmatched in the country's history. Whole families were massacred, babies burned in their cribs, mothers, fathers, daughters and sons carried off to the torture chambers to be mutilated, starved and shot. Eventually perhaps 40,000 perished and a million or more fled the country; New York, Paris, Montreal filled with Haitians until there were many more Haitian doctors abroad than at home.
In Haiti the Macoutes assumed these vacated places, spreading and expanding until there were Macoute bureaucrats, Macoute university teachers, even Macoute priests. In 1963 the United States briefly suspended relations and then withdrew its aid; embassies, crowded with terrified Haitians seeking asylum, scaled down to skeleton staffs; the economy collapsed, with money enough only to fill a few pockets at the top. Duvalier's "revolution" amounted to a brutal effort to expand the ranks of those who had always plundered the country; the plundering continued, with a few middle-class blacks invited to join the predators. At night the frequent power outages left the city eerie and dark; anyone foolish enough to venture out would, at the least, be shaken down by the prowling Macoutes (who, officially dubbed "national security volunteers," depended on extortion and robbery to earn a living), and at worst disappear forever into the night. Papa Doc, secretive and all-powerful, his fingers on the country's every filament like a spider at the center of his web, rarely left the palace; for many Haitians, the black-garbed little man had come to represent Baron Samedi, the lord of the graveyard.
Mr. Gold returned in 1963 and found that his beloved Haiti had become "a laboratory in the business of manufacturing paranoia." After a "clot of macoutes" roughs him up at one of their inevitable roadblocks, the sinister mayor of the capital tells him he has only Graham Greene, that "enemy of the nation," to blame for the Macoutes' enmity. "Perhaps . . . they don't like . . . writers whose names are colors . . . Greene . . . Gold. . . ." One of his friends has been made to drink the urine of his Macoute torturer and to lick his own blood from the floor ; another has had excrement smeared across his face. This friend, an electrical engineer, notes that Papa Doc "has performed an economic miracle for Haiti. Taught us to live without money, eat without food. . . . Taught us to live without life."
One night the palace is flooded with light: President Kennedy, Duvalier's archenemy, has been murdered in Dallas, and the doctor, who has long been fighting Kennedy by means of a ouanga, or voodoo charm, is claiming credit. (Mr. Gold, in the most painful of several historical slips, says Kennedy died on the anniversary of the great voodoo ceremony that set off Haiti's War of Independence, which in fact came in August -- an error, to Haitian ears, comparable to saying Americans set off their independence fireworks on the Fourth of October.)
Duvalier remained in power for 14 years until, having survived at least eight attempts to overthrow him, he died of a heart attack -- but not before he had left his country a little gift: his enormously fat, famously stupid 19-year-old son Jean-Claude, installed as President for Life. It is Papa Doc's final joke. Mr. Gold returns in 1973 -- like Greene, he had been banned during the doctor's later years for his criticism of the regime -- to find new money flowing into the country, most of it from the United States and other foreign lenders.
Jean-Claude, his father having made the "political revolution," is determined to preside over the economic one. American companies arrive to take advantage of the dirt-cheap Haitian labor force, making Haiti, among other things, the world's largest manufacturer of baseballs (though the game is unknown there).
A new younger generation of technocrats, this time preferring cocaine to champagne, raises its villas in the mountains above Port-au-Prince; Mr. Gold calls them the "Bon Ton Macoutes" (punning on the French expression for "good form" or "chic"). Haitians continue to starve, though now they run less risk of being murdered in the street. Mr. Gold can stroll through his beloved Port-au-Prince at night again, can run in the mountains above Kenscoff, can bring his daughter from a second marriage to see the gingerbread palaces where her stepsisters spent a dream year of their childhood.
Jean-Claude, familiarly known as "Basket head" for his vast and vacuous countenance and benefiting from the fear his father had attached to the family name, managed to hold power for 15 years. In 1985, six years after Jean-Claude married Michele Bennett, a nouveau-riche mulatto whose avarice and haughtiness quickly made her much more widely detested than the dictator himself, rioting began; finally, the United States withdrew its support, and the young President for Life flew off to an opulent exile in the south of France. Five years of intermittent chaos and hope have followed, during which five governments have held power. (It was under the first of these, when the Macoutes had withdrawn into hiding and the army was struggling to gain control, that I saw my highway robbery; the Macoutes soon returned.)
Mr. Gold, visiting in 1988 and 1990, writes about two of these "ephemeral presidents" (as the Haitians have learned to call their more fleeting heads of state): a plump political science professor brought to power by the army in a largely boycotted, fraud-ridden election -- and unceremoniously overthrown four months later -- and a clever American-trained general who had grown wealthy managing Jean-Claude's finances. He witnesses a man being burned as a werewolf, talks with a congenial big-bellied voodoo priest and former Macoute who is a firm believer in family planning and is handing that lesson down to his 54 sons (all of them were planned).
But in these later chapters the book begins to turn a bit sad. Mr. Gold dutifully describes what he sees, the blatantly faked election -- he, the white writer, is invited to vote, as often as he likes -- and the absurd celebrations staged to greet the clever general on his return from his one foreign venture, a trip to Taiwan to beg for foreign aid. But Mr. Gold's mind is increasingly in the past. "The ghosts of old friends haunted the Oloffson," he says. Some have left; most are dead. Haiti has long since frightened away even the most intrepid tourists. Mr. Gold has begun to look less at the present than at the Haiti he knew 30 odd years before. "I bring my children to Haiti," he writes, "because I need their help in the enterprise of remembering."
It is right that the book jacket features two pictures of the author, one of the handsome young man and budding novelist who arrived in Port-au-Prince during the early 1950's, and another of the "American graybeard" and well-known writer who looked sadly at the Haiti of the late 80's; for his memoir finally becomes an attempt to recover -- 30 years after he first sailed into Port-au-Prince -- what he fears has become a lost Haiti and, with it, his own lost youth .
He probably shouldn't worry: since "Best Nightmare on Earth: A Life in Haiti" was completed, yet another president has entered the palace, this time by means of a real election. Jean-Bertrand Aristide is a fascinating and extraordinary young priest, a populist and proponent of liberation theology who, whatever his failings, commands undeniable support, at least among the desperately poor people who still account for 9 Haitians in 10. He has accomplished no revolution. Haitians still starve, children with the swollen bellies and the pale orange hair of severe malnutrition still beg on the streets; but at least one can now venture out at night without fear of assault or arrest. And the annual Mardi Gras Mr. Gold so prizes has recovered its joy. No one who knows Haiti would deny that things might well get worse before they get better; but until they do, that this President even reached the palace must be taken as a slender sign of hope.
Looking on the Haiti of today, one is tempted to remind Mr. Gold of his own words, describing the darkest days of Papa Doc: "Haiti's jokes, songs and stories, paintings, and laughter could not be extinguished, I believed; they were also a part of my metabolism, and for them to disappear would amount, for me, to a kind of suicide. I had fallen asleep too often to the steadiness of drums resounding over the hills. I loved Haiti as one could also love a woman -- despite the pains she inflicted. That's the truth. I have no excuses." He need have none now; even the American graybeard, had he been present to watch the unlikely young priest stepping through the palace's white portico , would have had no trouble seeing his Haiti. If nothing else, this improbable country still fits the description first supplied by Mr. Gold's oldest Haitian friend, the tall imperious black man in the white linen suit who first greeted the young traveler on the Panama Lines vessel : he called it "the land of unlimited impossibility."
 
 
 
WHERE IT'S HAIR-RAISING AND HOPEFUL
 Despite its vivid descriptions of locale and the customs of the Haitian people, "Best Nightmare on Earth" is more an autobiography, a story of personal discovery, than a travel book, Herbert Gold said in a telephone interview from his home in San Francisco. "Haiti is one of the greatest adventures a traveler can have. People who go there for a few days and think of it as a third-world horror story are missing a great deal."
Although the book is filled with extraordinary episodes, it is devoid of "gee-whiz" descriptions of even the most unbelievable, hair-raising happenings. Mr. Gold said the first voodoo ceremony he attended, which involved an animal sacrifice, was less shocking than he anticipated because of the celebratory atmosphere surrounding the ritual.
Mr. Gold, who is 67, also began discovering his own Jewish heritage there. "I have a rather ambiguous history as a Jew," he said. "I was raised in a totally non-Jewish household, but I discovered a great deal of affiliation between Israel and Haiti -- because Haiti is isolated -- a black nation in a white world, a Caribbean nation in a North and South American hemisphere -- and because, surprisingly, so many Haitians, including some of the elite, are descended from Jews, mostly adventurous traders and emigrants turned away from Ellis Island."
Will he return to Haiti? "I'll always go back. The place is so vividly, uniquely alive and hopeful. I go elsewhere, and I find myself lonely for Haiti." -- STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
FEW STORIES IN HISTORY are more familiar than the one of Christopher Columbus sailing west for the Indies and finding instead the New World. Indelibly imprinted in our memory is the verse from childhood: "In fourteen hundred and ninety-two/Columbus sailed the ocean blue." The names of his ships, the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria, roll fluently from our lips. We know how Columbus, a seaman of humble and obscure origins, pursued a dream that became his obsession. How he found not the riches of Cathay but a sprinkling of small islands inhabited by gentle people. How he called these people Indians, thinking that surely the mainland of Asia lay just over the horizon.
Yet the history of Columbus is frustratingly incomplete. When and how in the mists of his rootless life did he conceive of his audacious plan? He supposedly wanted to sail west across the Ocean Sea to reach Cipangu, the name then for Japan, and the region known generally as the Indies. But was he really seeking the Indies? How are we to navigate the poorly charted waters of ambiguous and conflicting documentation everywhere Columbus went and in everything he did? We are not certain how he was finally able to win royal backing for the enterprise. We know little about his ships and the men who sailed them. We don't know exactly where he made his first landfall. We don't know for sure what he looked like or where he lies buried. We do know he was an inept governor of the Spanish settlements in the Caribbean and had a bloodied hand in the brutalization of the native people and in the start of a slave trade. But we are left wondering if he is to be admired and praised, condemned -- or perhaps pitied as a tragic figure. 
 Walt Whitman imagined Columbus on his deathbed, in the throes of self-doubt, seeming to anticipate the vicissitudes that lay ahead in his passage through history:
 
What do I know of life? what of myself?
I know not even my own
 work past or present;
Dim ever-shifting guesses
 of it spread before me,
Of newer better worlds,
 their mighty parturition,
Mocking, perplexing me.
The man who wrote to his patron, Luis de Santangel, on the voyage back to Europe in 1493, proclaiming discovery and assuring that he would not be forgotten, probably had no such thoughts. He could not foresee posterity's "ever-shifting guesses" concerning his deeds and himself any more than he could assimilate in his inflexible mind what he had done and seen. But it was his fate to be the accidental agent of a transcendental discovery and, as a result, to be tossed into the tempestuous sea of history, drifting half-forgotten at first, then swept by swift currents to a towering crest of honor and legend, only to be caught in recent years in a riptide of conflicting views of his life and of his responsibility for almost everything that has happened since.
 COLUMBUS'S REPUTATION in history has followed a curious course. His obsession, obstinacy and navigational skill carried Europe across the ocean. "The Admiral was the first to open the gates of that ocean which had been closed for so many thousands of years before," wrote Bartolome de las Casas a half century later in a comprehensive account of the voyages, which remains to this day a major source of knowledge about Columbus. "He it was who gave the light by which all others might see how to discover." But he was then anything but the stellar figure in history he was to become. His immediate reputation was diminished by his failures as a colonial administrator and by a protracted lawsuit between the crown and the heirs of Columbus, casting doubt on the singularity of his plan for sailing west to the Indies. (Testimony by some seamen who had sailed with Columbus suggested that one of his captains was actually responsible for much of the idea.) In time, Las Casas forced his contemporaries to question the morality of the brutal treatment of Indians at the hands of Columbus and his successors.
By the early years of the 16th century, Amerigo Vespucci, a more perceptive interpreter of the New World and a more engaging writer, had already robbed Columbus of prominence on the map. His star was also eclipsed by explorers like Cortes and Pizarro, who obtained gold and glory for Spain and had the good fortune to conquer not an assortment of islands but splendid empires like those of the Aztecs of Mexico and Incas of Peru, and by mariners like Vasco da Gama, who actually reached the Indies, and Magellan, whose expedition of circumnavigation was the first to confirm by experience the world's sphericity -- and also left no doubt about the magnitude of Columbus's error in thinking he had reached Asia.
Many books of general history in the first decades of the 16th century either scarcely mentioned Columbus or ignored him altogether. Writers of the time "showed little interest in his personality and career, and some of them could not even get his Christian name right," according to J. H. Elliott, a British historian. Responsibility for the neglect has been attributed in part to Peter Martyr, an Italian cleric in the court at Barcelona, whose correspondence, beginning in the months after Columbus's return, was widely read. It made much of the years of discovery but gave only passing notice to Columbus himself, though acknowledging his fortitude and courage.
With the poverty of available documentation about the man, there were few alternative sources of information. Yet to come were the works of the contemporary observers Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo (who would write an encyclopedic history of the early discoveries), Bartolome de las Casas and Columbus's son Ferdinand, who would write the first definitive biography of Columbus. Nearly all of Columbus's own letters and journals had long since disappeared.
By the middle of the 16th century, Columbus began to emerge from the shadows, reincarnated not so much as a man and historical figure but as a myth and symbol. In 1552, in a ringing assessment that would be repeated time and again, the historian Francisco Lopez de Gomara wrote, "The greatest event since the creation of the world (excluding the incarnation and death of Him who created it) is the discovery of the Indies." Columbus came to epitomize the explorer and discoverer, the man of vision and audacity, the hero who overcame opposition and adversity to change history.
By the end of the 16th century, English explorers and writers acknowledged his primacy and inspiration. "Had they not Columbus to stirre them up," Richard Hakluyt, the historian of exploration, wrote in 1598. He was celebrated in poetry and plays, especially by the Italians. Even Spain was coming around. In 1614, a popular play, "El Nuevo Mundo descubierto por Cristobal Colon," portrayed Columbus as a dreamer up against the stolid forces of entrenched tradition, a man of singular purpose who triumphed, the embodiment of that spirit driving humans to explore and discover.
The association between Columbus and America prospered in the 18th century, as the population became increasingly American-born, with less reason to identify with the "mother country." No one in Boston or New York is recorded to have celebrated Columbus on the bicentennial, in 1692. But within a very short time, the colonists began thinking of themselves as a people distinct from the English. By virtue of their isolation and common experience in a new land, they were becoming Americans, and they looked to define themselves on their own terms and through their own symbols. Samuel Sewall of Boston was one of the first to suggest their land should rightfully be named for Columbus, "the magnanimous heroe . . . who was manifestly appointed of God to be the Finder out of these lands." The Columbus who thought of himself as God's messenger -- "As the Lord told of it through the mouth of Isaiah, He made me the messenger, and he showed me the way," Columbus wrote on his third voyage -- would have been pleased at this turn in his posthumous reputation. But Sewall was also indulging in a practice that would become rampant: enlisting the symbolic Columbus for his own purposes -- in spirited defense of the colonies, which were being described by theologians at Oxford and Cambridge as the Biblical "infernal region," or in plain English, "hell."
By the time of the Revolution, Columbus had been transmuted into a national icon, a hero second only to Washington. The new Republic's celebration of Columbus reached a climax in October 1792, the 300th anniversary of the landfall. By then, King's College in New York had been renamed Columbia and the national capital being planned was given the name the District of Columbia, perhaps to appease those who demanded that the entire country be designated Columbia.
It is not hard to understand the appeal of Columbus as a totem for the former subjects of George III. Columbus had found the way of escape from Old World tyranny. He was the solitary individual who challenged the unknown sea, as triumphant Americans contemplated the dangers and promise of their own wilderness frontier. He had been opposed by kings and (in his mind) betrayed by royal perfidy. But as a consequence of his vision and audacity, there was now a land free from kings, a vast continent for new beginnings.
In Columbus, the new nation found a hero seemingly free of any taint from association with the European colonial powers. The Columbus symbolism gave Americans an instant mythology and a unique place in history, and their adoption of Columbus magnified his own place.
In "The Whig Interpretation of History," Herbert Butterfield, a British historian of this century, properly deplored "the tendency of many historians . . . to produce a story which is the ratification if not the glorification of the present." But historians cannot control the popularizers, the myth makers and propagandists, and in post-Revolutionary America the few who studied Columbus were probably not disposed to try. Even if they had been, there was little information available on which to assess the real Columbus and distinguish the man from the myth.
By the 19th century new materials had emerged -- some of Columbus's own writings and a lengthy abridgment of his lost journal of the first voyage -- that might have been used to assess the real man. Instead, these manuscripts provided more ammunition for those who would embellish the symbolic Columbus. Washington Irving mined the new documents to create a hero in the romantic mold favored in the century's literature. His Columbus was "a man of great and inventive genius" and his "ambition was lofty and noble, inspiring him with high thoughts, and an anxiety to distinguish himself by great achievements."
Perhaps. But an effusive Irving got carried away. Columbus's "conduct was characterized by the grandeur of his views and the magnanimity of his spirit," he wrote. "Instead of ravaging the newly found countries . . . he sought to colonize and cultivate them, to civilize the natives." Columbus may have had some faults, Irving acknowledged, such as his part in enslaving and killing people, but these were "errors of the times."
The historian Daniel J. Boorstin observes that people "once felt themselves made by their heroes" and cites James Russell Lowell: "The idol is the measure of the worshiper." Accordingly, writers and orators of the 19th century ascribed to Columbus all the human virtues that were most prized in that time of geographic and industrial expansion, heady optimism and an unquestioning belief in progress as the dynamic of history.
This image of Columbus accorded with the popular rags-to-riches, log-cabin-to-the-White-House scenario of human advancement. This was the ideal Columbus that schoolchildren learned about in their McGuffey readers. The orator Edward Everett reminded his audience in 1853 that Columbus had once been forced to beg for bread at the convent doors of Spain. "We find encouragement in every page of our country's history," Everett declared. "Nowhere do we meet with examples more numerous and more brilliant of men who have risen above poverty and obscurity. . . . One whole vast continent was added to the geography of the world by the persevering efforts of a humble Genoese mariner, the great Columbus; who, by the steady pursuit of the enlightened conception he had formed of the figure of the earth, before any navigator had acted upon the belief that it was round, discovered the American continent."
With the influx of millions of immigrants after the American Civil War, Columbus assumed a new role, that of ethnic hero. Irish Catholic immigrants organized the Knights of Columbus in New Haven in 1882. The fraternity's literature described Columbus as "a prophet and a seer, an instrument of Divine Providence" and an inspiration to each knight to become "a better Catholic and a better citizen." The knights grew in number and influence, promoting academic studies in American history, lobbying for the Columbus memorial erected in front of Union Station in Washington and seeking the canonization of their hero.
At the same time, French Catholics were mounting a campaign to elevate Columbus to sainthood, on the grounds that he had "brought the Christian faith to half the world." But, despite encouragement from Pope Pius IX, the proponents got nowhere with the Vatican. Columbus's rejection was based largely on his relationship with Beatriz Enriquez de Arana, his mistress and the mother of his son Ferdinand, and the lack of proof that he had performed a miracle, as defined by the church.
The 400th anniversary of Columbus's voyage was marked by a yearlong commemoration throughout the United States. To the beat of brass bands and a chorus of self-congratulation, Americans hailed the man who had crossed uncharted seas as they had now leaped a wide and wild continent. As part of the celebration, Antonin Dvorak composed "From the New World," a symphony evoking the sweep and promise of the beckoning American landscape. President Benjamin Harrison proclaimed, "Columbus stood in his age as the pioneer of progress and enlightenment." In New York, Italian immigrants, who had joined the Irish in search of an identity with the larger American community, raised money for a statue atop a column of Italian marble, placed at the southwest corner of Central Park, which was renamed Columbus Circle.
The grandest of all the celebrations, the World's Columbian Exposition, in Chicago, was billed as "the jubilee of mankind." President Grover Cleveland threw the switch on that new invention, electricity, to set in motion the many machines and architectural marvels by which the United States advertised itself as an emerging giant among the nations. Columbus was now the symbol of American success. The invocation was a prayer of thanksgiving for "that most momentous of all voyages by which Columbus lifted the veil that hid the New World from the Old and opened the gateway of the future of mankind." Clearly, the exposition was more than a commemoration of the past; it was also the exclamation of a future that self-confident Americans were eager to shape and enjoy.
A few historians, seeking the man behind the myth, struck chords of a refreshing counterpoint to the adulatory hymns. Henry Harrisse's diligent examination of all known Columbus materials left scholars no excuse for continuing to treat the man as a demigod, though he, too, rendered a largely favorable judgment. "Columbus removed out of the range of mere speculation the idea that beyond the Atlantic Ocean lands existed and could be reached by sea," he wrote in "Christopher Columbus and the Bank of Saint George." He "made of the notion a fixed fact, and linked forever the two worlds. That event, which is unquestionably the greatest of modern time, secures to Columbus a place in the pantheon dedicated to the worthies whose courageous deeds mankind will always admire."
It was the biographer Justin Winsor, more than any other respected historian of the day, who cast a cold light on the dark side of Columbus's character. He had objected strongly to Columbus's proposed canonization. ("He had nothing of the generous and noble spirit of a conjoint lover of man and of God," he wrote at the time.) In his view, Columbus forfeited any claim to sympathy when he robbed of proper credit the lookout who had cried "Tierra!" and thus took for himself the lifetime pension promised to the first person to see land.
"No child of any age ever did less to improve his contemporaries, and few ever did more to prepare the way for such improvements," Winsor wrote in his 1891 biography. "The age created him and the age left him. There is no more conspicuous example in history of a man showing the path and losing it. . . ." Columbus left his new world "a legacy of devastation and crime. He might have been an unselfish promoter of geographical science; he proved a rabid seeker for gold and a viceroyalty. He might have won converts to the fold of Christ by the kindness of his spirit; he gained the execrations of the good angels. He might, like Las Casas, have rebuked the fiendishness of his contemporaries; he set them an example of perverted belief."
Winsor's withering assault on the Columbus of legend was the exception in the late 19th century, and not taken kindly by those who held to the prevailing image. They had created the Columbus they wanted to believe in, and were quite satisfied with their creation.
But by the early 20th century, historians were beginning to expose contradictions, lacunas and suspected fictions in the familiar story. No one could be sure when and how Columbus arrived at his idea, what his real objective was or what manner of man he was -- an inspired but rational genius, a lucky adventurer clouded by mysticism, a man of the Renaissance or of the Middle Ages. It wasn't until 1942 that Columbus was rescued from mythology and portrayed as what he had been first and foremost: an inspired mariner.
In his biography, "Admiral of the Ocean Sea," Samuel Eliot Morison, drawing on the accumulating documents and his own seafaring expertise, chose to stress the one aspect of Columbus that has been beyond serious dispute. Morison's Columbus was no saint, but he could sail a ship and possessed the will and courage to go where no one had presumably gone before.
 THE WORLD AND America are changing, of course, and Columbus's reputation is changing, too. Modern life has made disbelievers of many who once worshiped at the altar of progress. In the years after World War II, nearly all the colonies of the major empires won their independence and, like the United States in its early days, began to view world history from their own anticolonial perspective. The idol had been the measure of the worshipers, but now there were atheists all around. To them, the Age of Discovery was not the bright dawning of a glorious epoch, but an invasion. Columbus became the avatar of oppression. Another Columbus for another age.
"A funny thing happened on the way to the quincentennial observation of America's 'discovery,' " Garry Wills wrote in The New York Review of Books in 1990. "Columbus got mugged. This time the Indians were waiting for him. He comes now with an apologetic air -- but not, for some, sufficiently apologetic. . . . He comes to be dishonored."
Today, historians are addressing consequences as well as actions -- increasingly approaching the European incursion in America from the standpoint of the native Americans. They speak not of the "discovery" but of the "encounter" or the "contact." Alfred W. Crosby, at the University of Texas at Austin, has examined the biological consequences of Columbus's arrival. While some -- the exchange of plants and animals between continents, the eventual globalization of biology -- were generally beneficial, he found others, like the spread of devastating disease, to be catastrophic.
In public forums, Columbus is tarred as the precursor of exploitation and conquest. Kirkpatrick Sale, in "The Conquest of Paradise," argues that Columbus was a grasping fortune hunter whose legacy was the destruction of the native population and rape of the land that continues to this day.
Descendants of American Indians and the African slaves brought to the New World, as well as those who sympathize with their causes, are understandably reluctant to celebrate the anniversary of Columbus's landfall. Leaders of American Indian organizations condemn Columbus as a pirate or worse; Russell Means of the American Indian Movement says that Columbus "makes Hitler look like a juvenile delinquent." In a 1987 newspaper story, the Indian activist Vernon Bellecourt was quoted as calling for "militant demonstrations" against celebrants in 1992 "to blow out the candles on their birthday cake."
The governing board of the National Council of Churches, a predominantly Protestant organization, resolved that, in consideration of the "genocide, slavery, 'ecocide' and exploitation" that followed Columbus, the quincentenary should be a time of penitence rather than jubilation. In 1986, after four years of impassioned debate, the United Nations abandoned its attempt to plan a celebration.
Once again, Columbus has become a symbol, this time of exploitation and imperialism. It is time that the encounter be viewed not only from the European standpoint, but from that of the indigenous Americans. It is time that the sanitized storybook version of Europeans bringing civilization and Christianity to America be replaced with a more clear-eyed recognition of the evils and atrocities committed in wresting a land from its original inhabitants.
But are we burdening him with more guilt than any one man should have to shoulder? Should not the guilt be more broadly shared?
Columbus should be judged by the evidence of his actions and words, not by the legend that has been embedded in our imaginations. What do we know of Columbus the person, who really was, and of the times, as they really were?
Columbus, as far as we can tell, was born in 1451 in Genoa, apparently the eldest of five surviving children in a family of wool weavers. (One child was a girl, rarely mentioned in historical accounts.) They were tradespeople of modest means. But of them, as of most aspects of his early life, Columbus said nothing. Some of his ancestors may have been Jewish, though this has never been established and, in any event, it seems to have had no direct bearing on his life and exploits. His family was Christian, and so was Columbus -- demonstrably so. His surviving journals and letters are replete with invocations of the names of Christ, Mary and the saints, and he often sought the advice and hospitality of Franciscans.
Even more crucial than his ancestry may have been the time into which he was born. Columbus grew up hearing of the scourge of Islam, the blockage of trade routes to the spices of the East and the parlous times for Christendom. All this could have nourished dreams in an ambitious young man with nautical experience. Columbus did write that at a "tender age" he cast his lot with those who go to sea, shipping out on several voyages in the Mediterranean. In 1476, he found his way by chance to Portugal, where exploration of the sea was a dynamic of the age and the search for a new route to the Indies was an economic and religious imperative.
He gained a knowledge of the Atlantic in voyages to England and Ireland (perhaps as far as Iceland) and at least once down the African coast. His marriage to Felipa Perestrello e Moniz took him to the Madeiras, where he would study Atlantic sailing charts and hear the many tales of westering voyages, and gave him access to Portuguese nobility. In these years he presumably conceived of his bold plan, but it was rejected by John II of Portugal.
So after his wife died, Columbus took their young son, Diego, and went to Spain in 1484, again seeking royal backing. He managed to make friends with influential Franciscan friars and members of the royal court. "Columbus's ability to thrust himself into the circles of the great was one of the most remarkable things about him," writes John H. Parry, an American historian. But he would spend the next eight years entreating the court and defending his plan before royal commissions.
During this time, he fell in love with Beatriz Enriquez de Arana of Cordoba; they never married, but she bore their son, Ferdinand, who became his father's devoted biographer. Ferdinand described his father as a "well-built man of more than average stature" who had a complexion tending to bright red, an aquiline nose and blond hair that, after the age of 30, had all turned white.
Only after the fall of Granada in January 1492, which ended the Moorish presence in Spain, did Ferdinand and Isabella finally relent, apparently on the advice of Santangel, the king's financial adviser. Contrary to legend, Isabella did not have to hock her jewels, and Columbus did not have to prove the world was round. Educated Europeans were already convinced, but he seems to have been the first to stake his life on it.
Columbus was a consummate mariner, everyone seemed to agree. As Michele de Cuneo, who sailed with him, said: "By a simple look at the night sky, he would know what route to follow or what weather to expect; he took the helm, and once the storm was over, he would hoist the sails, while the others were asleep." And he found a new world. If there had not been an America there, he would probably have sailed to his death and certainly to oblivion. He could never have made the Indies, which lay far beyond where his miscalculations had placed them. He was wrong, but lucky. No explorer succeeds without some luck.
He made three more voyages, but his skill and luck deserted him on land. He was an inept administrator of the colony he established at La Isabela, on the north shore of what is now the Dominican Republic. Ruling by the gibbet for three years, he antagonized his own men to insurrection (some lieutenants tried to seize ships and get away with a load of gold) and goaded the native Tainos into bloody rebellion. Thousands of Tainos were raped, killed and tortured and their villages burned. At the first opportunity, Columbus captured Tainos and shipped them to Spain as slaves, a practice not without precedent in Europe or even among the people of pre-Columbian America. Las Casas sadly lamented the practices of his countrymen: "If we Christians had acted as we should."
The geographic interpretations of Columbus were muddled by preconceptions. He tended to see what he wanted to see and took native words to be mispronunciations of places in Cathay. He forced his crew to swear that one of his landfalls, Cuba, was the Asian mainland. His was not an open mind. He sought confirmation of received wisdom, usually church teachings, rather than new knowledge. Enthralled by the proximity of what he believed was the earthly paradise, he failed to appreciate that he had reached the South American continent on his third voyage. The waters of the Orinoco, he wrote, must flow from the fountain in Paradise, "whither no one can go but by God's permission."
Still, Columbus persevered, often racked with the pain of arthritis, which worsened with each voyage, and also tropical fevers. His four voyages, between 1492 and 1504, showed the way to countless others. As he approached death in 1506, his mind was consumed with self-pity, mysticism and a desperate desire to seize Jerusalem in preparation for Judgment Day. He wrote in a letter to the court: "All that was left to me and to my brothers has been taken away and sold, even to the cloak that I wore, to my great dishonor. . . . I am ruined as I have said. Hitherto I have wept for others; now have pity upon me, Heaven, and weep for me, earth!" Columbus did not die a pauper, legend notwithstanding. But his death, in Valladolid, Spain, went unheralded.
How are we to judge the historical Columbus, the man and not the legend? Was he a great man?
No, if greatness is measured by one's stature among contemporaries. We will never know if the course of history might have been any different if Columbus had been a kinder, more generous man. To argue that Columbus was acting in the accepted manner of his time is to concede that he was not superior to his age. To contend (with ample supporting evidence) that even if Columbus had set a better example, others who followed would have eventually corrupted his efforts, is to beg the question. Moreover, the only example Columbus set was one of pettiness, self-aggrandizement and a lack of magnanimity. He could not find in himself the generosity to share any credit for his accomplishments. Whatever his original objective, his lust for gold drove him from island to island and, it seems, to the verge of paranoia. And the only future he could anticipate was wealth for himself and his heirs and, probably more than most people of his time, the chimera of the imminent end of the world.
Yes, if greatness derives from the audacity of his undertaking, its surprising revelation and the magnitude of its impact on subsequent history. Columbus did cross the uncharted Atlantic, no mean feat. He did find new lands and people, and he returned to tell of it so that others could follow, opening the way to intercontinental travel and expansion. True, if he had never sailed, other mariners would eventually have raised the American coast, as the Portuguese did in reaching Brazil by accident in 1500. But it was Columbus who had the idea, ill conceived though it was in many respects, and pursued it with uncommon persistence, undeterred by the doubters and scoffers. As it was put in the apocryphal story, Columbus showed the world how to stand an egg on its end.
Whether he was a great man or merely an agent of a great accomplishment, the issue really is his standing in history. And that depends on posterity's changing evaluation -- Whitman's "evershifting guesses" -- of him and the consequence of Europe's discovery of America. His reputation is inextricably linked to America. Ultimately, Columbus's place in history can be judged only in relation to the place accorded America in history. Surely we have not finally established that place.
It would be interesting to know how Columbus will be characterized in 2092. For it seems that his destiny is to serve as a barometer of our self-confidence and complacency, our hopes and aspirations, our faith in progress and the capacity of humans to create a more just society.

HEADLINE: Amos and Andy's Social History

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Mel Watkins reviewed "The Adventures of Amos 'n' Andy: A Social History of an American Phenomenon" by Melvin Patrick Ely on July 7. I found the entire article objectionable for several reasons. 
 The review does not place the radio show in its political, social or economic setting. This century began with the most repressive and violent actions against black Americans since slavery. In the South, black professionals, wealthy black people and black veterans of World War I were put back in "their place" through threats of violence that ranged from tarring and feathering to disfiguring to lynching.
The "Amos 'n' Andy" television show did not provide, as Mr. Watkins says, a "visual disclosure of genuine African-American stage humor." The use of language did not ring true, the program was not an honest representation of blue-collar or professional blacks, and it refused to acknowledge institutions that framed black life -- racism and poverty.
The author apparently tries to lend some validity to "Amos 'n' Andy" by stating that in the 1930's blacks enjoyed the radio show; then he notes that in the 50's blacks protested the television show. Mr. Watkins suggests that blacks protested the show because they were uncomfortable with black actors exposing the idiosyncrasies of black life to white America.
The protests in the 50's reflected an increasing Afro-American pride that was inspired by many things, but to list only a few: the Harlem Renaissance, the experience of black World War II soldiers in Europe and the roots of the civil rights movement.

Roof Rules Regulating Residential Havens

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
NEW YORK CITY apartment dwellers can be passionate about preserving the right to spend leisure hours on the roof during the warmer months.
The best roofs -- adorned with plantings and planking and carrying the more gracious title of sundeck -- tend to have been created in the larger, postwar buildings. Such structures already provided the stronger support needed for such an amenity, reports Andrea Bunis, president of ABR Management of Manhattan. 
 But not only the weather starts heating up when the trek upstairs begins. Tempers may rise too if the noise, littering or carelessness starts to pit neighbor against neighbor.
It then becomes apparent that rules concerning roof use need modification. The roof itself may also need special attention if it is to remain the building's preferred "backyard" and not be damaged or deemed such a nuisance that it has to be declared off limits.
When preparing or revamping roof rules, it might be useful to begin by compiling a list of city regulations regarding roofs. These can then be incorporated in an individual building's regulations, with the appropriate citation to carry added clout. For example, under its fire prevention code the city forbids anyone to barbecue on a roof, with fines for violators of up to $100 for the first offense and $500 for a subsequent offense.
The Multiple Dwelling Law makes the building's owner or board of directors responsible for keeping the roof in good repair according to the local building codes. The building's professional engineer who regularly inspects the structure should be able to provide details about codes and penalties.
Regulations should include hours of permitted use; policies concerning guests, particularly limiting numbers; whether residents may bring their own furniture; a prohibition on ball playing or other active sports, a ban on loud music; acceptable attire and the minimum age for unaccompanied minors.
A ban on certain types of drink may also be needed. Michael Cantor, a principal with Cantor Management in Brooklyn, noted that several of his client buildings have had to close off their roofs because residents were stuffing soda cans down vent pipes and it was impossible to identify the culprits.
Some managers and lawyers further suggest that simply posting the rules in a public place, such as a notice board in a lobby or on the roof itself is not enough. A letter needs to be circulated to residents covering the rules along with the reasons for the restrictions.
A manageable security system is vital, in particular to protect residents whose apartments open onto the roof. Allan Rosenberg, executive vice president of Darwood Management of Manhattan, recommends the kind that permits residents to deactivate the alarm on the door to the roof with a special key. A double benefit of this, he noted, is that the threat of having to give up the key if rules are not followed can be a powerful tool for compliance.
A professional engineer should inspect the roof at least once each season to make sure it can safely carry the weight load for general access and is in full compliance with the codes, warned Michael Lynn, president of Project Consulting Associates of Manhattan.
Mr. Lynn, an architect, noted that most roofs also accommodate elements of the building's mechanical systems. Although these are normally fenced off, "we constantly see deterioration," he said. "Guard rails will rust and come loose." An old parapet may not be high enough to meet current codes, he added. And there may be nothing on the roof's surface to prevent penetration from spiked heels or chair legs.
MANAGERS report that one of the best and most economical ways to prevent damage is to cover the roof with loosely woven wood decking -- like the surface of a suburban deck. This elevates foot traffic and furniture from the roof surface and is cooler and more pleasant to walk upon.
Wally Rosenwach, chairman of Sitecraft of Long Island City, Queens, a company that has installed such decking on the roof of dozens of co-op and rental buildings, said it comes in sections of varying sizes, such as 2- by 2 or 3- by 3 feet. It can easily be installed and the cost is around $12 a square foot. The company is one of a number that also supply wooden benches (yet another safeguard against the damage that can be caused by improper placement of personal garden chairs) and planters with a drainage base designed specifically for roof use.
An additional value of decking is that it reduces noise. Leo Frantzman, president of the 98-unit co-op at 201 East 77th Street, said complaints by upper-floor residents about the noise level generated from the roof from all the walking and moving around of chairs abated substantially after the board installed planking.
However, to obtain the maximum absorption level, he said, the co-op purchased planking with four inches of clearance from the roof surface instead of the customary one-inch elevation. A shower was also installed, a convenience to make it unnecessary for residents to return to their apartments for showers. That reduced the noise level from trips back and forth to the roof.
But even with all these safeguards the roof might still have to be closed off. Mr. Cantor said some roofing companies refuse to provide a full warranty if they know the roof will be reopened to general access after a resurfacing. In some buildings, roofs were closed because of excessive vandalism and mischief.
If this happens certain rent-regulated tenants may wish to file with the Department of Housing and Community Renewal, the state agency that supervises rent regulation, for a lower rent based on reduced services. Craig Kraus, a Manhattan lawyer specializing in rent-regulation, said that this may only be granted if the roof had been set up as a recreational area -- not if the renter had simply gone up there informally.
A compromise might also work, as it did for an 18-unit brownstone co-op on the Upper West Side. Until a year ago, it had a magnficient roof area with trees, shrubs and picnic tables. But following a severe problem with leaks the architect recommended lightening the load and resurfacing -- all of which seemed to doom the roof garden, said Ingrid Dichter, the past president.
Under the compromise, a small area will remain open, decorated with just a few lightweight planters and limited to just a few residents at a time.

HEADLINE: TriBeCa West: The Issue of Boundaries

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
FOR decades, a grubby industrial neighborhood west of City Hall and wedged between the financial district and Canal Street went virtually unnoticed. But by the late 70's, urban pioneers -- many of them artists squeezed out of SoHo by the gentrification of that onetime industrial area -- discovered its spacious, inexpensive and mostly vacant factories, warehouses and lofts.
Within a decade the area was transformed from an after-dark urban ghost town to one of the city's fastest growing and most desirable residential neighborhoods. The new arrivals dubbed it TriBeCa, for "triangle below Canal." 
 Despite its economic metamorphosis, the area has retained a remarkable number of well-preserved late-19th- and early-20th-century brick and cast-iron industrial buildings. Taken as a group, they provide a rare picture of one of New York City's turn-of-the-century commercial faces, and tomorrow the City Council's Land Use Committee will hold the second of two public hearings on a proposal to approve part of TriBeCa -- the section known as TriBeCa West -- as a historic district.
The hearing is a result of new rules that came out of last year's Charter revisions, which abolished the Board of Estimate, the body that used to have the final say on proposed landmarks and historic districts. By Sept. 10, the full City Council must act on the Landmarks Commission's recommendations -- approving, amending or rejecting them.
TriBeCa West covers 17 blocks bounded by Reade Street on the south, West Broadway on the east, Greenwich Street on the west and Hubert Street and Ericsson Place on the north. Most buildings in the district were built between 1860 and 1910.
"TriBeCa is an extraordinary example of urban industrial design," said Laurie Beckelman, chairman of the Landmarks Commission. "But beyond its historic and architectural value, TriBeCa is a remarkable illustration of successful adaptive reuse."
The commission is currently considering three additional historic districts for TriBeCa: TriBeCa North, bounded by Hubert, Watts, West and Varick Streets; TriBeCa South, to encompass the neighborhood between Chambers and Thomas Streets from West Broadway to Broadway, and TriBeCa East, from Worth to Canal Streets and West Broadway to Lafayette Street.
While the Real Estate Board does not pretend to represent any particular constituency in TriBeCa, its president, Steven Spinola, will appear tomorrow to press a case for whittling down the historic district. Mr. Spinola said that while the organization recognizes the special historic and architectural qualities of some of the buildings in TriBeCa, the district, as now defined, is substantially larger than it needs to be.
"TriBeCa has buildings that represent an important part of the city's history," said Mr. Spinola. "We support their preservation. But there are many others in the area that either do not contribute to the neighborhood's fabric and feeling because they have been altered to the point where they do not conform to any significant historic architectural style, or are so new that they never did make that kind of contribution."
Once known as the Washington Market district, after the city's main produce marketplace, which was demolished as part of an urban renewal push in the 1960's, the neighborhood was home to many of the city's candy factories, spice companies and butter and egg merchants.
Outwardly, TriBeCa has retained most of its rough edges. Many streets are still paved with cobblestone, and raised metal loading platforms are part of the streetscape, as are iron awnings and window shutters. It is still home to many commercial companies and wholesale food business, both new, like Aux Delices des Bois, which imports wild mushrooms, and old, like A. L. Bazzini Company, a nut and candy business.
But behind the aging brick and cast-iron facades are art galleries, chic restaurants and shops and some of the city's most luxurious loft-style residences.
According to a survey of land use made by the Planning Commission, 56.48 percent of the buildings in the proposed district are now used as residences, with 17.6 percent functioning as warehouse or semi-industrial spaces, 5.7 percent of the buildings hold wholesale goods businesses and 5.7 percent are used by office companies. Retailing, film-related businesses, other industrial companies and community facilites comprise the balance of the occupied space.
The Planning Commission report found that 6.74 percent of the buildings were empty and that vacant land and parking lots accounted for just over 3 percent of the space.
If developed in accordance with existing zoning, which calls for a ratio of 5 square feet of floor space for each foot of building site, the empty lots would generate 307,395 square feet of commerical or industrial space.
The City Planning Department is in the midst of a land use survey for the neighborhood with the objective of proposing revised zoning regulations.
Of particular concern to the Real Estate Board are vacant parcels that have been included in the historic district. The board says there are seven such properties, most of them are currently being used as parking lots.
"WITH the inclusion of vacant land and nonconforming buildings," Mr. Spinola said, "the landmarks process is being used as a tool to control future development there."
"As far as we are concerned," he continued, "it is de facto planning and zoning and not preservation."
If the board had held the pen when the boundaries for TriBeCa West were drawn the district would cover only the area from Reade to Franklin Streets, between Greenwich Street and West Broadway. Those boundaries are on a map the board has sent to City Council members as part of a vigorous lobbying effort to get the Council to reduce the district's size.
But doing so would exclude from the district several buildings that architectural historians say are as significant as others in TriBeCa West. One of them is the former warehouse at 117-119 Hudson Street at North Moore Street. Built between 1888 and 1889, it was designed by Thomas R. Jackson. Another is the Baker William warehouse, the 1905 six-story, Neo-Renaissance building at 48-62 Beach Street designed by Charles Haight, who was responsible for many buildings in TriBeCa.
Hal Bromm, a member of Community Board 1 and chairman of its landmarks committee, said that development potential in a neighborhood does not have to be understood as the potential for new high-rise construction.
"The population growth rate in TriBeCa is 88.9 percent," said Mr. Bromm. "That is the highest rate of any residential neighborhood in Manhattan. It speaks strongly to the fact that people are moving to the area, spending money and supporting services."
Mr. Bromm criticized the Real Estate Board for waiting two years after the Landmarks Commission's public hearings on the district to come forward with its own proposal.
"This is an attempt to politicize the process," Mr. Bromm said. "Rather than let the City Council act as a final review process, they are coming in at the 11th hour to make points that should have been made to the Landmarks Commission over the last two years when the record was open, or to the Planning Commission during its hearing on the district.
"To wait until now is a subversion of the process and an attempt to discredit the proposals for future districts in the neighborhood."
While property owners often protest the inclusion of their buildings in historic districts, support for historic district designation for TriBeCa West has come from residents, merchants, the community board and some commercial property owners there.
BUT Stanley Scott, the founder of S.V. Scott Printing Company is not among them. Mr. Scott, who owns the building at 145 Hudson Street as well as the parking lot directly to the west, believes that neither the building nor the parking lot belongs in the historic district.
"I don't see the value on landmarking vacant lots," said Mr. Scott, who, with the help of city Industrial Development Agency bonds, in 1980 bought the loft building where he had been a tenant since the 1960's. "But if that is done, it seems to me that there should be some consistency in the decision."
Mr. Scott said that his lot, which faces Hubert Street and is on the edge of the district, was included but that other border parking lots were not.
Ms. Beckelman said that the West Broadway parking lot, which is between Worth and Leonard Streets, was excluded from the district because it is part of a full block piece on a major avenue that has "obvious development potential."
"Other lots were mostly midblock pieces that are part of significant northern and western boundaries for the district," said Ms. Beckelman.
The Landmarks Commission saw fit to exclude from the historic district a string of midblock buildings on the southern boundary along Reade Street, including a two-story warehouse that still bears a red, blue and yellow Creamoland Butter sign.
Some Council members acknowledge the significance of the Council's consideration of TriBeCa West.
"The Riverdale historic district was the first to come before the Council," said Walter L. McCaffrey, a Queens Democrat and member of the Land Use Committee. "But it is mostly residental and the issues were pretty clear. With TriBeCa West it will be the first time the committee and Council will make these kinds of determinations for a mixed-use neighborhood.
"There is definitely support for landmarking," he continued, "but you can't ignore the potential for economic gain so there has to be a clear delineation between zoning and landmarking."

Silver Glimpsed in Cloud Over Bridgeport

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
 WHEN Bridgeport's petition for bankruptcy was denied 10 days ago by Federal Bankruptcy Judge Alan H.TW. Schiff, the local real estate community braced for the worst. "I thought, oh boy, we're going to see everybody calling up and pulling out of deals," said Charles Coviello, a broker with Realty World-Trio Associates on East Main St. "But nobody did."
He had said the same thing after the June 6 announcement by Mayor Mary Moran that she was filing for bankruptcy protection. If anything, business got better throughout June and July. 
 "The basic message of bankruptcy," said Steven Auerbach, the city's Director of Economic Development, "is that filing means a restructuring of the city's debt and will be a stabilizing influence on taxes."
The petition was denied because, the judge ruled, the city has enough money to pay its bills for the current fiscal year. He added that it may file again when its resources are exhausted.
But brokers are not apprehensive.
"There is an optimism about the city in spite of some uncertainty," said William Raveis, president of Raveis Real Estate in Fairfield. "But I think the cards are in favor of the Bridgeport buyer."
Buyers coming to Elaine Carvalho, a realtor with Memoli & Memoli in Bridgeport, have apparently shared that optimism recently. "We closed four deals in June, with five more pending," she said. "Last year I had three deals from Jan. 1 to July 1."
Among her recent sales was a two-bedroom Cape Cod near the Trumbull border, to Mandy and Bert di Silva, who had rented an apartment in Bridgeport. "We got it for $25,000 less than the asking price of $100,000," Mrs. di Silva said. "The city has hit bottom, it can only go up, and this is our foot in the door. Investors and first-time buyers like the di Silvas are the leaders in the current market.
"We have many investors interested in two- and three-family houses," said Bob Csom, manager of the Stratford office of Beazley Realty, a statewide agency. "The glut of commercial space is driving them into residential properties, and rentals have always been a good commodity in Bridgeport. People transferring into the area from outside the region do not have Bridgeport on their list, but Bridgeport has the best values. Prices haven't been this low in 10 years."
Mansions overlooking Black Rock Harbor on up to three acres, priced from $500,000 to $1.9 million, would cost twice as much in lower Fairfield County.
Beazley Realty, as well as other large firms like Dollar Dry Dock, Raveis and Elmer R. Craw, have moved out of Bridgeport since 1988, leaving smaller local firms to handle the walk-in business. Many of the larger brokerages believe that the recent spurt of sales is simply due to a more widespread improvement in the housing market and not solely to Bridgeport's fiscal troubles.
Some brokers, in fact, say the state of Bridgeport's economy has hurt the local real estate market and helped its neighbors.
"It has put a hold on residential sales and made selling property that much more difficult" in the city, said Dian Vince, manager of the William Pitt agency's Trumbull office. "First-time buyers are worried about the city's economy and are looking elsewhere, making the surrounding towns the beneficiaries of Bridgeport's troubles."
Pitt, based in Stamford, has never had a Bridgeport office but carries a large inventory of foreclosed properties there.
"THE suburban communities offer better education and lower taxes," said Jeff Craw, a broker with Elmer R. Craw in Monroe. "Bridgeport offers more house for the money. The break-even point governs the sale. People don't say they want to buy in Bridgeport; they just want a $110,000 house. They may be able to afford $120,000 in the suburbs because of the tax differential. I had two recent customers shy away from Bridgeport. One young couple concerned about high taxes would not commit to a house they liked very much at $120,000."
A house selling for $130,000 in Bridgeport is taxed at $3,171, according to Richard Ruggio of the assessor's staff. In Trumbull, a $130,000 house is taxed at $2,795; in Stratford, the tax would be $1,653. But the average price of a three-bedroom house in Bridgeport is $113,000; in Stratford, $150,000, and in Trumbull, $230,000.
Two- and three-family houses in the city are selling for $110,000 to $120,000. Richard Stein, president of the Greater Bridgeport Board of Realtors, said there had been "a 25 percent increase in sales of multifamily houses since early June."
Joan A. Gamble, owner of Realty World-Trio Associates, just sold a foreclosed six-family house at 587 Brook Street to a Greenwich investor for $147,000. "His cash flow will be $1,500 a month after expenses," she said.
The Kimball Group of Bridgeport and the Rasamny Realty Group of Danbury are buying Bell Tower, a foreclosed condominium complex in Bridgeport, from Comfed Savings Bank of Lowell, Mass. "We took nine binders the last weekend in July," said James Kimball.
Converted from the 1901 Shelton School on Alice Street, the imposing red-brick building will contain 44 units. Nine two- and three-bedroom units measuring 1,500 to 1,650 square feet were sold by the original developer for $124,000 to $134,000. Fifteen identical, centrally air-conditioned units (including the nine on binders) are available from $65,000 to $69,000. The rest are still under construction. All units have working fireplaces, cathedral ceilings, stoves, refrigerators and dishwashers.
To help finance home purchases, GE Mortgage Insurance Company and People's Bank of Bridgeport offer a free, six-week Community Home Buyers Course for families of any size with incomes up to $60,000. After "graduation," they qualify for a mortgage at 33 percent of their monthly income instead of the usual 28 percent.
Home inspections are subsidized, and a reserve of two months worth of mortgage payments is waived. Of the 250 families who have taken the course since March of last year, 50 have obtained mortgages and bought homes.

Auto Injury Cases
THE State Department of Insurance estimates that nearly four million New Jersey drivers now have auto insurance policies that carry the "verbal threshold" -- an insurance option that lowers premiums but limits lawsuits by permitting individuals to sue for only serious injuries. 
 And though drivers who take the option are able to easily calculate the premium savings resulting from their choice, a debate over what they have given up, and what constitutes serious injury, has raged in legal circles since 1989, when the option first became available.
 That debate will be resolved soon, lawyers say, when the Appellate Division of State Superior Court delivers its opinion in a case that most experts agree will set the standard for auto injury cases for the foreseeable future.
"This is the fulcrum of the auto insurance issue in New Jersey," said Gerald Baker, a Hoboken lawyer who filed briefs in the case on behalf of the New Jersey chapter of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America.
Mr. Baker said that the auto injury case, involving a plaintiff who sustained neck and back injuries but no broken bones, would establish for the first time what the State Legislature envisioned when it included the verbal threshold option in the state's insurance law.
"It all comes down to whether we take away innocent victims' rights to make a claim for injuries," Mr. Baker said.
The case before the Appellate Division is an appeal from a decision by Judge Burton L. Fundler of Monmouth County Superior Court, who ruled that the verbal threshold barred injured parties from instituting lawsuits for pain and suffering when injuries were of the "soft-tissue" type, like sprains and strains.
Mr. Baker said the Appellate Division was expected to answer two crucial questions in deciding the appeal: What constitutes a "serious" or "permanent" injury and who makes that determination, a judge or a jury?
Personal injury lawyers say that many soft-tissue injuries can be both serious and permanent and that a jury, and not the judge, should make that determination. Indeed, they say, if a trial judge can make that determination and dismiss soft-tissue lawsuits, then many seriously injured parties would effectively be denied their rights to jury trials.
Mr. Baker said many lawyers who had clients with potential cases were waiting for the Appellate Division's decision. And in at least one county -- Middlesex -- a Superior Court trial judge has temporarily suspended proceedings in 15 automobile injury cases until the opinion.
Lawyers who represent insurance companies are also awaiting the decision.
"I think that the Legislature's intent was to eliminate minor cases," said James Martin, a North Brunswick lawyer who represents both insurance companies and injured parties in personal injury litigation. "Unfortunately, soft-tissue injuries generally fall within that category."
Mr. Martin said not all soft-tissue injuries would necessarily be considered minor. "Those that are severe will survive any interpretation of the statute," he said.
But Mr. Baker said the uncertainty over what injuries were actionable under the verbal threshold had worked to the disadvantage of some injured parties.
"Some lawyers are just rejecting soft-tissue cases out of hand," he said. "Others are taking them and then settling them cheaply."
Most lawyers, Mr. Baker said, simply don't know what to do with soft-tissue injury cases.
"What do you do when someone walks into your office with a neck injury that the person's doctor says is significant?" he said. "Who decides whether to put the case into suit? It's a hazardous decision for a plaintiff's attorney."
He said many lawyers were just doing nothing until they received some guidance from the courts.
"I probably have 75 cases in my office right now," he said, "and I'm just sitting on them."
 
Tourism at Shore

Despite optimistic predictions that business would be booming at Jersey Shore resorts this season, merchants in Seaside Heights say that though the summer has been hot and the water cool, the tourist trade has been lukewarm at best.
Encouraged by clean beaches and an unusually high number of rental reservations earlier in the year, officials enthusiastically expected Shore resorts to attract record numbers of vacationers who, reeling from the recession, would choose areas closer to home.
It appears, however, that many people stayed even closer to home than expected.
"We have been very, very slow," said Joe Kascuba, manager of the Midway Steak House, a concession stand on the boardwalk in Seaside Heights. "I would say our business has been off about 30 percent."
On a particularly sweltering Saturday afternoon recently, Mr. Kascuba was found standing behind an almost empty grill with a sparse array of customers, most of whom were buying soft drinks instead of steak sandwiches.
"All I can say is, thank God it's hot," Mr. Kascuba said.
Some local business people say that conditions this summer seem tailor-made for the tourist industry.
"Weatherwise it's been a 10, and waterwise it's been a 10," said Leo Szalkowski, a Lavallette real-estate broker. "But touristwise it has probably been a six and a half."
Mr. Szalkowski, who has been in the real-estate business for 30 years, said that the motel owners and other real-estate experts he had spoken to were generally disappointed by the low numbers of out-of-town visitors.
"The motels have been doing a good weekend business, but during the week there are a lot of vacancies," he said. "There was a lot of fanfare at the beginning of the season, but I don't think it really panned out."
Some officials, however, say merchants' pessimistic perceptions may be the result of overly optimistic expectations.
Amanda French, director of programming for the Toms River-Ocean County Chamber of Commerce, said she was not disappointed by the number of tourists because she had managed to keep a tight rein on her expectations.
"It's what I expected because I expected it to be better than it was in previous years," Ms. French said. "And by all means it's better than it was, though we still have a long way to go."

HEADLINE: Triangle Where Business, Taxes and Neighborhood Intersect

BYLINE: By RAY CORMIER

DATELINE: YORKTOWN

 BODY:
OLD CROMPOND ROAD winds downhill from Zino's Nursery at Route 202, past one modern house and several other older residences, some meadows and patches of trees. It could be a country road in the Catskills.
But to some town officials here, this little neighborhood looks more like a Platinum Half-Mile. 
 The master plan that the town updated and approved in 1983 sees the 69.29 acres that resemble a triangle between Route 202 and the Bear Mountain Parkway Extension, just west of the Taconic State Parkway, as an ideal area to attract light industry and much-needed revenue. In 1989, the Town Board proposed to rezone the area, from commercial on the perimeter and residential elsewhere, to accommodate light industrial uses.
Old Crompond Road is also home to 10 families. And 10 undeveloped acres along Route 202 are where one local landowner wants to develop businesses for his children to run.
 
<SC0>Two Years of Talk
 There are the three competing concerns over what has come to be known as the Bear Mountain Triangle: a neighborhood's way of life, American entrepreneurship and the fiscal well-being of the municipality. They are intertwined in a way that could arise in many suburban communities as developable land disappears and tax pressures grow.
The property owners in the Bear Mountain Triangle won a reprieve in October 1989, when the Town Board failed to muster an 80 percent majority made necessary by the property owners' petition opposing the rezoning.
But the subsequent two years of petitions, legal wrangling and negotiations have left the property owners alternately angry and frustrated, living in a kind of zoning limbo.
"It's been a real nightmare," said Joseph M. Adrian, a Hawthorne real-estate appraiser who lives in Yorktown and wants to build an auto mall with a dealership and other automobile services along Route 202 in the Bear Mountain Triangle.
The 1989 proposal would have changed Mr. Adrian's commercial zone to an industrial category, barring the kind of businesses he planned. "Town boards have got to a point where with the stroke of a pen they can ruin someone's life," he said.
James Kutter, whose family has lived on Old Crompond Road since the 1930's, said: "We've been here three generations; others have been here five or six. Now they say 'We don't care about your roots,' in order to get another $1 million in revenue."
 
'No Hidden Agenda'
 A neighbor of his, Edith Cassinari, said her family has lived in the area since 1924. She, too, sounded frustrated, saying of town officials, "They don't want to listen to us."
But Anthony L. Grasso, one of two current Town Board members who voted to rezone the area in 1989, said recently: "No one is trying to force anyone out. There's no hidden agenda. I feel we have to do what's right for the whole community. Our commercial tax base isn't high enough."
How far does a town go in following a master plan?
"A master plan is a kind of great overview of the town over 20 years or more," said Lester Steinman, director of the Municipal Law Resource Center of Pace University in White Plains. "Master plans are looked upon as very theoretical."
 
'When People Are There'
 David Portman, a private planner with Frederick P. Clark & Associates in Rye, who like Mr. Steinman would speak only of general planning principles and not about the specific issue, agreed, adding, "The bottom line is the Town Board has to decide what is best for the town."
Town Superviser Nancy R. Elliott, who cast the lone vote against the rezoning plan in 1989, said of the plan's effects: "If we were looking at a blank map on the wall, that's one thing. But when people are there, that's another."
And Mr. Grasso acknowleged, "Master plans are not cut into stone."
But the issue seems far from being settled.
Mr. Adrian started planning his auto mall in 1986 on 10 acres that for decades was mostly zoned for commercial use. He said that he had spent more than $200,000 on his plans and that he had filed a suit that said the town had induced him to spend money on development plans and then tried to outlaw those plans with the zoning proposal.
Members of the Town Board have said his plans would be approved, as long as they did not include a car dealership. Board members said the road, which already has some auto dealerships, could not accommodate any more. But Mr. Adrian said he still wanted to open one, and he is disputing a town ruling on wetlands on the property limiting its use.
Mr. Adrian initiated the petition opposing the rezoning, which meant that a "super majority" -- 80 percent -- approval was required for the plan to take effect. With one board member, Gary Ajello, abstaining because he was the lawyer for a property owner in the area, Mrs. Elliott's no vote killed the proposal to rezone most of the site for light industrial use, rather than commercial use. She said she was concerned about the longtime residents. "Longevity played a part in my thinking," she conceded.
Some board members have said the new zoning would make the land more valuable, but Mrs. Elliott asserted that "it doesn't while they are living there." In other words, a parcel is more valuable only if a company wanting to build there makes an offer acceptable to a landowner.
Naomi Tor, director of planning, explained that the concept behind the master plan for the area was to keep commercial development on the south side of Route 202, where the Building and Design Center, a home furnishings mall, already exists. The north side would be for industrial and office space and a new interchange district for travel-related services to take advantage of the proximity of the Taconic State Parkway.
"The planners felt in the larger picture we must be economical in the use of our land," she said. "We don't have that much land for that kind of use." She added that the Old Crompond Road area "is isolated, not a good place for a residential community."
 
'Negative and Positive Impacts'
 But Neal Bailenson, a Councilman who voted for the rezoning in 1989, said it was Mr. Adrian's proposal for an auto dealership that "was the original impetus" for the rezoning proposal.
He said that the master plan called for nonresidential use of the area and that there already were some nonresidential uses on some parcels: at the west end there is an auto-body shop, and one resident stores construction equipment on another parcel. "Whenever you do rezoning, there are negative and positive impacts," he said. "You hope the town can benefit and you can limit the negatives."
An impact study done for the Town Board in 1988 by Tim Miller Associates of Brooklyn estimated that the rezoning would produce a tripling of assessments and tax revenue and the creation of 6,000 jobs, figures Mr. Kutter said were exaggerated. To create that many jobs on 70 acres, he said, "you would have to denude the land" for buildings and parking space.
Several residents echoed the comment of Brian R. Hoy, who said he liked the seclusion that the semi-rural nature of the neighborhood provides.
Mr. Kutter and his wife, Ann, have looked at real estate in the area. They and Mr. Kutter's elderly parents live in adjoining houses.
"We looked at $500,000 houses that don't give us what we have here," said Mrs. Kutter, who has been a leader in trying to negotiate a compromise and is secretary of the town Republican Party, the party of all five board members. The Kutters's house, a modest-looking bungalow from the street, has 10 rooms for them and their teen-age son, and there is a pool in the backyard.
 
Willing to Compromise
 Mr. Kutter, a consultant to international computer companies, said he had turned down a lucrative position in London to keep from leaving his roots and his parents, who are in their 80's.
The Kutters and others said they did not mind compromising to allow some form of additional tax base in the area as long as their homes are protected. Eugene Orloff, who is retired, said: "We're not being obtuse or stubborn. I do not know exactly what's being proposed."
Mr. Grasso, Mr. Bailenson, who also voted for the rezoning in 1989, and Mrs. Elliot have met with the residents of Old Crompond Road, but a compromise has eluded them. Talks of buffers for the residential properties, switching the industrial space across Route 202 and other ideas have yet to be put into a proposal, and the residents remain frustrated. As one, Brian R. Hoy, said, "It always seems the towns and counties get their way."
No one has fought the Town Board harder than Mr. Adrian. He said late last month that he still wanted to start an auto dealership and that he would sue over the most recent wetlands limitations imposed on him by the town. The board members all agree any question of rezoning must await settlement of the Adrian case.
Besides providing a source of income for four of his six adult children, Mr. Adrian said, "I thought my plans were for the betterment of the area and would bring taxes into town."
Mr. Bailenson, who surprised many in town by announcing on July 23 that he would not seek a fourth term this fall, said of Mr. Adrian's proposal, "I was reluctant to see 202 become another Central Avenue."
About rezoning in general, he added: "You have to be professional about it, and it has to make sense. This seems to make sense. But we're still going to make some people unhappy."

HEADLINE: At a Seaside Gallery, It's 'La Boheme' With a Happy Ending

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON

DATELINE: CITY ISLAND

 BODY:
RON TERNER knew the scene: the icy reception at the art gallery door, the noncommittal response from a brusque employee, the portfolios returned without comment. Because of his own brush with rejection as a young photographer he decided never to run his own gallery that way.
Now 42 years old, the man who has owned the Focal Point Gallery for 18 years here has retained a genuine friendliness that draws artists from miles around. The gallery specializes in photography, and Mr. Terner promises a sharing of ideas, if not an exhibition, to any artist who wants to bring in work. 
 Near the Hutchinson River Parkway just below the Westchester County line, City Island looks no trendier than when Mr. Terner moved here in the early 1970's. The Focal Point Gallery itself, set among pizza shops, laundromats and marine-supply stores on the island's one long commercial street, is as unpretentious as Mr. Terner and his wife, Niru, who runs the place with him.
 
Jewelry Underwrites Other Projects
 One recent summer day, the couple's golden retriever, Tandra, lolled under a table. A fan circulated the humid air. Mrs. Terner, a native of India, displayed an exotic collection of jewelry from behind a well-stocked counter. Customers wandered in and out, greeted either by Mr. or Mrs. Terner or by their 13-year-old son, Rajeev.
It is the sale of jewelry, Mr. Terner explained, that allows him to pursue his real interest: showing the work of established artists like Armand Rumayor, whose work was then on the walls.
He can exhibit up-and-coming photographers like the five whose group show opened at the gallery on Aug. 2, without worrying if the pictures will sell, and he can continue the nude photography he has concentrated on for many years -- now exploring the boundaries between painting and photography to create increasingly abstract imagery.
 
Coming Upon Photography
 In addition, he is able to publish his own works and those of others by means of the Focal Point Press, a nonprofit enterprise Mr. Terner founded. The press in turn helps finance many of the gallery's projects.
Mr. Terner's City Island story reads like a "La Boheme" with a happier ending. A native of the Bronx, he said he had been influenced "to make art my life" by his grandmother, the late painter and art therapist Anne Kellogg. Searching for a medium in which to express himself, Mr. Terner found photography at the age of 20, at first regarding it as "a tool to help me with my painting and drawing."
He took his early portraits and street photography to Manhattan galleries, but it was on City Island that he found kindred spirits. Crafts were flourishing here at the time and Mr. Terner became friends with a group of artists working in jewelry, woodcraft, stained glass, pottery and painting. He sold his first pictures at an outdoor exhibition, and with the encouragement of his friends, opened the Focal Point Gallery when he was 26.
He lived at the back of the gallery, relying on a pot-bellied stove for warmth. "I remember chopping a lot of wood -- probably 10 cords a season," Mr. Terner said. "It rained and snowed inside. I bartered for meals by doing people's portraits and restoring old photographs."
 
'I Sold the Pups for a Tripod'
 When his first golden retriever had puppies, "I sold the pups for a tripod and lens," Mr. Terner recalled. "I got a cat who ate the mice who ran over me when I slept."
But Mr. Terner was happy, he said, more so after a striking Indian woman walked into the gallery one day. "I wouldn't let her go," Mr. Terner said of Niru. Now the Terner family lives in a house down the street from the gallery. Mr. Terner is the only artist left living here of the early group of friends. While there are antiques shops and a private art dealer in town, his is the only art gallery.
 
More Residents, More Tourists
 City Island has changed, he said. There are more people living here -- especially more upper-middle-class people -- and marinas have replaced the boatyards, which were a mainstay of the island's economy. Rents have gone up and condominiums are more numerous. Tourists flock to City Island for its restaurants and the beach.
But he is still happy here, he said, because the island still has its charm. "The people who are coming here to live also want to preserve it," Mr. Terner said.
The photographer doesn't seem to measure success in square feet or slickness. Doing what he wants in the way he wants to do it counts more for him than upscale appearances. The darkroom where he works mornings and Mondays, when the gallery is closed, does not gleam with the latest equipment.
Instead, he proudly showed a visitor a signed, original photograph on the wall by the late Imogene Cunningham that a friend of Mr. Terner's had found in a dump. The black and white picture shows Alfred Stieglitz in front of a painting done by his wife, Georgia O'Keeffe. "A picture by a master of a master in front of a master," is how Mr. Terner describes it.
 
'A Sign, a Calling'
 When his friend gave him the picture -- in perfect condition -- in 1977, Mr. Terner said he "took it as a sign, a calling, not to give up the gallery" as he had planned. After he and his wife visited India several months later he reopened the gallery in a new location. The present gallery is the Focal Point's third site here.
Beside what he called Stieglitz's "watchful eyes" Mr. Turner works with photographs of Albert Einstein and the Indian philosopher Rabindranath Tagore facing him. On the same wall is a color portrait he made of his grandmother, whom he calls "the biggest influence in my life."
Mrs. Kellogg coined the term "PhotoTerns" for Mr. Terner's style of work, which involves painting with chemicals on fixed black and white prints and then refixing them. Prices for the pictures, of which no two are alike, begin at $1,500. Mr. Terner will show his work, which has been exhibited in the Soviet Union and will travel to Mexico next year, at the Focal Point Gallery from Oct. 12 to Nov. 3, with an opening reception for the public on Oct. 12 at 7:30 P.M.
The gallery's exhibitions are generally culled from slides submitted once a year by artists from all over the country. There are exceptions: recently there was a show of Latvian photography.
 
Classical Nude Studies
 The current group exhibition, which includes color abstractions of nature, classical nude studies, impressionistic photographs of exotic dancers and the people who watch them, and the photojournalistic portrait of a family, will be on view through Sept. 29.
Frank McGinnis of Hastings-on-Hudson, one of the five artists represented and the only one from Westchester, is showing nudes strikingly composed in black and white.
In addition to funds from the Focal Point Press, the Focal Point Gallery receives it support in part from the Bronx Council on the Arts, the International Paper Company and the State Department of Cultural Affairs. The gallery's hours are Tuesdays through Sundays from noon to 6:30 P.M. and additionally from 7:30 to 9 P.M. on Fridays and Saturdays. For further information, call the gallery at (212) 885-1403.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Can the Fed Keep the Cracks From Growing?

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Just when everyone knew the economy was recovering, cracks are being noticed again.
The cracks are in the mountain of credit that was built up in the past decade, and it is fair to say that their existence is not news. They spooked the markets last fall, but after that they were not so much papered over as dismissed as irrelevant. 
 But now some companies are finding the credit markets less hospitable than they expected, and there were old-fashioned runs on the Hong Kong operations of Citibank and Britain's Standard Chartered Bank. Both runs were unreasonable, but when the whiffs of crisis start to blow, they do not always swirl with discrimination.
It appears that the runs have ended. Citibank stayed open late and handed out cash to any depositor who wanted it -- the classic tactic to fight a run. By Friday, things appeared back to normal, and the vast majority of Hong Kong depositors had left their money where it was. Blessedly, the run remained a retail event, and did not involve institutions that can withdraw billions within minutes.
The problems in Hong Kong may yet shake the comfortable assumption, prevalent both in the City of London and on Wall Street, that the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International will have political repercussions, not financial ones. In fact, it has brought home to depositors in Britain and Hong Kong, among other places, the risks of putting money in a bank. Those lessons parallel the painful realization that some who are owed money by Executive Life will not get it all back. Both are likely to make people more cautious. Insurance regulators worry that rumors lead to runs by policyholders and bringdown insurers that could have survived.
Last fall, when credit worries were high and bank stocks low, the stock market illustrated the fears. Now, it reflects the confidence that followed the Federal Reserve's aggressive easing, which continued last week. Most bank stocks are holding up, although they are not hitting new highs, as the S.&P. 500 did last week. But shares faded after bonds began slipping on Thursday, and the Dow Jones industrial average ended the week down 10.06 points, to 2,996.20.
That market strength is a blessing for the economy. Many companies that need capital have found a way to get it from the market, often by selling shares in a subsidiary. The money can then go to meet debt obligations that otherwise would cause problems. Citicorp shares are weak, but many others are strong enough that banks should be able to raise capital.
The market irony is that it is starting to look as if the bears may have been right when they warned that the Fed could not get the economy moving again simply by pushing interest rates down. Many now think the revised figures will show that there was a further economic decline during the second quarter. Analysts are cutting profit forecasts at a rapid rate.
But so far, the stock market is willing to retain faith that the Fed's actions will work. Let us hope that faith is justified.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Sweden Gets a Case of the Jitters

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Sweden is stumbling.
After a surprisingly robust performance this year, the stock market has gotten a case of the jitters, the result of a pessimistic economic outlook and the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming elections this fall. 
 Since Aug. 1, the Swedish market's Affarsvalden index has declined 2.4 percent, closing Friday at 1,096.20. It has fallen 4.7 percent from its 1991 high of 1,149.80, which was set on July 11.
James Capel Inc. in London is telling its clients to take profits now and wait until the fourth quarter before deciding on whether they should return to Stockholm. UBS Phillips Drew of London is cutting its forecast for the Affarsvalden index to 1,050 by year's end, down from 1,100.
Because many of the country's blue chip companies, like Astra and Ericsson, depend on exports, the outlook for the economies of Europe and the United States are just as critical to investors as that for Sweden. And the news is not rosy. The recovery in America may not be vigorous. In England, the recession is dragging on. And in Germany, a major Swedish trading partner, the economy is slowing and interest rates could rise another notch.
The change in sentiment toward the Swedish market is also a result of a worry over the latest round of six-month earnings reports, which began to come out last week. SKR, the ball-bearing manufacturer, announced a 95 percent drop in pre-tax profits. The company said it expected earnings to improve in the second half of the year, an announcement that gave the stock market a little lift at the end of the week.
Sweden's own economic outlook is also darker than many local investors had thought. The recession is expected to continue through this year, the experts say, with forecasts showing a weak recovery, at best, developing next year.
Although analysts at UBS expect corporate earnings to increase 20 percent to 25 percent in 1992, part of the rebound will be a result of one-time restructuring charges many companies are taking this year year to cut costs. Some companies, like Volvo, also had major costs for development of new models, which will not be repeated.
The September election, in which the current Government of Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson, will be fighting for its political life, is also adding uncertainity.
The possibility of a coalition government of several conservative and non-Socialist parties could add impetus to the move that is seeking to tilt what was once a major Western welfare state toward an open market orientation. But the coalition, analysts argue, could break apart over other issues, like nuclear power and membership in the European Community. And in recent polls, the Social Democrats, although still trailing, have gained some ground.
Much of the impetus for the market rally came from signs of a change in the Social Democrats' attitude and economic management. Less inclined toward innovation, the Government, analysts say, is now more likely to use inflation than the unemployment rate as the key guide to policy.
The Government's decision to apply for membership in the European Community also encouraged many foreign investors to buy stocks before the country's stock market is forced by E.C. rules to open its door fully to foreigners. According to James Capel, foreigners were net purchasers of 3.7 billion kronor worth of stock by the end of May, compared with 1.2 billion kronor for all of last year.
The decision to tie the krona to a basket of European currencies, as represented in the European Currency Unit, gave the Swedish currency a new stability. It opened the way for cuts in interest rates at home and raised confidence that the government would not use krona devaluations just to make Swedish exports cheaper abroad.
In addition, two major deals, both involving the Wallenberg family, which has major stakes in many Swedish companies, poured billions of kronor into the market, helping to spur domestic buying. One was the friendly $2.8 billion takeover of Alfa-Laval, a manufacturer of dairy machinery, by Switzerland's Tetra Pak. The second was the purchase by the Wallenbergs of the remaining shares in Saab-Scania that they did not own.
The market also rebounded from a very low level, having fallen 37.6 percent after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Even after this year's rally, the market is 18 percent below its pre-invasion level, according to the Financial Times index of world stock markets. During the war rally in January and February, the market was the top performer in the Financial Times index, rising 27 percent.
"There is no room for any disappointments coming through," said Roddy Bridge of UBS in London. "If this earnings period disappoints, the cash that had been supporting the market can turn around and the market can fall. This is what I am hoping for so that we can take a look to see if we should go positive on the market again."

HEADLINE: Piercing Wall Street's 'Lucite Ceiling'

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
When pressed, Bernard B. Beal will say that he made his most critical career decision at gunpoint. It was the summer of 1972, and Mr. Beal, the son of an elevator operator in Brooklyn, had just finished his scholarship-sponsored studies at the Wooster School in Danbury, Conn. He had applied to various colleges, but preferred entrepreneurship. So he took his college fund and bought a stake in a fast-food restaurant in the Bronx, which he helped manage. When a gunman arrived one hot night, the young manager tried to bolt and a bullet grazed his leg. Bernard Beal decided that maybe college was a better idea after all.
College and an M.B.A. from Stanford led to a nine-year stint at E. F. Hutton, now Shearson Lehman Brothers. Then, in 1988, Mr. Beal at last became an entrepreneur: He joined with several partners to form M. R. Beal & Company, one of the fastest-growing minority-owned investment banking firms on Wall Street. 
 In a way, he is still under fire.
M. R. Beal has entered the securities industry at a time when Wall Street firms are battling to preserve their slice of a shrinking business. But it is also a time when the financial community, mirroring the national debate about the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, is groping for ways to open the doors of Wall Street to minorities and women without abandoning the notion of rewarding individual merit.
In many ways, Bernard Beal's experience captures the soul of that debate. He acknowledges that his firm benefits from various state and local government programs that set aside a portion of bond underwriting business for minority- and female-owned firms. But he is quick to add that he wants to be in charge of those deals. "We couldn't survive on a 5 to 10 percent set-aside program," he said. "The people we've hired are used to running transactions."
Nor will he limit his role to just underwriting municipal bonds. His firm also actively trades them through one of the largest trading desks of any minority-owned firm on the Street. "There is no way that there is any advantage to being a minority firm in the buying and selling of securities," said Mr. Beal. "Nobody is going to sell a bond to you for one-eighth of a point less just because you're black."
 
A Corporate Aim
 And while some minority-owned firms are content to stay in the realm of municipal finance, where the growing power of black and female politicians bolsters their access to business, Mr. Beal is determined to expand into corporate finance -- a stony field jealously guarded by the oldest and most powerful firms on Wall Street. Indeed, he sees expansion into corporate finance as a crucial step to provide minorities access to badly needed capital. "We've had social and political advantages," he said. "Now we need the economic advantage."
He has no illusions this will be easy. Most of corporate America's top executives are white males. And despite Wall Street's much-publicized effort to lower barriers to minority firms in recent years, there are few blacks or women in the corporate finance arena.
"It's worse than a glass ceiling, because at least you can break glass," Mr. Beal said. "This ceiling is solid Lucite." He softens his indictment with laughter. "It's just going to take some time, that's all."
It's an effort worth making, said Lee Jackson, a former Wall Street investment banker who is now the collector-treasurer for the city of Boston. "It is time for minority and women-owned firms to break into that market," he said. "They will be met with some resistance, but it is time for someone to knock on those doors, because it's good for the economy, overall, when the corporate world is not just hearing from firms that are predominantly male and predominantly white."
Mr. Beal was senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers in May 1988 when he struck off to become chairman of M.R. Beal -- the initials are drawn from the middle names of his two children (Manning and Mae) and his wife, Valerie Rose. The firm started with just eight people on staff. It now has three dozen -- most of them from the ranks of Wall Street's blue-chip institutions and about two-thirds of them minorities or women.
Diana L. Taylor, the president and an equity partner in the firm, was a senior vice president of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Tom Monti, who oversees both sales and underwriting, was recently recruited from Bankers Trust. Stephen C. Leslie, who runs the trading desk at the firm, is a veteran of Salomon Brothers.
 
Starting in Munis
 Beal devoted itself first to developing its municipal bond business. Since its founding, it has participated in 167 long-term public underwritings totaling $17.7 billion, according to data from Investment Dealers Digest. Last year alone, I.D.D. said, the firm took part in 73 long-term public bond deals worth a total of $8.3 billion. That put it a respectable 24th in I.D.D.'s industry rankings, close behind Pryor, McClendon, Counts & Company; Grigsby Brandford Powell, and W.R. Lazard & Company, -- the other leading minority-owned firms, all of which were well established before M.R. Beal was born.
The growth at minority- and female-owned firms is thanks in part to state and local policies and laws that encourage their inclusion in the syndicates that underwrite public bond offerings.
Some issuers -- California, for example -- require by law that female- and minority-owned firms be included in their bond sales. "We want an open-door policy, not an 'old pals' act," said Kathleen Brown, the state treasurer. "The theory of providing greater opportunity is that it provides more competition, and the more competition there is, the better the deal the state should get." Other issuers, like Detroit and Boston, have informal policies based on government procurement rules.
According to I.D.D., minority- and female-owned firms participated in more than half of the long-term municipal bond deals, by dollar value, that were sold in the first half of this year, up from less than 20 percent in all of 1988.
But the ranking that places minority firms so high gives every member of a selling syndicate full credit for the entire face value of a deal. That is not how Mr. Beal keeps score. He takes credit only for the deals on which his firm has served as the senior underwriter or co-senior underwriter. (The senior manager allocates the bonds in the selling group, and thus can attract the lion's share of the purchase orders -- and the profits -- because buyers are confident the lead firm can fill its orders.)
By that sterner standard -- I.D.D. statistics for lead managers, excluding short-term notes and private placements -- Beal climbed to 69thin the industry last year, up sharply from 231st the year before.
 
An Elusive Goal
 But minority firms still fall far behind the major Wall Street firms in the senior manager rankings.
That is probably less a result of bias than of financial strength, said William H. Hayden, a senior managing director of Bear, Stearns and chairman of the National Association of Securities Professionals, which represents minorities and women on Wall Street. With today's sharper competition for the profits that go with the senior manager's spot, larger, better-capitalized firms are winning out over smaller ones, he said.
However, Mr. Hayden added, "Bernard Beal has great marketing and banking skills, and I have every expectation that he will lead his firm through that process of getting bigger and bigger deals to manage."
Ernest G. Green, a managing director at Lehman Brothers, a division of Shearson Lehman Brothers, agreed that Mr. Beal's ability to get the senior spot as often as he does "is a recognition by issuers that he wants to be seen as more than a minority firm. Plus, he is spending more time on the trading side than other firms do, and that helps."
Not every minority-owned firm sets its sights on running a sales syndicate. Indeed, one criticism of the governmental programs that give minority firms an assured spot is that some small firms do little to earn their place on the team. Each syndicate member is responsible for selling a certain portion of bonds, but Ms. Taylor, Beal's president, said there are instances in which some minority firms simply sell their bonds back to the senior managers or to other dealers for a quick profit.
They refuse, she said, "to take a hit if the bonds drop in value."
Public officials, while loathe to condemn any minority-owned syndicate participants, agree that some, for various reasons, turn in a very uneven sales performance.
"It was initially a problem, because in many cases the minority- and women-owned firms were simply tacked onto the management team and were not given any role in selling the bonds," said Mr. Jackson, the Boston official. "There are probably cases where that still happens, but issuers have gotten more sophisticated. They are saying to the lead managers that you have to give the firms the opportunity to perform and demand that performance."
No one on the Street or in the halls of government seems to have any complaints about Beal's selling effort, however.
Mr. Jackson said he closely monitors how members of his city's selling groups perform and has been "especially impressed" by Beal.
J. Chester Johnson, president of Government Finance Associates, an independent financial advisor to state and local governments, said "They have come through and have moved bonds for a number of my clients. There are certain minority firms that I could not say that about."
Wall Streeters are quick to point out that do-nothing syndicate members come in all colors and sizes. "There are firms that perform and firms that don't perform, but that has nothing to do with race or gender," Mr. Hayden said.
Clearly, this is an issue that rankles Bernard Beal. He recalled getting a plea from a friend at a large underwriting firm who found herself ready to market a deal but with inadequate minority representation. She asked him to step in as a favor. He refused. "People would have said, 'Those guys just showed up and took a check for being black,' " he said. "We will not front for anybody."
As that reaction suggests, Mr. Beal projects a level of uncompromising aggressiveness considered intense even by Wall Street standards. His rivals say he occasionally rubs people the wrong way, although his friends say he is maturing along with his firm. Mr. Green of Lehman Brothers said, "The real measuring stick for a small firm is the relationships they have with the major firms and how wisely they make the trade-offs that involves. Bernard is growing at that."
A few competitors in the business complain, too, about Mr. Beal's "political connections," suggesting that his firm has benefited from his ties to newly powerful black politicians.
"Of course we try to target areas where one of us, usually Bernard, has a very, very good relationship," said Ms. Taylor. "But we still have to show something concrete. We're under more of a microscope, and we have to be sure that the people who hire us will never be embarrassed."
She cited a housing bond issue in Louisiana. "A minority firm doing a senior-managed deal in Louisiana -- that was a coup," she said. "But we had the expertise. All we needed was a chance to compete."
The key word, said Mr. Beal, is "compete." In an argument that echoes complaints of African-American conservatives like Judge Thomas about affirmative action, Mr. Beal rejects the idea that giving minority firms a chance ever justifies giving taxpayers less than the best deal.
"There's this notion that there's an extra cost to doing business with a minority firm," he said. "That simply is not true. In the deals where we've gotten to run the books, we've had the lowest costs. So I don't care why you hire me. You'll keep me because I'm the cheapest and you get great service and great ideas."
Government officials supporting the inclusion of minority firms agree. "It has never cost us an extra penny on any of our transactions to include minority- or female-owned firms on our managing team or in our selling group," said Bella Marshall, finance director for Detroit.
 
Small Successes
 But the real test for Bernard Beal will be pushing his firm into corporate finance, a world where neither political connections nor affirmative-action efforts are of much help.
His initial strategy, he said, was to expand his muni trading desk to handle corporate bond sales. Some of the institutional buyers of municipal bonds are also in the market for corporate bonds and he hopes that connection will help it win a small spot in a corporate bond syndicate.
"We just want to get into the syndicates," Mr. Beal said. "Let us sell a little piece of an issue, and then we'll work our way up."
There have been small corporate finance successes. Led by Alric B. Nembhard, a senior vice president, a Beal team handled a $10.7 million deal in June for a commercial real estate investor trying to finance three buildings that he had purchased from -- and then leased back to -- Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph in Denver. The issue was sold privately to a state pension fund.
In another deal expected in September, the borrower is a privately held Florida utility. "The credit crunch has been an incredible help to us in developing this niche," Mr. Nembhard said. "We can take private companies, new to the rating process and to the market, and teach them what the institutional financing market is all about. That can be a real eye-opener for someone used to dealing only with banks and insurance companies."
Beal intends to prospect for corporate clients among these small- to mid-sized companies. "We hope to fly in below the radar of the big firms," said Ms. Taylor. "None of the larger firms are interested in deals of $50 million or less."
The ultimate corporate finance goal for both Mr. Beal and Ms. Taylor is providing investment banking services to minority and female entrepreneurs, which they see as being underserved by Wall Street.
Mr. Beal sees this mission in an intensely personal light. "Part of the problem the Afro-American community has is that we are consumers, not producers," he said. "Access to capital is what we need to move our community the next step."
 
 
 
'Ms. Inside' Stretches Management Wings

 Most successful Wall Street firms have a "Mr. Outside" and a "Mr. Inside" -- one top executive who drums up new business and another who gets the deals done. So, too, at M.R. Beal & Company, though in this case it's "Ms. Inside."
Diana L. Taylor, president and a founding partner of Beal, is officially in charge of internal management and admininstration. But her colleagues describe her as "the glue" that helps to hold the fast-growing firm together.
A Dartmouth College graduate, Ms. Taylor has an M.B.A. from Columbia University. After stints at two other large Wall Street firms, she joined Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in 1984 and was a senior vice president when she left in 1988 to help found Beal.
Before joining Mr. Beal, she was as focused on generating new business as he was. So management does not come naturally to her. In fact, she said, "Management is something that Wall Street doesn't do very well. People on the marketing side have a time horizon of about 30 seconds, on a good day. On the investment banking side, the people who rise are good at doing deals. So management is really tough."
But at a minority firm, she said, "We feel we have to do a better job than everybody else. If there are one or two typographical errors in one of our proposals, people say, 'Oh, they can't spell.' Of course, big firms have typos all the time."
Ms. Taylor said she would have been attracted to Beal regardless of opportunities elsewhere. "The main difference between working here and working anywhere else is that nobody looks at anybody as a minority or a woman," she said.
One factor in her move was that the "glass ceiling" for women remains pretty much intact at the major Wall Street firms. "I don't see any real conversion experience going on yet," she said.

 
 
POOLING FUNDS TO MAKE A PAC
 As the power of minority politicians grows across the country, Bernard B. Beal, chairman of M.R. Beal & Company, thinks it is time for a change in how minority-owned investment firms handle the sensitive matter of political contributions to elected officials.
Most major Wall Street firms have individual political action committees (PAC's) that support local and national candidates. The Public Securities Association, the trade group for the municipal and government securities industry which has a small PAC of its own, insists that the disclosure of Wall Street's political gifts is sufficient to cope with the public suspicion that such gifts are part of a quid pro quo. But something more is needed, according to Mr. Beal.
"This is an issue that is going to rise up and bite us on the bottom if we don't do something about it," he said. "And it affects minority firms especially, because if you have to buy the business with political contributions, there is no way we can compete. We just don't have that kind of money."
His solution? He and a few other minority firms have formed a fledgling PAC, Afro-Americans for a Better America, to pool what funds are available. One advantage is that this approach gives black-owned firms a clearer voice on public policy issues, Mr. Beal said. Another is that it separates the gift-giving from the deal-making. "I want the decisions to be made by third parties," he said. "I want to be able to say to politicians, 'Hey, it's out of my hands. All our contributions are handled by the PAC.' "

Seidman Gets Ready to Leave the Headaches Behind 

 
For more than a year, L. William Seidman, the nation's top banking regulator, was under pressure from the White House and some in Congress to step down. They did not like the independent way he was managing the savings and loan bailout. Last week Mr. Seidman said he would resign, effective Oct. 16. "I'm now available for any kind of job that will pay a lot of money to do practically nothing," Mr. Seidman said. No wonder; as head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation since 1985, he has had to provide assessments of savings and loan losses, shore up the bank insurance fund, supervise the sale of thousands of properties, merge failing savings and loan institutions and rattle a $100 billion tin cup Congress was forced to fill. No successor has been named, but William Taylor, a senior banking regulator at the Federal Reserve Board, is considered likely to get the nod.
 
Stockholder Backlash
 
The Chrysler Corporation is a little like the Soviet Union -- big plans for the future, not much money. It lost $212 million last quarter and is now the No. 4 auto maker, just behind Honda. So it came as no surprise when Chrysler announced a plan last week to raise cash fast. It will sell 56 million new shares of stock at current prices for $792 million to tidy up its balance sheet. Chrysler hopes the cash will raise its credit rating back to superpower status. But the car company's current stockholders are grumbling. The new offering is equal to 20 percent of all outstanding shares and that means dilution -- tinier dividends, a shrinking price and a smaller share of the vote. "The only constituent whose ox gets gored is the poor common shareholder," said Charles T. Freeman, a portfolio fund manager at the Windsor Fund, a "poor" shareholder that controls 20.1 million shares.
 
Revealing B.C.C.I.'s Strategy
 
Now that the Bank of Credit and Commerce International has captured the world's attention and racked up a 12-count indictment for its alleged misdeeds (more are expected), it is interesting to find out how those bankers actually ran the bank. Last week one of them, Masihur Rahman, B.C.C.I.'s former chief financial officer, began the long process of explaining. Mr. Rahman told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that B.C.C.I. kept running even though it was insolvent. In 1985, he said, the bank lost $430 million. But it never told the regulators. Instead, it covered up the losses with cash from a B.C.C.I. affiliate in the Cayman Islands, called the International Credit and Investment Company. I.C.I.C. was a "bank within a bank," and it became the center of B.C.C.I.'s fraudulent operations. From 1985 on, "effectively the whole group was finished," said Mr. Rahman, who told the committee he fled London last week fearing for his life. He was threatened by bank officers, he said.
 
Chase Sells -- and Buys
 
At the Chase Manhattan Corporation, decades of financial diversification are being reversed. Chase said last week it would sell its leasing businesses in the United States and Canada for $2.2 billion. Why is it slimming down? To raise cash to buy two troubled savings banks in Connecticut -- Citytrust and Mechanics and Farmers Savings Bank. Together the two banks have assets nearly equal to those Chase is shedding.
 
Relief for Policyholders
 
When the Executive Life Insurance Company of California went under, policy and annuity holders feared the worst. But last week they got some cheering news. A French investment group headed by Credit Lyonnais -- the big state-owned bank -- wants to take over Executive Life. It proposes to inject $3 billion in the company and take over its "junk bond" portfolio. That would prevent a liquidation. The French investors would also guarantee that most of the company's policy and annuity holders would eventually receive at least 81 percent of the value of their investments. But corks are not popping just yet. There is also at least one other serious bid to be considered, said John Garamendi, California's Commissioner of Insurance.
 
The King Goes to Tokyo
 
If Elvis is ever sighted again, he could be singing in Japanese. That much was said in a speech last week by Jack Soden, executive director of the Graceland theme park division of Elvis Presley Enterprises Inc. in Memphis. Mr. Soden said the company was close to making a deal to build an $80 million park near Tokyo. The park would feature more than just the King and his guitar. It would recreate American life in the 1950's and 60's and feature exhibits about other prominent Americans like Marilyn Monroe and James Dean.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
A Nudge for the Recovery
 
Around the country economists have been murmuring among themselves that the recovery may stall. What will give it some oomph, they say, are lower interest rates. The Federal Reserve appears to be listening. Last week, it dropped the funds rate to 5 1/2 percent from 5 3/4 percent on news that the employment picture was worsening. That was the first drop since April. The funds rate is what the Fed and some other banks charge for overnight lending. But don't expect rates on credit cards or home mortgages to fall immediately. "I doubt that this latest Fed move will be enough to cause the banks to reduce the prime," said Irwin Kellner, chief economist at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. Cutting the funds rate is designed more to get capital flowing than to make it cheap. But getting capital flowing is exactly what the credit-crunched economy needs. On the news of lower rates, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 38.24 points but finished the week down 10.06 points at 2996.20.
 
Whipping Inflation
 
To the surprise of many economists, it looks as if inflation is finally being tamed. The Labor Department reported last week that the Producer Price Index -- which measures wholesale prices -- fell by 0.2 percent in July. That follows a 0.3 percent drop in June. Inflation was brought to its knees by the recession, analysts say. Shoppers stayed away from the stores and price plunged to lure them back. With the annual inflation rate at 4 percent or less, many economist think the Fed may be poised to drop interest rates even further.
 
Competing With the Economy
 
What's good for the individual is often bad for the economy, one economic maxim says. That seems to be the case now. Consumers are cutting back on borrowing. In June, according to the Federal Reserve, consumer borrowing fell by 3 percent, the sixth decline in seven months. But since consumers account for two-thirds of all economic activity, that new frugality comes at a price: slower growth.
 
Working Harder
 
Fewer people may be working, but those that do have been producing more. A lot more. According to the Commerce Department, the nation's productivity increased by 1.9 percent from April through June. That is a hefty jump in an important indicator that has been languishing for almost three years. Productivity, which is defined as output per worker, is an especially important indicator. When productivity climbs, wages can rise without cutting into profits.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Not Even a Slap
 
The slap most people were expecting seems to have completely missed the wrists of Japan's major securities houses. The firms admitted making bogus trades to pay back more than $1 billion that their major clients lost, but they were not penalized. The Ministry of Finance in Tokyo explained that no penalities would be imposed because the bogus trades took place in London, not Tokyo. According to Nobuhiko Matsuno, head of the ministry's securities bureau, the trades were also done over the counter, rather than on a recognized exchange. That made it impossible, the ministry claims, to determine if the trading took place at artificial prices. And the ministry also said that though Japanese laws prohibit a firm from promising to compensate a client for its losses, they do not expressly ban payments. In most countries it's the defense lawyers that look for loopholes. In this case, it seems that the Japanese Government has undertaken the search.
 
Polygram Buys a Hit Maker
 
Andrew Lloyd Weber, the powerhouse of Broadway and London's West End, has decided to share the limelight with Polygram N.V., the big Dutch record company. Mr. Weber, who created "Cats," "Phantom of the Opera" and "Starlight Express," among others musicals, is selling 30 percent of his company, Really Useful Holdings, to Polygram for $117 millionplus a payment in 1994 of $17 million. Polygram is also buying the option to acquire a majority of the company in 2003. Mr. Weber's hits have sold more than 10 million albums. The deal will help Mr. Weber repay debts of about $103 million.
 
More Go Jobless in Germany
 
Historically, Germany has always been nervous about two things: inflation and unemployment. Inflation is temporarily under control, but unemployment is rising. In eastern Germany, where the economy has all but collapsed, 1 million people, or 12.1 percent of the work force, are unemployed, according to the Federal Labor Office. The Economics Ministry in Bonn says the number of unemployed could rise 50 percent by the end of the year.

Making Designer Chips On a Desktop Setup

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif.

 BODY:
Computer chip manufacturing may conjure up visions of huge sterilized factories with workers toiling in white "bunny suits." But a growing number of engineers in the United States are now making integrated circuits on their own desks.
The do-it-yourself chips are known as field programmable logic devices, and they are proving to be important time savers for engineers designing computers, telephone switches, medical devices and other electronic equipment. Instead of waiting for a chip to come back from a factory, which can take weeks, engineers can produce chips in their offices or laboratories in a few minutes and try them out. If the chips don't work, the design can quickly be changed. 
 Such desktop silicon foundries, as they are sometimes called, promise to have as much impact on the semiconductor business as desktop publishing, using laser printers, has had on the printing business.
Field programmable chips have become perhaps the hottest products in the semiconductor business. The two San Jose companies that now lead in the business -- Xilinx Inc. and the Altera Corporation -- have grown right through the recession that is hurting most other chip companies.
"Our problem is we can't ship enough," said Rodney Smith, the chairman and chief executive of Altera. Both Xilinx and Altera will cross the $100 million sales mark this year, and their stock prices are near all-time highs. The Actel Corporation, a privately held concern in Sunnyvale, Calif., with 1990 revenues estimated at $20 million, is generally considered the No. 3 player.
But competition is heating up. Motorola Inc., the largest American semiconductor company, announced last month that it planned to get into the business. The Toshiba Corporation and other Japanese companies are also expected to enter what has been a preserve of American companies.
Several Silicon Valley startups are also taking aim at the market. They include the Quicklogic Corporation of Santa Clara, whose founders invented an early type of programmable chip, and Concurrent Logic Inc. of Sunnyvale. But entering the market might not be easy for everyone. Patents could keep out some companies. And some industry executives say the arena is already overcrowded. One vendor of programmable logic devices, International CMOS Technology, recently filed for bankruptcy protection, while another, Plus Logic, laid off half its employees and replaced its top management.
Programmable logic devices have been around since the 1970's. Among the pioneers in the field was Monolithic Memories, now part of Advanced Micro Devices, which remains a supplier. But devices sold by Xilinx, Altera and others can make more complex circuits than the early products.
Dataquest, a San Jose market-research company, estimates sales of all programmable logic devices will grow from the $828 million of 1990 to $2.2 billion in 1995. Most of the growth will be in the most complex devices, sales of which will grow from $270 million in 1990 to about $1.8 billion in 1995, a compound annual growth rate of close to 50 percent.
To produce a homemade chip, an engineer designs the circuit on a personal computer or engineering work station, usually using commercially available design software. In most systems, a blank chip is then inserted into a small box connected to the computer or work station, which programs the chip in a minute or two.
Different vendors use different technologies. In general, the blank chips, which are made in huge factories, come with logic elements set in an orderly pattern. The customization process involves connecting the logic elements into a particular arrangement.
In the Actel chip, for instance, logic elements are separated by a layer of insulation. Applying an electric charge at a particular point in effect melts the insulation, thus connecting the two elements. The company calls this technology antifuse because the jolt of electricity creates a connection instead of breaking a connection, as occurs in a fuse.
Equally important is the software that converts the engineer's design into the specific pattern of connections on the chip. It is the high software content of the business that vendors of field programmable chips hope will make it hard for others to enter the business. This software can sell for several thousand dollars. A blank chip itself costs anywhere from $1 to hundreds of dollars depending on complexity and on the technology used.
Companies that design electronic products like to make customized chips because it allows them to differentiate their products from their competitors'. Until the advent of the field programmable chips, companies wanting a customized chip used application-specific integrated circuits, or ASIC's, which are customized at a factory. The ASIC provider works with the customer to design the chip, and then it manufactures the chips to order.
But designing an ASIC can cost $25,000, and getting the chips back from the factory can take six weeks. If the chip has a mistake, getting a new one will take another six weeks.
The desktop foundries are far quicker and cheaper for producing a small number of chips. But just as a printing press produces better output than a laser printer, an ASIC factory can produce far more sophisticated chips than a desktop foundry and the chips operate faster.
For large volumes of chips -- say, more than 10,000 -- it is cheaper to use a factory, just as it is cheaper to use a printing press instead of a laser printer to print thousands of copies of a document. For that reason, some companies use field programmable chips only to produce prototypes and then use factory-produced chips in the final product.
Still, companies are willing to put up with the higher costs of field programmable chips because getting something to market quickly is crucial in an industry in which products can become obsolete in as little as a year. "Xilinx wouldn't exist if we didn't reduce time to market," said G. Wesley Patterson, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Xilinx.
Apple Computer used two Xilinx chips in prototypes of a laser printer it introduced in March. The chips performed such functions as communicating with the Macintosh and controlling memory. The Xilinx chips gave Apple "the ability to try out designs and test out designs quickly" and shaved about six months off product development time, said Rob Briody, senior engineer at Apple. Nevertheless, Apple used factory-produced chips in the final product because those chips cost less than $10 per printer compared with $80 for the two Xilinx chips.
Some field programmable chips can be changed even after they are inside the finished product. That allows electronic equipment to alter its own circuitry to suit a given task. Radius Inc. of San Jose makes a computer screen that can tilt on its side, allowing the user to have either a tall narrow screen or a low wide one. A Xilinx chip reconfigures the internal circuitry as the screen is tilted.
In the future, a scientist needing to solve a particular problem might rewire the circuitry inside a computer containing chips with such flexibility as to make it particularly fast at that problem.

HEADLINE: All About/Air-Conditioners;
When Manufacturers Must Depend On the Miseries of Summer

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
On a blistering summer day, with suffocating humidity and urban tempers on knife's edge, any city can be New York -- hell, with an attitude. Among the small brotherhood of companies that make and sell air-conditioners, however, heat is bliss.
Three days of hazy, hot and humid weather, so an industry rule of thumb goes, means sales, sales, sales. Only when summer lashes back with mild temperatures does this industry, with an estimated $1.2 billion in wholesale revenues, mop its brow. "Unfavorably cool," as one company spokeswoman terms the miserable condition. 
 The industry is prisoner to more than the weather. Production overcapacity, the resulting wave of consolidation and looming changes in Federal energy-efficiency standards mean big changes for the industry, where a few companies -- nine, to be exact -- account for 99 percent of all unit sales.
The upshot for consumers is that air-conditioners are bound to get more expensive, perhaps significantly, because making units thinner, lighter and less ravenous for electricity will mean retooling of plants and changes in methods of manufacture.

 
 
The Geography
Central Air Sells In the Sun Belt
 Air-conditioners are sold in two basic configurations. Room air-conditioners fit snugly into windows and are typically used to cool apartments. Central air-conditioning systems -- huge affairs with elaborate air ducts into each room -- have most of their apparatus outdoors and are used to cool entire houses and apartment buildings.
In the regions of the United States where it is hotter longer, the Sun Belt states stretching from the Carolinas to California, central systems prevail. A big system there may be cheaper and more energy-efficient in the long run. In a place like Corpus Christi, Tex., for example, an air-conditioner typically runs more than 2,000 hours a year, or nearly three months of 24-hour use, according to the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, a trade association.
By contrast, the Snow Belt states of the Midwest and Northeast favor smaller room units, which may be more energy-efficient, despite their smaller size. In New York, for example, the typical air-conditioner operates about 450 hours a year, or only 19 days of round-the-clock use.
Half of the room units are bought by cool customers who have done comparison shopping. The other half are bought by sleep-deprived consumers panting from humid nights without an air-conditioner.
The problem for the industry is that demand during a heat wave overheats and retailers order too many units. The air-conditioners then have to be liquidated at a discount or held until the next summer.

 
 
After Consolidation
Nine Players Get Most of the Sales
 Draw a diagonal line between Minneapolis and Atlanta, slicing off about a quarter of the country, and 70 percent of all room air-conditioners are sold to the right of that line, mainly in the cities of the Northeast.
Which brings us to Peapack, N.J., the eastern end of that Snow Belt slice and home of the Fedders Corporation, the nation's biggest maker of air-conditioners. Fedders had revenues of $186 million in the first half of 1991, down 14 percent from the same period a year ago.
In 1990, Fedders had a market share of 30 percent, according to Appliance magazine. That includes the January 1991 acquisition of Emerson Quiet Kool for $56 million.
The industry has been consolidating for years, to the point where three companies -- Fedders, Electrolux A.B. and Whirlpool -- account for more than two-thirds of unit sales. Six more companies account for nearly all of the remainder.
In 1990, the industry shipped 4.2 million room air-conditioners, far from its recent peak of 5.1 million units in 1989, according to the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers. But shipments in the first six months of this year -- due to the recession and retailer reluctance to reorder -- have plunged by one-third, to 2.4 million air-conditioners.
Industry executives believe core demand for air-conditioners -- mainly replacement sales -- is 3.5 million units, leaving an overcapacity of 1.5 million units to be wrung out through more mergers and plant closures.
The remaining companies will be bigger, more efficient and run their plants at higher capacity. Or so the theory goes. Fedders makes the most important parts of the air-conditioner in its own plants, rather than in the Far East as many other makers do. Japan, which produces more air-conditioners and more innovations than any other country, still sells primarily in Asia.
But even Fedders is suffering. Profit in the first half plunged nearly 75 percent to $4.1 million.
Salespeople often think air-conditioners sell themselves. They ask consumers rote questions about cooling capacity, size of room, the maximum price they want to pay and little else.
But not at Tops Appliance City, a four-store New Jersey chain. Tops sells as much as $1 million worth of air-conditioners on a hot day and trains its sales staff thoroughly. It sells air-conditioners en masse -- 75 units on a selling floor the size of a small house.
But unlike TV's, whose screens are plain to see, consumers cannot compare air-conditioners. Investigating cooling capacity, noise and fan efficiency would take special, and costly, insulated rooms.

 
 
Designs for the Future
Expect Smaller, Thinner and Quieter
 Like refrigerators, air-conditioners pump heat out of one place and into another. A refrigerant gas, usually some form of chlorofluorocarbons, is compressed by a pump, and then conveyed to a condenser, where it is pressurized, cooled and turned into a liquid.
The liquid is then allowed to expand and return to a gaseous state. As that happens, the refrigerant absorbs heat, or boils. The gas is then compressed again and the cycle continues. An air-conditioner is simply a refrigerator with the door open.
There are, of course, necessary fillips. An air-conditioner cools the entire room, not to a temperature just above 32 degrees, or freezing, but to about 78 degrees, or "room" temperature. A fan sucks warm air from the room into an evaporator coil, where the air is cooled and returned to the room. The heat leaves the outdoor side of the unit, which is why it must be set in a window or wall.
Innovations on this basic design continue. Fedders is introducing later this year its "Micro Sonic." Using more efficient components, it is designed to be smaller, thinner and quieter than other units with about the same energy efficiency ratings. Panasonic, a unit of Matsushita, has come up with a pudgy, upside-down "L" design that is quieter, too. It keeps most of the window-shaking parts outside and below the window.
But real innovation may have to wait until next spring when the Department of Energy comes up with proposals for more stringent energy standards. A 1987 Federal law mandates tougher standards, wringing more performance from less electricity, for most home appliances, including air-conditioners.
"Things are going to get tougher and tougher," said Russell G. Patterson, director of home comfort product marketing at Electrolux A.B. "Stay tuned."

 
 
COOL AIR, JAPANESE-STYLE

At nearly $5,000, the Sanyo Fisher (USA) Corporation's "Tri Zone" may well be the world's most expensive room air-conditioner. It is expensive because the design is radically different.
Instead of a bulky, window-rattling box the size of a large microwave oven, the Tri Zone offers discreet "indoor evaporator units" about the size of, say, a desk blotter. The air-conditioner does not poke out of a window either. The evaporator, or blower, unit cools the room and can hang snugly on a wall.
Like central air-conditioning, the noisiest components of the system are outside the building. But instead of tearing expensive metal pathways, or ducts, through the building, the evaporator units are connected to the outside through 3.5-inch squared hoses that trail through the house to wherever the units are placed. That is why the system is called, inelegantly, ductless cooling.
The American approach is to cool the entire house while Japanese manufacturers have long favored cooling individual rooms. Central air-conditioning systems strike some Japanese as a waste of energy.
"This is a very Japanese approach to air-conditioning," said David Claus, a spokesman for Sanyo Fisher.
But it may not be American, at least not yet. Sanyo has sold only 65,000 of the units recently, compared with the hundreds of thousands of conventional air-conditioners sold by American manufacturers.

HEADLINE: Managing;
When Employees Choose a Charity

SERIES: Second of two articles on corporate philanthropy.

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
Every month, the 22 employees on the Adolph Coors Company's Vice Squad -- the wonderfully pronounceable acronym for Volunteers in Community Enrichment Squad -- decide which projects the Golden, Colo., brewery will support. The projects vary from cleaning up a weed-choked lot to providing shoes for needy children to doing repairs on an elderly person's home. But each is proposed, managed and staffed by Coors employees or retirees.
"Letting employees pick and run projects challenges them and shows them respect," said Rosa M. Bunn, Coors's director of economic and public enrichment. 
 Coors is among a growing number of companies to use charitable programs in lieu of lavish raises and limitless promotions to garner employee loyalty. If, at the same time, it can support programs that help educate the current and future work force, so much the better.
These companies are going well beyond matching-gift programs. Some match volunteer time with money and train employees to manage nonprofit projects. Others sponsor programs -- say, local day care centers -- that benefit their employees directly. And quite a few are bolstering educational programs that feed into their industry's needs.
The upshot is that the line between the giving function and the personnel function has blurred. "There is no question that human resources and philanthropy influence each other here," said Mary Beth Salerno, vice president of the American Express Company's domestic giving program, which supports many educational programs.
At the International Business Machines Corporation, the human resources people suggested donating money to causes that I.B.M. employees, retirees or their spouses support with their time. "They understand that supporting charitable work can enhance productivity and retention," said Juan Sabater, director of corporate social policy.
The trend to involve employees in contributions decisions is a boon to local charities that otherwise would have little clout with corporate giving functions. It helps regional theater groups, art museums and other cul- tural groups that women, an increasingly powerful segment of the work force, tend to favor for sponsorship over sporting events.
And it is giving a lift to charities that are not part of United Way. Several companies now allow the American Cancer Society, the Black United Fund and others to mount workplace campaigns. "Our members are gettng into the workplace at the request of the employees," said Robert O. Bothwell, executive director of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, a Washington group of non-United Way charities.
The melding of personnel and philanthropic goals is particularly noticeable in aid to education. The General Electric Foundation, for one, subsidizes university programs that train engineers. And it encourages employees and retirees to teach in high schools. "We've found that G.E.'s local people really want to participate," said Clifford V. Smith Jr., the foundation's president.
Foundations are bound by tax law to eschew projects that benefit their corporate sponsors directly. Corporate giving offices are not so constrained. That is why Citibank's contributions group was able to start a program at a Brooklyn high school that aims to generate bank employees through various work-study arrangements. It does do foundation-like aid as well, such as giving money to black colleges, and to programs that train minority faculty. "We choose projects that teach skills that we need, and that can develop our future work force," said Paul M. Ostergard, Citibank's director of corporate contributions.
Occasionally, the links between philanthropic programs and human resources aims emerge after the fact.
The contributions people at Mervyn's and Target, two department store chains owned by the Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corporation, have for several years been operating Family-to-Family, a program that trains local day care providers. Only lately have Dayton-Hudson's human resources people joined in the project. "They finally realized that employees have the same needs as customers," said Cynthia Mayeda, The Dayton Hudson Foundation's chair.

HEADLINE: The Problems of Scarce Capital

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Madis Senner astutely describes some likely effects of scarcer capital on the global economy ("The Grim Shortage of Global Capital," July 28). However, the obvious source of the capital shortage is insufficient saving at prevailing interest rates. The issue is how to increase saving or reduce consumption. The United States, he suggests, should "address the budget deficit." However, improved fiscal balance requires lower government spending (unlikely) or higher taxes -- and this more probable route would reduce the private sector's ability to save. 
 Using internal financing in Germany would have a similar effect on private saving. And asset inflation in Japan is just one result of the Bank of Japan's easy-money environment of the late 1980's. Restrictive monetary policy is the appropriate response to what is fundamentally rooted in excessive monetary growth.
Yes, the supply of capital is shrinking just when the world needs it most. But economists and policy makers must resist the temptation to precipitously implement "solutions" to a problem that is poorly understood.

HEADLINE: HAITIANS EXPELLED BY SANTO DOMINGO

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BON REPOS, Haiti

 BODY:
The Dominican Republic has expelled thousands of Haitian sugar plantation workers in recent weeks, inflaming long-latent enmities and suspicions in the two countries that share a single Caribbean island.
The Haitian authorities say that more than 10,000 people have been forced to return to this poor and densely populated country since mid-June, among them many who left Haiti so long ago that they no longer have homes or close relatives here. 
 Officials in Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital, say the blame belongs to the new Haitian leadership, which lent its voice to the outcry by human rights organizations over the recruitment of Haitian cane cutters and their treatment in the Dominican sugar fields. The Haitians would have done better to press their complaints through quieter diplomacy, the Dominicans say.
Many Haitians view the expulsions as an effort by the Dominican Government to arouse racial and nationalistic passions as a distraction from its difficulties with striking labor unions, high unemployment, steep inflation and failing public services.
 
A Painful Separation
 For those expelled, including many of Haitian extraction who were born in the Dominican Republic or have spent most of their adult lives there, the crisis has meant painful separation from relatives and a bewildering return to a country they hardly know.
"They didn't tell us anything," said Hermanis Francois in Spanish, the language he speaks best, as he squatted on the ground at the Haitian repatriation center here with his wife and their few possessions at his side. The grizzled, 50-year-old man, who left Haiti 34 years ago to cut sugar cane, said that one day recently "the Dominicans just rounded us up and carted us off."
"Everything we owned was left behind."
Mireille Sam, director of the Bon Repos center, which has temporarily housed and fed more than 3,200 of the uprooted Haitians, said, "Many of these people were just brought to the border and dropped off, told to get out and left to their own devices." She added that after short stays at the center, because of Haiti's limited means, the refugees are sent off to uncertain new lives in the squalor of the Port-au-Prince slums or to the countryside.
 
Under Sharp Attack
 In recent years, the Dominican Government has come under sharp attack by human rights groups condemning what they assert is the state-owned sugar industry's widespread use of child labor, low salaries, restricted freedom of movement and deceptive recruitment drives of Haitians often resembling outright abduction.
Facing punitive trade sanctions over the issue in the United States Congress, Dominican officials have aggressively rebutted the assertions.
Shortly after the newly elected Haitian Government of the left-leaning Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide began echoing comparisons by human rights groups of the working conditions of Haitians in the Dominican sugar industry with those of slavery, however, the deeply conservative 84-year-old Dominican President, Joaquin Balaguer, already wary of his neighbor, responded angrily by ordering the expulsion of Haitian plantation workers under the age of 16 and over 60.
While Mr. Balaguer seemed genuinely offended, some Dominican observers say the President's expulsion order was not made without domestic political calculations.
 
Sentiments Running High
 "The President has tapped into the historical struggle between the two countries, indirectly promoting the old feeling that those guys over there are inferior, yet they want to dominate us," said a Dominican academic, requesting anonymity. "At the same time, Balaguer is saying to the Haitians, 'Wait a minute, if you pressure me, I'll drop a lot of people on your hands and cause you some real problems.' "
With sentiments running high, human rights monitors say, predominantly Haitian neighborhoods in the Dominican Republic, rather than the sugar estates, soon became the focus of surprise raids by police officers and soldiers, whose actions they assert quickly exceeded the bounds of the President's expulsion decree.
"It seems from the pattern I have seen that they have been focusing on the Haitians who are best established, and this has included people of all ages," said Sarah DeCosse, an observer with the New York-based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.

HEADLINE: Optimism Is Disappearing For a Solid Recovery Soon

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The economic recovery that had been widely expected since late spring now seems much less certain, raising the likelihood that a strong rebound in hiring, wages and retail sales will not occur before the fall, at the earliest.
Many economists have reached that conclusion in recent days after confronting statistics and surveys that measure the economy's recent performance. Economic conditions have clearly improved since the spring, the data show, but the progress toward recovery seems to have temporarily halted. 
 "We are going to live for a while in a situation in which it is hard to discern good times," said James P. Smith, a senior economist at the Rand Corporation.
For Mr. Smith and others, the issue is not whether the United States is recovering from recession; it surely will, he says. "The real question is whether our incomes are going to grow at a faster rate than inflation," he said. "If not, or if the gain is only 1 percent a year, who wants to wait 20 years to feel better?"
 
Apprehension About Jobs
 The public is clearly uneasy about the direction of the economy, according to the University of Michigan's monthly surveys of consumer attitudes. The surveys show Americans apprehensive about their lagging incomes, the banking crisis, the cutbacks in public services by states and municipalities and the security of their jobs. All of those concerns are likely to be exacerbated if little new wealth is added to the economy in the next one or two years.
"It is not that people fear that the unemployment rate will rise more," said Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan surveys. "It is that they don't expect many people on layoff to be recalled or new jobs to open up."
The unemployment rate was 6.8 percent last month, compared with 5.4 percent in July 1990, the first month of the recession.
The Bush Administration and many forecasters had interpreted an upturn in industrial production and in the sale of cars, appliances and homes that began in May as a sign that a robust recovery might have begun. Since July, sales of many items have tended to level off, and two events in the last 10 days suggest the recovery could be in trouble.
 
51,000 Jobs Disappear
 The first was a Labor Department report, released on Aug. 2, showing that 51,000 jobs had disappeared in July; it was the third time in four months that layoffs reduced the number of job holders. Then, on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to stimulate borrowing and the economic activity that lending makes possible. The action was a tacit acknowledgment that the robust recovery Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, had been expecting in mid-July has not yet materialized.
In case anyone missed the point, the Federal Reserve released on Wednesday a survey of regional business conditions that characterized the recovery as slow and unevenly distributed across the nation. A similar regional survey, published in June, had been more optimistic. The Midwest and the Southwest, while in recession, show more strength than the hard-hit Northeast and other states on the East and West coasts.
 
Politics of a Weak Recovery
 A weak recovery, running into the 1992 Presidential election year, would work against President Bush in his bid for re-election. Administration officials applauded the Federal Reserve's decision last week to reduce a key short-term interest rate. They have been pushing for more more economic growth than the Federal Reserve considers to be possible and this issue is undoubtedly discussed by Mr. Greenspan and Michael Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, in their frequent contacts with each other.
Still the task of reawakening the economy is more difficult than usual, many economists say, because this ninth recovery from recession since World War II has some unprecedented aspects that could delay an upturn. The numerous bank failures, the cutbacks in credit and the collapse of commercial building construction -- unknown since the Depression -- are, by any account, dragging down the nation in ways economists say they cannot easily quantify.
Employment trends are also a puzzle for Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate is not rising because so few people are entering the labor force to seek jobs, she notes. The smaller number of young people now coming of working age in the post-baby boom generation is only part of the explanation.
 
Fewer Women Go to Work
 For some reason -- perhaps the recession itself or the stagnant wage growth of recent years -- the percentage of American women entering the labor force has stopped rising and teen-agers are dropping out. Among the nation's 16- to 19-year-olds, only 50 percent are holding or seeking jobs, the lowest level in 20 years. The percentage stood at 52.5 percent a year earlier.
Mrs. Norwood says the decline has come partly because the service companies that hire young people -- in particular, retail stores and restaurants -- are reducing their work forces to cut costs and become more efficient.
"Looking at the numbers, I don't see any strong growth in employment," Mrs. Norwood added. "It is good that we are not going down any further, but I don't see growth."
Nevertheless, the economy did hit "some sort of a bottom in April or May," said Robert Hall of Stanford University, who is also chairman of the Business Cycle Dating Committee, a group of prominent economists who set for the record books the dates when recessions begin and end. The committee fixed July 1990 as the start of the current recession, but Professor Hall shrinks from suggesting that April or May of this year will turn out to be its end.
 
No Telling Where the Bottom Lies
 "We are by no means prepared to say that April or May was the trough," he said. "If the economy turned down again, and fell lower, that lower period would become the trough."
What puzzles Professor Hall is a trend that appeared early last year, before the economic and political shock of the Persian Gulf crisis. Consumer spending, as a percent of personal income, fell below the postwar norm and has not moved back up, he said. If personal income were to rise -- and the improvement this year has been meager -- consumption might not rise with it, Professor Hall says.
"There is this unknown element in consumption that we have to feel properly humble about," he said.
A rebound in consumption is the great hope of kicking off a strong recovery. More consumption -- of cars, appliances, clothing and many other products -- means rising production, more jobs and higher incomes, which can be spent on more consumption. Or it can be saved, to be indirectly invested in machinery, roads, public works, factories and the like.
 
Absence of Coordination
 "There is not today that growing coordination among the parts that is the essence of recoveries from recession, and there is not that sense of a recovery spreading," said Albert T. Sommers, a senior economist at the Conference Board, a business research organization.
Whatever the obstacles to spreading recovery, the 52 prominent forecasters surveyed each month by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, of Sedona, Ariz., had some second thoughts in their forecasts in the August survey, released yesterday. In the July survey, 20 had raised their forecasts of economic growth in 1991 while only 5 had reduced their estimates. But in August, this was reversed: 22 forecasters made downward revisions, while only 14 raised their estimates.
"They are back-tracking on the modest economic growth that they had been predicting," said Robert Eggert, publisher of the monthly survey. "They are back-tracking from modest growth to less than modest growth, but not another dip into recession."

HEADLINE: Even Weicker Can't Overshadow Budget-Fallout Concerns

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Ct. Aug. 9

 BODY:
Reporters and lobbyists crowded around a television in the Capitol on Wednesday to watch the speech in which Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. would say whether he was signing or vetoing the third budget passed by the Legislature. Suddenly the screen was blacked out, then almost entirely filled by a broad back as someone stepped right in front of the television camera in the Governor's office.
It was Mr. Weicker, so large that he seemed to take up all of the space in his office. 
 Minutes later, Mr. Weicker had added to his larger-than-life reputation with his third budget veto, standing against the politics of business as usual. Nearly six weeks into its fiscal year, Connecticut remained without a budget, but he had kept alive his hopes of achieving one that would help pull the state out of recession and deficit, with an income tax if need be.
But the continued budget battle also renewed questions about how Connecticut reached this point, and how Mr. Weicker's term as an Independent governor, and the legislative process itself, might be affected by the outcome.
 
For Some, No Looking Ahead
 For the Governor and his staff, still deep in the delicate task of trying to convert Democrats and Republicans from their anti-income-tax faith, it is premature to look beyond the budget. It is clear enough that a victory would help, and that a loss, or a budget that did not resolve the state's fiscal problems, would hurt. "It's way, way too early," said his press secretary, Avice Meehan.
Others, though, are already asking what lessons can be learned, and what scars might remain, from this test of wills.
"Anyone who's in public life has given some thought to the long-term effect of this deadlock on the state and the political future, or lack thereof, of the various players," said John F. Droney Jr., the Democratic state chairman, whose party has split over the income-tax issue.
For many people, the budget debate has been a brush-up course on the political and economic diversity of this small state, from wealthy Fairfield County, with its hint of a New York accent and desire to reduce the state's high tax on investment income, to rural eastern Connecticut, with the beginnings of a Rhode Island twang and envy of its neighbor's lower sales tax.
 
Political Lessons
 It has also been a civics lesson, as Mr. Weicker, whose third-party campaign attacked politics and politicians, has had to build a working coalition from scratch, without a single member of his own party. Party leaders and political scientists look back to the election, which Mr. Weicker won with 41 percent of the vote by campaigning, after 18 years in the Senate, as an anti-politician independent.
Sarah Morehouse, a professor of political science at the University of Connecticut, said Mr. Weicker began his term without the natural coalition of supporters that officeholders assemble in winning their party's nomination and campaigning together. Normally, Professor Morehouse said, "the governor will have people who are bound to him, who have followed him through the electoral process, and there's been some mutual give and take."
Mr. Weicker, she said, "belittled and maligned the parties during the election, and he may have thought that was the reason he was elected."
"That to my mind was not the way to start building a coalition for a very forward program," she said.
 
Breaking the Rules
 Mr. Droney and his Republican counterpart, Representative Richard Foley Jr. of Oxford, also return to the election. Mr. Weicker was the victor, they said, and by the rules of politics it was up to him, and necessary for him, to reach out and start building a consensus. Instead, he continued appealing to the public and attacking the parties.
"Weicker has demonized political parties and political leaders, but they have existed in this country for hundreds of years for good reasons," Mr. Droney said. "One reason is the ability to coalesce votes around an idea and promote it until it becomes law."
Mr. Foley, whose party Mr. Weicker deserted for his run for governor, also criticized him for not reaching out. But Mr. Foley did not think the rest of Mr. Weicker's term would be as brutal as the budget battle.
"Time is the great healer in politics," he said, predicting that coalitions of Democrats and Republicans would continue to shift on various issues, in support of Mr. Weicker and against him, during his remaining three years.
Morton J. Tenzer, an associate professor of political science at the University of Connecticut, gave Mr. Weicker good marks despite his own doubts last November about how an Independent governor would fare.
 
Support for Approach
 With a party behind him, Professor Tenzer said, Mr. Weicker probably would have won an income tax by now. But he thought the process worked well up until the budget impasse. And unlike many people, including Mr. Droney and Mr. Foley, who accuse the Governor of arrogance, he said, "I don't think his personality has been harmful."
"Some people have complained he hasn't compromised," he said, "but that's because they want him to give up."
Mr. Foley said the budget process may have been permanently affected by the Legislature breaking the taboo of starting a fiscal year without a budget, which he said is likely to be repeated.
"I truly don't believe it will ever go this far again in my lifetime," he said. "But it does make individuals involved in the process less likely to reach an agreement, meaning you have to exert more leverage or leave more on the table."
Mr. Tenzer thinks the Democratic Party is also at risk, because of the depth of feelings in the split between the conservatives who represent the state party's tradition, and liberals who advocate an income tax.
The budget debate has shown the party's conservative leaders to be outnumbered in their own caucuses. "What might happen now," he said, "is that the liberal Democratic majorities in the caucus might eventually seize control of the party."
But the electoral implications of that are serious. The party's candidate last year, Bruce A. Morrison, was from the liberal side, and he finished with barely 20 percent of the vote.
Mr. Droney, who has battled some of his local party chairmen who favor an income tax, played down the split's significance. "There have always been strongly income-tax people," he said, "who have made no bones about it."

HEADLINE: Kenyan Corruption Is Aired in Death Inquiry

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Aug. 10

 BODY:
A long judicial inquiry into the killing of a popular Foreign Minister last year has brought into the open allegations of corrupt practices by Kenya's second most powerful politician and an account of his stormy relationship with the slain official.
While the damaging testimony about Energy Minister Nicholas Biwott has come from a hardly impartial source -- a sister of the slain minister -- the fact that the charges have been allowed to be publicly aired and reported in Kenya's tighly controlled press suggests that President Daniel arap Moi is seeking to limit the political damage that Mr. Biwott's behavior is causing to his Government. 
 Mr. Biwott, who has yet to comment publicly on the allegations, has long been one of Mr. Moi's closest political associates, and international financial experts say he has amassed a large fortune from foreign investments and other dealings abroad.
It is those kinds of dealings that were at the center of the corruption charges leveled this week at the long-running inquiry into the death of Foreign Minister Robert Ouko, whose partly burned body was found about four miles from his home in western Kenya in February 1990, shortly after he returned from a trip to the United States. Mr. Ouko, who was considered an articulate and effective spokesman for Kenya abroad, had been shot through the head.
The allegations by Mr. Ouko's sister, Dorothy Randiak, that Mr. Biwott had demanded a share in a foreign venture as a condition for letting the project proceed seemed to shed some light on why Kenya, like many other African countries, has had trouble attracting investment.
Mrs. Randiak testified that the Foreign Minister had described Mr. Biwott and corruption as synonymous. She said Mr. Ouko had told her that his criticism of Kenyan corruption "had earned him enemies," and that he considered Mr. Biwott to be "dangerous." Mrs. Randiak said the two men had quarreled during an official trip to Washington because Mr. Biwott envied the special security arrangements granted to Mr. Ouko.
Offering an example of what she said was corruption, she testified that Mr. Biwott had demanded an interest in a molasses plant that an Italian company was thinking of opening in Kisumu in western Kenya, the home constituency of Mr. Ouko. Mrs. Randiak said her brother told her that Mr. Biwott's demands had thwarted the project because the company refused to comply.
"Dr. Ouko was complaining that this was giving Kenya a bad image in the Western world on the one hand, and that it was also making his work of formulating foreign policy very difficult," she said.
The nature of the allegations against Mr. Biwott did not surprise Kenyans. What did raise eyebrows was that Mrs. Randiak was allowed to present her accusations despite objections from the Energy Minister's lawyers.
Some people were also startled by the prominent display of her testimony on front pages of the three daily newspapers, including the Kenya Times, which is owned by the governing party.
Stories that the Government deems contrary to its interests are often suppressed through telephone calls from the President's office.
Mr. Biwott's friendship with President Moi goes back to the 1950's, when Mr. Biwott helped Mr. Moi in his first campaign for a parliamentary seat. Both men are from the same tribe, the Kalengin, a pastoral people based in the Rift Valley. Now Kenyans are wondering if Mr. Moi is hearing complaints from the Kalengin people about Mr. Biwott's practices, and is finding his friend an embarrassment.
Mr. Biwott's financial dealings have been publicly discussed on one previous occasion, during a debate earlier this year in Parliament on a bill imposing a new tax on foreign oil companies.
The tax revenue was to go into a fund at the Energy Ministry that would be personally administered by Mr. Biwott. Some members of Parliament said that such an arrangement was like giving Mr. Biwott a blank check. But the debate was cut off, and the parliamentary bill was approved unanimously.

HEADLINE: New York Leads Big Cities in Robbery Rate, but Drops in Murders

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
New York City led the nation's 25 largest cities in robberies last year, claiming the dubious distinction for the second straight year at a time when reports of violent crime were surging across America, an analysis of data released today by Federal officials indicates.
In a city where crime has become a dominant theme of private and political discourse, a record 100,280 robberies were reported to the police last year -- 13.7 for every 1,000 residents, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's annual Uniform Crime Reports for 1990. 
 But despite a record 2,262 homicides last year, New York City dropped from ninth to 10th in murders per capita, and its homicide rate was only slightly higher than the average for the country's 25 largest cities, an analysis of the Federal data by The New York Times showed.
New York City had 30.9 murders for every 100,000 residents, just above the big-city average of 29.2, and would have ranked 11th, behind Chicago, but for the 87 deaths in the Happy Land social club fire, The Times analysis showed.
 
Five-Year Trends
 Using 1990 census data and Federal and local crime statistics, the analysis calculated and ranked the per capita robbery and murder rates for the nation's 25 largest cities over the last five years, and ranked robbery and murder rates for New York's five boroughs for 1990.
Tracking the five-year trends, New York's robbery rate turned down in 1986, but has been rising steadily since and passed previously top-ranked Detroit in 1988, the analysis showed. New York's murder rate has shown a steady though gradual rise since 1986, but has been lower than those for Washington, New Orleans, Detroit, Dallas and Baltimore.
Within New York City, The Times analysis showed, the Bronx had the highest murder rate, with 54.2 homicides for every 100,000 residents, followed by Manhattan with 33.8, Brooklyn with 33.3, Queens with 16 and Staten Island with 7.7.
But Manhattan was found to lead New York's boroughs in its rate of reported robberies last year, with 18.1 for every 1,000 residents, followed by 15.8 for Brooklyn, 14.8 for the Bronx, 9.3 for Queens and 2.7 for Staten Island.
In the nation, Washington, continuing a five-year climb, recorded the highest murder rate among major cities in 1990, with 77.8 killings for every 100,000 residents. The nation's capital was followed by New Orleans, Detroit, Dallas, Baltimore, Houston, Cleveland, Memphis, Philadelphia and New York.
 
Worst Robbery Rates
 The major cities with the highest robbery rates after New York were Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, New Orleans, Washington, Dallas, Boston, Los Angeles and, tied for 10th, Cleveland and San Francisco. All but the last two exceeded the average rate for the 25 largest cities -- 9.7 robberies for every 1,000 residents.
The F.B.I.'s Uniform Crime Reports for 1990, a 365-page compendium titled "Crime in the United States," was issued by the bureau's Director, William S. Sessions. Its voluminous data are based on crimes reported to 16,000 law-enforcement agencies and the report is regarded as the nation's most comprehensive survey of criminal activity and trends.
Across the nation, the report said, overall violent crime increased 11 percent last year over 1989, with homicides and forcible rape each up 9 percent and robbery and aggravated assault each up 11 percent. In other categories, burglaries decreased 3 percent, auto theft rose 5 percent, larceny was up 1 percent and arson rose 3 percent.
The report said that firearms were used in 3 of every 5 murders in the United States, that 78 percent of the victims were men and that only 14 percent of the victims were murdered by strangers.
 
Most Women Killed by Men
 It also said that, in situations with a single victim and a single offender, 93 percent of the black murder victims were killed by blacks and that 86 percent of the white victims were slain by whites. While 85 percent of the men were killed by other men, it said, 9 out of every 10 women were slain by men.
Experts have cited many factors, including surges in drug use and drug disputes, for the rising homicide rates. Thomas A. Reppetto, a criminologist who heads the Citizens Crime Commission of New York, a private organization that analyzes criminal justice issues, said one explanation for New York City's high robbery rate lay in the way people get around.
"This is less of an auto town than other places," he said in an interview. "People take subways and other public transportation. They walk a lot. They are much more vulnerable to robbery than people who ride around enclosed in iron boxes."
The F.B.I. report said some of the complex factors that accounted for crime rates included the density, composition and stability of populations; modes of transportation; economic and cultural conditions; climate; the effective strength of law-enforcement agencies; attitudes of citizens, and the policies of government.

HEADLINE: Canadian Seeks 3d Term Amid Drop in Polls

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, after months of disappointing economic news and declining support in the polls, came to Canada's most populous city this week to fire up his party's faithful and open a campaign for a third five-year term as the national leader.
Yet against the fanfare of his Progressive Conservative Party's convention, the last one before it must face voters within two years, another drama was playing outsidethe hall where protesters were making their own pitch -- to dump the Mr. Mulroney. 
 The conflicts on the shores of Lake Ontario touched the issues that are likely to dominate a new national campaign from Vancouver to the Maritimes -- unemployment, free trade, privatization, taxes, high interest rates, deficit spending and national unity.
At one point the police had to intervene to keep unemployed construction workers away from the Tory delegates after one of the delegates had taunted the workers: "Why don't you get a job?"
High interest rates have cut construction activity in Canada, and construction unemployment, depending on which specific sector, is running at from 20 percent to 60 percent.
For the nation as a whole, joblessness is still running at a six-year high of 10.5 percent, almost half as high as the official rate in the United States.
The protesters, who besides construction workers included truckers, disabled people, provincial public servants, feminists and farmers, had set up in a place beside the convention center that they called Mulroneyville.
From the main street, marked by a signpost labeled "Layoff Lane," , people were invited to mail a letter to the Prime Minister, telling him what a lousy job he was doing.
 But inside the convention hall it was a far different story. The 2,500 delegates gave their leader one standing ovation after the other as he outlined his strategy to keep the party governing until the turn of the century.
 
Counting on Economic Recovery
 "They think of him as some kind of magician," said Gerry Caplan, a political analyst who used to advise the New Democratic Party. "Remember, before the last election he was also lower than a snake's belly in the polls, and he brought it off."
For victory this time he is counting on three elements: recovery from the recession; declines in the federal budget deficit and credible progress in resolving the constitutional crisis to keep the country from splitting apart.
"I am here before you," he told the cheering delegates on Wednesday, "bloodied and sometimes bowed, but completely determined to fight another winning battle for a united Canada."
Then on Friday in a dramatic show of solidarity behind the Prime Minister, the delegates voted 92 percent in favor of recognizing Quebec as a "unique society" with the right to choose its own future.
Although the resolution is mainly symbolic, it sends a signal to Quebec that while the French-speaking province is free to pull out out of the confederation if it so chooses, the governing party is going to pull out all stops to accommodate Quebec's distinctness within proposed new federal structures.
Although economic recovery has proved slow and faltering here as in the United States, the Prime Minister insisted in his speech to the delegates that the recession was over and that "we'll bounce into the election in 1993 with prosperity all over."
It was the first time that he has mentioned when elections might be held. The mandate expires in the fall of 1993, but under the Parliamentary system, the Prime Minister has the flexibility to call for elections any time within the five-year eriod.
The reference suggests that despite his buoyancy at the Conservatives' convention, Mr. Mulroney still thinks he will need all the time he can muster to achieve the desired turnaround in his popularity.
"What we saw here," said Hershell Ezrin, a former Liberal Party strategist, "was a massive effort at resurrection. But conversion even on the road to Damascus has proven difficult."

HEADLINE: PAN AMERICAN GAMES;
Come the Revolutions: Cuba Is Bowling Again

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAVANA, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Once it was a sport for the elite of Cuba: glittering indoor palaces where the clatter of the ball hitting the 10 pins mixed with the tinkle of the rum hitting the ice cubes.
Come the revolution, the bowling apparatus nearly disappeared from the island, no doubt replaced by agencies that served the people better. 
 There was one six-lane center in the town of Sancti Spiritus, on the road to Cienfuegos. There is also the prevailing legend that Fidel Castro maintained two lanes somewhere in his living quarters, but he has said he gave up the sport years ago.
 
The Cool Clatter of the Pins
 Now, the clatter can be heard again. Bowling is back: a 24-lane establishment, Bolera Panamericana, is in operation, at first for bowlers competing in the Pan American Games, but soon for the people of Cuba.
They stand in line in the heat and the humidity, waiting for a free seat in the air-conditioned marvel.
"I'm a baseball fan," said Rosa Martinez of Marianao, waiting patiently in the boiling sunlight. "I've never seen bowling, but I could learn."
Once inside, they watch bowlers in bright shirts -- the Mexicans have a striking Aztec warrior on their backs -- throwing highly respectable scores in the high 100's, all day long.
The handsome center is just another sign of the massive commitment of the Cuban Government to produce medals and provide recreation in a country short on food and gasoline.
When bowling was made an official part of the 1991 games, the Cubans promised to build a center. But as the Cuban economy tightened, there were doubts.
"We were hoping to have help from the U.S., but because of the blockade, that was impossible," said Maria del Carmen Rubio, a director of the center.
The United States Tenpin Bowling Federation wanted to help, "but we had a policy that we would not try to get around our Government embargo," said Gerald L. Koenig, the executive director.
 
Enter the Japanese
 Eventually, the Cubans contracted with a Japanese company to put the bowling center inside a large airy building next to the volleyball arena.
"They took 72 days," said Sergi Vega Urrutia, another director of the center, shaking his head in admiration.
The Japanese sold them 24 reconditioned lanes, with pinspotters and stations for the balls, and seats and tables. It is bright and clean and spacious. There is a bar right behind the middle lanes, although the Pan American bowlers cannot have drinks during competition.
The price for the entire project, including a fascinating Museum of Cuban Sport upstairs, is put at 4 million pesos, which could be anywhere between $600,000 and $1 million, depending on how much value is given to the peso.
The final necessity was a machine to apply the "dressing," the oil coating on the wooden surface. The U.S. federation sent over a $10,000 high-tech machine, developed by John Davis of Florida, but under American Government policy, the machine must come back on the same cargo ship on which it was sent.
 
Bowling, Anyone?
 Once the center was built, though, Cuban athletes had to learn how to bowl. Sports officials began to recruit athletes like Lorenzo Oliva, who plays soccer for a local club, and has a trim midfielder's build.
"I first heard about bowling a year ago," Oliva said. "I think it is a sport of much intelligence, and it has a great tradition. Also, it is the only sport that permits the whole family to play."
Oliva joined a Cuban program that sent athletes to Venezuela. His average was 170 this week, at the low end of the spectrum that had four men over 200 and the highest woman at 191.
Most of the participants in the Pan American competition are the top bowlers in their countries, but the United States bowlers are amateurs, not members of the professional tour. Still, two top amateur women have recently moved into the pro circuit and done well, and Lynda Norry, 23, of Concord, Calif., is thinking about it.
Norry recently won the U.S. Olympic Festival in California with an average of 201, higher than any man or woman. She is here, wearing a brace for tendinitis on her right wrist and in 10th place at 183.
"This is nothing but good news that bowling is a medal sport here," Norry said. "It's too bad it's not a sport in 1992 at Barcelona but we're hoping for Atlanta in 1996."
Asked why bowling should be included with basketball and track and field and swimming, Norry said, "I always tell people, 'You go get a 16-pound ball and bowl 10 games every day. You have to use your muscles and you have to use your brain.' "
The competition runs through Monday. Then the bowlers go back to their home centers all over the Americas, leaving the Bolera to the people of Cuba.

HEADLINE: BOATING;
Any Spare Change? The America's Cup Defense Wants You!

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD

 BODY:
The costs of competing in and staging an America's Cup yacht racing series have spiraled in the last decade. But financial support for the event, known throughout its history as a rich man's sport, has not kept pace with prices.
Dennis Conner, the cup's most successful skipper, has found it difficult to raise money for his 1992 Stars & Stripes campaign. His budget, downgraded from $30 million to $20 million in the last year, has stalled out at little more than $10 million, the amount raised so far.
 
Might Be Forced to Go With One Boat
 The lack of money has forced Conner to put off building a second boat. His team has set Sept. 1 as the deadline for deciding whether to go ahead with a second boat. 
 Jerry La Dow, Team Dennis Conner's executive director, said in a recent interview that the Stars & Stripes defense syndicate will carry on with one boat if it has to. "It's not going to make us feel as good as if we had a new boat," La Dow said. "But we're not discouraged; we've got a good boat."
The decision on a new boat is being made with caution. "The question is, How late can we wait?" said La Dow. "The longer we wait, the better the design will be. It's an evolutionary process. But this is an expensive game; these boats cost $3 to $4 million apiece."
 
Plenty of Prototypes in Past
 In past cup campaigns, in 1980, 1983 and 1987, Conner built two or three prototype yachts. The 12-Meter designs cost about $500,000 each. Conner used the boats as trial horses, ultimately choosing the fastest yacht in his stable for the final cup matches.
Conner's new 78-foot International America's Cup Class yacht made its debut at the I.A.C.C. world championship in San Diego last May. The boat won a berth in the semifinal series, but Conner dropped out of the final races rather than risk a breakdown. It was a calculated move in a campaign preoccupied with survival.
Conner spends more time fund-raising than sailing. Pepsi-Cola, Cadillac and American Airlines have signed on as $3 million "Gold Level" sponsors. But he has been unable to persuade others to step in at that level.
 
$4 Million in '83 to $40 Million in '92
 His original cup plan, which called for three new boats, vanished amid the recession. "Capital has dried up in the last year," said La Dow. "That scares corporate America. They think long and hard about it. It's a lot easier to say no."
The $4 million budgets that supported cup syndicates in 1983 have escalated to $40 million in 1992. The Italian and Japanese challenger teams, both with high-end budgets, are building up to four I.A.C.C. yachts for their 1992 campaigns.
William Koch, a wealthy businessman from Palm Beach, Fla., is financing the only other cup defense team, America 3. Koch plans to fund about two-thirds of his $40 million budget privately. The rest is being raised by outside donations.
 
Organizing Committee Jumps In
 The America's Cup Organizing Committee, the managers for the 1992 race series, agreed two years ago to stay out of the corporate arena. The group was under pressure from defense teams after the same money.
Last week, the organizing committee said it couldn't hold back any longer. Strapped by financial shortfalls of its own, the committee announced that it planned to go after international companies for support.
"Revenue has sharply declined," said Tom Mitchell, the A.C.O.C.'s assistant general manager, in a telephone interview last week. "The only way we can survive is to sharply decline our expenses."
The cup event, which lasts five months, is expected to cost about $25 million. The A.C.O.C. expected to pay for it with money from San Diego's port authority, and from television rights, licensing agreements and merchandising.
Mitchell insists that organizers will not infringe on Conner's or Koch's fund-raising efforts. "There are international sponsors who want to be event sponsors," said Mitchell. "They are companies who would not want to be associated with any one syndicate because the firms have offices all over the world. They're there for the taking, and we're going to take them."
The committee announced last Thursday that it was laying off seven staff employees. Of the $9 million it has spent to prepare for the race series this winter in San Diego, the committee owes creditors more than $3 million.
Jet Ruban Bleu, the 82-foot powerboat designed to break the trans-Atlantic speed record, left Ambrose Light off Sandy Hook, N.J., at 7:04 A.M. Friday morning. But Serge Medac, Jet Ruban's skipper, was forced to give up the attempt yesterday afternoon when the crew discovered a leak in one of the boat's portholes. The crew feared that incoming water might damage the boat's electronics. Jet Ruban turned back at 2 P.M., heading for St. Pierre, a small island south of Newfoundland. The French-built craft and its crew of four had wanted to beat a time of 3 days 7 hours, the record set in 1990 by the 243-foot ferryboat, Hoverspeed Great Britain.

Players Association Priority: Taking Care of Business

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Few American unions can boast of being as successful a conduit of cash to their membership as the Major League Baseball Players Association.
The association has become a super-union: a savvy bargaining unit that has won nearly all its battles, and a business agent capitalizing on baseball's licensing mania. No other sports union plays both roles so well. 
 The union has capitalized lucratively on baseball's role as a marketing magnet. Hundreds of companies want a piece of baseball. To depict a player's face on products, or use his name or biographical data, companies must deal with the union. To pair faces with team logos and uniforms, Major League Baseball Properties, the licensing arm of major league baseball, must also be paid.
As administrator of the program that licenses players' faces on products like trading cards, posters and board and video games, the union has paid out $141.9 million in royalties, plus interest, to the players since 1986 -- $124.7 million since early 1990, according to the union's financial filings with the United States Department of Labor. The union's licensing program excludes individual endorsement deals, like Bo Jackson's Nike commercials.
"The increased revenues simply track baseball's increased popularity," said Donald Fehr, the union's executive director and general counsel, "and the fact that the Topps monopoly on trading cards was broken" in 1981.
Early each year, the union's executive board decides how to distribute royalties to the players. Over the last few years, in anticipation of a lockout or a strike, it withheld $76.8 million. This would have been used primarily to make periodic payments to players had last year's lockout by owners continued into the regular season.
When the lockout ended, the harbored cash was paid quickly in lump sums. The most recent payment was made in March, $36.7 million, or about $36,700 for each of the estimated 1,000 eligible players, managers, coaches and trainers.
It is not a major windfall in the context of $900,000-plus average salaries, but somewhat more than extra pocket change.
Licensing fees have greatly augmented the dues ($15 from each union member for every day of a season on a major league roster) to help finance three collusion cases; the 1990 Basic Agreement negotiations; arbitration; licensing; a pension for the union's former executive director, Marvin Miller, and staff bonuses.
"To do what we do without the licensing revenues," said Fehr, "would require a drastically different dues structure."
The 1985, 1986 and 1987 collusion cases cost $4.6 million to pursue, including $2.9 million for the 1986 case. But the union received a huge return when an arbitrator levied a $280-million penalty against the owners.
 
A Comfortable Retirement
 The union also spent $396,791 between 1988 and 1990 on the Basic Agreement negotiations; $114,000 on last year's staff bonuses; $735,453 on arbitration since 1986 and $101,187 last year to administer the licensing program.
 
A Comfortable Retirement
 And Fehr, who represents about 1,000 players, has benefited with a salary higher than most of the top officers of blue-collar unions with tens of thousands of workers. He will receive $500,000 this year, up from $475,000 in 1990. By comparison, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. paid Lane Kirkland $175,000 in 1990, the Teamsters paid William McCarthy $283,483 and the United Mine Workers paid Rich Trumka $79,214.
"Fehr's salary is a lot," said Greg Tarpinian, senior economist of the nonprofit Labor Research Association, "but it's relative when you look at what his members make." Besides, he added: "Nobody wants to license the rights to a machinist's face."
Miller, Fehr's predecessor, is well cared for in retirement: his annual pension of $90,000 has been financed with four annuities that cost the union $1 million.
When Miller came to the union in 1966, its finances were not so flush. Only $5,400 remained in its bank account. Miller scotched a players' proposal to finance union activities with $150,000 from All-Star Game proceeds because it violated the Taft-Hartley Law.
Miller negotiated a licensing program with Coca-Cola to put player pictures underneath bottle caps. It raised $60,000 in 1966, crucial financing until a new dues system brought in operating cash a year later.
Topps, the trading card company based in Brooklyn, was the sole maker of trading cards then, but paid no royalties, only nominal flat fees to the players. In 1968, after players refused to renew their contracts with the company, it began paying royalties.
The Topps monopoly was broken by Fleer in a 1981 antitrust suit. Shortly after that, Fleer and Donruss became Topps' first marketplace rivals in the card business, and were joined later by Score and Upper Deck.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Americans Confront the Debt the House Built

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
THINK of them as little S.& L.'s or insurance corporations, Americans who earned big and invested bigger, especially in real estate, in the booming 1980's, and who are now on the recessionary rocks. They are the burgeoning number of people who are finding that the house they bought is worth less than they owe on it, their credit cards are borrowed to the limit, and they are going bankrupt.
The number of Americans declaring personal bankruptcy has grown by 152 percent in six years, from 285,000 in 1984 to 718,000 last year, and the trend shows no sign of abating immediately, according to the American Financial Services Association, a Washington trade group. 
 The figures tell only part of what is going on in the evolving relationship between Americans and their debts, the experts say. Far from being an indelible personal, social and economic stain, many bankrupts are increasingly likely to regard defaulting on loans as a temporary setback, even a smart financial strategy, considering how quickly lenders extend new credit to former deadbeats. And as the filings increase, the stigma of bankruptcy fades.
"The shame of bankruptcy does not seem to be as great as it once was," said Dr. Robert W. Johnson, senior research associate at the Purdue University business school's Credit Research Center in West Lafayette, Ind. "Consumers nowadays seem more concerned about losing their credit and they are learning that you can go bankrupt and get credit back very quickly."
In business bankruptcy, a debtor seeks to delay payments to keep a business, but a Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy wipes out a person's debt, except for taxes, alimony and child support payments. The same exceptions apply to a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, in which an individual agrees to pay off a portion of the total debt in installments. While the assets of a Chapter 7 filer are typically seized and applied toward debt payment,, a recent United States Supreme Court ruling made such a bankruptcy less onerous by making it easier to retain homes and some investments.
Dr. Johnson said that a main factor behind the banktrupcy boom is devaluation of what is the biggest investment for most people: their houses.
"The New England states had the highest rate of housing market loss and the sharpest increase in bankruptcy filings," he said. "People have to move and find out they can't sell their homes for as much as they were counting on, perhaps to pay some other debts, so they file for bankruptcy."
There is some evidence that the distress is sharpest in the Northeast. In the first quarter of this year, Massachussetts, Maine, New Hampshire and Rhode Island plus Puerto Rico -- the First Federal Judicial Circuit states -- registered a 67 percent increase in personal bankruptcy filings, a total of 6,835 filings, compared with the first quarter of last year. The rest of New England and the Mid-Atlantic states showed the next highest rates, going from 14,948 filings in the first quarter of last year to 21,852 for the same period this year.
 
A Booming Business
 Nationwide, personal bankruptcies in 1990 increased by 16.4 percent over the previous year, and this year's first quarter figures are 28 percent ahead of last year's record numbers.
"I'd like to think my business is so good because of the good job we do, but it is mostly due to the fact that there are so many more foreclosures today than at any time since I started practicing, 35 years ago," said Sid Schneider, a New York City attorney who specializes in bank foreclosures of houses and co-op apartments.
"The price increases in real estate that occurred in the 1980's were not realistic," Mr. Schneider said, "but people paid them because they were earning a lot and they had a lot to spend. Now that times are bad, people aren't buying real estate, and the people who can no longer afford the houses they bought don't have anyone to sell them to."
Today's families coming in for personal financial counselling are older and better off than the usual run of families in financial trouble, said Jay Muzychenko, vice president of the National Foundation for Consumer Credit, a credit-industry-supported financial counseling service that tries to keep debtors out of the courts and abreast of their bills.
"This recession is hitting white collar workers, the middle manager types, and this is not the traditional group that has faced layoffs before," Mr. Muzychenko said. "They are people who were making more money, so they had more debt, including for real estate."
But Mr. Muzychenko and Dr. Johnson agree that there is something more than just a soft economy that has hit white collar workers harder than usual. The level of installment debt, Dr. Johnson noted for example, has increased much more modestly -- by 26 percent, to $732 billion, since 1986 -- than the number of bankruptcies. But in an era unmarked by self-denial of the trappings of comfort and leisure, credit has become easier to get as banks and lenders, themselves stung by real estate losses, look for new sources of income.
Softer lending policies may explain why bankruptcy does not always spell the end of credit worthiness. Studies have found that about 10 percent of bankrupts establish new lines of credit within six months of filing, Dr. Johnson said, a third obtain new credit within three years, and after five years half have reestablished themselves. They may not file for protection again for six years, which can give a perverse boost to someone's risk worthiness. "Some people give recent bankrupts credit because they think, well, they can't go bankrupt for another six years," he noted. "But they're still not a good bet. Our studies show that a quarter of bankrupts are back in trouble after four or five years."

The Computer Age: Still a Work in Progress

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
WHEN the International Business Machines Corporation introduced its first personal computer 10 years ago tomorrow, the company hoped to sell 250,000 machines over the life of the product. Others predicted that machines would be in every home and on every desk, and those without them would be left behind in the race toward the information age.
Both predictions were wrong. The personal computer has succeeded far beyond I.B.M.'s wildest expectations, with millions sold and computers now accepted as a fact of life almost as basic as electric power. But the grander vision of a computerized society has not yet been realized. In many cases, computers have mainly been used as faster calculators and better typewriters and have not yet radically altered the way we live and work. 
 "We've mostly just used them to pave the cowpaths," said Paul Saffo, a researcher at the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif. "We're mostly just doing old things in a new way." But, he added, "the main event is yet to come." Indeed, the pace of change in the next decade is expected to be as great as in the last one.
The revolution would have happened with or without I.B.M. Apple Computer, Tandy Corporation and others had been selling personal computers since 1977, and machines for hobbyists appeared two years before that. But the I.B.M. machine catalyzed the invasion of personal computers into the American workplace because it was made by the trusted provider of computers to corporate America.
 
Making Billionaires
 Since then, the world has seen an explosion of computing power. It is hard to imagine that before personal computers came along, there were only about 230,000 computers in use in the United States. Today there are more than 55 million in this country and more than 110 million in the world.
And the power of machines has continued to double every two years or so. Today's personal computer can calculate at least 12 to 20 times faster, has 64 times more internal memory and 500 times more disk storage than the original model for the same price in inflation-adjusted dollars. The most powerful personal computers are nearly 100 times as fast as the originals.
The personal computer has been the basis of a thriving industry, one still largely controlled by American companies. It has created entrepreneurial heroes and millionaire wunderkinds, like William H. Gates, the founder of the software giant Microsoft, who is worth $4 billion at age 35. But the ascendance of the desktop machines has meant painful contractions for companies that make larger computers, not the least of these being I.B.M. itself.
With the advent of the personal computer, the typewriter has completely disappeared from many offices. Middle managers do their forecasts and analyses on electronic spreadsheets. The computer helps architects design buildings, scientists analyze experiments and students simulate what it would be like to live in revolutionary France or travel at the speed of light.
It has given small businesses and individuals capabilities once reserved for large corporations, like printing newsletters and brochures. It has united people in different locations with common interests into "virtual communities" through computerized conferences. It has helped the blind to read and the disabled to work.
But as fast as the technology has advanced and diffused, expectations have advanced even faster, so that many of the predictions of the last decade now seem almost humorous and the visions unfullfilled.
Computers are still notoriously hard to use, despite all the talk about user-friendliness. Instead of creating the envisioned paperless office, the computer has only made it easier to flood the office with paper. While relieving some workers of drudgery, it has created electronic sweatshops for those who type in all the data, in some cases even monitoring their performance automatically.
Education has not been transformed by computers, in part because there are not enough machines in schools and in part because the ones that are there are often used merely as electronic flashcards. But it was probably unrealistic to think that any machine could have that much impact on what is a human-oriented process.
Nor are many households doing their banking or shopping on home computers. In fact, for most people, there is still no compelling reason to have a computer in the home in the same way that it is necessary to have a phone or a television.
Even in business, economists say that the overall productivity of office workers has not improved much, despite the investment of hundreds of billions of dollars in computers in the last decade. Productivity in the service industries is rising less than 1 percent a year, compared with 4 percent in manufacturing, said Stephen Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company.
Part of the reason is that many office workers spend most of their day in conversations, not working with a spreadsheet or word processor. Even the benefits of word processing, the ability to make changes in a document quickly, can be lost if writers spend more time making revisions. "You fine-tune, fine-tune and fine-tune because it's easy to do that," said Gary Loveman, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School who has studied the impact of computers on productivity. "I really question whether the value of that is that high."
But many computer experts say the promises of the 80's will be fulfilled in the 90's. Computers will continue to gain in speed and capacity, and much of that new power will be harnessed to make machines easier to use and more versatile, to automate entire businesses instead of just individual workers.
"The theme of the second decade will be to achieve business objectives faster," said Andrew Grove, president of the Intel Corporation, which makes the central processing chips used in personal computers. Computers "are going to become as necessary to the business world as air."
Networks will become so advanced that people will not only exchange messages electronically but collaborate by viewing the same information simultaneously while sitting at terminals miles apart. Electronic mail is already proving indispensable to some companies, though networking fiefdoms must be better united to provide smooth, universal service.
With computers hooked into networks, vast electronic libraries will be available. Today's databases require special commands and often retrieve nothing if even a single letter is mistyped. "They are like Conan the Librarian -- lots of arbitrary rules and no mercy," said Mr. Saffo. But in the future, he said, information robots, or "infobots," will scour the networks for us, retrieving needed information, alerting people to developments in their field and perhaps preparing a customized daily newspaper.
Pocket-sized information appliances will receive and transmit by radio, leading to "anywhere, anytime" computing. By the end of the decade people will be writing and talking to their computers and artificial intelligence will help the machines anticipate their user's needs. Video computers will allow an art lover to take a simulated tour of the Louvre, deciding which hallways to walk down and zooming up close to particular paintings, which will appear on the screen with stunning clarity.
Looking back 10 years from now, some of these predictions will look humorous, and people might be asking questions like those being asked today. Will access to huge electronic libraries help people make better decisions, or merely drown them in useless information? Will "anywhere, anytime" computing shorten the workday or just make it impossible to escape from one's job?
The only thing certain about the next decade of personal computing is that it will be like the first. There will be tremendous change, mind-boggling advances and numerous benefits, and still more visions unfulfilled.

On Reaganomics' 10th Birthday, Not All Celebrate

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TEN years ago President Reagan laid the foundations of the Reagan revolution by signing two laws so sweeping and ambitious that they overshadow most of the legislation passed since then.
Mr. Reagan's historic package of tax and budget reductions cut individual income tax rates by 23 percent over three years, and to an astonishing degree those laws, signed Aug. 13, 1981, still shape the nation's political debate. Politicians still fiercely argue the fairness of those changes and the merits of cutting taxes as a way to stimulate economic growth.
But the relentless demand for Federal largess, the growth of social insurance benefits and the nation's military buildup long ago overwhelmed the budget cuts. Social Security outlays grew 90 percent in the last decade, while spending for Medicaid and Medicare has nearly tripled.
Still, Jack F. Kemp, spiritual father of the 1981 tax cuts, says they had a lasting legacy. "I doubt, in our lifetime or our children's lifetime, that we'll ever go back to a steeply graduated and progressive income tax system" with top rates of 70 percent or higher, he said last week in an interview.
The most important and permanent of all the 1981 tax changes is probably the indexing of tax brackets, which prevents the automatic increase in tax rates that occurs when wages and salaries increase as a result of inflation.
And is the overall tax burden any lighter now? Total Federal, state and local tax receipts declined as a percentage of gross national product from 1982 to 1984, but gradually climbed back to the level where they were when Mr. Reagan took office: slightly more than 27 percent of G.N.P.
C. Eugene Steuerle, one of the nation's foremost experts on tax policy, who was Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury from 1987 to 1989, said that after a round of state tax cuts in the late 1970's and the Federal income tax cut in 1981, state and local governments increased taxes in the ensuing decade. At least 33 states have raised taxes this year as they wrestle with serious fiscal problems. To be sure, Federal income tax rates are lower today, but Social Security payroll taxes are higher. About 32.5 million families pay more in Social Security payroll taxes than in income taxes, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.
The tax revolt of the late 1970's and early 80's reduced overall levels of taxation only "slightly and temporarily," said Mr. Steuerle. It focused on two of the most unpopular levies, the income tax and the property tax, but did nothing to slow the growth in Social Security taxes, he said. President Bush has resisted a proposal by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan to cut Social Security payroll taxes.
The magnitude of the 1981 tax cuts is such that if all their provisions were still in effect, they would have reduced Federal tax receipts by $322 billion last year. In fact, almost two-thirds of the revenue loss has been offset by tax increases and other changes since 1981.
In 1986, Congress lowered income tax rates again, but significantly broadened the definition of taxable income, curtailing tax shelters, limiting many personal deductions and repealing the investment tax credit for businesses. In "The Tax Decade," a book to be published this fall by the Urban Institute Press, Mr. Steuerle reviews the extraordinary outpouring of tax legislation in the last 10 years and concludes that the result for most income groups was "almost no change in average tax rates."
However, in the 1980's the tax rate on the last dollar of earnings -- the rate most likely to affect individual decisions about work and savings -- did drop for many people. For example, the top rate for the most affluent people dropped from 70 percent in 1980 to less than half that today.
But Mr. Kemp, now Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, expresses despair that "we have forgotten the lessons of the early 1980's." Underlining the rift in Republican ranks, he said, "The budget agreement engineered last year by my good friend Dick Darman inadvertently paralyzes the President's call for a cut in the capital gains tax rate," because such a cut would produce revenue losses, according to conventional estimates. Mr. Darman is the Federal budget director.
When Mr. Reagan cut taxes, he "did it on faith," Mr. Kemp said. But now, he added, "we're listening to econometric models that tell us lowering the capital gains tax will lose revenue, and lowering the payroll tax will destroy the economy."
Mr. Bush abandoned his campaign pledge of "no new taxes" last year and supported a budget package that raises more than $150 billion of additional revenue over five years. He continues to call for a cut in the capital gains tax, even espousing it in a speech to low-income people at a housing project in St. Louis a few months ago. Congressional Democrats have blocked the capital gains proposal on the ground that it favors the wealthy -- it would lower the tax on profits from the sale of stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets.
On Tuesday, at a 10th anniversary celebration sponsored by the Heritage Foundation, Mr. Kemp will speak and there will be a videotaped message from Mr. Reagan. But Mr. Bush, who once derided the Reagan policy as "voodoo economics," was not invited. "Inviting Bush to this event would have been like inviting a nudist to a Moral Majority meeting," said Burton Yale Pines, senior vice president of the foundation.
While the overall tax burden has not changed much, there have been clear winners and losers from the changes in the last decade, particularly the Tax Reform Act of 1986, intended by Mr. Reagan to encourage "risk-taking, innovation and that old American spirit of enterprise." Among the losers were people who had invested heavily in tax shelters. The biggest winners included wage earners with few deductions, credits or exclusions under the old tax law.

A Long-Running Battle On How to Divide The Medicaid Burden

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
NO sooner had Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor David N. Dinkins agreed to put aside their differences over what to call a city-state conference than they found themselves squabbling over its agenda. The Mayor wanted to advocate, again, that the state assume more of the city's $2 billion in Medicaid costs. The Governor, in turn, did not want the city's financial problems cast solely in that light -- and then laid at his doorstep.
The issue is hardly a new one. 
 In the mid-70's, 14 of New York City's top bankers and union leaders agreed to meet informally to discuss the city's financial problems. One of the first issues they decided to take up was Medicaid, the Federal health-care program for the poor, and the heavy financial burden it was imposing on the city. A manifesto of sorts resulted, which proposed that Washington pick up half of the state and local governments' Medicaid expenditures.
"State and local governments should not be forced to contract needed public programs or to raise their taxes to uncompetitive levels because of this national problem," read the statement, signed by Walter Wriston, then chairman of Citicorp, David Rockefeller, then chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank, and Victor Gotbaum, then executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, and others.
This unusual political alliance then went to Washington, where the group pleaded their case before President Jimmy Carter. "We got nowhere," said Jack Bigel, the labor consultant who was co-chairman of the group.
Fast forward to 1987. Times are good again. But Mayor Edward I. Koch is alarmed by the city's soaring Medicaid costs and names a task force headed by William J. Grinker, then commissioner of the Human Resources Administration.
Its final report, optimistically entitled "Medicaid in the 1990's: Recommendations for Change," concluded, among other things, that the state of New York had the country's most expensive Medicaid program, and required its towns and cities to pay a larger share of those costs than any other state. It suggested that a portion of the city's Medicaid recipients participate in an experimental program to control costs.
Two years later, another Koch commission issued a lengthy report on taxes. It found that New York was one of only nine states that required any local contribution to the Federal welfare program, and that the 50 percent contribution the state imposed on its cities and counties was the highest in the nation.
It also found that only four other states required contributions from their local governments for Medicaid. And while New York City was paying 37 percent of the non-Federal share of that program, the next highest local burden in other states was 15 percent.
The commission concluded that while New York City's taxes are higher than any other city in the country, it is because its spending is higher. And that is "in part because a significant portion of the city budget is for programs that are more commonly financed today by states (and historically by the Federal government) than by localities."
 
Money for Police and Schools
 Fast forward again, to 1991. Mayor Dinkins has created a management advisory task force made up of business, labor and political leaders. It, in turn, has a subcommittee on health care headed by Mr. Bigel. In a 90-page report published in April, the subcommittee found that health-related expenditures now consume 21 percent of the city's $30 billion budget and that of the 14 states now requiring counties to contribute to Medicaid, only New York approaches the maximum of 30 percent allowed by law.
Given this history, it is hardly surprising that in the summer of 1991, when the city is once again trying to extricate itself from a financial vise, the pressure is growing for the state to assume a larger portion of the city's Medicaid costs.
City officials point out that if New York City were located in 45 other states, it would have an additional $2 billion in tax revenues that it could direct to services generally associated with local government -- including police, fire and education -- instead of to Medicaid. They note that the annual cost to New York City of welfare payments is $350 million.
After all, what should be more important to the state than the city's financial health? City officials like to remind state officials and others that 40 percent of the state's jobs are still located in the city, and the city's economic activity generates 50 percent of the state's tax revenues.
"The idea of a state Medicaid pick-up has surfaced as a silver-bullet solution to New York City's problems," acknowledged Drew Zambelli, secretary to Mr. Cuomo.
When the Mayor and the Governor agreed in early July to a joint study group of their interdependent financial problems, the sharing of Medicaid costs quickly emerged as the hot topic.
The Mayor wanted it to rank high on the agenda, and it was no accident that one of the people he named to represent the city on the group was Finance Commissioner Carol O'Cleireacain, who was a staff member on the mid-70's group.
But the Governor was more wary. While the Governor has always favored the state assuming a larger share of Medicaid, Mr. Zambelli said Mr. Cuomo thinks the dollar amounts are so large that it is unrealistic to expect the issue to be resolved politically anytime soon.
And since the state cannot deliver the kind of financial relief the city needs now, the issue itself should not take precedence over other more pressing issues.
That is where things stand after more than 15 years of blue-ribbon panels.
Yet, there has been headway. When Mr. Cuomo took office he agreed to reduce the city's portion of long-term Medicaid costs to 20 percent of the non-Federal share, which has resulted in savings of $2.4 billion since 1984.
As city and state representatives discuss the issue privately, the emphasis seems to have shifted away from whether the state should assume a greater share to how and when, according to some of the participants. Yet Mr. Cuomo, and legislators, want more assurances that before the state assumes more financial responsibility for Medicaid the program's costs would be under better control.
And therein lies the new rub. As long ago as the mid-70's, the bankers and labor leaders in that informal group suggested that a flat payment for Medicaid patients would remove the financial incentive for doctors to suggest more patient visits and longer hospital stays. The concept has since been formalized in the form of health-maintenance organizations in the private sector, and endorsed by subsequent study groups.
The question now is whether such a concept can be introduced in New York State for Medicaid patients, in what is known as "managed Medicaid." That is what the 1987 proposed experimental program was all about. But even though legislation allowing such a program was passed in 1987, its implementation is still being studied by the city.
"These ideas aren't new," Mr. Zambelli said, "but the politics are changing. People are beginning to realize they can't afford the alternative any more."

HEADLINE: THE REGION: In Connecticut;
Another Week Without Much Hope for a Budget

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
SIX weeks into its fiscal year, Connecticut is the only state still without a budget, and despite another week of rollercoaster politics it has none in sight.
The end seemed near for a few hours on Wednesday, when Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. vetoed a budget for the third time, saying it, like its predecessors, was not honestly balanced and struck at the poor and middle class by expanding the reach of the state's 8 percent sales tax. 
 Even Mr. Weicker seemed to think the veto, offering no new path for the General Assembly to follow, might push legislators to end their frustration by finally overriding him.
"I think the odds are clearly against me, because there is a great desire to flee the premises," he said after his televised veto message.
But Mr. Weicker, in his calmly delivered but sharp-edged message, had stirred anew the public's growing frustration over the deadlock.
"For too long the needs of some in the legislature have had little to do with the needs of Connecticut," Mr. Weicker said.
The message had its effect, and on Thursday the House and Senate -- their members under pressure, including calls from constituents -- decided it was futile to try to override the veto. But neither did they know where to turn next, with everyone dug deep on opposing sides of the key issue, an income tax.
Connecticut's fiscal troubles are like those in many states: the recession has blunted tax revenues after a decade in which spending soared. The result is a deficit that would approach $2 billion at the end of this fiscal year, in a $7.6 billion budget, if taxes were not raised.
Connecticut now stands alone, without a budget, in part because of Mr. Weicker's insistence on a budget that is free of fiscal gimmicks and that stimulates the economy by cutting sales and business taxes. The only plans he has favored included income taxes, and they have all died.
"Opposition to an income tax has gone beyond the political, beyond the philosophical," said Representative Richard Foley, who is also the Republican state chairman. "It has become a religious experience."
The state may also be alone because Mr. Weicker is an independent, with no party behind him. To form a coalition on the income tax, he has had to find legislators willing to buck their own parties. But as someone who campaigned as an anti-politician, perhaps he has also felt less need to seek compromise merely so business can go on as usual.

HEADLINE: Democrats in Congress Push for Jobless Bill

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10

 BODY:
The Democratic leaders of Congress are trying to turn up the political heat on President Bush by enlisting state and local officials to lobby for a bill that would extend unemployment benefits.
The House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington; the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, and the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, wrote to 27 Democratic governors and 346 Democratic mayors on Friday asking them to press Mr. Bush to sign the $5.2 billion jobless benefits bill passed last week. 
 The bill was sent to the White House on Tuesday, and the President has until Aug. 17 to act on it. The measure will become law on that day with or without his signature, but it will be meaningless unless Mr. Bush declares an emergency that will initiate the benefits.
The bill would allow up to 20 additional weeks of unemployment pay for those who have exhausted their basic 26 weeks of benefits. About 8.8 million Americans are unemployed, and benefits have already run out for some 1.6 million of those workers.
The Administration has been cool to the legislation, insisting that the nation's economy is recovering and that there is no emergency that would warrant the spending of more Federal dollars and deepening the deficit.

HEADLINE: In the Nation;
A Tale Of Two Faces

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER

 BODY:
Senator Jay Rockefeller has dropped out of a Presidential race he never really wanted to make. Coming on the heels of Representative Richard Gephardt's decision not to run, this new departure caused a predictable -- but not necessarily warranted -- chorus of moans and groans from Democrats hankering for a candidate.
Mr. Rockefeller has built a career in West Virginia that seems inevitably pointed toward a Presidential bid. But he had not planned to make it this early in his career, has plenty of years left and successfully resisted party pressures to force him into what at best would have been a long-shot campaign. 
 It seems ever clearer that Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, who has issued another disclaimer, also will sit this one out. Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee, like Mr. Gephardt a loser in 1988, must think long and hard before risking another defeat, even if this time as party nominee.
This line of speculation -- it's only that -- suggests the possibility that the Democrats might turn to their 1988 Vice Presidential candidate, Lloyd Bentsen of Texas. He is not elbowing his way to the front either, but he was generally praised for his campaign four years ago, particularly his debate victory over Dan Quayle; and it would be hard for him to turn down his party's call after accepting it in 1988.
The reluctance of acknowledged leaders to run also keeps open the possibility of a "new face" -- someone from outside the accustomed field of speculation, perhaps outside the party political scene. Shortly before Mr. Rockefeller opted out, for instance, a "draft committee" circulated a letter urging support for Ralph Nader, the well-known consumer advocate.
Mr. Nader has made about as many enemies as friends with his in-fighting skills and tenacity in Washington; but he's never run for office and the draft committee could say with a straight face that he "is not a politician." That's usually a Republican line, and may be an asset in a year when the public seems more than usually turned off on confessed politicians.
The New Republic also chose, in the current issue, to publish an attack on Bill Moyers, the former White House aide turned television journalist, whose name causes much excitement among Democrats taken with the idea of a new face. If he's drawing fire without even being a candidate, someone must take him seriously.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, who does seem eager to run, would qualify as a new face in Presidential politics, also because he's one Democrat apparently unafraid to claim New Deal heritage or to call himself a liberal. Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, whose views are more "centrist," also would be a newcomer to Presidential, though not to Democratic Party, politics.
But the new face the Democrats most need to see would be one for George Bush, who now looks unbeatable, and whose presumed campaign issues -- victory in the desert and opposition to quotas -- now seem insurmountable. By November 1992, however, it's not too far-fetched to suggest that that face of invincibility may look more like a map of economic decline.
The Administration has been talking bravely about recovery from the recession, but the Federal Reserve's "beige book" -- an economic review prepared by its 12 regional banks -- tells a different story. It reports continued weakness in real estate, retail sales lagging in major markets and overall improvement only at a "slow, uneven pace."
Acting on this picture of an economy that might be about to drop back into recession, the Fed again reduced the rate at which banks lend each other money, to 5.5 percent. The beige book's gloomy picture may cause even further interest-rate reductions this fall, since the demand for business loans remains weak.
Most unhappily for Mr. Bush, unemployment continues at about 7 percent, and an actual loss of 51,000 jobs was reported in July. The only improvement has come from people dropping out of the work force -- hardly an encouraging sign. State and local government layoffs, forced by recession and the loss of Federal aid, are just beginning to have economic effect.
Not even the most ardent Democrat could wish for victory in 1992 at the cost of an economic collapse. But with Mr. Bush displaying so little ability to take action against continuing, perhaps worsening recession, or to comprehend its effect on so many Americans, by mid-1992 he may no longer be wearing the face of an easy winner.
In that case, the Democrats will have little trouble putting on a good face of their own -- new or old.

HEADLINE: Pinch-Hitting for the Democrats;
Invest in the Future? Yes, but How?

SERIES: The Missing Campaign/An occasional series

 BODY:
As the Democratic convention grows closer, the field of candidates grows steadily smaller -- and the chance for illuminating debate grows remote.
Senator Jay Rockefeller and Representative Richard Gephardt have now counted themselves out, and so far, the only rallying cry is that yes, Democrats have discovered economic virtue. Former Senator Paul Tsongas, the only declared candidate, and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, a leading undeclared candidate, urge the sensible goal: 
 America should invest in itself, in the future.
But neither they nor anyone else has faced up to an inconvenient fact: investing more means consuming less. Presidential leadership is about leveling with voters, telling them who will have to ratchet down their purchases, and why.
Americans consume 97 percent of everything they earn, holding U.S. rates of investment and productivity growth below those of our Western allies. The danger is that the U.S. might be sliding into economic mediocrity.
Decisions to buy equipment, attend school and acquire training will be made by millions of individuals -- which Congress may want to encourage with tax reforms and other policies. But Government investments are also important. The task is to recast Federal spending toward the future. Here are some plausible guidelines.
Human Services. The U.S. economy depends on rapid adoption of new information and technology. That requires workers who are well trained and adaptable. Yet millions of children lack adequate education, health care and nutrition, and an increasing number of workers, especially immigrants and minorities, enter the workplace with low skills.
During the Reagan years, the dollars spent on Federal programs for education, training, employment and related social services fell by an astounding 21 percent, taking inflation into account.
Programs like preschool education, job training for disadvantaged workers and welfare-to-work experiments do not work wonders. But they do show promise. Isabel Sawhill and Jason Juffras, researchers at the Urban Institute, propose a sensible guideline: restore Federal, state and local support for human services to levels reached during the 1970's. That would mean an annual boost in spending of about $35 billion, or 15 percent.
Physical Infrastructure. The nations's highways, bridges, railroads, water treatment facilities and airports need repair. But some estimates -- as high as $3 trillion -- dangerously exaggerate the problem. Studies show that performance of existing facilities could be maintained at an additional cost of $20 billion a year.
More important than spending more money is spending the money better. That would require levying user fees to unclog congested airports and highways; it would also require that Congress end pork-barrel transportation projects.
Paying the Bills. The $55 billion needed to pay for this increased public investment is hardly daunting in a $6.5 trillion economy. Some of the money could come from cutting defense faster and raising taxes.
But ultimately Congress will have to confront the fact that, apart from defense and interest, about half of all Federal spending goes to the elderly. Unless these gargantuan payments can be modified, there won't be any money for investment.
The idea of paring payments to the elderly strikes terror into Congressional hearts. But there are reasonable ideas to debate. One is to tax the untaxed portion of Social Security benefits, which would not affect the poor. That alone would raise some $30 billion a year -- about enough to pay for the proposed education and training programs. Another is to gradually raise the eligibility for Medicare.
Redirecting Federal spending into productive investments could be a powerful theme for the campaign, but only if Democrats are prepared to move beyond vaporous virtue and convince voters that investing billions for the sake of their grandchildren is worth today's cost.

HEADLINE: The Atlantic Charter: Design for Tomorrow?

BYLINE: By Arthur Schlesinger Jr.; Arthur Schlesinger Jr. is professor of humanities at the City University of New York.

 BODY:
A document drawn up a half-century ago today can plausibly be seen as the foundation of the new world that lies at last within humanity's grasp. Not many historic pronouncements have dated so little as the joint declaration to which Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill subscribed on Aug. 12, 1941.
The two men met in a shrouded rendezvous at Placentia Bay off the coast of Newfoundland -- a destination to which they had traveled in utmost secrecy through dangerous waters on heavily armed warships. Though Roosevelt and Churchill had been exchanging messages since World War II began in 1939, they had never talked face to face. Beyond satisfying his curiosity about the other -- and these were men with acute instincts for history -- each had particular objectives. 
 Churchill, for obvious reasons, wanted to get America into the war. Roosevelt, for less obvious reasons, wanted to formulate principles for the peace. American association with Britain in a statement of peace aims, he hoped, would hearten European resistance to Hitler, and the right peace aims would reassure Americans that solidarity with Britain need not compromise American ideals.
To get the peace aims right, F.D.R. wanted a guarantee against the "secret treaties" that had disgusted Americans after World War I; he wanted assurances against closed trading systems, and, fearing isolationist wrath at home, he wanted to avoid language that might sound like an internationalist plot to revive the League of Nations. This fear of the isolationists was hardly idle: on the very day Roosevelt and Churchill finished drafting their declaration, the House of Representatives barely succeeded in extending the draft, by a single vote.
After two days of amiable but forceful argument in Placentia Bay, Churchill accepted a compromise on freedom of trade; F.D.R. a compromise on international organization. They agreed in rejecting secret treaties. The final statement was Wilsonian in spirit and in language: no territorial aggrandizement; self-determination of peoples; a freely trading world; economic and social security; freedom of the seas; disarmament of aggressor states pending the "establishment of a wider and permanent system of general security." Two days later The London Daily Herald gave the document its enduring name: the Atlantic Charter.
The two leaders were satisfied with their handiwork. If Churchill had failed to get the United States into the war, he had at least wonderfully solidified what came to be known as the "special relationship." Roosevelt now had British endorsement of peace aims that would at once justify convoying British ships in the Western Atlantic and, if it came to that, might later justify war itself.
Nevertheless, many considered the Charter a disappointment. British opinion found it a poor substitute for American intervention. Americans saw the recycled Wilsonianism as a collection of pious platitudes. Judging by opinion polls, the Charter was, in the words of the historian Theodore Wilson, "a propaganda bust."
During the war the British and the Russians chipped away at the Charter's lofty principles, claiming exemption for their own "existing obligations" (Churchill) and "historic peculiarities" (Molotov). After the war the Soviet Union trampled on most of the Charter's points. Even the United States fell short of full dedication to the ideals.
Yet the ideals never faded away. In January 1942 the Declaration of the United Nations explicitly adopted the Charter's "purposes and principles." These purposes and principles informed Bretton Woods in 1944 and the U.N. Declaration on Human Rights in 1948. Today they constitute the philosophical and juridical basis for President Bush's new world order.
Take a look at the Atlantic Charter 50 years after. Is not the world dreamed of by Roosevelt and Churchill at last coming to pass?
Consider the goals of Aug. 12, 1941 -- "the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live," equal access "to the trade and to the raw materials of the world," "improved labor standards, economic advancement, and social security," assurance that all "may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want," relief from "the crushing burden of armaments," establishment of a community of nations. After half a century of bitter contention, the Atlantic Charter sets forth the agenda on which most nations are at last agreed.
They didn't do too badly, those two inspired prima donnas, when they met off the coast of Newfoundland 50 years ago.

HEADLINE: What the U.S. Can Do in Peru

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has good reasons for helping to train and equip the Peruvian armed forces and police to combat drug traffickers and the leftist guerrillas who protect their trade. Sending 50 U.S. military personnel to assist an army notorious for human rights abuse does not mean that Washington is sliding toward another Vietnam, or even another El Salvador.
But to avoid being dangerously drawn into another country's political conflicts, policy makers will have to keep the limited nature of their mission clearly in mind: to help a democratically elected government implement its drug-control strategy and fend off guerrillas who get in the way. 
 That does not require the U.S. to be neutral in Peru's larger guerrilla war. The Shining Path rebels are brutal terrorists, with no strong base of popular support. President Alberto Fujimori's Government is democratically legitimate and economically competent. But Peru's present problems, including ethnic and regional strains, disease, insurgency and declining living standards, have deep historical roots and cannot be solved from abroad or by mainly military means.
The cocaine traffic is another story. The huge U.S. appetite for drugs helps drive this lucrative industry. Thousands of Peruvian peasants have been drawn to the remote Upper Huallaga Valley, where they can make far more money growing coca than they could from more traditional pursuits.
Shining Path, which has its main base in the Andean highlands, has exploited the cocaine traffic to open a new military front. The guerrillas pressure drug traffickers to pay more for the farmers' coca crops, and offer farmers and traffickers protection against army and police raiders.
Two years ago at the Cartagena summit meeting, the Presidents of the U.S., Bolivia, Colombia and Peru agreed on a joint strategy. The centerpiece was military cooperation, although useful new approaches, like Peru's crop substitution program, have since been added. The U.S. training mission in Peru is a result of the Cartagena understandings and has the support of the Fujimori Government.
There are defects in any anti-drug strategy that concentrates mainly on supply. Progress in squeezing Andean and Mexican traffickers has been partly offset by the relocation of drug facilities to other Latin American locations.
There are also human rights concerns. Peru today has perhaps the worst rights record in South America. The army, which ruled until 1980, remains a law unto itself; efforts to contain the violent insurgents of Shining Path have often caught innocent peasants in the middle.
The Fujimori Government has tried to rein in abuses, but has limited power. U.S. military trainers are likely to have no more success in changing the Peruvian Army's internal culture than they have had in El Salvador over the last decade.
Still, limited military cooperation against traffickers makes sense; and in Peru, no such campaign can succeed without also attacking the connection between the coca industry and Shining Path.

HEADLINE: Black Theater Groups Share Dreams

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., Aug. 9

 BODY:
Denzel Washington was here. So were Esther Rolle, Avery Brooks, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee and other actors, as well as directors, script writers and hundreds of fans. They all descended upon this central North Carolina city last week for the second National Black Theater Festival.
Audiences at the six-day event were treated to 20 productions by some of the nation's leading black companies. There were also workshops and seminars on subjects from set design to audience development. 
 "Networking is going on all day and all night," said Larry Leon Hamlin, the festival's producer and artistic director. "Deals are being made, shows are being moved and actors and playwrights are getting jobs."
Mr. Hamlin said he got the idea for the festival, which he founded in 1989, while preparing a magazine article on black theater in the South. "What I heard was a tremendous scream of pain and frustration," he said. "Then I began asking how black theater was faring in the rest of the country, and I heard that same scream."
Mr. Hamlin, as executive and artistic director of the North Carolina Black Repertory Company here, then began to organize a gathering that would involve the nation's more than 250 black theater troupes.
"I had thought there were only 55 or 60," he said. "Here we were in the same business, and we didn't even know each other. I felt we all needed to come together to see if we could share resources and organizational ideas."
The success of the 1989 festival, which drew an estimated 20,000 visitors to Winston-Salem, made fund-raising easier this time, Mr. Hamlin said, noting that corporate sponsors had contributed about $300,000 toward the current budget of $750,000. Attendance is expected to equal or surpass the previous total.
Plans for the next festival, in August 1993, include broadening its scope by inviting black theater companies from around the globe. Mr. Hamlin said he was discussing the idea with troupes in London, Amsterdam and several African countries.
 
Morale Booster
 A more immediate concern is the survival of black theater during recessionary times, said Beth Turner, publisher and editor of Black Masks, a New York-based magazine distributed in 35 states and featuring information about black performing and visual arts. Events like the National Black Theater Festival boost morale and enable acting companies to exchange ideas, she said.
"It's very essential," she added. "Black theater groups, in particular, tend to get caught up in the daily grind of getting the show out. You feel like an island unto yourself. You find there are other theaters that have strength."
Miss Dee, who presided over this year's festival with Mr. Davis, her husband, said that networking by theater groups was perhaps the festival's most useful offering in an era when budget shortfalls often mean cutbacks in arts subsidies.
"We have to strategize to keep them alive," Miss Dee said. "We can't let these theaters die."
She said she was impressed by the week's productions, which included Mr. Brooks's portrayal of Paul Robeson and Mrs. Rolle's of the educator Mary McLeod Bethune.
 
Tribute to Aretha Franklin
 Other offerings included Yolanda King's multi-media tribute to her father, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.; "Blues in the Night," a musical produced by Mr. Hamlin's repertory company, and "Lady Soul: A Cabaret Tribute to the Music of Aretha Franklin," with Leonard Thomas and Peggy Alston.
"This is really a meeting ground for everyone to come together and talk about what the conditions are and to develop new ways to cooperate," said Sidne Mahone, director of play development for the Crossroads Theater company of New Brunswick, N.J. The company is one of America's largest black repertory groups, with an annual budget of $2.5 million.
"There is a recession; that is a reality," Ms. Mahone said. "But what is hard is working in isolation."

HEADLINE: The Right Way to Retool the Soviet Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You report that Mikhail S. Gorbachev's letter to the Group of Seven leaders was called inadequate partly because it "hedges on the goal of privatizing large enterprises" (news article, July 16). It would be unfortunate if Western assessment of Soviet economic transformation focused on privatization. Far more important are the steps that should be taken first, such as monetary stabilization, freeing of prices, marketization and full legalization of private ownership. 
 Privatization sounds like the natural way of transforming a state-enterprise economy into a private-enterprise economy. But a privatized enterprise is no more private than a tranquilized person is tranquil.
Part of the history of Soviet state-owned enterprises is incorporated in a stock of plant and equipment so old, so poorly maintained, so designed for military production and so ill suited to the consumer demands of a market economy that most of it could not survive genuine competition.
Another part of that history is embodied in an overstaffed and unmotivated labor force that has never been exposed to the discipline of a labor market. Add to that management staffs that have achieved their positions through years of carrying out the orders of a bureaucratic government, rather than competing for the orders of consumers or businesses.
Imagine what the United States economy would look like if not a single enterprise had been permitted to go out of business in the last half-century. The state sector provides a weak basis from which to start a proud new market economy.
Fortunately, the Soviet population has a large potential for vigorous entrepreneurship. Some of it has surfaced in the last few years in the limited legalization of private ownership, including individually and cooperatively owned enterprises, and joint ventures with Western businesses. Those employed in this private sector now number in the millions.
Because the Government maintains price controls, fortunes can still be made in the black market. As in the United States in World War II, much entrepreneurial effort has been diverted into buying and trading price-controlled goods. And as in the United States after that war, if price controls were abandoned, the black market would largely vanish, and entrepreneurs would produce goods and services that people wish to buy.
The hunger for goods and services is so great, and the facilities for producing them so meager, that fortunes can be made in a competitive private sector. Protected by law and supported by the Government, private savings would expand rapidly. Those savings, supplemented by foreign capital seeking genuine business opportunities, could further expand the private sector and purchase portions of the state enterprises that would stand the test of profitability as perceived by business people with their own capital at risk.
In the long transition, state enterprises could first compete with the growing private sector and then the plant and equipment could finally be retired or bulldozed over to make way for new private enterprises.
If the Soviet economy should one day join the club of major industrial countries, it will be based not on the privatization of decrepit state enterprises, but on the vitality of new, genuinely private enterprises. That requires establishment of a real market economy, which requires abandoning price controls. Before that, however, the huge Government budget deficit must be eliminated and the monetary system stabilized. And before any of those, the fundamental political question of which level of government has the right to make what laws must be resolved.
Such a reform program would tax the administrative resources of the most powerful of governments. For a weak Government, it may be overwhelming. The West should regard it as a great achievement if the conditions for vigorous private enterprise alone were established in the Soviet Union. It should not burden the Soviet Government further by pressing for the privatization of large state enterprises.

HEADLINE: The Right Way to Retool the Soviet Economy;
Allies and Partners

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Though your imagination soars bravely in the political-security realm about potential Soviet-American cooperation in "Allies" (editorial, July 28), you stop far short of the long-term economic possibilities. Soviet integration into the international economy has to signify much more than a stake in a stable world order.
When we look at today's wrecked Communist command system amid empty stores, inflation and rapidly declining gross national product, it is easy to forget the Soviet Union's strengths: tremendous agricultural territories, enormous natural resources (including huge petroleum reserves), a huge pool of literate and skilled workers, and a powerful scientific and technological establishment.
The transformation will be lengthy, uneven and worrisomely uncertain. Nevertheless, a worldwide economy in which, with luck, a healthy Soviet Union (however renamed) becomes a major player will be radically different. The three-cornered love-hate competition among the United States, Europe and Japan will open up to all sorts of new combinations and permutations. Whether the goal is to undercut Persian Gulf oil dominance, to embark on new collaboration in space or to initiate major new technologies, a revived Soviet Union will alter global behavior patterns and business alliances.
The United States can, along with sounder domestic policies, revive its competitive fortunes even as the Soviet Union revives its own. While imaginatively helping the Soviets on their journey, we should not forget the main future promise for ourselves.

HEADLINE: CHINA BACKS PACT ON NUCLEAR ARMS

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 10

 BODY:
China announced today that it had decided "in principle" to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, becoming the last major nuclear power to commit itself to the terms of the agreement to curb the spread of atomic weapons.
The announcement came during a summit meeting today between Prime Minister Li Peng and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan, whose nation last week marked the 46th anniversary of the two American atomic bomb attacks. Mr. Kaifu, who arrived today for three days of talks, is the first leader of any industrialized country to visit China since the Tiananmen crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in June 1989.
 
'Things Have Changed'
 "On many occasions in the past, China made clear its reasons for not acceding to the treaty," Wu Jianmin, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, said tonight. "Now things have changed. This is for the purpose of attaining the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons." 
 In recent months, China had hinted it might join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and today's announcement, while not entirely a surprise, is expected to be a boost to the international effort this year to curtail the spread of nuclear and conventional weapons, particularly to trouble spots like the Middle East.
The Foreign Ministry spokesman did not say when China would sign the treaty, nor did he say whether "in principle" meant that there were any issues China still wanted to discuss before it signed. He did say, however, that China has not "imposed any conditions" for signing the treaty.
China was the last of the five major nuclear powers to hold out against the accord; on June 3, France committed itself to the terms of the treaty, although it has not yet signed it.
Only a handful of countries -- including India, Pakistan, Israel, South Africa, Argentina and Brazil, which are thought to possess advanced nuclear technology -- have yet to sign the accord. But among the nations that have accepted it are countries like Iraq and North Korea that are believed to have ambitions of developing nuclear weapons.
[The Bush Administration welcomed China's announcement, saying the move was something the United States had long sought. "We welcome this development and we look forward to early ratification by China of the treaty," the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said in Kennebunkport, Me., where President Bush is vacationing.]
Mr. Li's announcement appeared to be a friendly gesture toward Japan, which has been more eager than Western countries to re-establish normal ties with China.
 
Ties 'Returned to Normal'
 In the last two years, Japan and China have rebuilt strong economic, commercial and even diplomatic ties, without focusing on the Tiananmen crackdown or human rights abuses. Some Western countries, particularly the United States, continue to have frosty relations with China because of concerns about Chinese violations of human rights and weapons sales.
Prime Minister Li suggested to Mr. Kaifu, in a comment repeated by the official New China News Agency, that China regarded the summit meeting as an indication that Chinese-Japanese relations are now back to normal.
"We are pleased to see that our bilateral relations have returned to normal," Mr. Li said. "We hereby express our appreciation for the positive efforts the Japanese Government and Prime Minister Kaifu have made to restore and develop the bilateral relations."
 
Treaty Took Effect in 1968
 One of the aims of Mr. Kaifu's visit was to encourage China to play a more active role in controlling weapons sales and the proliferation of nuclear arms.
Mr. Wu today did not explain why his country had long opposed the treaty, but China in the past has suggested that the pact was an effort by the superpowers to dominate other countries. Beijing has said the treaty discriminated against developing countries and hindered international cooperation for peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
The treaty, the subject of intensive negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union in the mid-1960's, bans the export of nuclear weapons and nuclear-arms technology. It went into effect in 1968.
The treaty was controversial because it sought to make permanent the nuclear-weapons monopoly of those nations that then possessed such weapons -- the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China -- and sought pledges from other countries nt to acquire any. The treaty also committed the nuclear powers to work toward total nuclear disarmament and to help nonnuclear nations that sign the accord to develop peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
Arms control experts say China's nuclear arsenal is much smaller than those of the United States, Soviet Union, Britain or France. According to a report by Jane's Information Group, China has a nuclear arsenal that consists of 1,455 devices, both strategic and tactical. Many of those include warheads on land-based missiles, but China also has bombs, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and mines and shells.
The Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control has reported that China has transferred sensitive nuclear material or technology to Pakistan, India, South Africa, Algeria and countries in South America.
In addition to seeking Chinese acceptance of the nonproliferation treaty, the United States has been pressing Beijing in the last year to curb its missile sales. Nevertheless, China went ahead recently with the sale to Pakistan of a package of M-11 missiles, which can carry nuclear warheads. It is apparently considering the sale of M-9 missiles to Syria.
China indicated recently that it was considering joining the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international agreement to curb the spread of missiles, but the issue was not raised at today's meeting, according to a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Sadaaki Numata.
 
Issue of Arms Transfers
 Mr. Numata said Prime Minister Kaifu had pressed China for support in Japan's effort to sponsor a United Nations resolution calling upon countries to report weapons transfers. But China said only that it was willing to discuss the subject and gave no commitments.
Japan is now offering low-interest loans to China, and the Chinese have made a request for more economic assistance. But the only announcement of economic aid today was a new donation, worth $1.5 million, in disaster relief for Chinese regions devastated by flooding last month. Japan already had given $500,000 worth of aid.
One reason bilateral ties have improved relatively smoothly is that Japan has tended not to criticize China's human rights abuses harshly. In today's meeting, Mr. Kaifu seemed to touch lightly on human rights issues, referring to the concerns expressed at the recent summit meeting of the seven major industrialized countries about China's process of democratization.
Mr. Kaifu did not seem to win any assurances from China that Communist North Korea would allow international inspection of its nuclear installations.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
BEIJING-HANOI TIES WARM
 BEIJING, Aug. 10 -- China and Vietnam announced today that they hoped to normalize relations, and called for further consultations in the near future.
A reconciliation between the two Communist neighbors, after a dozen years of enmity and occasionally armed conflict, would reflect the steps taken toward resolving the civil war in Cambodia. A reconciliation would also improve the chances that a lasting peace could be achieved in Cambodia.
China supported North Vietnam in its war against the American-backed South, but Beijing and Hanoi turned on each other after the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia at the end of 1978 and ousted the Chinese-supported Khmer Rouge Government. In the spring of 1979, China and Vietnam fought a border war.
The announcement today came in a joint communique issued after three days of talks between Chinese Foreign Ministry officials and Nguyen Dy Nien, Vietnam's Deputy Foreign Minister.
The communique said Hanoi and Beijing agreed that a comprehensive political settlement in Cambodia should be achieved "on the basis of a framework document of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council." That seemed to be a sign that Vietnam and China favor a United Nations plan for elections in Cambodia.
The statement may have been meant to allay fears that the two countries planned to have Cambodian factions loyal to them simply share power in Cambodia without ever consulting the Cambodian people.

HEADLINE: More Cases Expected in S.& L. Fraud

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
THE savings and loan scandals that have grabbed most of the headlines have focused public attention on states like California and Texas, but Federal law-enforcement officials say New Jersey has emerged as one of the states with the highest incidence of corruption in some of its lending institutions.
Michael Chertoff, the United States Attorney for New Jersey, said that in just the past year his office had charged 42 people in connection with major bank and savings and loan fraud totaling almost $90 million. Thirty-eight of the defendants have been convicted or have entered guilty pleas, and four are awaiting trial. 
 "There are three ways banks and thrifts can get into trouble: bad luck, bad investments or bad conduct," he said. Some of the bad conduct, he said, was concealed through much of the economic boom of the 1980's, when developers were covering the landscape with office parks and condominiums, and savings and loans and banks were vying to make loans.
 
The Most Takeovers in the Northeast
 Mr. Chertoff said New Jersey had experienced more closures and takeovers of financial institutions, especially savings and loans, than any other state in the Northeast, and said he expected evidence of corruption to continue to surface for some time to come.
"When a savings and loan closes, the F.B.I. immediately gets involved along with the regulators," he said. "Once the institution is closed, the review is like a dead body autopsy; it's infinitely easier to see what caused the closure and whether corruption was involved when it's over."
Mr. Chertoff said that the fraud investigations were time-consuming and labor-intensive and that his staff was being expanded to handle the anticipated growing caseload.
The recession revealed the weakness in many of the projects and also made it more difficult for corrupt officials to hide their misdeeds, Mr. Chertoff said. "It's like a tide rolling out, leaving the litter on the beach exposed," he said.
Gary Penrith, agent in charge of the Newark office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said that when the agency's agents and auditors assisted the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in examining some troubled lending institutions, it was fairly easy to spot signs of insider transactions and properties on which loans were based that were overappraised.
He said agents were not empowered to conduct criminal investigations at that time, but left their business cards with bank employees and encouraged them to call if they had anything to report. In time, the telephones began to ring.
"Some people who knew something felt they had nobody to tell before," he said. "They wanted to clear their consciences."
At one time, Mr. Penrith said, he had 11 active cases in his office.
 
Scheme Generated $10.5 Million
 One of the largest bank frauds in recent years ended when one of the principals turned himself in to Mr. Chertoff's office in August 1989. James Fredericks, a former cashier at the Montgomery National Bank in Somerset County, told of a scheme that had succeeded for eight years and generated $10.5 million through the sale of phony repurchase agreements.
Customers were asked to lend the bank money in return for repurchase agreements made out on bank stationery that told when the loans would be repaid and specified the rates of interest. The bank was declared insolvent in June 1990 because of its losses and taken over by the F.D.I.C.
Mr. Fredericks pleaded guilty to conspiracy and mail fraud charges and agreed to cooperate with the Government. Michael Schneiderman, a former assistant vice president, was convicted of conspiracy, bank fraud and tax fraud, Mr. Chertoff said. Both are awaiting sentencing.
Mr. Chertoff also said that judges were handing out prison sentences for bank fraud, a so-called white-collar crime that in the past usually drew nothing more than probation, restitution and a fine.
Eugene Unger, vice president of the Fidelity Mutual Savings and Loan Association in Westmont, pleaded guilty in August 1990 to the embezzlement of $6 million over a 16-year period, by diverting customers' deposits, manipulating bank records and creating fictitious accounts, Mr. Chertoff said. In March 1991, Mr. Unger received a four-year sentence and ordered to pay back the $6 million.
 
Not All Show Remorse
 Richard Halajian, owner of the New Jersey Yacht Corporation, based in Brielle, was convicted of defrauding local banks out of close to $583,000 through a check-kiting scheme, Mr. Chertoff said. In January 1991 he was sentenced to 18 months in prison and was ordered to make restitution.
Not all defendants show remorse for their misdeeds, even when they admit them in open court, Mr. Chertoff said. He said the guilty plea of Donald Moskowitz, former president of the failed United Savings Bank/ SLA of Paterson, amounted to "a litany of excuses."
"He was watching all the people making money on Wall Street during the 1980's, and he decided that he worked very hard and was entitled to help himself," Mr. Chertoff said.
Mr. Moskowitz pleaded guilty in September 1990 and admitted that he had used bank funds for personal expenses, taken kickbacks from loan customers and evaded personal income taxes, Mr. Chertoff said.
A report released by the United States Attorney's office said the former bank official admitted causing the bank to pay more than $224,000 for unauthorized life insurance policies, with total death benefits of $2.75 million payable to his mother; at least $52,000 in health-care and homemaking expenses for his mother; at least $40,000 in personal expenses charged to bank credit cards, including restaurant, hotel and travel bills, and $10,000 for personal limousine and florist expenses for his friends, his wife and his mother.
He also generated kickbacks in the form of cash, jewelry, furniture and clothing for himself, the report said.
 
Bank Problems Said to Be Few
 Robert C. Forrey, president of the New Jersey Bankers Association, said most of the problems uncovered in New Jersey had been with savings and loans.
"Problems with banks are still few and far between, but we deplore it when it happens and are heartily in favor of steps being taken by law enforcement to correct any problems," he said. "There are 40,000 employees in the banking industry in New Jersey, so these abuses are basically unusual.
"Employees who find anything wrong are required first to tell their supervisors and then law-enforcement officials, and we're proud of their record in following that policy."
Mr. Chertoff said that most of the first wave of cases opened to view by the recession had been dealt with, but that information gathered in these investigations had convinced Justice Department officials in Washington that much more remained to be done.
"We're getting 16 additional people in New Jersey to work on nothing but bank and savings and loan fraud," he said. "We expect to continue to develop cases for the foreseeable future."
 
CHARGES AND PLEAS
 Here are some of the major bank and savings and loan fraud cases prosecuted by the office of the United States Attorney for New Jersey:
City Federal Savings Bank of Somerset: Declared insolvent in December 1989, it has been liquidated with an estimated loss to the Government of $1.5 billion, making it one of the five most costly failures, to taxpayers, in United States history. William J. Spagnoli, a former senior vice president, was indicted in January on charges of taking more than $2.5 million in kickbacks from real-estate developers, four of whom have pleaded guilty to paying the bribes. Mr. Spagnoli, who denies the charges, is scheduled to come to trial next month.
United Savings Bank/SLA: described by officials as one of the country's top 100 fraud-ridden savings and loan associations, United Savings was taken over by the Government in April 1990. Shortly afterward, Donald Moskowitz, the former president of the Paterson-based savings and loan, and Ronald Rudd, the former controller, entered guilty pleas to bank fraud and other charges. Mr. Rudd was sentenced to six months in Federal prison and fined $60,000 in May of this year. Mr. Moskowitz faces a maximum of 30 years and $1.35 million in fines.
Montgomery National Bank: Two former officers were convicted in a $10.5 million bank fraud by using using fraudulent repurchase agreements. One of the principals in the scheme, James Fredericks, a former cashier, turned himself into the United States Attorney's office, collapsing the scheme, which had run for eight years. He later pleaded guilty to conspiracy and mail fraud and is cooperating with the Government. Michael Schneiderman, a former assistant vice president, was convicted on 12 counts of conspiracy, bank fraud and tax fraud. Both men are awaiting sentencing. The bank, unable to recover from the losses because of the scheme, was declared insolvent in June 1990.
Midlantic National Bank: Anthony J. Surano, the owner of a mortgage banking firm, pleaded guilty to his role in defrauding the Newark-based Midlantic of more than $7 million between September 1986 and October 1988. He received a sentence of 37 months in prison, the maximum under Federal sentencing guidelines.
First Fidelity Bank: Neil F. Cohen, an auto dealer and part owner of the Ritz nightclub in Manhattan, and Antranig A. Arzoomanian, a former senior vice president of the Newark-based First Fidelity, were indicted in February 1989 on charges of conspiracy and perjury in connection with $3.4 million in bad loans. Mr. Arzoomanian had approved the loans and letters of credit to Mr. Cohen in return for the use of Mercedes-Benzes, cash and other gifts. Mr. Cohen eventually went bankrupt. Both men pleaded guilty. Mr. Arzoomanian received an 18-month sentence and Mr. Cohen 30 months.

HEADLINE: Lower Skyline, Higher Aspirations

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER

 BODY:
It isn't going to be built tomorrow -- nothing is in New York -- but when it finally does happen, Riverside South, the huge project planned for the 72-acre former Penn Central rail yards on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, now stands a real chance of being a cause for celebration rather than embarrassment.
 The much-debated plan -- in its most complete and successful version yet -- has just been made public. It calls for a lively, Central Park West-inspired skyline of slender, fancifully topped towers along a southern extension of Riverside Drive and Riverside Park. It is a romantic vision of the New York we have always known, not a science-fiction vision of a New York that will never be. And the world's tallest building, the centerpiece of previous plans, has disappeared altogether. 
 It almost wasn't so promising. The first versions of Trump City, as the mega-project was once known, were the architectural equivalent of junk bonds: highly leveraged hubris masquerading as substance. These early schemes, which were also to have included a shopping mall big enough to make Paramus weep, were a prize example of 1980's excess.
 But last March Mr. Trump announced that he would abandon his plan in favor of one developed by a coalition of civic groups for the site, which runs along the Hudson River from 59th to 72d Streets. The report of his abrupt about-face hit urban development circles with about the same impact that the news that the Soviet Union had given up on Communism had in political circles.
 Don't laugh; there are more similarities between Mr. Trump and the Soviet Union than one might think. After all, the developer and the country are motivated by the same impulse: survival. Mr. Trump knew that it would be a freezing day in August before his own plan could ever win approval and, like any skillful politician, he jumped on the opposition bandwagon so deftly that he made it look like his own.
The years of battling over the site won't end with the unveiling of this new design, of course; the political process in New York is never simple, and as the project moves through its long months of official hearings there are bound to be complaints that it is still too big, still too elaborate, still too indifferent to the needs of the city.
 It is big, it is elaborate, and it does not do a great deal to ameliorate New York's social problems. Of course, if the plan contained housing for half the city's homeless and a hospital in which the developers promised to cure cancer there would still be some objections to it: so things go in New York, the city in which saying no is always politically correct.
 But on balance, the plan just unveiled for Riverside South is right. It is dense enough to be economically viable, open enough to provide the city with vast and valuable new public space. It is intelligently tied in to the existing city, yet it holds the promise of being a special, even a unique, place.
 The basis of the scheme is a plan prepared by the architect Paul Willen (initially for the coalition of civic groups as a means of showing that there was an alternative to the Trump proposals) to extend Riverside Drive and Riverside Park southward beyond 72d Street and run the West Side Highway below street level for much of the site. Buildings containing apartments and some commercial space would go up along the eastern edge of the 13-block-long site, and a huge park would fill the western portion, running from the buildings down to the waterfront. In the months since Mr. Trump joined his own opposition, a team of architects led by David Childs and Marilyn Taylor of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill has been at work fleshing the Willen plan, essentially an outline, into reality.
 Key to Mr. Willen's design was his suggestion that the West Side Highway, now an elevated road running along the Hudson River, be moved to the inland portion of the site. Mr. Trump's plan, designed by the architectural firm of Cooper, Robertson & Partners (replacing an earlier and still more outrageous Trump plan by Helmut Jahn), left the elevated highway in place next to the river, cutting off the project's park from the waterfront. Vast towers were to have filled the rest of the site, and the scale would have been overwhelming.
Mr. Willen's design, on the other hand, bespoke a certain modesty and reasonableness. Not the characteristics one has associated with Donald Trump, to be sure, but the 1990's will do that to a man. So far Mr. Trump has been forthright in his support of this project's design principles, contrary though they are to all he zealously fought for up to a few months ago. Instead of huge towers, the Willen scheme called for lower buildings, set along streets that very much resembled the traditional streets of Manhattan.
 The current design team -- which, in addition to Mr. Childs and Ms. Taylor, includes Mr. Willen and Steven Robinson, an architect who represents the community's interests -- is working under the direction of Richard A. Kahan, the developer and former public official who played the critical role in conceiving the present form of Battery Park City in lower Manhattan, surely the finest large-scale development of the last decade anywhere in the nation. Mr. Trump, as developer, is paying the bills and makes the major decisions, but as planning has progressed the entity that has been calling most of the shots is the Riverside South Planning Corporation, which Mr. Kahan now heads and whose board contains a mix of representatives from nonprofit community groups.
 The plan as it now stands calls for 8.3 million square feet of space to be spread out over the site, down from the more than 10 million square feet called for in Mr. Trump's plan. Most of the apartments would be in buildings set along the curved extension of Riverside Drive; at the southern end there would be commercial buildings, including a large film and television studio complex. In a magnificent note of irony, the site that was to have contained Mr. Trump's dream, the world's tallest building, is now to be a void, an entry square in front of the studio structure.
 The most striking thing about the Riverside South plan is the new skyline it projects: a curving, up-and-down sequence of buildings, ranging in height from roughly 15 to more than 50 stories, with lively tops based heavily on the profiles of the skyscrapers of the 1920's and 30's. The tall buildings are relatively slender and carefully placed, so that their height becomes not an oppressive mass but an energizing force on the skyline. It's a reminder that height alone is rarely the enemy in urban design: it's the combination of height and bulk that does a skyline in.
 The placement of the tallest buildings is surprising, and at first glance seems altogether wrong. Instead of putting the height in the middle of the site, where it would be opposite the widest section of the new Riverside Park, the architects have set the biggest towers to the north and south of this point. But it makes sense, for it confers on the generous open curve of the three-block park space the maximum amount of sunlight. And it makes the whole skyline a much livelier and less predictable profile.
 It could still be a bit less pat: looking at the model you wonder if the architects projected a sine curve onto it. But there are some subtle elements, such as the decision not to put a very tall building at the northernmost point at the corner of 72d Street, a space that is given over instead to a curving building that, like the venerable apartment buildings at the corner of 116th Street and Riverside Drive, makes a gracious transition between the side streets and the formal boulevard. Taller buildings are set just south of this point, at 70th and 71st Streets.
 The plan also helps solve the problem of Freedom Place, a truly wretched street tucked behind the huge Lincoln Towers project next door to the Riverside South site, by including a mix of retail and commercial space and landscaping to enliven Freedom Place's banality. It doesn't make Lincoln Towers go away, of course, but it helps.
 The biggest buildings face west, across the new park toward the river, and there is a temptation to worry when a plan like this turns its back on the rest of the city. I don't see this as a real concern, any more than the present buildings of Central Park West -- in so many ways the models for Riverside South -- can be criticized for turning their backs toward Columbus Avenue. This is a vast set of buildings facing the river, and it makes perfect sense for it to turn its best face in that direction; it will be up to the architects to make sure that the designs at street level tie the project into the rest of the urban fabric there, on the ground, where it matters.
 The architects have thus far put forth only a rough proposal for the buildings, and not for the park itself, which will follow in the next few months. Mr. Kahan speaks of his desire not to replicate Riverside Park literally, but to try to rethink the idea of the large urban park and "ask what a major public space in this day and age means to different ethnic groups, and to see what the ecologists can bring to it as well."
 A noble idea, though here it is worth remembering that the great models of urban parks, like Central Park across town, were hardly elitist; indeed, Frederick Law Olmsted, the co-designer of Central Park, wrote of his awareness of the different recreational needs "of the Sicilian and the Irishman," and of his determination that the park serve them all.
 But what of the issues of density and social good that preoccupy so many critics of this plan? Is it too much, in the end giving the city too little? Yes, a little less building would be better. But this is a huge piece of land, and it has to be developed in accordance with some economic reality; less building will mean less park and less public space.
 So, too, with affordable housing. Ideally, there would be significant affordable housing as part of a plan of this kind. It's all a matter of how the trade-off is managed: since the government has nothing to contribute today in terms of subsidizing housing, the money for it has got to come from somewhere. Since the park is to be paid for by the developer, a little less park could mean a little more affordable housing.
 But as things now stand, the public realm does just fine. We have the chance for splendid, even sumptuous, urban design, and generous, perhaps even important, public open space. In a city whose public realm has been pushed to the wall by private greed over the last decade, the Riverside South plan offers the promise of turning things around.

HEADLINE: Political Talk

BYLINE: By Sam Howe Verhovek

 BODY:

Neutral but Leaning
 At the core of the struggle over redistricting of seats for the New York City Council has been minority politicians' demands that they be better represented on the expanded council, whose primary is on Sept. 12. But sometimes personal ties can conflict with this theoretical goal. One apparent case involves the loyalties of the Manhattan Democratic leader, Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., who is black.
 Although he has been in the forefront of calls for greater minority representation on the council, other Manhattan Democratic leaders now say that Mr. Farrell seems to be favoring a longtime associate, Stanley E. Michels, who is white, over the two black hopefuls for one of the seats whose boundaries have been redrawn to favor a black candidate.
 The race is in the new Seventh District which includes portions of central and west Harlem, along with the western halves of Washington heights and Inwood. Mr. Michels, a four-term Council incumbent, is battling the Harlem district leader, Peggy M. Shepard, and a lawyer, C. Vernon Mason.
 Mr. Farrell, one of the highest-ranking black officials in the state, is publicly neutral in the race. But though he is close to Ms. Shepard, four party officials in northern Manhattan interviewed last week say Mr. Farrell has made it clear he is backing Mr. Michels.
 Mr. Farrell insisted in an interview that he was not endorsing anyone in the race. But he admitted to a warm feeling for Mr. Michels, who has been his ally in local politics for a quarter-century. "I've always considered Stan a very hard worker for our community," he said.
 
 
 
Song's the Same
 A flurry of national attention surrounded last Friday's meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors in Hyannis, Mass., after its head, Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston, predicted that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo would use the occasion to signal an intention to run for President.
 But even before Mr. Cuomo stepped into the hotel to speak, he gave a clear signal that there would be no such signal.
 Anyway, the signal was this: As he stepped out of his car, the Governor was greeted by Harry Belafonte, who was in town for an engagement at the Cape Cod Melody Tent.
 "You know, Harry," said Mr. Cuomo, who appeared bemused by the gaggle of national reporters who quickly surrounded him, "there's really nothing new in this speech. It'll be as familiar to you as your 'Day-O!' is to me."
 
 
 
For Love Nor Money
 Has New York State fallen out of love with itself?
 Not really. But like a devoted suitor who cannot afford an engagement ring, it no longer has the money to tell the world how it feels.
 It all gets back to budget problems. The state tourism budget, which reached a high of $15.8 million in 1988, officials said, is now down to $3 million. And since March, the state has not broadcast any of its "I (heart) NY" television commercials, some of which have featured Mr. Cuomo telling viewers, "you never knew love could be like this."
 While the State Department of Economic Development spent about $2 million last year on summer-oriented tourism advertising, there have been no such public displays of affection this year, although the state is hoping to begin a modest campaign in the fall.
 
 
 
Running or Jumping.
 Speaking of those who may or may not be running for President, add Ralph Nader to the list. The consumer advocate met recently with two of his former staff members who have filed papers with the Federal Election Commission to form a committee to draft Mr. Nader.
 Spearheading the effort is Carl Mayer, a Hofstra University law professor who worked for Mr. Nader's Center for the Study of Responsive Law about 10 years ago.
 "If enough citizens join together and indicate that they want him in the arena, he may relent," Mr. Mayer said. Mr. Mayer and his partner, Matthew Rothschild, publisher of The Progressive magazine, have not decided whether Mr. Nader should run as a Democrat or as an independent.
 The two organizers are optimistic about talking Mr. Nader into a run. "So far, " Mr. Rothschild said, "he hasn't told us to jump in the lake."

HEADLINE: Franchises Lure Seasoned Executives

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
WHEN Jeffrey Weiner saw the writing on the wall where he worked, he said, he began to consider going into business for himself.
Mr. Weiner, a 40-year-old former computer-leasing executive from Purchase, who described himself as the "top sales guy, making in excess of six figures a year for several years," said that he did not like the way his company was being managed and that he "wanted to have control of my own destiny." 
 Because he believes corporate executives today are not prepared to become small-business owners, he said, "I thought a franchise was the way to go. And I was very interested in a good master franchise area, such as Westchester or Fairfield."
Through a master franchise, a franchisee buys the right to a geographic territory, instead of just one location. The buyer then subfranchises as many locations as the area can support.
 
An Option to Making the Doughnuts
 Former high-level employees like Mr. Weiner or early retirees with golden parachutes may not be willing to "make the doughnuts or dish out the yogurt," said Thomas Everett of Franchise Service Consultants in Purchase, but their business experiences and access to capital makes them prime candidates for such franchises.
And Westchester has a plethora of such seasoned executives, said Peter I. Hoppenfeld, a franchise consultant in Mamaroneck. "Already the wave of middle and upper managers who have left corporate ranks have added a different dimension to franchising," he said.
Mr. Weiner is still looking for the right master franchise for him. After missing Blockbuster Video "by a couple of months," he said, he hopes to find something in sports memorabilia or video games.
Mr. Weiner is one example of the growth in franchises and master franchises, not only in Westchester, but also nationwide.
 
More Than Fast Food
 "Mention franchising and most people immediately think of fast food," Mr. Hoppenfeld said. "But these days, virtually every line of consumer business uses franchising in some form or another."
Mr. Hoppenfeld, a lawyer who is a partner in the S. H. Development Group, a franchise advisory service, said, "In my estimation there are probably about 5,000 franchisees in Westchester at this time. As for major franchises, the major franchisor in the country, Pepsico, which has Taco Bell and Pizza Hut among others, is here. Carvel was here until very recently. In the metropolitan area, including Westchester, Fairfield and greater New York, I would estimate that there are dozens of major franchisors headquartered in the area."
"It's probably the best way people can get into their own businesses," Mr. Everett said. "It is also one of the safest." Figures from the Commerce Department show that 80 percent of small businesses fail in their first year of operation. But the failure rate for franchises is about 5 percent.
Consultants who work with the Everett organization include several former International Business Machines executives, who go to outplacement companies to speak about franchising. "We talk about the up and down side of franchising," Mr. Everett said. "There's a lot of skepticism at first, but by the end of the meeting, the people in the audience -- who are executives aged 40 to 60 -- are pretty enthusiastic." Mr. Weiner attended one of those outplacement sessions in his search for a master franchise.
 
Getting in on the Ground Floor
 The returns on a master franchise can be very lucrative, said Carol Hance, director of Kidder Peabody, an investment banking firm in Manhattan that looks to franchises as investment opportunities.
"Master franchises are well suited to seasoned executives who aren't going to start their own business by flipping hamburgers," Ms. Hance said. "They're able to use their business skills to sell and monitor new franchises in their master-franchise territory and in return they get a monthly royalty from their franchisees. Some multi-unit franchises are already generating $200 million in annual sales."
Buyers of master franchises, Mr. Hoppenfeld said, are interested in building a good-size business. "They want to get in on the ground floor of a particular industry."
 
For Sale: Organic Lawn Care
 And in a recession, some companies, especially those in the retail business, are using franchising as a means of raising capital and lowering overhead expenses, Mr. Hoppenfeld said.
Others, like a client of his who is in the organic-lawn-care business, are using franchising to expand. Franchising helps companies expand quickly because the franchisee puts up the capital to open a new outlet. Once a franchise is operating, its owner pays the franchiser a monthly royalty of 2 to 10 percent of total sales.
In return for this capital, the franchiser usually supplies training, the territory, advertising assistance and supplies, Mr. Hoppenfeld said.
Stanley Kapica of Armonk, a partner in Turf Specialists of Middletown, said he expected to be marketing franchises, which will be priced at less than $10,000, by early next year.
Mr. Kapica, a former marketing executive, said he had beome interested in Turf Specialists when he began selling organic plant food to its owner, John Jones.
 
'An Emerging Industry'
 "We now have a joint-venture partnership," he said. "There has been a heightened interest and concern for the environment that shows up in Turf Specialists's business. I strongly feel that this is an emerging industry. I believe that more and more people are going to want to have organic products: not only homeowners but golf courses, apartment complexes. I think it is a growth market."
Franchises have also been growing rapidly overseas. "Especially those in the fast- food category," Ms. Hance said. "American executives are snapping them up for Eastern Europe and Mexico."
Similarly, Mr. Hoppenfeld's company recently became allied with Price Waterhouse, the international accounting firm, to provide franchise advisory services to Price Waterhouse's 450 offices worldwide. "Companies around the world are evaluating franchising as a method of distribution and expansion," he said.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN: Stowe

BYLINE: By JANET NELSON; JANET NELSON frequently writes about the outdoors.

 BODY:
From various spots around Stowe, Vt., in summer, it's easy to see how Mount Mansfield's Nosedive trail got its name. Most skiers who have gone down the trail's upper turns probably think the name alludes to its steepness. But from lower elevations, when Mount Mansfield is silhouetted against a deep blue summer sky, the profile of a man's face is clearly visible; below his nose is the Nosedive trail.
Summer business here is now estimated to exceed winter business, filling the 5,000 beds in the center village and along the Mountain Road (State Route 108) on most weekends. As in winter, the focus is on sports and the outdoors. The warm-weather schedule also includes classical concerts, repertory theater and exhibits at the village art center. 
 Some longtime visitors are not completely pleased with the changes brought by increasing numbers of tourists. They remember the Stowe of sleepier years when the Mountain Road was not so congested or dense with mini-malls. Many of the resorts are gentrified motels with original structures that date back 30 or more years, but new additions have changed their character.
For a booklet on accommodations and dining, contact Stowe Area Association, Main Street, Box 1320, Stowe, Vt. 05672; (802) 253-6617.
 
The Outdoors
 Mount Mansfield, highest peak in the state, attracts hikers to its 4,400-foot summit. There is a four-and-a-half-mile Toll Road ($10) that ends at the base of the nose on Mount Mansfield. Some visitors prefer taking the gondola ($9.50 round trip) to the Cliff House restaurant, lower on the mountain, and hiking down.
Smugglers Notch, a narrow pass with cliffs that reach 1,000 feet on either side, offers more difficult climbs. The Notch is said to have got its name in the War of 1812 when cattle were smuggled into New England from Canada. Over the years, the pass has grown from a footpath to an automobile road, but it is so narrow and winding that it is closed in winter. Even in summer, drivers pass through slowly, hugging the right side.
The easiest and most accessible hike is along the five-mile Recreation Path, a paved thoroughfare that starts in the center of the village and weaves toward Mount Mansfield. Bikes and roller blades can be rented at outfitters along the route, but most people hike or jog. Besides the Recreation Path, the region has an abundance of trails, including the Long Trail, which crosses Mount Mansfield and connects with 20 other hiking routes.
Golf is popular because of the 18-hole, par-71 course at the Stowe Country Club, (802) 253-4893. Greens fees are $36; cart rental, $14. There is a nine-hole course at the Farm Resort, (802) 888-3525, six miles north of Stowe on Route 100. Greens fees are $14 weekdays, $16 weekends; cart rental, $11. About 10 minutes away, the Copley Country Club, (802) 888-3013, off Maple Street in Morrisville, has an 18-hole course. Greens fees are $14; cart rental $17.
There is a 9-hole course in Waterbury, also about 10 minutes' drive from Stowe, at the Blush Hill Club, (802) 244-8974, off Exit 10 of Interstate 89. Greens fees are $15.75 on weekdays, $18 on weekends; cart rental, $15.75.
Many lodges offer packages with discount golf fees at the Stowe Country Club, and golf can be studied at the Natural Asset Golf School at Stoweflake Inn, (802) 253-7355, on the Mountain Road, which has two-day weekend or five-day midweek programs for guests at the resort as well as for those staying elsewhere. The five-day program costs $895 for each of two people sharing a room and includes accommodations, breakfast and dinner daily, daily morning instruction sessions and four days of golf.
There are about 50 tennis courts at lodges and inns, but the Topnotch Racquet Club, (802) 253-9649, on the Mountain Road, is the center of tennis with 4 indoor and 10 outdoor courts with rates of $15 an hour for the public and $10 for guests at the resort. In Stowe village, the high school tennis courts are free.
Horseback riding is also available at Edson Hill Manor, (802) 253-8954, on Edson Hill Road, where lessons cost $30 an hour and trail rides are $18 for 50 minutes, and at Topnotch, (802) 253-8585, with rates of $20 an hour for guided trail ride, $35 an hour for private lessons.
 
Events

The Grand Prix Horse Show, Aug. 14 to 25 at the Trapp Family Lodge, is the final test for riders who have entered a series of jumping events in Vermont. During the week, preliminary and schooling classes compete all day. On Saturday, starting at 1 P.M., 30 or more top riders from around the world compete in the International Jumping Derby. The fee to watch is $7, $5 for children.
Polo is another attraction with a series of matches through the summer. Most of the teams are from New England, but a few foreign groups add spice. The matches (free to spectators) are held several weekends a month at the Stowe Polo Field off Route 100 north of the village.
The Mountain Road antique market is held in three tents at the Topnotch Field from Aug. 31 to Sept. 1. More than 100 vendors participate. Entry fee is $3.
At the Foliage Craft Fair at the Topnotch Tennis Center on Sept. 28 and 29, about 160 Vermont artisans, many from the Stowe region, offer wares for sale. Entry fee: $4.
 
Performing Arts
 The Stowe Stage Company, (802) 253-7944 or (800) 388-4253, presents "Godspell" on Aug. 16 and 24; "Twelfth Night" on Aug. 17 and 23; "Sound of Music" on Aug. 14 and 21; "Equus" on Aug. 15 and 20; "Comedy of Errors" on Aug. 13 and 22, and "Judevine" from Aug. 27 to 31.

Where to Stay
 There are close to 70 lodges in Stowe. About half of them qualify as country inns. Most establishments offer package plans with or without meals.
The Green Mountain Inn, Post Office Box 60, (800) 445-6629 or (802) 253-7301, at Stowe's main intersection of Routes 100 and 108, has been an inn from its founding in 1833. Rates: $45 to $65 a person a night. Behind the original facade, however, is a renovated interior plus an expansion that includes an outdoor swimming pool.
The Trapp Family Lodge, (800) 826-7000 or (802) 253-8511, at 42 Trapp Hill Road off Luce Hill Road, has been rebuilt from the 1980 fire that destroyed the original structure. It is still very Austrian -- and elegant and formal -- despite the modern sports center, swimming pool, tennis courts and other amenities; $180 to $210 for two.
The Stoweflake Inn and Resort, (800) 253-2232 or (802) 263-7355), Post Office Box 369, on Mountain Road, is an example of a motel-turned-resort. The rates range from $34 to $56 a person. On its 50 acres, the Stoweflake has outdoor and indoor pools, a sports center, saunas, a game room, tennis courts, lawn games, a golf practice tee, a conference center, a restaurant and a bar.
The Hadleigh House, 1386 Pucker Street, (802) 253-7703, is a converted farmhouse dating from the early 1800's with just three guest rooms. Rates are $55 a person with breakfast. The 1860 House Bed and Breakfast Inn, (800) 248-1860 or (802) 253-7351, Post Office Box 276, on School Street, has five rooms. Rates are $75 to $105 with breakfast.
Budget choices: The Yodler, (800) 227-1108 or (802) 253-4836, 123 Mountain Road, with rates of $39 to $85 for two; Golden Kitz, (800) 548-7568 or (802) 253-4217, 1965 Mountain Road ($46 to $60), and the Salzburg Inn, (800) 448-4554 or (802) 253-8541, Post Office Box 487, Mountain Road ($57 to $67).
 
Where to Eat
 There are about 40 restaurants in the village and along the Mountain Road. Reservations usually required.
Ten Acres Lodge, (802) 253-7638, 14 Barrows Road off Luce Hill Road, is an intimate country inn that specializes in scalloped veal with Italian fontina cheese and roast lamb with Vermont chevre served with local vegetables; each $19.
Topnotch, (802) 253-8585, on the Mountain Road, has wide-ranging fare that includes a spa menu; a popular dish is Hunan duck with a spicy sauce, wild rice pancake and vegetables for $19.50.
Stubbs, (802) 253-7110, on the Mountain Road at Edson Hill Road, has a ranch-like setting and features lamb, veal and seafood. The sauteed Vermont calf's liver with balsamic shallot sauce is $12.95.
There may be a wait at Whiskers, (802) 253-8996, on the Mountain Road, but cocktails in the garden make it pleasant. Lobsters, steaks and seafood are popular; prime rib with salad bar is $14.95.
The Shed, (802) 253-4364, on the Mountain Road, specializes in burgers and unusual salads. The Shedburger, served for 25 years, is marinated in beer and spices and served on an English muffin for $4.40.
Mr. Pickwick's Polo Pub, (802) 253-7558, on the Mountain Road, has a bar with 100 different beers and pub fare featuring pot pies as well as fish and chips, which costs $7.95.
 
Shopping
 Ski shops begin their end-of-season sales in March but get serious in summer. Along Main Street, four stores have the aura of shops in earlier days. Lackey's, (802) 253-7624, is part variety store, part museum. Next door is Stafford's Pharmacy, (802) 253-7361. If Lackey's doesn't have it, Stafford's probably does.
Across the street is Val's Country Store, (802) 253-8487, carrying homemade food products -- salads, sandwiches and the like.
Shaw's General Store, (802) 253-4040), a landmark since 1895, has catered to skiers and outdoors enthusiasts since 1966. More modern is the Silver Den, (802) 253-8787, on Main Street, with a collection of silver and gold jewelry made by Vermont craftspeople. A V-shaped slalom ring costs $10 in silver, $110 in gold.
Next door, Everything Cows, (802) 253-8779, reflects the importance of the dairy industry to the state's economy. There are cows to hug, wear, view, eat; boxer shorts printed in a cow motif cost $14 to $18.
Exclusively Vermont, (802) 253-8776), around the corner on the Mountain Road, offers good design, unusual items, typical crafts -- all of them made in the state. Simon Pearce glass goblets, for example, are about $36 each.

HEADLINE: Liz Taylor's Great Society

BYLINE: By Barbara Ehrenreich; Barbara Ehrenreich is author, most recently, of "The Worst Years of Our Lives: Irreverent Notes on a Decade of Greed."

 BODY:
Hats off to Liz Taylor for her decision to marry a blue-collar man, the construction worker Larry Fortensky. Other stars talk about grave social problems. They stud the star-studded benefits. They assemble in great tuneless choirs to sing to us about the issues of the day. But Liz, bless her durable little heart, proposes to actually get something done.
The social problem in question is the one that goes by such ungainly terms as "class polarization" or the "shrinking middle class" -- the insidious economic trend that is making the rich richer, the poor poorer and the middle class exceedingly nervous. 
 Liz must have read the same grim bulletin that just crossed my desk, "Selective Prosperity: Increasing Income Disparities since 1977," from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. She must have shuddered delicately, much as I did, at the news that middle-income households are barely holding their own while the richest 1 percent of Americans have seen their incomes more than double since the late 1970's. She must have called together her hairdressers, nutritionists, masseuses, publicists -- and for all we know her resident economist -- and cried, "What in God's name can I do?"
And they must have pointed out to her the particular problem of young blue-collar males, whose income in real dollars has been declining for over a decade, leaving them loath to marry. After all, when a blue-collar man marries a socioeconomic equal -- say, a waitress or data-entry clerk -- he takes on a lifelong commitment to fast food, discount furniture and unpaid medical bills. But there is, Liz's staff must have said, an alternative.
The surprising thing is that the Democrats haven't picked up on the Liz Taylor approach. They remain mired in comparatively stale, old-fashioned ideas like extending unemployment benefits. They know that the sure-fire remedy for inequality -- the redistribution of wealth -- is considered boneheaded and atavistic. Unless, of course, the Republicans are promoting it, in which case the redistribution invariably goes uphill. But the Democrats have yet to see the potential of financially redistributive marriages, which are arguably the only truly "pro-family" approach to the economic woes of the middle class.
Consider your average female movie star, with assets in the seven-figure range. If she marries Warren Beatty, which is always a possibility, she will be locking her wealth into the colossal loot already accumulated by those at the top of the pyramid. There is, for example, the disquieting spectacle of Jane Fonda, erstwhile friend of the dispossessed, pooling her aerobics fortune with Ted Turner's vast earnings from CNN. But if our average star were to marry a truck driver, or, better yet, a bus boy. . . .
Are there enough stars, one might ask? Just as the middle class is shrinking, so too is the class of female film stars, who have little to contribute to the great cinematic theme of our age -- the effect of steroids on the human male.
Here I can only point to Madonna, who is shown in her recent film with a constant retinue of a half-dozen young men who might otherwise be dragging down the employment statistics.
Will these couples get along? In the past it was fashionable to think of men like Larry Fortensky as crude clones of Archie Bunker. But we know today that a blue-collar boyfriend is no more likely to be physically abusive than the average blue-blooded medical student. He is, furthermore, accustomed to manual labor and able to operate a vacuum cleaner or change a diaper without being moved to write a press release about it.
And in contrast to your average white male professor type, a blue-collar guy will accept the occasional tip on avoiding sexism without indulging in a full-scale tantrum on the evils of political correctness.
So I see no reason not to proceed apace with the Taylor solution. In fact, the program needn't be only for stars. I envision a vast social healing as the genders and classes come together in socially responsible mating: lawyers and lathe operators, M.B.A.'s and machinists, brokers and bicycle messengers.
After all, even the Democrats seem to agree that all the other approaches -- those involving "programs" and taxes, wages and benefits -- are too dreary and dated for words.

HEADLINE: Issues Linger in Europe's Japan Auto Pact

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 11

 BODY:
The recent agreement between the European Community and Japan to limit Japanese car imports may be the most important quota arrangement in the history of global trade.
The accord will restrict sales of Japanese cars for seven years in what will become by far the world's largest auto market once the European Community removes its internal trade barriers by the end of 1992. 
 European auto makers hailed the agreement, which was announced on July 31, saying it gives them precious time to become more efficient before they face the brunt of Japanese competition. The Continent's auto makers vow to emerge from the seven years of protection far better equipped to compete with Nissan, Toyota and Honda than Detroit's bruised and bloodied Big Three have been able to do.
But some economists say the agreement could prove a disaster, by causing the Europeans to delay efforts to become more efficient. At the same time, these economists say, the community's quotas could cause the Japanese to build more plants in Europe, just as American quotas on cars from Japan encouraged the Japanese to build assembly plants in the United States.
The first of what are likely to be many battles stemming from the vaguely worded agreement has already broken out over the issue of Japanese production in Europe. Many Europeans, notably the French and Italians, boast that they were smarter than the Americans in negotiating their agreement, asserting that the accord sets a ceiling on the number of cars the Japanese can produce in Europe.
Community officials say they negotiated the agreement with the understanding that Japan's auto makers will produce no more than 1.2 million cars in Europe by 1999 -- up from 260,000 now but well below the 1.8 million cars a year that some industry and government officials had long predicted that the Japanese would be assembling in Europe by 1999.
But the Japanese heatedly deny that the accord sets a ceiling on their European production. Indeed, the Japanese say that what pleases them most is that the agreement does not place an express ceiling on the number of cars they can assemble in Europe. According to this interpretation, Nissan and Toyota would face no barriers to expanding their British plants.
"Whether this will be 1.2 million or not, this is what the E.C. Commission said unilaterally," Yutaka Kume, president of the Nissan Motor Company, said in an interview. "This is not something that will bind the Japanese side."
Some Europeans argue that if production of these Japanese "transplants" exceeds 1.2 million units, then import ceilings should be lowered correspondingly. To the extent that the agreement encourages the Japanese to build plants in Europe, among the few clear winners here would be the European auto parts companies like the German manufacturer Robert Bosch G.m.b.H.
 
Import Limit Is 1.23 Million Cars
 The agreement, which runs from the end of 1992 to the end of 1999, in effect freezes Japanese car imports at 1.23 million units. This would give Japanese imports 8.1 percent of the 15.1 million cars that government officials expect to be sold in the European Community in 1999, compared with 12.2 million cars last year. By comparison, last year's United States market was 9.3 million cars.
Under the strict European interpretation of the accord, Japanese imports and transplants could take 16.1 percent of the market, up from the current share, which is slightly above 10 percent.
"As far as the volume manufacturers are concerned, it gives them a certain breathing space by keeping the Japanese at unnaturally low levels until the year 2000," said Stephen Reitman, an auto industry analyst for UBS Phillips & Drew, a London brokerage. "It will also help focus governments and work forces on the need to achieve competitive efficiencies."
 
Some Pain for Europe's Big Six
 Still, by giving the Japanese five additional market-share points, the accord certain will mean some pain for Europe's Big Six: Volkswagen, Fiat, Peugeot, Renault, General Motors Europe and Ford Europe.
Some pain was inevitable because the whole idea of 1992 and a barrier-free Europe was to create more robust competition. France, Italy, Britain, Spain and Portugal have long had national quotas on Japanese car imports, but with 1992 on the horizon community officials insisted on scrapping these intra-community trade barriers. In their place, however, Europe's auto makers, led by Peugeot, Renault and Fiat, insisted on communitywide quotas to shelter them from unbridled competition.
Community officials, who vow to support free trade, felt pressure to open up their market to Japanese cars, so they decided on this seven-year transition period, which includes informal, slightly higher national quotas. After 1999, all limits on Japanese cars are supposed to be lifted. Most people, however, expect auto executives to push for extending the quotas, as happened in the United States.
In France, Japanese imports will be allowed to climb to 150,000, or 5.2 percent of the country's market, from their longtime ceiling of 3 percent. In Italy, Japanese imports can climb to 138,000 or 5.3 percent of the market, up from their decades-old limit of less than 2 percent.
 
A Sacrosanct Industry
 That the community allowed the continuation of any sort of informal national quotas, thus violating the spirit of 1992, shows how sacrosanct Europe's auto industry is. Although European politicians campaign for a barrier-free Europe, few are willing to see their auto industries collapse, bringing with it lost jobs and perhaps lost elections. Renault's chairman, Raymond Levy, predicts that at least 200,000 workers will be laid off as Europe's auto makers strain to cope with Japanese competition.
Some analysts say Volkswagen and the General Motors Corporation, with its powerful Opel division, might fare the best from the agreement because they have thrived in Germany's relatively open market. Still, with considerable sales in France, Italy and Spain, they may suffer as Japan's auto makers take larger shares in those countries.
Between imports and transplants, the Japanese could take 9 percent or more in France and Italy, compared with less than 3 percent in those markets a few years ago. Since Fiat S.p.A. has about half the Italian market, and Peugeot S.A. and Renault together have three-fifths of the French market, the accord could hurt these companies more than some others.
Still, some analysts suggest that the agreement might hit Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Porsche hardest. "As with other automobile quota agreements, this will encourage an upgrading of Japanese imports," said Jeffrey Schott, an economist with the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "There will be even stronger competition on the higher end of the market where profit per unit is higher."
He said the accord could mean fatter profits for the Japanese, which they could pump back into their operations, giving them a competitive advantage.
Over all, some call the accord a victory for Japan's auto makers because it means a higher market share. But others call it a defeat for Tokyo because the Japanese were given neither free access nor the 18 percent market share that community officials had suggested last year. Hard-line officials like Prime Minister Edith Cresson of France helped bargain down Japan's allowable market share.
"It's probably the best agreement the Japanese could get without causing a significant political conflict with the E.C." said Peter Cope, an analyst with DRI/McGraw-Hill in London.
The accord -- which several officials called "a gentlemen's agreement" because it is not signed -- states, "Japan bears in mind the E.C.'s concern that the necessary adjustments of the E.C. manufacturers toward adquate levels of international competitiveness would be adversely affected if the E.C. manufacturers cannot enjoy the adequate benefit of market growth."
The agreement calls for twice-yearly talks under which the accord might be adjusted if, for instance, Japanese imports exceed anticipated levels or if European auto sales plunge.
 
Learning Detroit's Lesson
 Europe's auto makers vow to be more aggressive in improving their competitiveness than Detroit was. They say they have absorbed the lessons that Detroit learned the hard way, among them: slash costs, reorganize production, listen more closely to the customer and move more quickly from new design to production.
"In Europe it was never so much a question of quality," said one European auto executive. "It was cost. It was productivity. We haven't yet reached the productivity of the Japanese."
Because everyone assumes the Japanese will build more plants in Europe, the Europeans are straining to make their own plants as efficient and low cost as those of their archcompetitors. G.M. officials point to their new plant in Eisenach, in eastern Germany, while Volkswagen expects quality low-cost production at its new plants in Czechoslovakia and outside Barcelona, Spain. In addition to new, highly automated plants in southern Italy, Fiat is looking to projects in Poland and the Soviet Union.
"We know the Japanese challenge," said an official with G.M. Europe. "We know European car manufacturers have to improve continually."

Outside Publishing Centers, A Giant Bookstore Prospers

BYLINE: By RANDALL ROTHENBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore.

 BODY:
Great bookstores, like great restaurants, are usually associated with great cities, where they provide the world-weary with a respite from urban grit.
Yet what may be America's largest bookstore sits not in midtown Manhattan or Chicago's South Side, but on the slope of a hill near a brewery here in the nation's 32d-largest city. 
 In spacious, well-lit aisles covering a city block, Powell's Books crowds nearly a million copies of 550,000 titles. Its 132 sections -- which range from broad subjects like "Children" to categories as tiny as "Spiders" -- are a bustling literary and social oasis in downtown Portland.
The theology section, three aisles long and 10 shelves high, has five shelves devoted solely to feminist theology and two for books on sex and celibacy. The store's "Purple Room," one of six large chambers designated by colors, contains seven shelves of Japanese-language fiction.
As for the poetry section, 9,000 titles strong, "we got the Robert Bly, we got the Robert Service, we got the Robert Browning," said Michael Powell, the store's 50-year-old owner.
Powell's defies most of the conventions of modern book-selling and exemplifies what many publishing professionals believe is a resurgence of the independent bookstore after a decade of dominance by chains like Waldenbooks and B. Dalton.
With their understanding of local interests and willingness to stock many titles, many independents have shown signs of vigor. Meanwhile, the chains, which emphasize best sellers, have suffered from a recession-related decline in shopping mall traffic. Indeed, with an eye on the success of large independents, several chains are opening so-called superstores, with large and diverse stocks.
 
Plenty of Used Books
 Unlike the typical mall bookstore, with an average of about 3,000 square feet in space, Powell's has 43,000 square feet set aside in its main store for page-thumbing. While it carries virtually every popular contemporary book, half the two million volumes that Powell's expects to sell this year will be used books.
And where computers have become the lifeline of the book business, telling store owners what is in stock and when to reorder, Powell's sticks to a manual system of inventory cards, maintained by the 75 people who run the store's sections.
These section heads meet regularly with 30 used-book buyers, who acquire 3,000 books a week and do their peruse-and-purchase routine at a table just inside the store's entrance.
"We're trying to make a statement of what the store's about," said Miriam Sontz, Powell's general manager. "But we've also found that customers love to watch us buy books. It's like going into a restaurant and watching the chefs work."
 
A Challenge in Denver
 Only the Tattered Cover in Denver, with 40,000 square feet of retail space and 150,000 new titles, can challenge Powell's for the distinction of being America's largest bookstore, publishing professionals say.
They offer several explanations for the existence of places like Powell's in smaller cities outside the loop of mainstream publishing. Some believe that Portland's rainy weather makes reading a more popular pastime.
Others say that a great bookstore grows from one seed: its owner.
"Cities give rise to a Powell's and a Tattered Cover because of a Michael Powell and a Joyce Meskis," said Joe Friedman, who until recently was the membership director of the American Booksellers Association. "These people could have kept their stores at 3,000 square feet and done very well. But people were reading, so they decided to keep growing."
 
'Explosion of Reading'
 Mr. Powell has his own explanation for his store's success. "In the 80's, there was an explosion of reading," he said.
Those are encouraging words for a $17 billion industry in desperate need of hope. The American Booksellers Association projects that book sales will grow 8.2 percent this year, compared with 12.3 percent last year.
But Mr. Powell has reason for optimism, having seen his empire blossom from a 2,500-square-foot collection of used books in 1971. Today, the giant Portland store alone now sells more than $10 million worth of books a year, he said.
Other Powell's stores include a 10,000-square-foot annex for technical books, specialty stores devoted to cookbooks and travel books, and another large store in the Portland suburb of Beaverton.
There are also three Powell's stores in Chicago, where Mr. Powell began his career as a bookseller when, as a graduate student at the University of Chicago, he was encouraged by several professors, including the author Saul Bellow, to take over a bookstore. With a $3,000 stake from the sociologist Morris Janowitz, Mr. Powell assumed the lease.
He paid Professor Janowitz back within two months.

Fall in 30-Year Yields Is Not Expected Soon

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Investors and economists still expect bond yields to fall eventually from the current level of 8.22 percent for 30-year Treasury issues, but they are not optimistic that the drop will come soon.
Yields on Treasury bonds are much more influenced by traders who are looking for a quick profit in response to immediate reports on inflation and the economy than by long-term forecasts about the attractiveness of today's yields compared with predictions that next year's inflation will be below 4 percent. 
 Many analysts say this week's economic reports are not likely to create the kind of speculative fervor that would lift bond prices and lower yields. But neither are the reports likely to disprove the idea that bond yields might eventually fall as the economic recovery remains sluggish, with no upward inflation pressure.
 
7 3/4 Yield Called Possible
 "One of these days, the bond market is going to wake up and decide that inflation is below 5 percent and might even stay below 4 percent for a sustained period," said G. A. David Gray, co-director of fixed-income investments at the Boston Company, a unit of the American Express Company. "When that happens you could easily see the long bond yield drop to 7 3/4 percent."
But Mr. Gray, like many other investors, is not making any bet that a big decline in bond yields is imminent. For the time being, he expects to hold the maturity of the funds he manages about unchanged, and continue to follow a middle-of-the-road investment philosophy with maturities that match the mix of outstanding issues in the market.
Since bond yields have already fallen from nearly 8 1/2 percent as recently as July 23, the bond market may be "particularly vulnerable to less favorable news" this week about consumer prices and retail sales, said Susan Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers.
 
An Uninspiring Report
 Surveys by MMS International, an economic analysis firm, show that the Consumer Price Index for July is expected to rise four-tenths of a percentage point, an uninspiring report that would suggest an annual inflation rate still in the range of 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent. Retail sales for July are widely expected to show an increase of about four-tenths of a percent, or better than the average gain of one-tenth of a percent in the last three months, while industrial production could rise about three-tenths of a percent.
"The bond market still has bitter memories of the last recovery, when the Fed tighened as the economy picked up, and by 1984 you had 14 percent Treasury bond yields and massive losses in investment portfolios," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence Morgan Grefell. "The market remains scared of a strong economy, and it will need time to be convinced that inflation is not going to ratchet up and the Fed is not going to tighten."
 
Aug. 20 Meeting Planned
 It is widely expected that the Federal Reserve will hold short-term interest rates stable at least until the Aug. 20 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. At that meeting, many economsits expect Fed officials to settle on a policy favoring further easing moves, contingent on weak economic data and, of course, continued low inflation readings.
A review of March 1986 to March 1987 -- the last time that Treasury bond yields stayed below 8 percent (except for a few months in late 1989) -- is a reminder that a Fed move to lower interest rates may not be necessary to attract buyers to longer-term issues.
In July 1986, when 30-year Treasury bond yields averaged only 7.27 percent, the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market averaged 6.56 percent, a percentage point higher than currently, and 30-day commercial paper rates averaged 6.42 percent, or eight-tenths of a percentage point higher than now.
 
Large Amount of New Bonds
 Apart from gauging fresh economic data, the bond market is confronted by a large amount of new 8 1/8 percent Treasury bonds, which remain in the hands of dealers who bought the bonds at Thursday's auction at an average price of about 99 1/2 to yield 8.15 percent. Between July 29 and the auction, bond prices rose about 2 1/4 points, but have since dropped more than half a point.
"There is potential for more of a rally, but securities dealers bought the new Treasury issue at the top of the market and it is going to take a while to distribute," said Glenn I. Henricksen, vice president and portfolio manager at the New York Life Insurance Company.
The task of finding buyers becomes more difficult, he added, when there is an ample supply of new corporate and mortgage-backed secutities offering higher yields. With a borrowing cost of less than 9 percent available for good-quality companies, he said, "there has been talk that a good many well-known household names might come to market."

HEADLINE: Steel Hits Hard Times Again

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CLEVELAND

 BODY:
In the late 1980's, when steel producers were seeing some of their most robust times in years, industry executives boasted that their companies had become so lean that they could make money running at 60 to 65 percent of capacity.
Now, American steel plants are running at 70 percent capacity, and many industry analysts expect the steelmakers' losses to exceed $1 billion for the first half of this year. 
 American steelmakers have matched the efficiency of their German and Japanese rivals, but sinking prices, sagging demand and rising labor costs have caused them more hard times. Even as the economy shows signs of emerging from the recession, the evidence of the industry's renewed woes are abundant.
 
Potential Cash Squeeze
 On average, the large steel companies lost $50 a ton in the first quarter of this year -- for a total loss of $700 million, compared with net earnings of $400 million in last year's first quarter. And while not all steel companies have reported earnings for the second quarter -- typically the strongest quarter of the year -- analysts estimate that the industry will post operating losses of another $400 million for that three-month period, compared with operating income of $170 million in the 1990 period.
The American steelmakers' share of the domestic market has actually risen in the last year by about 3 percentage points, to about 80 percent. But continued losses will pinch the steelmakers' ability to invest in the technology necessary to keep up with foreign competitors and comply with environmental laws.
For many workers, the recent months have been eerily reminiscent of the recession in the early 80's, when thousands were laid off.
"These are the worst times I've seen since 1982," said L. E. Smith, president of Local 185 of the United Steelworkers of America, which represents workers at the LTV Steel Company's operations on the west side of Cleveland. He said about 800 workers were idled for about two months earlier this year before being recalled.
"We had hoped that the layoff days were over, but they weren't," Mr. Smith said. "You can't get any worse off than someone being without an income."
To be sure, steel producers in the United States have become much leaner and far more efficient in recent years. Sweeping plant closings, staff reductions and new equipment have caused the number of worker hours needed to produce a ton of steel to drop steadily, to fewer than 4 today, from 6 in 1988 and 11 in 1982.
Many in the industry say that continuing cutbacks in the labor force will further improve efficiency, even as layoffs, early retirements and the raises guaranteed in contracts burden companies with other costs.
Despite the current problems, Joseph N. Gross, manager of strategic planning at LTV Steel, insists that the industry is poised to benefit from the $18 billion that has been invested in plants over the last decade, with billions more to come. So long as the losses do not extend for too many quarters, he said, "the industry's capital spending plans will generally not be affected."
 
Concern Over Prices
 But many industry experts contend that the ability of the steelmakers to emerge from their slump will depend largely on their pricing. Foreign producers have faced far less pressure; steel prices in Japan are as much as $100 a ton higher than in the United States. With demand from American automobile and appliance producers slipping, steel producers have been eager to hold on to whatever market share they can.
That has meant widespread discounting. As a result, the average price for a ton of hot-rolled sheet steel -- the basic product used in everything from pipes and automobile parts to traffic signs and file cabinets -- has slid on spot markets from $345 at the beginning of last year, to about $280 now. And steel buyers said they could usually get prices that are even slightly lower.
"The biggest problem in the steel industry is the pricing situation," said John Jacobson, a steel analyst with AUS Consultants Inc. in Philadelphia. "Prices are now as low as they have been in a decade. Until they do something about the pricing situation, the steel industry will stay in trouble."
LTV Steel, the nation's third-largest producer, reported a $48.8 million loss in the first quarter, including a $32 million charge to cover future medical insurance for retirees. About 400 of the 1,000 workers laid off over the last year are still idle. The company said that its new orders had dropped and that it had had to scale back operations at the Cleveland mill, where it produces steel ingots.
"Prices are now at 1982 levels, and when you look at virtually any other commodity or product, that is simply not the case," Mr. Gross said. "There has been an impact from the recession in that we and the entire industry are worse off because we lost money. When you lose money over the long run, you can't have funds to keep the plants competitive."
The recession's impact extends far beyond LTV. The USX Corporation's steel division, the nation's largest producer, had an operating loss of $502 million in the first quarter, including charges against earnings to cover the closing of its Fairless Works steel operations near Philadelphia and the layoffs of 2,100 employees. The company said overcapacity at home and abroad and declining prices had made the plant closing necessary. USX said its steel business had a $39 million operating loss for the second quarter.
Inland Steel Industries closed its structural steel business along the Indiana shore of Lake Michigan, which produced steel for buildings, bridges and construction, earlier this year. Many of the 325 workers took early retirement or were laid off. Inland, which lost $18.7 million in the first quarter, said competition had become too sharp.
The LTV Corporation said its steel division had a $23.4 million loss in the second quarter. Bethlehem Steel, the nation's No. 2 steelmaker, reported a $29 million net loss for the second quarter.
The industry's plans for a fall pricing offensive have only a modest chance of success. LTV Steel touched off the campaign in July when it announced price increases on a number of sheet-steel products, beginning Sept. 29. Several other steel producers responded with their own increases, but many analysts doubt that the increases will stick.
Buyers resisted Bethlehem Steel's attempt to raise prices last year, forcing the company to cut its increases by half. In the industry's most recent efforts to bolster prices, Bethlehem is already undercutting its competitors. After some rivals announced plans to raise prices on some sheet-steel products by about 7 percent this fall, Bethlehem said it would only ask for 4 percent more.
 
Optimism in Industry
 But industry executives are optimistic that higher prices will stick this time. "These price increases will hold because the industry realizes that we're still at 1982 price levels," said Mr. Gross of LTV. "We have to get a return on our investment."
Executives contend that the worst times are already over. "The auto makers are talking about stronger third- and fourth-quarter schedules," said Andy Ellwain, general manager of market sales for Inland Steel. "The appliance industry also is beginning to recover, with increased production at all of our strategic appliance customers."
But analysts question the health of the industry, in view of its failure to at least break even with factories running at 70 percent of capacity. Even if demand surges, they say, steelmakers will see brighter days only if they resist the urge to reach for a larger slice of the market by cutting prices.

HEADLINE: Harry Helmsley: Unfit for Trial, but Fit for Business?

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
The people who worked with him are already beginning to talk about Harry Helmsley in the past tense, and the United States Attorney in Manhattan has dropped tax-evasion charges against him, citing what he regards as Mr. Helmsley's mental incompetence. The man who was a kingpin of New York real estate for more than five decades has receded from public view to the point of vanishing.
Yet Mr. Helmsley's immense real-estate operation is still moving along, shrunk in size, less vigorous, but possessing the many complex partnerships and service contracts that have been the foundation of his wealth. And despite the possible prison term that his wife, Leona, faces for tax evasion and his court-determined incompetence to stand trial, Mr. Helmsley appears to continue at the head of his companies.
 
'He Gives Us His Input'
 "All major decisions are made by Mr. Helmsley," said Gerald N. Schrager, the Helmsleys' real-estate lawyer and chief legal adviser and, since the legal and business troubles involving him and his wife began, the Helmsley spokesman. "He gives us his input every time he thinks it is appropriate." 
 If the 81-year-old Mr. Helmsley is in charge of holdings estimated at more than $4 billion, still by far the largest commercial real-estate brokerage in New York City, is he senile?
To what extent has Mrs. Helmsley's criminal notoriety, her infamous temper, her description by her own defense lawyer as "one tough bitch" and her depiction in a television movie as a cruel and dishonest "Queen of Mean" affected her husband's business?
And who will determine the future of the Helmsley operation?
In withdrawing 47 charges of fraud and tax evasion, Federal prosecutors relied on competency tests supervised by the State Supreme Court in Manhatttan, where the Helmsleys had faced similar state charges that were dismissed. According to court documents, those tests relied in part on evaluations conducted by doctors hired by Mr. Helmsley and his lawyers. Those doctors said Mr. Helmsley could not stand the strain of a trial.
 
No Comment by U.S. Attorney
 Asked to comment on the apparent discrepancy between Mr. Schrager's account of Mr. Helmsley's current abilities and the court finding of mental incompetence, the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment directly. The office's public information officer, Deborah Corley Guzman, said, "I would refer you to the wording of the motion to dismiss."
Mrs. Helmsley, who is now 71, was sentenced in Federal District Court in Manhattan to four years in prison for her part in the tax-fraud scheme, in which the Helmsleys' were accused of charging personal expenses to their business ventures. On July 31 the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld her conviction but sent her case back to the trial court for resentencing.
 
Finding by Psychiatrist
 On May 23, meanwhile, Dr. Murray A. Gordon, a psychiatrist, concluded that Mr. Helmsley suffered from dementia caused by hypertension and poor cerebral blood circulation. Dr. Murray wrote that the developer "lacks capacity to understand the proceedings against him, or to assist in his own defense."
But Mr. Schrager said Mr. Helmsley still presided over a multimillion-dollar property and services empire that was "stabilized." It is also one that has been shrinking in recent years, and one that Mr. Helmsley is, by the available evidence, trying to shrink further.
He has already shed some outlying brokerage holdings, his Manhattan real-estate insurance operations and his long-term lease on the million-square foot former Macy's warehouse in Long Island City, Queens. He is also seeking buyers for his Harley Hotel chain and for his residential brokerage and management company, Brown Harris Stevens Inc.
Perhaps most important in terms of prestige, Mr. Helmsley's partners in the jewel in the crown, the Helmsley Palace Hotel, are trying to force the Helmsleys out of control of the hotel and, Mr. Helmsley's consultants say, force the sale of the Palace.
The Palace partners' assert that the Helmsleys' billing of the costs of improving their Connecticut house to the hotel, and Mrs. Helmsley's criminal conviction arising from those actions, were responsible for the hotel's disappointing financial performance in recent years.
 
Major Role by 'Queen'
 Several former Helmsley employees insisted in interviews that Mrs. Helmsley has had a major impact, at first for the better, but more recently for the worse. She was a brilliant if ruthless real-estate executive, they say, and the nationwide advertising campaign that identified her as the "Queen" standing guard over customer services at the Palace produced great dividends.
But her tightening control over the Helmsley operation and, by many accounts, over Mr. Helmsley himself has been just as damaging, said these former associates, who asked that they not be identified.
 
Trial Led to Defections
 No one in the management of the company returned telephone calls for comment, and Howard J. Rubenstein, Mr. Helmsley's public-relations consultant, referred all questions to Mr. Schrager. Mr. Schrager did not respond to a request to interview the Helmsleys.
Several former Helmsley-Spear associates were blunt in their criticism of Mrs. Helmlsey, who is still listed as a broker at Brown Harris Stevens, but who does not appear to have had a role in the company's day-to-day operations since her 1989 conviction for fraud and tax evasion.
The former employees' criticism focuses on both Mrs. Helmsley's actions within the business, where she was noted for on-the-spot dismissals that Mr. Helmsley occasionally reversed, and on her public notoriety before, during and after the tax-evasion trial. The latter cost the company credibilty, said a former Brown Harris Steven broker who was part of a mass dismissal last October, and who now works at another management concern.
The broker said many shareholders in buildings managed by Brown Harris Stevens read about Mrs. Helmsley's paying personal expenses out of business accounts and no longer wanted the company to manage their building.
Perhaps as a consequence, and perhaps also because of a growing fragmentation of the city's co-op management industry, Brown Harris Stevens's client list has been shrinking, with a half-dozen trophy buildings forsaking the company for other agencies.
Mrs. Helmsley meanwhile is in seclusion with her husband while her appeal is pending.
"When the leader passes on," another former Helmsley-Spear broker said, using the now familiar past tense when speaking of Mr. Helmsley, "there is still the framework of a very big company there, even though the momentum and the energy are drifting away. Now the company is just waiting for the next leader to come along."
 
Associates Become Managers
 Mr. Helmsley is childless, and with his wife facing a possible prison term, day-to-day management of the company has fallen to two of Mr. Helmsley's oldest associates, Irving Scheider and Alvin Schwartz. Both are major shareholders in Helmsley-Spear and are reported to have an agreement to buy Mr. Helmsley's position on his death.
Craig Panzirer, Mrs. Helmsley's grandson from one of her two earlier marriages, is a salesman in the company but is not yet regarded as a potential successor to the helm.
Mr. Schrager, the lawyer, declined to account for the discrepancy between the court report of mental incompetence and Mr. Helmsley's reported command of his business. He spoke only of Mr. Helmsley as contented and in control.
"From a global view, the Helmsley interests are stabilized," Mr. Schrager said. "They are not exposed to the vagaries of the marketplace to the extent that the rest of the real-estate busines has been. We are not undertaking any new development projects at this time, because the marketplace doesn't call for any, and we are basically focusing on managing the existing interests."
But what activity there is constitutes shrinkage.
The Harley Hotel chain of 14 hotels in the East and Middle West has been rumored to be for sale for some time. Mr. Schrager offered only a faint denial, saying it has "not been actively put on the market," though the company would enterain offers.
Last year Mr. Helmsley sold Helmsley-Greenfield, a Philadelphia-based brokerage with several mid-Atlantic branch offices, Mr. Schrager said, while Brown Harris Stevens Inc., the residential management and brokerage company, has been on the market for nearly a year.
 
Insurance Business Transferred
 Helmsley-Spear's big insurance department, which wrote policies on both commercial and residential properties, has also been transferred, under terms neither side would reveal, to the Frank B. Hall Insurance Company, controlled by Saul Steinberg, the financier.
Helmsley-Spear Inc., meanwhile, has been shrinking internally as well, perhaps to a greater extent than the many other brokerage and management concerns that have been forced to cut back in the current real-estate recession.
In 1986 a standard directory of Manhattan real-estate brokerages listed Helmsley-Spear's headquarters at the Lincoln Building, 60 East 42d Street, 27 branch offices nationwide, 86 brokers and 145 sales people. The current directory shows nine national offices, not counting the old Helmsley-Greenfield affiliates, 67 brokers and 59 sales people.
Besides the hotels, the brokerage and the management agencies, Mr. Helmsley controls a handful of important buildings, although real-estate ownership has never been as large a part of his wealth as it has been for some of the city's other real-estate leaders.
After seeing Mr. Helmsley not too long ago, Mr. Schrager reported: "He said, 'I've only had one job, but it's the only one I've needed, and I think it has worked out fairly well.' And I said, 'It certainly has, Mr. H.' "

GRAPHIC: Table: "Helmsley's Manhattan Real Estate Empire"
 
Harry B. Helmsley's owns an interest in many properties in New York City and across the country through private syndication partnerships. His firms, Helmsley-Spear Inc. and Helmsley-Noyes Inc., have refused to list these interests, for which no public record exists.
 
Since, by his lawyer's account, Mr. Helmsley's firms manage principally buildings in which he has an interest, the annual Cushman & Wakefield Manhattan Office Building Directory listing of principal buildings by managing agents provides a sense of his holdings. In 1991, the service listed 45 major Manhattan office buildings under the management of the two firms.

HEADLINE: Labor Cuts by New York City Are Fewer Than Anticipated

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
To Diane Tripp, New York City's fiscal crisis has been a personal betrayal. Her job as a Health Department contract administrator gone, she worries about paying her $764-a-month rent in Flatbush and supporting her 7-year-old son. She broods about relocating to "a place that is up-and-coming fiscally, like New York used to be."
But so far, the pain from the city's fiscal troubles has flowed deep, but not wide. A month after the tumultuous adoption of a $28.7 billion recession-driven budget, just over one in 100 city workers has lost a job, far fewer than the Dinkins administration had predicted. And the most onerous service cuts have yet to be carried out. 
 "Its obvious that at this point, doomsday has not arrived," said Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the state Municipal Assistance Corporation, who had worried that the budget cuts could have catastrophic consequences.
 
Less Doom Than Promised
 So far, 3,013 city employees have been laid off from a total work force of 243,000, according to a recent city tally. That is far fewer than the 6,300 reported to have been laid off in June, or the 14,500 layoffs called for in Mr. Dinkins's budget in April. During a similar period in July 1975, amid a deeper fiscal crisis, 26,000 workers were laid off, according to budget officials.
The most striking change between expectation and reality occurred at the Board of Education. Earlier this year, Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez warned of 10,000 layoffs, including as many as 7,000 teachers. Now, with increased enrollment and budget cuts expected to increase class size, the board may be hiring new teachers, rather than laying them off, city budget officials say.
And in protracted negotiations with municipal labor unions, many workers who were already laid off may get their jobs back if the city and the unions can agree on cost-saving concessions.
 
Politics, Luck or a Ploy
 City officials attribute the lower number of layoffs to a combination of politics, luck and skillful planning. Some jobs were saved through last-minute negotiations with the City Council, they say, others though stepped up attrition or an early-retirement program in the schools.
They say Mr. Dinkins remains committed to reducing the work force by more than 7,000 jobs next June, through 3,100 additional layoffs if necessary. "If we can reduce the need for layoffs, that is good news," said Philip R. Michael, the city's Budget Director.
Mr. Michael despaired of pleasing the city's critics: "First they said we couldn't do it. Then they said it wasn't as elegant as you want it to be. Then they said what about next year? How do you know you can do it next year?"
But some fiscal analysts and labor leaders contend that over the last year, Mr. Michael has repeatedly exaggerated the need for layoffs as a bargaining ploy -- much as he called for turning off 74,000 street lights to save money -- in an unsuccessful effort to pressure the unions for concessions.
 
'Crying Wolf Once Too Often'
 "I don't want to gloat, because we have 3,000 people out there without jobs, but we have been saying to the Mayor's people all along: You can do it with attrition and early retirement, not 10,000 layoffs," said Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the city's largest municipal union.
Marc V. Shaw, the City Council's finance director, said: "After more than a year of threats, they ran into the point where they were crying wolf once too often and no one believed them. There is going to be a tremendous number of teachers hired, let alone layoffs."
Some analysts say that the reduced job-loss figures show that despite the political turmoil swirling around this year's budget, the cuts may represent minor trims in a city government that may still be too large and too expensive for its shrinking tax base.
"A great deal of the lifting was done through tax increases," Mr. Rohatyn said to explain why the impact on services did not cut deeper.
 
118 More Workers at Year's End
 Compared with private jobs in the city during a deep recession, the city work force has largely been spared.
The number of jobs in the city's financial industries has plummeted by 16 percent since the 1987 stock market crash, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the last 22 months, the number of construction jobs in the city has fallen by 18 percent, the number of manufacturing jobs by 10 percent and wholesale and retail jobs by 7 percent.
In contrast, city government grew through much of the recession. In June, at the end of the last fiscal year, 118 more city workers were on the payroll than when the year began, even after months of retrenchment. And the total, 243,208, after a decade in which 50,000 employees were added, was the largest to be reported at the end of a fiscal year since the city began keeping consistent records in 1975.
If the Mayor is able to reduce the work force by more than 7,000 jobs -- and some of the city's outside monitors remain skeptical -- it would bring the work force down only to its level in 1989, when Mr. Dinkins was campaigning for Mayor. The decline would be less than 3 percent, compared with 4.2 percent in private jobs since the recession hit home 22 months ago.
"There is a lot of pain for the people who are affected," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Labor Statistics Bureau, "but so far you are not seeing the kinds of numbers we have seen when the financial crisis hit in the mid-1970's."
Originally, the city administration called for 14,500 layoffs of regular full-time city employees and 6,500 more layoffs at libraries, museums, private social-service agencies and the city's autonomous hospitals corporation.
But by July, about half of the layoffs had been averted through stepped-up attrition, last-minute negotiations and shifting workers who would otherwise have been laid off to other jobs. Fewer than half of the remaining layoffs have been carried out so far.
 
Smaller, Grinding Reductions
 As the number of layoffs was being tempered, so were the harshest service cuts called for in the budget: Libraries were not shut; pools remained open. Unpalatable cuts were replaced with smaller, grinding reductions in maintenance, supplies and cleaning, which were all but invisible to the public but which could eventually take a toll.
And many department commissioners -- hoping, perhaps, for a last-minute reprieve -- delayed the worst of the cuts until later in the year. The Parks Department, for example, one of the agencies hardest hit, delayed laying off maintenance workers until the end of summer.
While large parks remain in good shape, said Robert L. Garafola, a deputy parks commissioner, small playgrounds are dirtier and graffiti that was once scrubbed off is lingering.
At Riverside Park in upper Manhattan, two of 38 park workers, a gardener and a playground attendant, were cut. And last week, Charles McKinney, the park administrator, got an emergency $700 grant from a support group to pay for removing a tree with Dutch elm disease near West 105th Street.
 
How to Cut Tens of Millions
 Even before the latest round of cuts, street cleanliness had fallen to its lowest level in two years, with the city rating 70 percent of the streets acceptably clean in June, the latest date for which a figure was available. But sanitation officials said a decision by Mayor Dinkins to provide $5 million for overtime to empty trash cans on Sundays could halt the slide.
At the Human Resources Administration and the Health and Hospitals Corporation, most of the cuts have been limited to administration and support staff, security officers, custodians and other cleaners. More than a thousand child-welfare caseworkers are to be laid off in the fall, officials said, increasing the work for those who remain. City hospital administrators were still meeting frantically last week to decide how to cut tens of millions of dollars from the budget.
City departments are still drawing plans for a 5 percent reduction in managers that is called for in the budget, a cut that could translate into 200 jobs. City budget officials say that in this fiscal year and the last, 1,700 city administrative employees are being cut, along with 2,000 employees at the Board of Education headquarters and the Health and Hospitals Corporation.
Under current city plans, after the count of city employees is reduced this year, it will creep upward in the next three years. Commissioners and the city's critics alike see many of the present cuts as temporary retrenchment, in which services will be restored and workers rehired as soon as the city can afford it.
 
'A Sledgehammer in the Chest'
 But with the city facing continuing and increasing budget gaps in the next few years -- even if the city economy rebounds somewhat, as the city expects -- Mr. Dinkins has pledged to restructure the government to permanently lower costs.
That is of little comfort to Miss Tripp, who was laid off June 28, or to Harold Taylor, a Health Department community worker who cleaned out his desk last week.
Miss Tripp, who has a master's degree in urban planning, was hired in December to help run a new city anti-violence program. Now she is looking for work in New Jersey and elsewhere across the country while she struggles to qualify for unemployment insurance after, she said, an error by the city showed she had not worked long enough to be eligible.
Mr. Taylor had worked for the Health Department since he was hired off the welfare rolls in 1978. Getting a layoff notice felt "like getting a sledgehammer in the chest," he said.
He is now preparing to start training for a respiratory therapy job, for which there is much demand, and he has already warned his two children that he might not be able to afford their child-support payments for a while.
He says his 10-year-old son is at a stage in which "he sees it and he wants," and does not understand what it is like to have a father out of work.
His 17-year-old daughter, he said, put an arm around him and said: "It's all right Daddy. I can get a job."

GRAPHIC: "New York City's Payroll: How Did It Get So Big?"
 
New York City's work force is at its highest level since the city began keeping consistent records 16 years ago. Even if the city carries out its ambitious budget-cutting program, the work force will still be above the level of June 1975, at the onset of the city's previous fiscal crisis.
 
In the past decade, the number of people in city government grew by more than a quarter, while the city's population grew by only 3.5 percent. The planned head count reduction of 7,151 workers to balance the budget for 1992 would reduce the city's work force by only 3 percent.
 
City agencies do not say that services have gotten that much better, but the city's problems - crime, homelessness, drugs, the AIDS crisis - have gotten that much worse, forcing a greater role by government.
 
Here is a look at the growth of eight agencies and some of the reasons the agencies say are behind it. Figures are for June 30 of each.
 
Graphs: Full-time employees on June 30 of each year from '81 to '91 at Correction, Education Environmental Protection, Finance, Housing, Police, Social Services and Transportation agencies; The total number of New York City's full-time employees on June 30 of each year from '75 to '91
 
CORRECTION: Although the Department of Correction, had the biggest growth in the number of employees, 161.9 perent in civilian and uniformed workers in decade, it was just keeping up with the prisoners it guards. The average daily prison population in the city went from 7,035 in the 1981 fiscal year to 19,000 in the 1990 fiscal year, an increase of 170 percent.
 
EDUCATION: Federal and state mandates to increase bilingual and special education accounted for most of the 22.8 percent increase from 1981 to 1991. Special education enrollment jumped 145 percent from 1979 to 1990, although the total enrollment increased only 1.5 percent. The bureaucracy is being cut; the number of people at the board headquarters has dropped to 3,600 from 5,200 in January 1990.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION: The department's personnel expansion of 28.9 percent in 10 years can be attributed to its increased duties. The department had primarily been responsible for monitoring the city's water supply, but in the past few years, Federal mandate3s have required that it take on air pollution and hazardous waste. In addition, it will soon begin to step up enforcement of the noise pollution laws.
 
FINANCE: Responding to the findings of a 1981 audit, the city increased the number of auditors and assessors in an attempt to collect more tax revenu. This largely accounts for the 36.9 percent increase in the Department of Finance staff from 1981 to 1991. But the 1990's are bringing retrenchment; the head count dropped by 66 people, or 2.9 percent, from the end of fiscal 1990 to 1991. Another 75 positions have already been cut for fiscal 1992, a drop of 3.3%
 
HOUSING: Housing Preservation and Development increased its staff by 19.4 percent in 10 years. The department attributes this to the increased demand for apartments for the homeless and to the capital plan of the mid-1980's, which calls for building more housing. In addition, the number of abandoned buildings that the department had to take control of almost doubled in this period. Bt the personnel drop that H.P.D. has seen in the past few years has continued; it has already lost 357 jobs, or 8.2 percent, from budget cuts.
 
POLICE: Murder and non-negligent homicide totals rose steadily in this period, from 1,896 in 1988, to 1,905 in 1989, to 2,245 in 1990. Under pressure to fight back, Mayor Dinkins assembled a package of taxes last year and increassed the number of officers on patrol. The department grew 23 percent from 1981 to 1991 and it will get more officers; 373 will be added by the end of the fiscal year 1992. Civilian jobs are another matter; 631 will be lost as a result of budget cuts.
 
SOCIAL SERVICES: In this department, where 97 percent of the budget is spent on programs mandated by Federal and state governments, a growth in cases meant a growth in caseworkers. Welfare recipients have increased 10 percent; the number of children in foster care has tripled in the last five years. The staff grew in tandem, up 48 percent in 10 years. But the department will lose almost 7 percent of its staff because of the fiscal crisis; 759 jobs have already been cut and 1,422 more are to be lost.
 
TRANSPORTATION: Deteriorating bridges and increased traffic account for much of the Department of Transportation's 41.3 percent increase in staff from 1981 to 1991. The city's bridges required more inspectors and maintenance workers, which resulted in a doubling of the highways and bridges staff. The number of traffic agents rose by 70 percent, but those workers doubled the amount of money they brought in through parking tickets, to about $300 million.
 
THE TOTAL: The number of New York City's employees increased 26.8 percent from 1981 to 1991. In the same period, San Francisco's total grew 11.2% AND Miami's grew 6.9%. From 1984 to the present, Boston's total increased by 1.6% and Chicagos's fell 7.3% from 1980 to 1990. (Comparisons were not available for the full 1981-91 period for the last two cities.)

HEADLINE: Chemical Makers Identify A New Hazard: Their Image

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
The nation's chemical makers, troubled that the public associates them with toxic-waste dumps, poisonous spills and carcinogens, are cranking up a $10 million advertising and communications campaign to convince people that chemical plants are run by friendly, responsible people.
It is part of an industrywide effort led by the Chemical Manufacturers Association to rebuild the industry's image. The trade group, which represents the makers of 95 percent of the chemicals produced in the United States, has begun a "responsible care" program that requires manufacturers to clean up their problems or leave the group. 
 In addition to adopting a set of general safety guidelines, plant managers are being encouraged to reach beyond the front gates and into the local communities to ease fears that chemical plants are lethal accidents waiting to happen. The association is encouraging managers to organize plant tours and public events to explain their operations.
 
Low Public Confidence
 In the last two years, surveys have shown that the public does not have much confidence in the chemical industry. Concerned that the public associates it more with the lethal gas leak seven years ago in Bhopal, India, and the polluting of the Love Canal area of Niagara Falls, N.Y., than with economic growth and helpful products, the chemical industry wants to be seen in a better light. More important, it wants to head off more stringent government regulation.
"We said, 'Look out, guys. We are going to end up in worse shape than the atomic industry if we don't do something,' " said John W. Johnstone Jr., current chairman of the trade association and the chairman of the Olin Corporation, a chemical maker based in Stamford, Conn.
He said the public's low opinion of the industry came as something of a shock to chemical company executives. "We thought of ourselves as righteous and very successful," he said.
A Roper Organization survey conducted last year for a chemical manufacturer, S. C. Johnson & Son Inc. of Racine, Wis., found that only 8 percent of people polled thought business would develop new, more environmentally safe products. And an overwhelming 72 percent of the respondents favored additional government regulation and strict enforcement.
In 1989, a survey commissioned by the Chemical Manufacturers Association showed that people regarded the industry as less environmentally responsible than either the nuclear or petroleum industries. Only tobacco was considered worse.
Environmental groups say they are skeptical of the chemical group's image-improvement efforts, and they criticize its "responsible care" program as too vague. They also say the program, which calls for chemical companies to adopt a set of management codes, lacks an outside audit to prevent companies from inflating their results.
 
'A Bunch of Aimless Words'
"The codes are nothing but a bunch of aimless words," said Karen Florini, a lawyer with the Environmental Defense Fund. "Without them specifying their accounting procedures, data collection methods and auditing, it is hard to take them seriously."
Vincent Covello, a risk-communications specialist at Columbia University, said: "There have been a series of national traumas that have raised questions about the competence of industry. We have had Love Canal, Times Beach, Three Mile Island. Even the Challenger explosion fits in that category."
He said the chemical industry was particularly tarred by the connection between exotic-sounding compounds and cancer, and by the reluctance of executives to do anything but denounce proposed environmental legislation. "They sat behind their fences for 30 years and refused to get involved in the community," Mr. Covello said. "Now, with all the environmental concerns, nobody wants them as a neighbor. They are having trouble finding sites for new facilities."
 
Generally Worded Codes
 At the heart of the "responsible care" program are six management codes, four of which have been completed by the association. The ones now in effect cover relations with nearby communities and response to emergencies, pollution prevention, process safety and distribution of products. All consist of a series of generalized statements.
For example, one part of the pollution prevention code requires members to "include waste and release- prevention objectives in research and in the design of new or modified facilities, processes and products." The companies are required to evaluate themselves against each of the codes each year, and report whether they are studying or implementing the code provisions.
Jon Holtzman, the director of communications of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, said the process commits the 185 companies in the association to "continuous improvement" rather than reaching one or more numerical goals.
But Joan Bavaria, president of Franklin Research and Development, which calls itself a socially concerned investment adviser, said the companies would have to do more to regain their credibility.
"We will need steady, clear implementation and an information-disclosure system before we can believe them," she said.
 
Considering a Third-Party Review
 Officials of the trade group concede that some form of independent audit of the industry's environmental practices will be needed to make the program believable. "We have internal audits now, and, in some cases, community evaluations," said Lori Ramonas, the director of the program.
"Long term, we are trying to figure out how to do a third-party review," she said. "We do not know how to do it yet, but we are giving it some thought."
Mr. Holtzman said the association began advertising before the program was fully under way to "commit publicly" to environmental improvement. The first print advertisement depicts a parent's concern as he drives past a chemical plant with children and realizes he does not know what is being made there or how hazardous it might be.
The ad's text tells of the outreach efforts of some companies and includes a toll-free "800" number, so readers can find out about the operations of chemical plants near them. The industry plans five more advertisements, each dealing with a different section of the program's codes.

HEADLINE: A Twist in Fair-Trade Case: Japanese Charge U.S. Rival

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SINGAPORE

 BODY:
In an aging factory near the airport here, hundreds of young women from Singapore and neighboring Malaysia are assembling an American classic known to generations of students: the portable Smith Corona typewriter. Across the globe in Bartlett, Tenn., 400 American workers in a similar factory are building competing typewriters for a Japanese company, Brother Industries Ltd.
From those simple facts arises one of the strangest and most politically charged trade disputes in recent times. 
 In the minds of many, the dispute raises the question of whether American trade laws are wildly out of touch with the politics and economics of contemporary manufacturing.
 
Turning the Tables
 The Smith Corona Corporation has battled Brother and other Japanese rivals for years, saying they were "dumping" foreign-made typewriters in the United States -- that is, selling them below the fair-market value in an attempt to seize market share from competitors. A few months ago, turning the tables, Brother became the first Japanese company to make the same charge against a competitor based in the United States.
Pointing to the fact that it makes its typewriters in a Tennessee plant with American workers, Brother claimed that it, not Smith Corona, was the true representative of the American industry. And it said the Singapore plant was being used to dump typewriters in the United States -- damaging Brother's American subsidiary and threatening the jobs of hard-working Tennesseans.
Brother's bold strategy has sent a ripple through Japanese industry. In Tokyo, executives of Japanese companies that have become increasingly impatient with American trade complaints -- from electronics producers to auto makers -- say that if Brother's counteroffensive works, they may follow suit.
No matter how the case is resolved, it points up questions that American trade policy is now only beginning to sort out: Should the United States try to protect American companies, no matter where they manufacture? Or should it try to protect American jobs and workers, even if that means bolstering the profits and business of a Japanese company?
"Regardless of which side wins," Robert Reich, the Harvard economist, wrote recently in The New Republic, "it seems appropriate to pause and ask why we have an anti-dumping law at all, now that the American economy has gone global."
Referring to the Nissan Motor Company's American manufacturing and sales operation, Yutaka Kume, the company's president, said recently that "we view our company as purely American, and I can't rule out the possibility that one day we could" follow Brother's lead. Like Brother, Nissan has a plant in Tennessee.
Smith Corona is outraged by Brother's claim to represent the American industry. "They are flouting U.S. trade laws," said G. Lee Thompson, the company's chairman and a survivor of many trade wars with Japan. "All that Brother does in Tennessee is insert some imported parts in a board and solder it."
Smith Corona has won several dumping decisions against Brother and other Japanese rivals, most recently on Thursday, when the International Trade Commission ordered steep duties on Japanese-made word processors, including Brother's.
But at the same time that the commission, an independent Federal agency that investigates the effects of trade, is issuing rulings against Brother, it is taking Brother's complaint seriously enough that it has approved an investigation of the Japanese company's charges.
Determining whether a product is being dumped is enormously difficult: it involves assessing whether the product is being sold below its manufacturing costs or below its price in its home market. Because so few typewriters are sold in Singapore, in this case the investigation will focus on prices in Europe.
Furthermore, Commerce Department officials have begun examining the Smith Corona plant in Singapore to assess its manufacturing costs. They are doing much the same at Brother's headquarters in Nagoya, Japan, and at its American subsidiary. It will be months before there is an answer.
For American manufacturers who have moved production offshore or entered a web of alliances to cut manufacturing costs, the dumping laws have become something of an international minefield.
The Chrysler Corporation, for example, led the drive a few months ago for Detroit's auto makers to file a major dumping complaint, charging that Japanese companies are selling mini-vans in the United States at prices that are far too low. The trade commission concluded recently that an investigation was warranted, and the Commerce Department is expected to rule by the fall.
But Chrysler, it turns out, may have filed the complaint against itself. One of the vehicles the American makers want to stop is the Expo LRV, a sort of station wagon made by the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation that by some definitions may be classified as a mini-van. Mitsubishi makes the Expo for Chrysler, which plans to sell it under its own names: Eagle Summit and Colt Vista.
Now, Chrysler and Mitsubishi are both scrambling to have the Federal definition of a mini-van changed so that the Expo is not part of the dumping case.
Because a growing number of American autos are actually renamed versions of Japanese models, other car companies may find themselves in similarly awkward positions, as may companies that supply chemicals, drugs, laptop computers and video cameras from overseas.
 
A 12-Year Battle
 Smith Corona's battles against Brother began 12 years ago, when the manufacturing scene was much simpler than it is now. All of Brother's typewriters came from plants in Japan. Smith Corona dominated the market then -- it still holds a share of more than 50 percent -- and it built its machines in the United States and in England.
In 1979, concerned that Brother and a host of other Japanese makers were dumping their typewriters to seize a larger share of the American market, Smith Corona filed its first complaint. One of the first actions defined typewriters as machines with no calculating functions. Brother added a calculator.
But Smith Corona was also going through traumatic changes as it was bought by Hanson P.L.C., a British group that still owns 48 percent of the company. Smith Corona greatly reduced its work force in Cortland, N.Y., where it is based.
 
Smith Corona's Labor Costs
 As Japanese competition drove down prices -- the average retail price of a portable electric typewriter is now about $150 or less -- Smith Corona moved the production of all of its low-end machines to Singapore. Now, labor in Singapore has become more expensive, so the company is doing much of its subassembly operations on a nearby island belonging to Indonesia, where labor rates are two-thirds lower.
Yet, Smith Corona argues that its typewriters are essentially American-bred, if not American-born. The research and development was done in Cortland, the company says, and the tools were designed there.
It is hard to define where value is added to any product, especially if it is a mix of intellectual property and parts and labor. At Smith Corona's factory in Singapore, boxes of parts are marked from Japan, South Korea and Malaysia. Moreover, the plant has precious little automation; most operations appear to be done by hand. In short, the company appears to have eliminated American jobs in favor of jobs in Singapore and Indonesia.
"They are hollowing out the industrial core of the United States," a lawyer for Brother, H. William Tanaka, said recently, "while we are nurturing it."
How much Brother is nurturing American industry, though, is also questionable. The company admits that it moved to Tennessee chiefly to avoid dumping charges. None of Brother's more sophisticated equipment, which is not the subject of dumping charges, is being produced outside Japan.

HEADLINE: Waterbury Killing Puzzles Teen-Age Suspects' Friends

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD with DONATELLA LORCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WATERBURY, Conn., Aug. 10

 BODY:
Mischief accented their lives. But apparently none of them dreamed it would turn deadly.
Friends said the crime was supposed to have been a trifling act of bravado, a manly demonstration of how easy it was to pull off a petty robbery. There were even overtures to their buddies to stop by and watch the action. 
 But then it sped out of control when a hitch developed in the carefully scripted plan and a young man was shot and killed -- all for $18 worth of Chinese takeout food.
Residents of this struggling New England mill town of 106,000 in the heart of the Naugatuck Valley are still fumbling to understand the chilling events of last Monday night, when the police say five local youths -- aged 13 to 18 years old -- gunned down a Chinese restaurant's delivery man when he refused to hand over some cartons of food. All were arrested within hours of the crime.
 Friends and neighbors of the suspects talked last week of troublemakers and of boredom. In interviews in the racially and ethnically mixed East End neighborhood where the crime occurred, they painted a picture of a group of smart-alecky teen-agers and the torpor and tedium of the hot summer in a city that has never recovered from the years its brass mills shut down. They talked of youths suffering from a dearth of recreational activities and itchy to find some thrills.
 
'This Was Like an Adventure'
 "They did normal stuff," said a teen-ager who said he hung out with some of them, but spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Then like they got bored. This was like an adventure. You know, look for pirate treasure. Climb a mountain. Rob a guy. Something different. But I don't think they expected to go bang-bang."
While some were quick to defend the arrested youths as relatively tame teen-agers who occasionally strayed, many others who described themselves as friends and acquaintances insisted they were a rowdy lot. The youngest member of the group, a 13-year-old who the police say furnished the murder weapon from his parents' gun collection, was portrayed most harshly. He was described as an impish chronic troublemaker who antagonized many of his neighbors by his antics. Everyone, however, said they were stunned that the youths might have killed someone.
The police have charged all five of the racially mixed group with murder, robbery and conspiracy to commit murder. The accused are Gerrod Ellis, 17, whom the police said fired the gun; Linas Zelvis, 18; Vince Hancock, 17, and two youths, 13 and 14, whose names were not released because of their ages. Many neighbors, however, say they are familiar with the two.
The police depicted the crime as the culmination of a plan -- perhaps the encore to a similar holdup four days earlier -- meant to be brought off with a flair for the dramatic.
The police said the group plotted to lure a Chinese restaurant's delivery man the night of July 29 to a vacant apartment near where they live, in a working-class neighborhood largely comprised of clusters of inexpensive strips of bland housing. Each participant had an assignment. One was the gunman. Another was to snatch the food. Another was to get the delivery man's money. A fourth was to steal the car. The final member was to lead them through the adjacent woods.
Not long before 10 P.M., relatives of the victim said, Mr. Ellis placed the order to the Kwok Hing restaurant on Main Street. He gave the address as 134-1 Stonefield Drive, a recently vacated apartment.
Three girls -- Joanne Bologna, 13, Kelly Jordan, 14, and Lindsay Butler, 13, say they frequently hung out with the accused youths. They were sitting on a boulder -- what is known as the rock -- near the apartment when the teen-agers came by and bragged that they were going to rob a delivery man. The girls said they were invited to watch. "They told us -- 'You guys hungry?' " Ms. Bologna said. " 'We're going to hold this guy up. We got a rifle in the woods, but it's not loaded. If you like, you want to watch?' "
But they said they declined and went home. Ms. Bologna was scurrying to beat a 10 P.M. curfew.
Several other youths in the neighborhood said they, too, were urged to stop by to see the robbery unfold. But they said they stayed away. One said there was something good on television.
The site was hardly the sort of secluded setting likely to be chosen to execute a crime undetected. Neighbors were close at hand, on foot and in cars swinging in and out of the parking lot just behind the apartments.
When the delivery man, Fai Yeung, 21, showed up shortly after 10 P.M., the police said he was confronted by the youths and told to hand over the food. Mr. Ellis, the police said, pointed a .22-caliber rifle at him. Mr. Yeung clung to the food and backed away, the police said, and Mr. Ellis shot him in the chest. Mr. Yeung then staggered back to his car, bleeding profusely.
The youths ran off, the police said, with nothing but the food, which they told investigators they later ate.
Lou Albano, 40, a field engineer who lived nearby and was waiting for his wife, Marge, in the lot, dashed over and tried to help Mr. Yeung while the police were summoned. He died at St. Mary's Hospital the next morning.
Mr. Yeung's sister Dow Hung Yeung said he had been badly beaten just a few nights before by a band of youths in the same neighborhood. Normally, she said, Monday was his day off, but he was covering for his other sister, Jen.
 
Told Her About the Slaying
 The police apprehended one of the five soon after the crime. Ms. Bologna, who is the daughter of the Albanos, said that Mr. Hancock called her later that night and told her about the slaying but insisted that he and Mr. Zelvis had run off before the shooting. Ms. Jordan said that Mr. Ellis phoned her and boasted, "I robbed a Chinese guy. I shot him in the butt." The three girlfriends furnished descriptions to the police and the remaining youths were arrested within hours.
Capt. Robert Moran, the acting chief of detectives, said early last week that the shooting had been staged as a spectator sport that took place before an audience. But the three girls and other neighbors said they knew of no one who actually watched. Captain Moran was unavailable for further comment on Friday.
Since the crime, the Albanos said they have received a string of anonymous threatening calls to their daughter. Ms. Bologna, however, seemed unfazed. "You can't be scared," she said. "When you gotta die, you gotta die."
Four nights before the killing, Mia Freeman, a delivery woman from Domino's Pizza, was held up in the same vicinity in a similar fashion. Ms. Freeman said that four or five youths were involved, and that one had a rifle. She surrendered $35 in cash and the pizza that had been ordered.
She said detectives have asked her to determine if those accused of the murder also accosted her.
Apparently all of the youths were born in Waterbury, a classic New England mill town that has passed through the same bruising transformations of so many manufacturing cities in the region. Known as the "brass city," it was a primary maker of brass as long ago as the Civil War when Waterbury foundries made the buttons that went on soldiers' uniforms. But the city's brass mills succumbed to the allure of plastic and to cheaper labor in the South, and began closing in the late 1960's and early 1970's.
Waterbury is comprised of a mixture of tight-knit ethnic groups. The Irish and the Italians predominate, though black and Hispanic populations have grown substantially over the last 10 years. Residents of the area where the shooting took place said that many people have been laid off from their jobs during the recession.
The lawns teem with children of all ages. Neighbors said the accused youths liked to congregate at the rock, gathering with as many as two dozen neighborhood teen-agers.
The 13-year-old, who the police say supplied the weapon, lives with his mother and two siblings. His father, neighbors said, died of liver cancer six months ago. He had kept a sizable gun collection, they said, that the son found easily accessible. Friends said the youth would sometimes take a gun and shoot it in the woods. Neighbors said that the police had been called to the apartment the week before the shooting because his mother reported a gun missing.
"He's been bad before," said Francisco Ruiz, a garbage man who lives a few doors away. "Trouble's always with him."
But none of the five had any more than minor criminal records. And neighbors spoke of how they leaned toward many familiar teen-age pursuits -- riding skateboards, fishing for turtles and operating radio-controlled cars. But other youths said they had taken part with them in stealing cars and going for joy rides, as well as breaking into houses.
 
'Two Sides to Every Story'
 They also spoke of less pleasant pursuits. Mrs. Albano said that the teen-agers used to hurl mud-covered rocks at her door, and she pointed out some pronounced dents. "They are real roughnecks," she said.
None of the parents of the accused teen-agers would consent to be interviewed. Paul Matasavage, a lawyer who represented Mr. Zelvis when he posted bond, would say only "there's always two sides to every story, and in this case it's no different."
A close relative of one youth said he was convinced that the killing was a game that went hideously awry. "They were doing a prank," he said. "They thought it was going to turn out a certain way and in the heat of what happened, when it didn't go the way they thought, they panicked. They were just looking for food and fun and they got blood and jail."
"I can see having a little fun -- beating a guy for the food," Ms. Bologna said. "I never thought Gerrod had it in him to shoot someone."
In the aftermath of the slaying, the Yeung family has kept their tidy, storefront restaurant open, a sign still taped to the window offered free delivery.
The family was born in Foo Chow, China, and envisioned America as an opportunity to realize success through hard work. The father, Ping C. Yeung, left China 20 years ago, with his wife staying behind. He owned a restaurant in New Jersey, as well as one in Georgia, before taking over the Waterbury restaurant last year. His children arrived in this country in 1984.
On Friday, Dow Hung Yeung said the family had been discouraged by the slack business in Waterbury and had been planning to sell and head elsewhere. She said that her mother, who still lives in China, had not been told of her brother's death because she was in failing health. The funeral was to be Sunday.
On the scrubby lawns that separate the strips of apartments in the East End, children continued over the weekend to ride their bikes, chase one another and sit on stoops and talk.
"It's weird," said Ms. Butler. "They're still your friends. But this is life. This isn't like stealing cars."

HEADLINE: Face of Protests in Wichita Is Religious and Undoubting

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WICHITA, Kan., Aug. 11

 BODY:
For three days, David Spear drove the 1,700 miles here from his home in San Francisco as fast as his old car would go.
He made the trip with little food, sleep or money, he said, because "the Holy Spirit led me here" to join what has become a monthlong assault on the city's three abortion clinics. 
 It has been a month of protests, prayers and police, a month that has brought national attention to Wichita along with hundreds of abortion opponents like Mr. Spear, a 42-year-old street artist, shoe shiner and window washer.
"I don't dislike pro-choice people," he said. "Some of my best friends are pro-choice and I pray for them. All I want is the law changed. I want babies to live. It won't be easy though because Satan is all around us."
The protests, organized by the militant anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, have resulted in nearly 2,000 arrests since late July. A Federal judge, who issued an order forbidding them to block access to two of the clinics, has received numerous threats and is under round-the-clock protection.
Slightly more than half of those arrested have been from Kansas.
Mr. Spear and the others have come from big cities and small towns, from unemployment lines and steady jobs, from Lansing, Mich., from Boston, from Dayton, Ohio, from Miami, from Portland, Ore. They see themselves, in the words of Mr. Spear, as "warriors of prayer" in a civil war over abortion.
To them the issue is clear and very simple. Abortion, they say, is murder and if it continues much longer America will suffer God's judgment.
"I'm suprised God hasn't allowed another nation to take us over yet," said Gladys Mitchell from Michigan.
Many of the abortion opponents who have flocked here since the middle of July, like Pam Schuffert, 39, of Asheville, N.C., or Joe Stauder, 52, of Ann Arbor, Mich., travel from city to city, state to state, to block the gates of abortion clinics with their bodies.
"I've been arrested in Atlanta, Dobbs Ferry, Washington, Charlotte, Greensboro, Asheville and a couple of other places," Miss Schuffert said. "I still have 10 days to serve in Greensboro and 36 hours in Charlotte."
Before coming to Wichita, Miss Schuffert said, she had just been in jail in Raleigh, N.C., after a protest there.
"I'm weary," she said the other day as she prepared to rush the gate of a clinic here. The campaign in Wichita, she said, "is my 16th rescue," using the term that members of the anti-abortion movement favor for their efforts.
The authorities call it law breaking, and according to results of a survey released today by The Wichita Eagle and KAKE-TV, 78 percent of the 483 Sedgwick County residents surveyed disapproved of the protesters' tactics, and 52 percent said they believed that the city's image had been damaged by the weeks of unrest. The survey, taken Wednesday and Thursday in random telephone calls, has a margin of sampling error of 4.5 percentage points.
On Monday some of the protesters, including a founder of Operation Rescue, the Rev. Joseph Foreman, are scheduled to appear before Judge Patrick F. Kelly of Federal District Court on charges of violating his order.
"A judge's order won't stop us," Mr. Foreman said before being arrested Friday and held on $100,000 bond.
 
Friendly Reception
 Despite the poll's findings, the protesters have received a friendlier reception in Wichita, a city of 300,000, than they have in larger cities.
Operation Rescue and its out-of-town followers have set up camp at the Wichita Plaza Hotel downtown, where a spokesman for the group, Gary McCullogh, said they had at least 40 rooms.
He said the hotel had halved its rate for the group to $25 a room, most of which are shared by four adults.
Other protesters have moved in for a few nights with families here, and several churches have turned their basements into dormitories.
There have been other signs of hospitality rarely offered to the group in larger cities. At a recent rally, the state's Governor, Joan Finney, a Democrat, spoke warmly of its effort.
"I am pro-life," she proclaimed to the cheers of 1,500 people.
For the most part, getting here was not easy for many of the protesters, mainly blue-collar workers like sign painters, store clerks and truck drivers. Mr. Stauder, of Ann Arbor, was a school janitor until he quit his job almost three years ago to devote full time to abortion protests.
The protesters travel in groups and pay for gasoline and food by saving pennies or by soliciting donations from church groups or relatives back home.
"I live very simply," Mr. Stauder said. "I have a brother who gives me $200 a month. I live and travel on that."
But among their ranks are also school teachers on vacation, medical technicians on their lunch breaks, retired couples and newlyweds.
"The rescuers seem like average folk," said Steve Grantstien, a 38-year-old nuclear medicine technician from Wichita and, he said, one of the few Jews taking part in the protests. "It seems like 30 percent of them are retired."
 
Dr. King and John Brown
 The leaders are mostly male and from out of town. They sprinkle their conversation with references to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the civil rights movement, the Holocaust and, because this is Kansas, John Brown.
Nuns, priests and ministers kneel at the rallies, fingering rosaries or clutching Bibles before leading a charge against the clinics' gates. Some have been dragged off to jail as many as six times.
The women, young and old, are "Mrs." or "Miss," rarely "Ms."
"We don't accept that term," said 33-year-old Stephanie Hunley, a Mrs. from Dayton. "It's a feminist term."
 
Nearly All White
 A vast majority of the protesters are white, a fact that apparently causes some concern. After telling a story about persuading a young woman in Dayton not to have an abortion, Mrs. Hunley said, "I'd also like to emphasize that the woman was a black lady."
"I know you don't see a lot of black people out here now," she said without being asked about the lack of black faces in the crowd of several hundred. "But we extend our hand to everyone. We love them, too."
Protesters are stationed almost around the clock outside the Women's Health Care Services, one of the few clinics in the country that performs abortions in the final three months of pregnancy.
Tiffany White, a 19-year-old resident of Wichita, said she became involved with the anti-abortion protests a couple of weeks ago when the guilt and anguish over her own abortion when she was 16 grew overwhelming.
"I was raped," she said. "I didn't even know who the father was. But I loved that baby. I wanted it."
Being young, scared and uncertain, "I turned to my mom." Her mother, she said, forced her to have an abortion, and, "I very much regret it now."
Earlier that day, the street was flooded with 350 abortion opponents, dozens of Federal marshals, local police and a growing band of supporters of the clinics.
Even in that crowd, King David Davis, a 34-year-old unemployed father of three from Wichita, stood out in his black karate uniform, monster mask and gloves covered in fake blood. He has worn the costume almost every day for weeks.
"I represent the evil that is going on in there," he said, pointing to the one-story clinic. "Remember, David was a little man with a small rock, and he was able to destroy a mighty giant. Truth will be our rock."
A boy approached him and tugged on his karate uniform. "The police are looking at you," the boy said. "You need to take the mask off."

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING;
At Saratoga, a Floating Serenade and Symbol

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y., Aug. 11

 BODY:
Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney parks her yellow 1964 Jaguar on the grass outside the clubhouse gate at the 127-year-old Saratoga Race Course, and steps toward the paddock in a wide-brimmed summer hat and white dress with huge red polka dots and matching parasol, looking for all the world like a belle being cast for the Ascot Gavotte scene in "My Fair Lady."
The small combo serenading the racing fans outside the gate spots her and promptly strikes up the old tune "Mary Lou." 
 She stops, listens with cheery attention, waves her thanks and sweeps into the large striped tent pitched alongside the paddock. It is crowded with women who paid $40 apiece for luncheon at America's oldest and maybe grandest country race track, with Marylou Whitney as the main attraction and the Ronald McDonald House for needy children as the main beneficiary.
It is a scene that is repeated four or five times a day during the five weeks when New York racing makes its summertime stage in this stately old town in Saratoga County, which is celebrating its 200th anniversary this year, 180 miles north of Belmont Park and light years north of the tumult of big-city racing downstate. It is a slice of 19th-century American life that has been threatened by change but that so far has survived the threat.
And Marylou Whitney stops the music as she floats from one gathering to another, raising or donating money for all kinds of charities and activities from the Salvation Army to the Olympics, racing her horses and spreading the message that Saratoga and its way of life are alive and well and worth preserving.
She is a size-6 dynamo in her middle 60's who reigns as the mistress of the 120 acres of Cady Hill House, one of seven places that she and Sonny Whitney call home, but for the last five years the place they actually make their home.
 
A Packed Agenda
 From this elegant pre-Revolutionary mansion with its 24 rooms, cottages and carriage houses, she runs the family businesses, directs the Blue Goose Stable and rules the same society that she also rules at other times at her 540-acre farm in Kentucky, her 100,000-acre spread with two homes in the Adirondacks, her Fifth Avenue apartment in Manhattan, her ancient 100-room castle in Spain and her tony villa in Palm Beach.
But she also serves as honorary chairman of the Saratoga Performing Arts Center and president of the Museum of the Dance, which she and her husband helped to finance 25 years ago and which now becomes the summer home of the New York City Opera in June, the New York City Ballet in July and the Philadelphia Orchestra in August.
Mostly, she acts as the symbol and the spirit of Saratoga. And she will receive yet another salute for both on Monday night when she steps forward at the Gideon Putnam Hotel to receive the Red Smith Award at the annual dinner of the New York Turf Writers Association.
All in all, it is likely that no sport symbolizes a city more than horse racing in Saratoga, that no family symbolizes a sport in a city more than the Whitneys and that no woman symbolizes the family more than Marylou Whitney.
"This is where we vote," she said the other day, sitting on the porch of the directors' room at the race track. "This is where we live. This is where we spend Thanksgiving and Christmas. This is our first home.
"I loved Saratoga the first time I came here as a bride 33 years ago. Sonny told me he had a house in Saratoga, but he was planning on selling it. But the minute we came up the drive, I started to cry. I said, 'Sonny, I'll offer you twice as much to keep it.' We were only going to stay for lunch at the Gideon Putnam Hotel. But we sat with Frank Sullivan and Monty Woolley and all the other authors and writers and artists. I was wide-eyed. Monty said we should stay the night; we stayed four days."
They actually stayed 33 years, and counting. Sonny Whitney, who is 93 years old and reasonably hale, already had roots in Saratoga going back into the last century. But he and Mrs. Whitney made their own mark on the city when Saratoga and other upstate towns began to wither somewhat after World War II, and new life had to be pumped into the old countryside.
 
Shot in the Arm
 "About 26 years ago," Marylou Whitney said, "Eugene Ormandy and Nelson Rockefeller and Newman Wait came to us. They wanted to start a center for the performing arts here, and asked us to join them. The city needed a shot in the arm, and so did racing here. I think the racing went down during the war when they closed the track. But once we started raising money and established the Center for the Performing Arts, from then on, Saratoga started growing."
"Why Saratoga?" she asked. "Well, Ormandy needed a place for the Philadelphia Orchestra for the summer, and he came here and found it had a natural amphitheater in the park. Nelson Rockefeller was Governor and wanted to revive the economy upstate, and we all put up money to get the arts center launched. After we got the orchestra here, we leased the old Saratoga baths from the state and put the ballet there.
"To keep it thriving, we put on a jazz festival and rock concerts, and Liza Minnelli is here this weekend. Those are the things that keep the arts center going. And racing is the thing that helps keep everything going."
But, for racing, why Saratoga?
"The racing people always came here," Marylou Whitney said. "You win a race here, it's special. People bring their best horses here. I remember Sonny saying, 'I'd rather win a race at Saratoga than any place in the country.' His father and grandfather said it, too. Now, he's out of racing. He retired the C. V. Whitney silks six years ago. But I set up the Blue Goose Stable with Leslie Combs when he had Spendthrift Farm in Kentucky. And now I'm trying to carry on the tradition."
She is carrying it on with the style that made her an international star of society, and she is doing it in her adopted hometown with the apparent approval of her neighbors and townspeople. She gives one party each summer for about 400 Saratogians, even before the racing crowd arrives in town. She averages four or five appearances a day, social and charity, after the racing crowd arrives and the season peaks. She tours the shops along Broadway before Christmas, shaking hands and even singing carols. She tells her five children and 10 grandchildren to stay home on Christmas Day, which she spends at home or at church serving meals. Then, two days later, she gathers her family for a delayed Christmas, and Cady Hill comes alive.
 
Completing the Cycle
 "I decided a long time ago," she said, "to help this community every way I could. Raising money was one way I could. But now I'm also active in the thing that makes Saratoga special: the horse. My ambition is to raise a horse to win the Whitney Handicap here. And possibly do something Sonny never did: win the Kentucky Derby. I want to raise a great race horse. Racing completes the cycle for me here in Saratoga."
People ask where she gets the drive. She doesn't know, either. But she gave up smoking five years ago, and thinks that helped.
"I grew a little, from a size 5 to a 6," she said. "But I feel 100 times better."
Meanwhile, she revels as the symbol of Saratoga and its revival. And she doesn't mind it one bit when she arrives for yet another appearance, or even a whirl, and the band swings into "Mary Lou" one more time.

HEADLINE: PAN AMERICAN GAMES: Sports of The Times;
Bay of Pigs Explains the Games

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

DATELINE: PLAYA GIRON, Cuba

 BODY:
WHEN Agustin Marrero Ferrer fell at the Bay of Pigs, he was carrying a photograph of Fidel Castro in his wallet. That wallet is now in a display case at the earnest little museum where the fighting took place in April 1961.
Castro himself is still in power, performing the wave and standing at attention for the American anthem at the Pan American Games after 30 years of hostility between the nations. So perhaps we should never say "never" about anything. 
 Everything that happens at these games, the hospitality and the security, the hopes and the fears and some of the gamesmanship at the events, must be seen through the prism of the upheaval in 1959, which led directly to the American-sponsored invasion by Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs.
"When people ask Castro how Cuba was able to organize these games so well, he says it is all done for the revolution," said Evie Dennis, the head of the United States delegation.
The revolution is part of these games. A huge rendering of Che Guevara dominates one entire wall at the basketball arena; the airport is named for Jose Marti, the martyr of an earlier struggle; and many sports arenas are named after Cuba's heroes and martyrs.
Sometimes you see the slogan El Deporte es un Derecho del Pueblo (Sport is a Right of the People). Other times you see the slogan Patria o Muerte (Fatherland or Death). Sometimes the slogans run together.
For example: the roller-skating competition is being held in Havana at the Centro Raul Diaz Arguelles, named for one of the early leaders of the student movement before 1959.
During the 72 hours of fighting near the Bay of Pigs, Diaz Arguelles was the commander of a unit being rushed to the front from Havana. In 1975, he would die as a general in an ambush in Angola, the highest-ranking Cuban officer to die in that expedition so far from home.
"A week after the Bay of Pigs, we came down here," said his wife, Mariana Ramirez Corria, one of the most accomplished women on this island: singer, actress, television host, writer, feminist, former hematologist for her neurosurgeon-father, and now a mother, grandmother, widow and patriot who has never felt the need to leave her country.
On Saturday, she escorted a few journalists to the Valley Forge of Cuba.
"My husband and I walked around," Ramirez continued. "We could see where the bombs hit, where people were killed. It was terrible.
"I knew guys from the university among the mercenaries. I could not talk to them, but my husband did. His own cousin was captured. He asked his cousin, 'What are you doing here?' I have not been back here until today."
This time she found it different: modern cottages, for rent to workers on vacation, and a pretty beach packed with Cubans who could come up with gasoline.
The healthy children playing in the sand at the Bay of Pigs helped explain why Cubans urge visitors to get out of faded Havana, why they say: "Wait until you see the changes in the countryside. Then, you will understand the revolution."
It is important to come here, to understand why the country has diverted what little gasoline and food it has to serve the athletes and the press. Clearly, sport is a convenient way of channeling the energies and the loyalties of an island badly damaged by the American economic embargo, the drop in Soviet aid and, some would say, three decades of its own centrally planned economy.
Whenever Alberto Juantorena -- the strapping Big Horse who won gold medals in the 400 and the 800 meters at the Montreal Olympics in 1976 -- is interviewed, he pays homage to the revolution. So does Ana Fidelia Quirot, the striking runner who is said to have lifted stones with her hands to help build the stadium, and then amasses gold medals in these games.
"We talk about the revolution because it supports us always," Juantorena said the other day. "Ana Fidelia and I come from the countryside. We have the opportunity to compete. We owe everything to the revolution."
The revolution is 32 years ago, still living history to many people. Fidel Castro, who turns 65 tomorrow, is everywhere, a living icon in olive-green fatigues, flying to Santiago, giving out medals.
Seen from a few feet away, Castro looks weary. He does not smile even while waving his hand at the Cuban people. It has been a long time since April 1961 when he proclaimed, "This day, Yankee imperialism suffered its first great defeat in the Americas."
Now the American defeats come in weight lifting and team handball, but then again, the United States is starting to gain gold medals in other sports, if any of it matters.
The amazing thing is that the United States is here at all. In the museum at the Bay of Pigs, they will hand-crank rough footage of those 72 hours in 1961: soldiers and civilians lying in their own blood. It is not hard to hear the words "Yankee imperialism" in Spanish. Then they shake an American's hand and direct him to a good beach, where Cuban men offer a swig of beer and give the thumbs-up sign and ask, "Are you here for the games?"

HEADLINE: As Times Get Tougher for California, Its Leaders Push Harder to Save Jobs

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 11

 BODY:
For decades, California could just lie back and rely on its seemingly irresistible lures to companies and people. If one plant shut or left, two more seemed to blossom amid the palms, and the state's economy consistently outpaced the nation's.
But suddenly California's political and business leaders have been jolted into action. They have belatedly started to mount a rear-guard action intended not to attract new industry but to prevent businesses from running away.
Colorado, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Oklahoma, Oregon, Idaho and other states, have found easy pickings in California, as has nearby Mexico. And this week, the Commissioner of Economic Development of the United States Virgin Islands, Eric Dawson, plans to make a pitch to business leaders here.
 
Radio Advertisements
 The sales pitches are not restricted to small groups. Commuters on Southern California's freeways often hear this advertisement on the radio: "If your business is based in California, then you already know it means putting up with traffic congestion, smog, doneover regulation, high costs and an irritable work force that result in lost revenues. . . . Now is the right time to cash out of California and go to Pueblo, Colorado."
Pueblo has attracted five plants from California. "All these companies are leaving, and nobody is listening in the Legislature -- I just smile," said Harold E. Mabie, who runs the one-man California office of the Pueblo Economic Development Corporation. "I've been working on a lot of companies the last six months."
Now California has begun to strike back. The California Chamber of Commerce recently organized a Task Force on Saving California Jobs, which has urged the state to ease what it considers the excessive burdens of taxation, environmental regulation and workers' compensation insurance. Gov. Pete Wilson made job retention a priority in the recent legislative negotiations to erase a $14.3 billion budget deficit, asking for new rules to reduce abusive claims for workers' compensation. The Governor was only able to win minor changes.
At the same time, the state's Office of Business Development has increased efforts to keep companies in California, partly by building an "early warning" system of potential defections. Southern California Edison, the electric utility, is offering special assistance to keep its industrial customers from moving away. And in Los Angeles County, probably the most vulnerable part of the state, the Economic Development Corporation of Los Angeles County, a private not-for-profit group, has a new president and a new mission.
"Over the last 10 years, there was no effort to retain jobs or bring them in," said the development group's chief economist, Jack Kyser. "In the meantime, Oklahoma opened an office in Irvine. It was just like a candy store to them. We've never had to work for growth in the past. Something at last is happening."
But the task is complicated by strong feelings among many Californians that the state's recent growth has come at the cost of bad air and water and congestion. While few are explicitly anti-business, many do not put a high premium on retaining heavy industry. "Californians have a big conflict over this," said Phillip E. Vincent, senior economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. "Some people do not want any more people here."
Despite the outward trickle of jobs, the California economy remains comparatively vibrant. In 1990, California, already the most populous state, gained more than 16,000 residents a day, growing at more than twice the national average. The state's economy was bolstered over the last decade by growth in manufacturing jobs, particularly in defense and aerospace industries, not to mention the garment and furniture industries.
As New York and other Eastern states were losing manufacturing jobs in the 1980's, California was posting gains. By 1989 the seven counties of Southern California accounted for nearly a fifth of the nation's military contracts and 1.4 million manufacturing jobs, more than the entire states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut combined.
 
Loss of Jobs
 But in the last year, the trend reversed, with California losing manufacturing jobs at a slightly greater rate than the nation as a whole, nearly 100,000 jobs since last July. The General Motors Corporation recently announced it would permanently shut its automobile plant in the Van Nuys area of Los Angeles by next August, putting 2,000 assembly-line workers out of work. The loss of such high-paying manufacturing jobs has been offset in part by growth in lower-paying service jobs in health care, hotels, restaurants and trade.
Economists say the loss of manufacturing jobs can be attributed both to the national recession and to cuts in military spending. But they also say that the state's comparative business disadvantages -- including high rents and housing costs -- have become increasingly powerful factors in corporate location decisions. According to a recent survey for the California Business Roundtable, a group of corporate executives, 14 percent of California's business leaders said they planned to relocate outside the state and 41 percent said they planned to expand operations out of state.
"We are attempting to face this head on," said Carl Covitz, the state's Secretary of Business, Transportation and Housing. "There's no need to be defensive about it. By recognizing that California is losing its competitive advantage, at least people will understand the implications. We do have serious problems doing business."
That is what Bernie and Sheila Gurstein, native Californians, decided when they uprooted their small family business, U.S. Products, and moved from Agoura, Calif., a suburb of Los Angeles, to Coeur d'Alene, a city in northern Idaho, in 1988. The company, which makes carpet cleaning machinery, wanted to expand but found that the cost of utilities, insurance and labor too high. So the company moved to Idaho, where workers' compensation rates are only $2.60 for each $100 salary, compared with $7.90 in California. The company has 20 employees.
"In California, I had to interview 30 people to find one questionable employee," said their son, Russ Gurstein, a co-owner. "They had an attitude problem. And when the surf's up, you said goodbye to half your employees." Mr. Gurstein added: "Officials listen to you here. Even the Governor came out to welcome us when we arrived."
Still, California retains some major advantages: a huge market, good ports, top-flight universities, a marvelous climate and proximity to Japan and other Pacific nations. "Firms who have the ability to relocate to lower-cost states often choose to do so," said Fred Cannon, chief economist at the Bank of America in San Francisco. "But it is a relatively small share of firms. We are close to a very large market, well positioned on the Pacific Rim. One reason for the high costs is so many people want to live here."
The man leading the Chamber of Commerce's Task Force on Saving California Jobs is Wilford D. Godbald Jr., chairman of the Zero Corporation, a Los Angeles-based manufacturer of aircraft cargo containers, camera cases and industrial cabinets.
 
Educational Program
 He said he was trying to organize a "grass-roots educational program" to show the Legislature how smothering layers of rules were affecting jobs. The goal, he added, is not to lower environmental standards but to make them easier to comply with.
But even as Mr. Godbald campaigns to keep jobs in California, he is exporting them. Zero recently transferred its Zero Halliburton division, which makes camera cases, from Pacoima, Calif., to North Salt Lake City, Utah, shifting 300 jobs. And he soon plans to move the company's Burbank plant, which makes cases to house electronic equipment, to Utah with another 450 jobs.
Mr. Godbald said he would like to keep the company's remaining seven California plants in the state. "I would very much like to stay," he said. "We are nearer the Pacific Basin, we like the environment and the California economy has been more vibrant than the nation over the years. But if the rules become more and more harsh, that will be overshadowed."
In Utah, Mr. Godbald said, the company was able to determine what permits were needed in a few days, a process that could take months or years in California.
Indeed, Utah has been particularly aggressive in attracting California companies. Nearly two dozen have relocated some or all of their operations there in the last two years, including Black Diamond, Lucas Western, Great American West Insurance and Standard Communications.
Probably no company has been more alarmed at the exodus than Southern California Edison, because the loss of major industrial customers means higher rates in its 50,000-square-mile service area. In the last five years, Barry R. Sedlik, Edison's manager of customer planning services, said that 60 manufacturers had either moved or expanded to Nevada, 44 to Arizona and 284 to Mexico.
Some say California should not try to prevent the decline of manufacturing, that it should allow its economy to evolve into one based more on services, trade, culture and research. "We are moving toward a service economy," said Mr. Vincent, the economist at First Interstate Bancorp. "Manufacturing is not the be all and end all."

Mabie, who heads the Pueblo Economic Development Corporation, a Colorado agency trying to attract California businesses. (Photographs by Bart Bartholomew for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Atlantis Mission Ends in Smooth Florida Landing

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Aug. 11

 BODY:
After nearly nine days in orbit, the space shuttle Atlantis returned to earth here today without mishap, and the Kennedy Space Center returned to service as a regular landing site for shuttle missions.
"Well done, Atlantis," mission control told the crew of four men and one woman, commanded by Col. John E. Blaha of the Air Force, seconds after the craft touched down at 8:23 A.M. 
 Atlantis lifted off here on Aug. 2, after a series of technical problems and postponements. It carried out 22 scientific experiments and launched a giant communications satellite intended to help channel the flow of information from low-orbiting spacecraft.
The only problem during the flight was the overheating of one of three auxiliary power units used to run the hydraulic systems during liftoff and landing. None of the units, which move wing flaps and rudders, interfered with today's landing, officials said, though the crew delayed turning on one unit to avoid overheating.
Today's landing was the first scheduled here by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration since 1986. Two shuttle flights have been diverted to Florida in the last year because of bad weather at Edwards Air Force Base in California, the primary landing site for the 42 space shuttle missions.
For both economic and scheduling reasons, NASA officials would like to be able to have more shuttle landings at the Kennedy Space Center. By landing here, the space agency saves more than $1 million and spares itself the cumbersome process of putting the shuttle on the back of a Boeing 747 and flying it across the country.
Clearing for the 15,500-foot runway began in 1974. The runway, also used for training, was completed in 1976.
NASA also gains a week in turnaround time whenever a shuttle lands here. Robert B. Sieck, who directs launchings at Kennedy, said the extra time allowed his staff to prepare more thoroughly for the next mission of Atlantis, scheduled for November.
Since the 1986 disaster in which seven astronauts died when the shuttle Challenger's booster rocket exploded shortly after liftoff, NASA officials have preferred to land at Edwards. The California base has wider runways and more predictable weather, although today's landing took place with a clear sky after a night of heavy thunderstorms and lightning.
In preparation for today's landing, both the shuttle fleet and the Kennedy landing strip have been modified. NASA officials said the main landing gear, braking system and steering mechanisms have been upgraded, in line with recommendations by the commission that investigated the Challenger accident.
To reduce wear and tear on the tires of the shuttle fleet, Kennedy's concrete landing strip has also been made smoother. Even so, Robert L. Crippen, director of the shuttle program, said at a news conference after the landing that one of the vehicle's tires "did show some wear on the cords."
The next shuttle flight, that of the Discovery, is scheduled for September. NASA officials said today that tentative plans called for the Discovery to touch down at Kennedy.

HEADLINE: In Guggenheim Restoration, Wright Laughs Last

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK

 BODY:
Did the Guggenheim Museum -- whose innovative spiral structure opened to a bemused public in 1959 -- do wrong by its architect, Frank Lloyd Wright? Yes, say Guggenheim officials, who promise that when the museum reopens in February after a $24 million renovation, Wright and his vision will be vindicated.
"We are restoring a monument," said Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim's director. "It was Wright's last and some say most original building, and our aim is to give it back to the public, reveal it in a way never seen before, consistent with Wright's original architectural concepts." 
 So the space Wright designed as a restaurant on the 88th Street side of the museum will again be a restaurant, using some of Wright's original plans for the first time, instead of a conservation laboratory; the ramp at the top of the spiral will be used as Wright intended, for art instead of storage, and the smaller of the two rotundas, which Wright called the Monitor Building, will be freed of its non-Wrightian glass and wood enclosures and made visible as dramatic space.
"It was clear that the Wright building was compromised, and much of it is in bad shape," Mr. Krens added. "The original architecture has been submerged, and the building is badly in need of repair." The project began in 1988.
The restoration was planned in conjunction with a nearly completed seven-story gallery and office annex connected to the rear of the Wright building. The annex, designed by the architectural firm of Gwathmey Siegel & Associates, has been widely criticized by those who say it detracts from the Wright structure.
 
The Changes Being Made
 All the glass in the Wright building, including that in the enormous domed skylight, is being replaced by thermal panes that filter out harmful ultraviolet and infrared rays. The skylight itself has been redone to seal leaks. The walls are being insulated for climate control, the auditorium stage is being renovated for performances, and new excavation beyond the foundation will provide 10,000 square feet of underground space on Fifth Avenue between 88th and 89th Streets for offices and other functions.
"We are driven by Wright's strict plans, but we want also to make sure that we have a mature, professional museum space," said Mr. Krens, whose eager championship of the Wright building is seen by some as an attempt to deflect criticism that the addition destroys the integrity of Wright's concept. "The only way we are able to give the public the full experience of the original Wright building is because we've put all of the necessary museum functions outside of it." Conservation activities and storage have been transferred to an Upper West Side warehouse, and offices are being moved to the new annex and underground space and to a building in SoHo.
The Guggenheim building, shaped like an upside-down teakettle, took 17 years from initial planning to realization. It was such a complicated construction project that after Wright finished the drawings, it was hard to find a builder. The job was undertaken by George N. Cohen, a contractor who had gained experience with cast concrete when building freeway overpasses. The museum's founder, Solomon R. Guggenheim, who died in 1949, had left only $2 million to build the museum, so Cohen used the most economical methods available, for example using Gunite, a concrete material sprayed from a hose against plywood forms, for the outside walls.
Wright was so grateful to Cohen for cutting costs that he allowed the contractor's name to appear on the building next to his own imprimatur, a red square with his signature through it. This is thought to be the only time Wright shared billing with a builder.
But the Gunite walls were not insulated, as required by the intricate climate-control systems that are standard in museums today. So an important and painstaking part of the renovation is stripping the walls of their interior plaster, applying a special vapor-controlling insulation and replastering them. "With the complex systems they require, museums have to be built like hospitals today," said Thomas A. Sansone, the architectural consultant for the restoration and expansion program, who researched Wright's original drawings for the Guggenheim at the Wright Foundation in Arizona. "They have a similar need for control of various climatological situations."
The entire mechanical system of the Wright building is being replaced and transferred to the annex. This will make the roof of the Wright building -- with its close-up view of the Central Park Reservoir -- accessible for tours and possibly for events, Mr. Krens said.
Many of the deviations from Wright's original vision can be traced to James Johnson Sweeney, the Guggenheim's director from 1952 to 1960. Wright and Sweeney were at odds constantly. Wright aimed at "a new unity between beholder, painting and architecture" and saw the museum as "one extended expansive wall space from top to bottom" with "no stops anywhere." He envisioned the pictures hung without frames on the outward-sloping walls, not "bolt-upright" but "gently inclined, faced slightly upward to the viewer and the light."
But Sweeney, a practical museum man, hated the idea of viewing pictures on a slant. As construction started in 1958, he pressed for the elimination of the sloping walls. What's more, a group of artists, including Willem de Kooning, whose work was hung at the museum's opening, wrote to Sweeney and the Guggenheim trustees pronouncing the sloping walls and ramp unsuitable for exhibitions.
The Wright scheme stayed. When the museum opened in October 1959, however, six months after Wright's death, it was apparent that Sweeney had foiled the architect, using rods that projected out from the walls to hang the pictures upright. He had also demanded several other changes to take account of the growing museum's needs: more office, library and storage space and a conservation laboratory. And he pushed successfully for an artificial lighting system as opposed to Wright's design for natural illumination.
Despite the fact that Wright felt the top of the ramp was the summation of the viewer's experience, Sweeney appropriated all of the sixth and half of the fifth floor ramp levels -- the biggest display areas in the building -- for storage and conservation. When the building reopens in February these areas will be reclaimed for the exhibition of art. False walls have been removed so that the bays, fully used for art for the first time, are flooded with light from both the dome and a skylight that runs like a ribbon around the perimeter of the ramp.
Beyond the battles between Wright and Sweeney, however, the building's suitability as a display space for art has for years been debated by professionals in both art and architecture. If the building has been criticized as impractical, as a visionary rather than a functional space, it has also been vociferously defended. In an interview the other day, Walter H. Kilham, an architect and admirer of Wright who was in practice at the time, said: "I remember Sweeney's differences with Wright, and from the museum point of view, Sweeney was absolutely correct. Wright was impractical. But his ideas were so much more important. There are thousands of practical people, but there's only one Frank Lloyd Wright."
 
Further Depreadations
 Sweeney resigned from the Guggenheim in 1960, but as the museum continued to grow and acquire collections, more of Wright's original design schemes were turned to other uses. Gradually the open spaces of the small rotunda were closed in. When the museum received the Justin K. Thannhauser Collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art in 1963, for example, an elaborate gallery, with brocade-covered walls and a parquet floor that Wright would have sneered at, was created on the second floor of the small rotunda. Eventually every open corner and closet was turned into office or storage space.
The cafeteria on the 88th Street side was used as a library and then a conservation lab, and the important public entrances on the outside ramp leading to the cafeteria and the basement auditorium were closed to the public. When the building reopens, these entrances will be restored.
In 1968, to provide more office and storage space, the museum built a four-story cantilevered annex behind the museum on a site for which Wright himself had proposed a 10- to 12-story extension that might have included artists' residences. The four-story addition, designed by Taliesin Associated Architects, the inheritors of Wright's practice, was torn down to make way for the new annex, which uses its load-bearing columns.
When the Wright building reopens in February, all the walls and other spatial encumbrances that plagued the small rotunda and the passage to the large spiral will be cleared away, said Michael Govan, deputy director of the museum. The rotunda will re-emerge as exhibition and gallery space. "The little rotunda is one of the big discoveries of the restoration," Mr. Govan added. "Its intimate, almost domestic scale contrasts with the public grandeur of the large spiral. Opening up this space makes you understand the logic of Wright's building."

HEADLINE: Careers;
Management Accountant's Wider Role

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
IN a sign of the times, the National Association of Accountants recently changed its name to the Institute of Management Accountants.
Along with the name change, there is a new importance attached to the title of C.M.A., for certified management accountant, that the institute bestows since management accountants, who work within corporations, are being given wider responsibilities. To get the title, they must have management accounting experience and pass examinations. Many companies, including Johnson & Johnson and I.B.M., provide study programs for the test for their employees. 
 The C.M.A. designation is intended as a counterpart to the C.P.A., or certified public accountant. It is awarded to accountants who have passed the required courses of study and examinations. Management accounting is intended to emphasize the nature of an accountant's work within a corporation as opposed to public accounting, which serves a variety of public clients in a number of ways, including the reviewing of a company's results for stockholders.
Currently there are 94,000 members of the institute, and about 10,000 of them hold the C.M.A. designation, which was first given in 1972, according to Donald W. Baker, president of the organization, who is a C.P.A. as well as a C.M.A. He is also vice president-controller of the Southwire Company, a Carrollton, Ga., maker of copper and aluminum wire cable for the transmission of electricity.
"Management is much more attuned to certification," Mr. Baker said in a telephone interview last week. "In the next decade we will see more emphasis on certification for those in corporate management posts in accounting."
He spoke of a "growing need for management accountants" who have a much broader role to play today in management than the cost and tax accounting in which they specialized in former years. There no longer is "the green-eyeshade viewpoint of accounting," he added.
Increasingly, he said, management accountants will need to understand the global environment and the handling of new, ever-changing technology demands. C.M.A.'s will continue to be used more widely by companies in planning corporate strategy, he added.
"We are becoming one large business community worldwide, and that means the need for more sophistication and knowledge," he said. "People who can provide and interpret the information will be those who hold C.M.A. designations. Employers more and more are recognizing the value of certification."
Mr. Baker urges that young people interested in corporate management via accounting should major in accounting during college and stress communicatons skills.
The institute, first named the National Association of Cost Accountants when it was formed in 1919, pioneered the evolution of cost accounting. This was a very important but confusing subject because it involved the setttlement of the "cost-plus" contracts with the Government during and after World War I, These contracts were based on the cost of producing a product plus an agreed profit. Company accountants also worked as well on projecting the cost of new products being developed. In 1957 the association changed its name to the National Association of Accountants.
Over the years, management accounting evolved to distinguish the internal accounting of companies from the duties of public accountants. And on July 27, 1987, institute officials appeared before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations to recommend the requiring of the C.M.A. certification for financial professionals as a "significant step" in achieving the aims of a national commission appointed to fight fraudulent financial reporting. No action was taken on the recommendation.
The C.M.A. title was first awarded in 1972. Gaining the right to use it requires two years of on-the-job managerial accounting experience and then passing an examination on varied topics. The subjects include economics, finance and management, financial accounting and reporting, management reporting, analysis and behavioral issues, decision analysis and information systems.
The institute gives its examinations twice a year, in January and June, in many cities. The examination consists of four parts, which can be taken one at a time, or all four over a period of two days. "Hong Kong; Fairbanks, Alaska; Amsterdam, the Netherlands, are a few of the places where we give the exams," an institute spokesman said, indicating the widespread availability of the tests.
Once qualified, C.M.A. applicants must agree to follow the code of ethics established by the institute. And once awarded the designation, a C.M.A. who commits a fraud loses certification, in addition to facing any civil or criminal charges.
The C.M.A. designation pays off in higher salaries, acoording to Daniel M. Hrisak, a spokesman for the institute, which has its headquarters in Montvale, N.J. According to the institute, the average salary for a C.M.A. in the 19-to-29 age bracket is $44,698, compared with $31,547 for institute members with no such certification.
In the 30-to-39 age group, C.M.A.'s typically earn $54,240 a year, while counterparts without the title earn $43,622. C.M.A.'s in the 40-to-49 age group average $59,509, while those without the title earn $51,858.
In the key managerial age group of 50 to 59, C.M.A.'s reported salaries averaging $65,361, compared with $63,257 for those without the designation.

Dollar Mixed in Light Day While Gold Prices Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mixed against major currencies yesterday in light trading as investors took a wait-and-see approach to changes in German interest rates to be announced this week.
Gold prices moved lower. In New York, gold for current delivery fell 90 cents a troy ounce, to $357.50, on the Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted an after-hours bid for gold at $357.45 an ounce, down $1.05 from late Friday. 
 The British pound gained against the dollar yesterday after slipping Thursday and Friday.
In New York, the pound finished at $1.6980, up from $1.6945 Friday. Earlier in London, the British pound rose to $1.6975, from $1.6965 late Friday.
The dollar finished slightly lower against most other European currencies, and held steady against the Japanese yen.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 136.40 Japanese yen, from 136.30 yen at Friday's close. Later, in London, it was quoted at 136.50 yen, down from 136.80 Friday. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 136.55 yen, unchanged from Friday.
Many currency traders were waiting to see what will happen to Germany's interest rates. Some dealers expect increases across the board in Germany's discount and Lombard rates after the Thursday meeting of the Bundesbank's council, but many traders said anything could happen.
"I think we're in a holding pattern," said Earl I. Johnson, a vice president with Harris Trust and Savings Bank. "Nobody wants to take a view until we see what the Germans do."
"I think most people continue to keep their powder dry -- stay on the sidelines," said David Ethridge, vice president with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. "It's an old adage of trading, you sell the rumor and buy the fact."
Against the German currency, the dollar fell to 1.7245 marks from 1.7288.

HEADLINE: Bank Stocks Lift Market; Dow Rises 5.14, to 3,001.34

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Buoyed by bank stocks, the stock market overcame early losses yesterday to post a gain at the close, with the Dow Jones industrial average again bouncing just past 3,000.
The announcement of the agreement for the $4 billion acquisition of the Security Pacific Corporation by the BankAmerica Corporation sent some big bank stocks sharply higher, but the rest of the market was weak. But in early trading only over-the-counter stocks posted gains, and even a firm bond market could not turn stocks around until the bank news hit. 
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was moderately light at 145.6 million shares, up from 144.1 million on Friday. Declining issues narrowly outpaced advancing issues by 776 to 767.
 
Composite Indexes Gain
 The Dow was up 5.14, to 3,001.34, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.90, to 388.02. Most stocks on the Big Board also gained and the composite index rose 0.36, to 212.53. American Stock Exchange issues rose, sending the composite index up by 0.33, to 366.31.
In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.69 to close at 510.
William E. Raftery, vice president of technical research at Smith Barney, Harris Upham, described yesterday's market as light but holding its own. He noted that the market was confused over the economy and had swung with each assessment of an economy that was strengthening to an economy that was weakening, to strengthening again.
"The market will stay at this level, until something gets the majority of the stocks to move," he said. "Right now we have investors just picking through the market, jumping from one segment to another."
Downward pressures stretched across the broad breadth of the market for most of the day, but by late afternoon blue-chip stocks cut their losses to post a slim gain in mild trading. Bank stocks were still up and bond prices were holding and supporting the market.
Mr. Raftery said it was possible the Dow could go to 3,100 and 3,200, with 4,000 reachable, if the bond market rallied.
BankAmerica rose 2 5/8, to 40, while Security Pacific jumped 9 1/8, to 32 1/8.
 
Other Banks Show Gains
 Other bank stocks caught up in the news included Bank of New York, up 2 1/4, to 35; Chase Manhattan, up 1 3/4, to 21 1/8; Mellon Bank, up 1 3/4, to 34 5/8; Citicorp, up 1, to 14 3/4; First Interstate, up 6 1/8, to 33 7/8, and Wells Fargo, up 3 1/4, to 75 1/2.
Special situations in yesterday's market also saw Price, a company whose principal business is in wholesale cash and carry merchandise, rise 2, to 58, in over-the-counter trading, as Chris Vroom, an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons gave the company a strong "buy" recommendation. He said the company's plan to offer shares in a real estate investment trust reflected a more aggressive stance toward growth and expects the company to accelerate its warehouse expansion.
ARCO fell 2 7/8, to 116 1/2. A Dean Witter analyst. Eugene L. Nowak, said he had cut third-quarter earnings estimates and those for all of 1991 and 1992. He still considers the stock a good long-term investment, but expects it to trade lower over the short haul as investors reassess what he thinks are diminished earnings propects.
 
Delta Down 7/8, to 72 1/4
 Delta Air Lines fell 7/8, to 72 1/4. Earlier in the day, Judge Cornelius Blackshear of Bankruptcy Court approved the sale of Pan Am assets to Delta in a new deal valued at $1.7 billion. Part of the sale agreement calls for Delta to help finance a plan of reorganization for Pan Am.
Kennametal Inc. fell 3 1/2, to 31 5/8, as investors reacted to reports that the company was the subject of a Government investigation on sales of equipment to Iraq. The company acknowledged that it had sold goods to Irag, or to those who resold products to that country, but it denied that the sales violated export laws.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
For Wall St., a Bigger Bank Is Better

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Wall Street loves bank mergers because it hopes competition will vanish, or at least get a lot less vigorous.
"Scale gives you market heft," said one investment banker yesterday, speaking on condition he not be named. "All of a sudden you have an 800-pound gorilla in some of these markets." 
 The reduction of competition is far from the only benefit of combinations like the one announced yesterday by BankAmerica and Security Pacific, and it is not the one that the banks prefer to cite. The two banks forecast annual savings of $1 billion a year within three years, as tellers are laid off and competing branches are closed.
But in talking to security analysts yesterday, Jerry A. Grundhofer, the president of the Security Pacific National Bank, said, "There are tremendous leverages on the revenue side, and we will take advantage of them." He will become a vice chairman of BankAmerica when its Security Pacific deal is completed.
Wall Street's enthusiasm was shown in stock prices. BankAmerica rose $2.625, to $40, adding $430 million to its market capitalization, while Security Pacific soared $9.125, to $32.125, adding $4.1 billion to its market value.
But Security Pacific shares still ended the day at only 80 percent of the price of BankAmerica shares, reflecting some market caution about the deal, which calls for each Security Pacific share to be exchanged for 0.88 BankAmerica share.
The market reaction indicated doubt that Wells Fargo, which had previously wooed Security Pacific, would try to submit a higher bid. But even though Wells Fargo seems like a competitive loser from the deal, its shares rose $3.25, to $75.50. And First Interstate, which merger rumors immediately named as a possible Wells Fargo target, leaped $6.125, to $33.875.
For now, anyway, investors are prepared to believe in synergy and in the benign effects on profits brought on by reduced competition. With fewer banks around, the hope is that those remaining will be able to offer lower interest rates to savers, charge higher rates to borrowers, and have more left over for shareholders. Even competitors, the theory goes, will benefit as large banks merge.
A generation ago, a combination of BankAmerica and Security Pacific -- the No. 1 and No. 2 banks in the nation's largest state -- would have been dismissed as a clear violation of antitrust laws. But bank officials said yesterday that they did not foresee any antitrust problems, and most analysts agree. Regulators now are less concerned that a lack of competition will hurt consumers than they are that bad loans will destroy banks.
To some on Wall Street, the most interesting aspect of the plan announced yesterday was not the expected savings, but the accounting. There are two acceptable ways to account for a merger, but in recent years banks have tended to use only one of them, known as pooling of interest, for most major deals. But BankAmerica will use purchase accounting.
That decision will enable BankAmerica effectively to add to loan-loss reserves at Security Pacific without having to report lower profits as a result.
The accounting treatment will not affect the reality of the loans, of course. In the past couple of years, problems have mounted, and Security Pacific's stock price has reflected investors' suspicions that more problems were likely to come.
In this takeover, BankAmerica effectively is betting that Security Pacific is not so bad off as Wall Street thinks -- or, a cynic might say, it is betting that BankAmerica is not so healthy as Wall Street believes. As of last Friday, BankAmerica was trading at 1.3 times its book value of $29.04 a share. But Security Pacific, beset by bad real estate loans and problems in Britain and Australia, was trading at just 0.7 times its book value of $32.40 a share.
In fact, the deal announced yesterday included an implicit disclosure that Security Pacific had more problems. In effect, BankAmerica plans to increase the reserves for bad loans by about $1 billion when it makes the acquisition.
If that is all there is to the hits, then the deal would still make sense for BankAmerica, even before it considers the savings that have so entranced Wall Street. Assuming a 40 percent tax rate, the effective write-off would be $600 million. That would mean BankAmerica would surrender stock with a book value of $25.56 for each Security Pacific share, which would have a book value of $27.68.
Finding that $1 billion in future financial statements will be a challenge. That is because of the accounting treatment. If it had been a pooling, the two companies would have combined, with all the historic book values preserved. If a write-off was needed, it would go through the income statement and would show up as a reduction of income.
But in purchase accounting, the buyer -- BankAmerica in this case -- values the assets and liabilities of the company being acquired. It then compares the net value of the assets with what it is paying. Based on the value of its stock last Friday, it will figure it is paying $4.2 billion.
If it winds up paying more than the assets are worth, then the difference will be shown as intangible assets, which are written off over many years. So it could make a large increase in loan-loss reserves, and have that show up as an adjustment to the value of the assets it acquired. If it ended up overpaying, that difference would show up as intangibles.
The rules for bank accounting are complicated in the extreme, and in some cases it is difficult to adjust loan values on acquisition if the problem is one of credit quality. But that can be finessed if the acquiring bank says it plans to get rid of the assets quickly.
That may help explain why BankAmerica's chief financial officer, Frank N. Newman, who will assume the same position in the combined company, said the company was considering a plan to put all or nearly all of the bad loans from Security Pacific, and perhaps some from BankAmerica, into a separate company. That company would owe money to BankAmerica, but its shares would be spun off to BankAmerica's shareholders, making it a separate company. Those plans, he said, were tentative and could be changed.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Securities Rise

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose in sluggish trading yesterday, pushing interest rates slightly lower.
"The market is in very good technical shape," one government bond trader said. "Of the refunding issues sold last week, only the bond is poorly distributed. As long as the economic numbers hold up this week, the market should do fine." 
 Despite the positive outlook, credit market participants spent a good bit of time yesterday talking -- and worrying -- about the potential impact of the market manipulation charges levied against Salomon Brothers by the Government last week.
"Nobody can think about the business because they are thinking about the business," the trader said. "It's impossible to say what the near-term implications of this are, but over the longer haul people are concerned about greater regulation. The timing of this couldn't be worse."
Last week Salomon admitted that at three separate Treasury note auctions held within the last nine months -- for two-, four- and five-year notes -- it had placed bids well in excess of the 35 percent cap any one firm can attempt to purchase at an auction. The firm also said that at some of those auctions it had submitted bids in the names of customers who had not authorized it to do so.
Suspicion that Salomon had been trying to corner the market in these issues had been circulating through the credit markets for months. But traders at rival firms said they derived little comfort when their worst thoughts were realized.
"This is a real black eye for the business," another bond trader said.
Investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commisssion and the Justice Department into Salomon's activities began before Salomon's announcement. With the Government Securities Act of 1986 up for reauthorization by Congress in the fall, market participants fear much tighter scrutiny in the future.
Traders and analysts said it would be impossible to begin to assess the market impact of the Salomon scandal until later this month, when the next two-year and five-year note auctions are scheduled.
"We will have a better feel for Salomon's reaction to this once we get through those auctions," said Steven A. Wood, director of financial markets research at Bank of America. "Then we will need to see what the S.E.C. and the Justice Department turn up."
Concerns about Salomon had no apparent effect on trading yesterday, as the successful completion of the refunding auctions and the positive implications of the Federal Reserve Board's decision to ease short-term interest rates last week continued to flow through the market.
Mr. Wood and other analysts said the Fed's move to lower the target for the overnight rate on bank loans in the Federal funds market to 5.50 percent had led to speculation that the central bank might move soon to lower the discount rate from its current 6 percent level.
That sort of speculation helped to bolster prices in the secondary market for Treasury securities.
In late trading, the new 8 1/8 percent issue of August 2021, sold at auction last week, was offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield to yield 8.20 percent, down from 8.22 percent late Friday.
In when-issued trading, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes sold last week were offered at a price to yield 7.93 percent, while the new 6 7/8 percent three-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.82 percent.
The recent slide in short-term interest rates was graphically visible in the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills.
 
Three-Month Bill Rates
 Three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 5.36 percent, down sharply from an average rate of 5.51 percent at last week's sale.
Bids on the new six-month securities produced an average yield of 5.39 percent, compared with 5.59 percent a week ago.
The drop in rates served as encouragement to a number of investment-grade corporations to price new issues yesterday. Five corporations offered a total of $875 million worth of new securities.
Among the issuers was Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, which offered $200 million worth of 30-year noncallable debentures through an underwriting syndicate led by Goldman, Sachs & Co.
The 9 percent debentures were priced at $99.178, to yield 9.018 percent, 87.5 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on the new 8 1/8 percent Treasury bonds of August 2021 at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
Motorola 40-Year Debentures
 Goldman, Sachs also acted as lead manager on a $200 million offering of 40-year debentures for Motorola Inc.
The 8.40 percent securities, which may be redeemed by the issuer at par, or $100, on Aug. 15, 2001, were priced at par, 45 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's new 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The issue is rated AA-3 by Moody's and AA-minus by Standard & Poor's.
A sharp improvement in the prices of oustanding debt securities issued by the Security Pacific Corporation highlighted activity in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds.
Prices of Security Pacific bonds surged by as much as six points shortly after it was announced the bank would be acquired by BankAmerica.
By contrast, traders said that bids on BankAmerica issues slipped by about a point. However, few securities actually changed hands.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	 	 	 	Average Price	98.660	97.275	Discounted Rate	5.30%	5.39%	Coupon Yield	5.46%	5.63%	High Price	98.663	97.285	Discounted Rate	5.29	5.37%	Coupon Yield	5.45	5.61%	Low Price	98.658	97.270	Discounted Rate	5.31%	5.40%	Coupon Yield	5.47%	5.64%	Accepted at low price	4%	1%	Total applied for	$40,638,705	$28,592,265	Accepted	$10,476,425	$10,429,815	N.Y. applied for	$36,767,715	$25,489,400	N.Y. accepted	$9,077,355	$9,018,400	Noncompetitive	$1,836,820	$1,450,410

HEADLINE: Business Scene;
Taxpayer's Role In Bank Bailouts

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
FOR months, the national debate over bailing out failed banks has rested on the assumption that the banking industry itself -- not the taxpayers -- would eventually pay the costs of reimbursing depositors who lose money. Now a House Banking Committee report is unraveling this assumption, mostly by illustrating rather starkly that the rules of deposit insurance have quietly been altered.
Until the report appeared in June, Congress had been proceeding with a rather standard strategy: It would advance $70 billion to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to get the nearly broke agency through the current wave of bank failures. The banks, however, would continue their decades-old practice of covering the cost of deposit insurance by paying annual premiums to the F.D.I.C. And they would eventually repay the $70 billion taxpayer advance -- thus preserving deposit insurance as a private, industry-financed affair. 
 "This bill has $70 billion in it for the bank insurance fund premised on the theory that the banks will pick up the tab; that's a very risky premise," Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, told the Senate Banking Committee recently during a debate on bank reform legislation.
As others have, the Senator reacted to the evidence in the House report that Federal Reserve lending practices had made possible the reimbursement of nearly all depositors in many bank failures since 1985, and not just those with insured accounts of $100,000 or less. Such expanded bailouts are raising the possibility that the deposit insurance system will, in time, have to be altered.
One concern is whether the commercial banks, already paying premiums that have quadrupled since 1989, can continue to afford the expanded coverage. The American Bankers Association says, flatly, no. "You have not got an industry big enough or an insurance fund big enough to protect all accounts above $100,000," said Robert Dugger, chief economist of the Bankers Association.
More important: should the banking industry cover all the costs of deposit insurance, even if it could afford the bill? The argument here, increasingly, is also no. The reasoning goes this way: The failure of some big banks would disrupt the financial system and damage the economy. Therefore, these institutions should be saved, with insured as well as uninsured depositors made whole. And since the public would suffer from such bank failures, the public -- the taxpayer -- should pay some or all of the huge bailout cost.
"If the costs are made more explicit in this fashion, then the public can voice some opinion," said Catherine England, director of bank regulatory studies at the Cato Institute. "There can be a debate about whether a particular big bank's failure would be a systemic risk." The recent bailout of the Bank of New England would have been part of this debate.
Congress is reluctant to give taxpayers a permanent role in bank bailouts, although the House and Senate versions of bank reform legislation move in this direction; the House much more than the Senate. The Bush Administration, for its part, says the banking industry should always pay for deposit insurance, never the taxpayer -- except for the $70 billion temporary advance, or the one-time outlays that have been made to resolve the savings and loan association failures.
Only the Fed, surprisingly, is prepared to give ground. Or, as David W. Mullins Jr., the Fed's vice chairman, puts it: "There is considerable logic behind the notion that a portion of the payment for systemic risk resolutions might come from public funds because of the public benefit from safeguarding the financial system and the economy."
By all accounts, the Fed's change of heart reflects embarrassment over the House Banking Committee report. Drawing on Fed data, the House report noted that the Fed had made unpublicized loans from its "discount window" to more than 350 faltering banks, large and small, that later failed. The loans prolonged the lives of these banks, allowing uninsured depositors to withdraw their money.
When these institutions finally failed, the F.D.I.C. reimbursed the Fed for its loans, but no longer had the uninsured deposits at its disposal to help reimburse insured depositors. The F.D.I.C. says the extra drain on the insurance fund over five years was less than $2 billion. But Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, challenges this estimate as much too low.
Whatever the amount, Mr. Mullins distinguishes between "liquidity" loans from the Fed's discount window and "extended" lending. The former would continue; most are short-term loans to get healthy banks through cash shortages. The extended loans, taking the Fed beyond its charter, are the very aid to faltering banks cited in the House report.
During the Depression, the last wave of bank failures, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation propped up banks through loans, and answered to Congress for its dealings. Now Ms. England, other experts and the Fed itself are suggesting that if some faltering banks are to be kept alive and all depositors reimbursed, some new R.F.C. should make this decision -- not the Fed.
"It would be one answer," Mr. Mullins said, "if we could disassociate the resolution funding from our traditional discount window activities."

HEADLINE: The Two Newarks; Boom Amid Bust -- A Special Report;
In Newark, Downtown Glitter Battles Neighborhood Gloom

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Newark has a future. On that most people agree. Its location makes it the transportation hub of northern New Jersey, and $6 billion in new office construction over the last five years has revived confidence in the city.
But whether that future will take the form of a city where people want to live is a question with no clear answer. Newark presents two different images to visitors: one of gleaming steel and glass towers, the other of 100-year-old railroad shacks and multifamily wood frame houses in neighborhoods with few stores or amenities, not even a movie theater. 
 Downtown, new office towers rise near the Passaic River; four dormitories have been completed near the city's four colleges and universities; a new Federal courthouse is under construction; the first 25 town houses in a 90-unit complex have opened, and the United States Postal Service, which had considered moving its regional distribution center to Secaucus, has decided to stay and expand here, possibly creating as many as 2,700 more jobs.
 
'Phoenix Is Rising Again'
 And the city, which has been the butt of jokes for generations, has received an all-American Cities Award from the National Civic League and, because of the city's improvements, has been called the "most livable city" by the United States Conference of Mayors.
"The Phoenix is rising again," said the city's ebullient Mayor, Sharpe James.
But if the Phoenix is rising, its flight has not reached the neighborhoods of this 325-year-old city, which lost 52,000 residents, a decrease of 16 percent, between 1980 and 1990.
Unemployment remains high at 12.6 percent, almost twice the state average. The city's school system is considered one of the worst in the state and is under the threat of a possible state takeover. Newark is second only to New York City in the nation in the per capita rate of AIDS infection -- mostly among intravenous drug users. And residents, as soon as they find the money or have children, flee to other communities.
"Newark is experiencing one of the biggest inner-city developments anywhere," said Norman J. Glickman, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University. "But the problem is there's no trickle down," he said. "Go five blocks from the core of the business district and you find some of the worst urban conditions in the United States."
The problems in this city of 275,221 are similar to those in other former industrial giants, like Detroit and Pittsburgh. Downtown development has changed the landscape of those cities. But the new offices, condominiums and apartment towers have done little for the neighborhoods.
 
Middle-Class Flight
 Newark, which became the state's industrial leader in the 1800's on the strength of its leather making, brewing and jewelry manufacturing, has suffered a steady decline since World War II. The city has been written off several times, most recently after the 1967 riots, which left 26 people dead and much of the city in ruins. After the riots, Newark lost most of its middle-class residents, who fled in record numbers, leaving the poor to rebuild their lives and neighborhoods with little economic support.
According to Census Bureau statistics, the 1990 population of Newark decreased 27 percent from 1970, when the population was 382,417.
Somehow, Newark survived, mostly on the strength of the people who stayed, either because they hoped to bring the city back or because they had no other choice. Now, their downtown is doing better than in decades, while their neighborhoods continue to rely on nonprofit organizations and block associations for improvements.
"The people who had to or chose to stay through the tough times, those who held the neighborhoods together, deserve as much credit as anyone else and should share in the benefits of any revival," said Richard Cammarieri, a lifelong resident and executive director of the Newark Coalition for Neighborhoods. "There is still some equity here because of them."
 
The Neighborhoods
Who Benefits From Revival?
 But so far, those people have not shared in the revival, said Msgr. William J. Lindner, founder of the New Community Corporation, a nonprofit organization that has built 10 housing complexes for 5,000 people, health-care centers for the poor and a supermarket, among other things, in Newark's most distressed neighborhoods.
"People arrive at Penn Station from the suburbs and go to work in all those complexes, but they don't provide jobs for the people in the neighborhoods," he said. "Our economic needs are so great and yet block grant money doesn't help the neighborhoods. It's used downtown."
Monsignor Lindner cited the construction of a walkway above Raymond Boulevard that connects a new office building -- the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's Legal and Communications Center -- with Penn Station. The pedestrian bridge was built by the Newark Economic Development Corporation with a $1.3 million loan from the city. That money, the Monsignor said, could have been used to repair streets, sidewalks and make other improvements in the neighborhoods.
Alfred L. Faiella, executive director of the development corporation, said the bridge was needed to complete the legal center and to provide a safe crossing for pedestrians. He said the development corporation will use the proceeds from a 450-car garage it is building downtown to pay off the loan. He said the corporation is already helping minority business owners fix up their stores.
"A ride up the main corridors of the city today will show a great deal of improvement over what it was just a few years ago," Mr. Faiella said.
Everett Shaw, president of Renaissance Newark, a civic and business advocacy group, said the $6 billion in downtown construction had helped to renew confidence in the city. That confidence, he said, has already begun to spread to the neighborhoods in the form of housing construction and renovation by private developers.
"More market-rate housing is being built in the city than in the last six decades," Mr. Shaw said, "and more than 2.2 million square feet of commercial space is under construction or contract."
Such development, Mr. Shaw said, provides construction jobs for the short term and the promise of permanent jobs in the long run. Community leaders counter that while the construction jobs are good, they are not enough to sustain a city where the median income is $12,000 and about one-third of the residents receive welfare.
"We need a reality check on some of these things," said Mr. Cammarieri of the Newark Coalition for Neighborhoods. "We have to get rid of the exaggeration and hyperbole about some of the development and talk realistically about costs and benefits.
"It's an old story," he said "We're not where we were but we're still not near where we want to be -- in terms of our needs."
 
The Decline
Downhill Slide In the 50's
 Newark was once a great city with a powerful industrial and business base. It was there that the Prudential Insurance Company was founded. But things began to change by the 1950's, with an exodus of residents and businesses to the suburbs. One of the city's major employers, Mutual Benefit Life Insurance, nonetheless chose to remain. After that the Prudential Insurance Company built a new office tower. At the time, the two buildings were the first new office construction in the city since 1931.
Mutual Benefit and Prudential -- joined by New Jersey Bell, the Public Service Electric and Gas Company and First Fidelity Bank -- began a coalition that has been a stabilizing force for decades. The coalition suffered a serious blow recently with the threatened collapse of Mutual Benefit, its acknowledged leader, because of poor real-estate investments. City officials and urban planners say the problems at Mutual Benefit could have serious consequences for the city's future.
The companies have provided the impetus for a proposed $75 million performing arts center, which would be built near the Passaic River and not far from the Newark Museum and Library. The center could be an anchor for further downtown development, such as that already under way with the legal center, a new Blue Cross and Blue Shield building, a new headquarters for N.J. Transit, the state's public transportation agency, and an office building that will house Seton Hall Law School.
 
'We Pulled the Rug Out'
 Such projects, Mayor James said, will help the city to better help its neighborhoods in the future.
In an effort to better manage the city, Mayor James in 1986 hired Richard Monteilh, the former deputy finance commissioner in Atlanta, to be Newark's business administrator. And last month, the Mayor hired William Celester, a deputy superintendent of the Boston Police Department, to be Newark's new police director. In an effort to bolster confidence in the city's neighborhoods, Mr. Celester has ordered the deployment of 70 percent of the city's police force to the streets.
On taking office five years ago Mr. James ordered a management study that showed the city was losing tens of millions of dollars through poor collection of property and water taxes. A crackdown raised the rate of tax collections to 92 percent, from below 80 percent, and ended a peculiar city hall perquisite. "Many of those who weren't paying worked for the city and assumed that they didn't have to pay taxes," he said. "We pulled the rug out from under them."
Since then, Moody's Investors Service has raised the city's bond ratings slightly, thereby making it less expensive for Newark to borrow money.
"People are feeling good about the city," Mayor James said, adding that "the true report card on the city will be the quality of life in the neighborhoods."
 
Paying No Taxes
 "My challenge is to use the development to reach out and touch the neighborhoods and make sure the renaissance is more than new buildings and Broad and Market Streets," he said.
Community leaders insist, however, that that is not being done. They say that the downtown development, as impressive as it is, is not addressing the needs of residents: an improved school system, better housing and improved health services.
About two-thirds of Newark's 24 square miles is occupied by government buildings, schools, parks and Port Authority operations that pay no taxes. The city receives $18 million a year from the Port Authority and about $10 million from other tax-exempt institutions instead of taxes to support the city's $465 million budget.
Richard D. Marshall, professor of real-estate finance at Rutgers University, said that in its eagerness to attract new development, the city has allowed non-taxpaying tenants to occupy prime commercial land. Those institutions include Rutgers, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and Essex County Community College.
Nonetheless, Mr. Glickman, of the Center for Urban Policy Research, said that Mayor James has made great strides in changing the city's deep-seated image problems. But those strides may not be enough. "The Mayor is pushing and trying to counteract them, but I don't know if he's going to be able to succeed," Mr. Glickman said. "Conventional wisdom says people will continue to leave. Things might yet turn around but it's going to be a tough job."
 
The Solutions
New Housing Is the Key
 Vic DeLuca, chairman of the Newark Coalition for Low Income Housing, and Steve Finn, director of the coalition's home project, said one way to help turn the city around is to build more affordable housing for the city's poor.
According to the Census Bureau, Newark had 127,424 housing units in 1970, and 102,473 in 1990.
Newark desperately needs affordable housing, they say. Community leaders say that the city has 8,000 to 10,000 homeless families and countless numbers of people doubled up, living in makeshift apartments in basements.
But in 1987 the Newark Housing Authority razed four buildings that contained 800 apartments at the Scudder Homes housing project as part of what was to have been one of the largest public housing demolition programs in the country. Eventually 39 of the 41 high-rise buildings were to have been destroyed.
The housing coalition and some tenants sued and under an agreement signed by the housing authority in September 1989 the authority was given permission to demolish all eight buildings at Christopher Columbus Homes and three of five buildings at Kretchmer Homes. In return the authority had to renovate more than 1,600 apartments and build 1,777 apartments to replace those lost through the demolition.
Since the agreement no new housing has appeared. Some town houses were started on the site of the 1987 demolition but they were so poorly built that two blew down in a thunderstorm in 1989 and the rest were razed.
Construction start schedules for four new town-house projects containing 465 units have come and gone. A ceremonial ground breaking for 100 units at Bergen and Madison Streets was held in April but the June construction start deadline has passed. Benjamin J. Quattlebaum, a spokesman for the authority, said construction will start in September.
Meanwhile, some private developers have built town houses and condominiums for middle-class residents in the Central Ward near the Essex County Courthouse and the cluster of colleges and universities. The Vogue town house development built by Prudential and the Society Hill condominuims, being built the K. Hovnanian Companies, will help to stimulate construction in other neighborhoods, said Dr. Saul K. Fenster, president of New Jersey Institute of Technology.
 
'Some Painful Memories'
 Cora Moody and Pearl Cole, who live in Hayes Homes, a housing project in which all but 280 of about 1,100 families have left, fear that the new housing development will mean they will be forced out of their apartments. Half of the 10 buildings in the project, which is in the Central Ward, are vacant.
"Hayes Homes is in a prime location and I don't think it's fair if we're pushed out," Mrs. Moody said. "I'm all for the renaissance but everybody has to be included."
Mrs. Cole, who has lived in Hayes for 31 years, saw her husband shot by a police officer during the riots when Mr. Cole came to pick her up after work. "We live with some painful memories," she said, "but we've learned lessons from that and we try to help each other. I think the housing authority, the city, H.U.D. and the tenants have to join together and fix the buildings up."
Despite the problems, though, many see a bright future for this city.
"The city has two good strengths," Mr. Glickman said, "its political and business leadership and its location. Mayor James is bright and vigorous and he's working with a very dedicated business leadership.
"And the city has access to the rest of the world and the rest of the metropolitan area by plane, ship, train and highways and that's important when building for the future," he added.

HEADLINE: THE BANK MERGER;
One Deal Maker Finds No Letup in Demand

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Donald A. Moore is an investment banker who is much in demand these days. A managing director of Morgan Stanley, he specializes in bank deals, and lately he has not had much free time. He has been involved in nearly every major bank merger or acquisition announced this year, including representing the Bank of America in its acquisition of Security Pacific.
Mr. Moore also represented Manufacturers Hanover in its merger with Chemical Bank, and he represented NCNB when it agreed to merge with C&S/Sovran. 
 "I had three days off between Nov. 1st and March 1st of this year," Mr. Moore said, adding that he was including weekends. "Recently, it has been a lot of execution, but we have also been spending a lot of time advising clients."
 
Merger Pressures Grow
 Mr. Moore is not the only one feeling the sweep of merger mania. With each new announcement of a deal, the pressure grows on the management of those banks that have not yet moved to improve their books or their market position.
Mr. Moore and some bank executives say the trend is based on a belief that a merger can produce cost savings for banks, mostly through reducing employment in areas where they have overlapping operations. But also, as regional giants like Banc One in Ohio, Suntrust in Georgia and NCNB in North Carolina build their prowess, many institutions are worried that they could become an also-ran in their own markets. Hence, there is pressure to put together a hefty and profitable market share through regional consolidation.
"There has always been economic pressure for consolidation among U.S. banks," Mr. Moore said, adding, as others have, that the nation needs a mere fraction of the 12,000 or so banks now operating.
In addition to the excess competition, he noted, the credit cycle is in a phase that is putting pressure on bank earnings. Also, problems with bad real estate loans are expected to drag on for several years.
 
Widespread Potential
 When asked where the next deals were likely to show up Mr. Moore, 40 years old, pointed to nearly every region of the country.
"There are some transactions waiting to happen in the Southeast, the West, the Northeast and the mid-Atlantic," he said, adding that there are natural combinations nationwide.
Perhaps more important, the nature of those transactions is likely to change somewhat as pressure grows on bank directors to make acquisitions or take other action to strengthen their companies. Mr. Moore predicted that as buyers get increasingly frustrated at not being able to get their targets to sit and negotiate, there will be more hostile transactions.
Mr. Moore, a California native who lives in New York City with his wife and two children, joined Morgan Stanley in 1975, after graduating from the Harvard Business School. He has specialized in the banking industry for about 14 years and became a managing director of the firm in 1986.

HEADLINE: Cocaine Is Again Surging Out of Panama

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: PANAMA

 BODY:
In most of the world, drug smuggling is a sneaky nighttime affair. But in Panama, nearly two years after President Bush sent in troops to capture Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and crush the cocaine trade, traffickers are boldly hauling drugs at all hours.
On clear mornings, private pilots and others say light planes can be seen circling over Panama's Atlantic and Pacific coasts while crewmen toss bundles of cocaine to waiting cabin cruisers and fishing boats. 
 Other aircraft deliver drugs to dozens of small unguarded airstrips, and an endless procession of skiffs, small wooden workboats, shrimpers and weathered freighters glide along the ragged shorelines, coming from Colombia with cargoes that include cocaine.
"Lots of drugs are coming in," said Captain Jose R. Rosas, the commander of the National Maritime Service, Panama's equivalent of the Coast Guard. "The boats operate all day long, day and night."
As in the past, Panama serves mainly as a way station for cocaine destined for the United States and Europe. But so much cocaine is flooding in that some Panamanians and Americans say the volume is greater than when General Noriega was supposedly giving traffickers safe passage through his airports and harbors in exchange for a share of the profits.
 
Expanding Market
 With General Noriega in custody in the United States and scheduled to go on trial on drug charges in Miami next month, American officials have withheld public disclosure of evidence that might give a measure of the trafficking in General Noriega's day. Nor have Panamanian officials and former Noriega associates come forward with such details.
One of President Bush's stated reasons for invading Panama in December 1989 was "to combat drug trafficking," but since General Noriega's ouster the price of cocaine in Panama has fallen and more of the drug that is being intercepted in the United States is being traced back here.
The Panamanians, with American help, have also been seizing increasingly larger quanitities of cocaine, and Government officials say local cocaine consumption is rising, another indicator that more is entering the country.
President Guillermo Endara and other senior Panamanian officials say they are committed to fighting drug trafficking, but complain that the Government lacks the resources to stem the tide.
 
A Smuggling Free-for-All
 This is partly the result of a decision by the civilian Government to assure that the armed forces and the police do not regain the strength that they enjoyed during the Noriega years, when they cowed the Panamanian public into submission. Though by some accounts the new security forces are less corrupt than their predecessors, they seem to lack a sense of esprit de corps and have not developed into an effective force.
Under General Noriega, cocaine smuggling in Panama was an orderly business, Panamanian and American officials say. He had a close relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency and the Drug Enforcement Administration and won accolades from the drug agency for helping to catch traffickers. But it now appears that the only traffickers who ran into trouble were those who tried to ship drugs without cutting him in.
Since the invasion, cocaine smuggling in Panama has become a free-for-all. Now, law enforcement officials in Panama and Washington say, it is as if the country were beset by an army of ants.
Shortly before the invasion brought the civilian Government to power, the Colombian traffickers began veering away from Caribbean smuggling routes and moving much of their cocaine through Central America and ultimately across the Mexican border into the United States. Panama became the first stop in a route that law-enforcement officials call "the trampoline," which accounts for 70 percent of the cocaine that reaches the United States.
 
Endara Feels the Barbs
 The increasing drug trafficking comes as the civilian Government of President Guillermo Endara is groping for its bearings.
The Government, which inherited $6 billion in foreign debt, a bloated civil service and a thoroughly corrupt and brutal army, has been confronted by strikes, street protests and a crime wave that has produced a bonanza for private security agencies.
After years of political repression but little common crime, Panamanians have been stunned by bank robberies, holdups of restaurants and all their guests, ambushes of business people traveling from airports, and hundreds of burglaries and auto thefts.
Mr. Endara, a 55-year-old corporate lawyer, was respected for his long opposition to Mr. Noriega. But he has appeared indecisive and disorganized and become the butt of jokes about his chubbiness, his love of sweets and his recent marriage to a woman half his age. This spring he broke with the leader of the biggest group in his ruling coalition in a dispute over Government spending policies and lost his majority in the national assembly.
The economy, crippled by nearly two years of American sanctions and finally stopped cold by the invasion, is beginning to percolate again. High-rise buildings and shopping centers are going up, new boutiques and restaurants are opening and retail sales are rising despite persistent unemployment, which has one in five Panamanians without work.
Deposits in Panama's more than 100 banks have gone from $12 billion at the time of the invasion to $16 billion, but foreign investors and tourists are still shying away. In 1987, bank deposits totaled $45 billion.
One of the Government's first steps in reshaping Panama was to dismantle the army and create a new security force with a gentler philosophy and less central control. Most of Mr. Noriega's officers were dismissed. But most of his troops were allowed to put on new uniforms and line up for United States-provided classes in how to be good police officers. They typically earn $300 or so a month. Some go about their duties half-heartedly, Panamanians say. Others fish for bribes and shady opportunities.
 
Drug Boats Are Too Fast
 "The truth is there are a lot of people in the system protecting and actually helping narco-traffickers," said Rodrigo Arosemena, the chief of the customs service.
Even the most dedicated officers are hamstrung by shortages of equipment. The unit that specializes in drug investigations has 80 members who share seven vehicles and a handful of radios. The Maritime Service has 10 vessels, including two shrimp boats, a confiscated speed boat and an 82-foot cutter that the United States Coast Guard delivered in early August. There is no air patrol.
The commanders often feel helpless. "We see the drug boats," said Captain Rosas. "But they're so fast we can't catch them."
Panama is a smuggler's dream. It shares a border with Colombia, the world center for refining and exporting cocaine, that runs through 135 miles of dense rain forest. The Panamanian coasts, rippled with coves, inlets and bays, run for 1,700 miles, about 350 miles more than those of Florida, and the country's waters are dotted with more than 1,500 islands.
Fishermen say it is not uncommon to find plastic-wrapped packets of cocaine the size of hard-cover books floating or scattered on the beaches. People who live near the water and the air fields frequently see traffickers.
"Little boats come in with the stuff and then fine cars, sometimes Mercedes-Benzes, come to take it away," said a woman who watches the action from a window of her home on the Bay of Panama, not far from the presidential palace and the heart of the capital.
The drug trafficking and other security problems are confounding to Mr. Endara and others who fought the dictatorship. Emotionally and politically, they feel that building a strong-armed force is not possible.
"We don't want anything that smells like an army," Mr. Endara said in an interview at his waterfront offices. "If we started increasing our law enforcement instead of building and fixing hospitals, people would protest."
He and the others are willing to better equip the security forces, providing that the United States pays. Gonzalo Menendez, the chief of the national police, said in a reference to the head of the Office of National Drug Policy in Washington: "If Mr. Bob Martinez and all the anti-drug forces want to fight drugs they must supply the resources to the Panamanian Government."
For 1990 and 1991, Panama received $13.2 million from the United States for police training and another $1 million for equipment like radios, emergency lights, sirens and bullet-proof vests. The new Government also got $10 million for equipment and training that had been designated for Mr. Noriega but withheld. In 1990 alone, Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, the three countries where almost all the world's cocaine is produced and refined, received $114.5 million.
The Government has been slow to embrace some United States measures against drugs. It took until this spring, for example, to reach agreement on patrols with the United States Coast Guard and a treaty that gives United States officials access to Panamanian bank accounts in investigations of money laundering and other drug crimes.
 
Money Laundering Continues
 Billions were said to have been laundered under Noriega, and some law-enforcement officials say the country may have been far more important to traffickers for its banking services than as a channel for drugs.
Government officials and some bankers say money-laundering has diminished markedly. But the State Department said earlier this year that it "is still a major concern," and a Treasury official said in an interview the other day that "a high level of money-laundering activity" appears to be continuing.
American officials say the Endara Government has been cooperative. But though Mr. Endara and many of his officials are lawyers and bankers familiar with the banking system, they have initiated no money-laundering investigations that were not first suggested by United States officials.
Mr. Endara and his Attorney General, Rogelio Cruz, were members of the boards of banks that were shut down because of money laundering, but both deny wrongdoing.
Panamanian officials insist they are doing the best they can against the traffickers.
"If you have no planes, no boats and no guns, what can you do?" said Mr. Menendez one morning at national police headquarters. "We're not getting ahead. Why should I fool myself?"

HEADLINE: THE BANK MERGER;
BankAmerica in $4 Billion Deal To Acquire Rival Security Pacific

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 12

 BODY:
The BankAmerica Corporation said today that it would acquire its California rival, the Security Pacific Corporation, in a deal worth more than $4 billion, the latest in a wave of mergers sweeping the nation's largest banks.
The combination of the two largest banks in the West will create a huge bank, approaching the size of Citicorp, the nation's largest. 
 The new bank, which will retain the BankAmerica name, would also eclipse in size the banks to be formed in two other huge deals announced in the last month -- the mergers of the Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover in New York and of NCNB and C&S/Sovran in the Southeast.
Bank executives and analysts say the wave of mergers, which now appears to be turning into a cascade, is occurring because the American banking system is beset by overcapacity. A merger, particularly of two banks serving the same state or region, can result in huge savings because overlapping branches and personnel can be eliminated. With such savings, banks can often offset losses that they are suffering because of bad real estate loans and the recession.
 
Praised by Seidman
 L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, praised both the proposed deal and the trend of large bank mergers. "It should be good for the efficiency of the system," said Mr. Seidman, who spoke from Nantucket Island in Massachusetts, where he is on vacation.
He noted that it would substantially reduce the banks' expenses and shore up their capital. "People have been predicting this trend for some time, and now it's finally happening."
 
Chairman and President
 The combined bank will use the Bank of America name for its branches and banking activities, and Richard M. Rosenberg, chairman and chief executive officer of BankAmerica, will become chairman and chief executive of the merged company.
Robert H. Smith, chairman and chief executive of Security Pacific, will become president and chief operating officer. The new company will have headquarters in both San Francisco and Los Angeles, but most of the corporate staff will be in San Francisco.
Mr. Smith said at a news conference in Los Angeles, "The benefits, the economies of an in-market merger are overwhelming." He added, "I think we'll be seeing more in the months to come."
Another factor pushing mergers is a desire for American banks to expand nationwide and to compete better globally with foreign banks, many of which are far larger than American ones. "I can't overplay the importance of a world-class position," Mr. Rosenberg said.
BankAmerica, which is based in San Francisco, and Security Pacific, which is based in Los Angeles, said they expected to save about $1 billion a year within three years. That is roughly equal to one-seventh of their combined expenses. Although company officials were not specific, it is expected that thousands of workers will be cut from the combined work force of about 92,000, and that dozens, if not hundreds, of the combined bank's 2,400 branches will be closed.
Such savings would help offset the addition of $1 billion to the banks' combined reserve for loan losses. Security Pacific, while by no means in trouble, has been hurt by bad loans and could benefit from having its capital base strengthened by the merger, analysts said.
Under the terms of the deal, BankAmerica will issue 0.88 of a new share of its stock for each of Security Pacific's outstanding shares. At BankAmerica's closing price of $40 a share today, the deal would be worth nearly $4.5 billion, making it the largest bank merger in American history.
The combination would have about $190 billion in assets, just behind the $217 billion of Citicorp, the nation's largest bank in overall assets, but ahead of Citicorp in domestic assets. Before the recently announced mergers, BankAmerica was the nation's second-largest banking company, and Security Pacific the fifth largest.
The $2.3 billion stock swap for merging Manufacturers Hanover into Chemical Bank will create a bank with $135 billion in assets. The NCNB merger with C&S/Sovran, a $4.3 billion transaction, will create a bank with about $116 billion in assets.
The three recent mega-mergers aroused investors' expectations that other banks will feel pushed into taking similar action, and the stocks of many banks rose today, as a result. Security Pacific's stock, the most active on the New York Stock Exchange, rose $9.125 to close at $32.125, while BankAmerica's stock was the second most active and rose $2.625, to $40 a share. Chase Manhattan, up $1.75, to $21.125, and Citicorp, up $1, to $14, were also on the active list.
The boards of both BankAmerica and Security Pacific have approved today's deal, but it is still subject to stockholder and regulatory approval. The two banks said they expected the acquisition to be completed within six months.
The combined bank would be the largest in California and Washington by far and also the largest in Arizona and Nevada. It would be the second largest in New Mexico and the third largest in Oregon. It would also have extensive operations in the Far East, where both BankAmerica and Security Pacific already have major operations.
"We have a historic opportunity to become the leader in American banking," said Mr. Rosenberg of BankAmerica.
 
No Antitrust Problems Seen
 He added that he did not expect any antitrust problems. Banks, he said, were facing competition not only from one another but also from other types of companies, like the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in credit cards and the Ford Motor Company, which owns a savings and loan and a leasing company, in consumer finance.
However, analysts said that regulators might require some branches to be divested because the combined banks' market share would be too high in some areas, particularly in Washington, where BankAmerica already owns Seafirst, the largest bank, and Security Pacific owns Rainier, the No. 2 bank, and in parts of California, where they are dominant.
Mark Foster, policy analyst with Consumer Action, a San Francisco consumer group, said the merger "is going to mean less competition and less consumer choice." Consumer groups in California have long contended that the four large banks' dominance in the state means that Californians receive lower interest rates on deposits and pay higher interest rates on loans than people who live elsewhere.
Wall Street analysts, in contrast, praised the move, saying it would result in huge economies of scale and bolster BankAmerica's earnings in the long run. "The merger strikes me as being a brilliant move," said Thomas H. Hanley, an analyst at Salomon Brothers.
Security Pacific surprised Wall Street with poor financial results in three of the last four quarters, partly because of problem real estate loans in Britain, Australia and Arizona and the cost of quitting certain businesses. The weak California real estate market has casts a cloud over all California banks.
Taking on Security Pacific's loan portfolio could present a major risk for BankAmerica. However, the bank's officials said they had thoroughly examined Security Pacific's portfolio. Other industry analysts said that any new problem loans could be compensated for by the savings in expenses because of the merger. In addition, BankAmerica will probably seek to sell some of Security Pacific's non-banking businesses.
Today's announcement is evidence of a stunning recovery by BankAmerica, which was perilously close to failure five years ago and was almost taken over by First Interstate. From 1985 through 1987 BankAmerica lost $1.8 billion because of bloated expenses and bad loans to developing nations and to companies in energy, agriculture and real estate.
But after selling assets to offset loan losses and cutting expenses, the bank has worked its way back to health. BankAmerica has now earned more than $1 billion in each of the last two years, placing it among the nation's healthiest banks.
BankAmerica has begun expanding aggressively, hoping to become a nationwide consumer bank, while the giant New York banks are preoccupied with problem real estate loans. It has bought more than a dozen banks and failed savings and loans throughout the West in the last year and half, and it bid unsuccessfully for the Bank of New England.
Because it will now have its plate full with Security Pacific, BankAmerica's expansion might pause briefly. But Mr. Rosenberg said, "We think we will still have the capability to continue to expand."

HEADLINE: F.D.I.C. Is Getting New Chief

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
President Bush has decided to nominate William Taylor as the next chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to succeed L. William Seidman, Administration officials said today.
The appointment of Mr. Taylor, a career official who is now the Federal Reserve Board's top banking regulator, is expected to be announced this week by the White House. Mr. Seidman told the President last Tuesday that he would be stepping down from the agency that oversees the nation's banks at the end of his six-year term on Oct. 16. 
 The President's decision lays to rest speculation that the appointment of Mr. Taylor, who had been the leading candidate, was in jeopardy because of criticism over the Fed's handling of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and several American banks it apparently has secretly owned for years.
Mr. Taylor has asserted that the Fed did not learn of the secret ownership until this year, although evidence has appeared that the Central Intelligence Agency knew about the secret ownership of the banks as early as 1986. The Fed's supervision of the case and of an industry plagued by significant bank collapses is expected to dominate his confirmation proceedings.
 
Named Last Year
 President Bush first named Mr. Taylor as Mr. Seidman's expectedsuccessor last year, when the White House sought very publicly to force Mr. Seidman from office because he was viewed by some Administration officials as being too independent. While Mr. Taylor had remained the leading candidate to succeed Mr. Seidman, Mr. Bush told reporters last week after Mr. Seidman's resignation that he had decided to "start over and take a hard look."
Mr. Taylor, 52 years old, did not return a telephone message today seeking comment. If he is confirmed by the Senate, he will bring a more low-key personality to the post than Mr. Seidman, the 70-year-old administrator who established a reputation for his bluntness and his forceful advocacy on behalf of the F.D.I.C. One lawmaker last year comparing the two men described the succession as a shift "from a spritely personality to a plaid one."
Under the 1989 law that set up the Government bailout of the nation's savings and loans and which Mr. Seidman helped to shape, the chairman of the F.D.I.C. also serves as chairman of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency overseeing the savings bailout. Mr. Seidman is also resigning that position and Mr. Taylor will assume the title.
 
A New Position
 But Administration officials, stung by accusations that the bailout has been too slow and concerned about a possible legislative overhaul of the bailout, announced earlier in the summer that they intended to create a new position of chief executive to oversee the bailout and remove the F.D.I.C. from day to day management of it. And Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has undertaken a search to fill that position.
Mr. Taylor is generally highly regarded on Capitol Hill and has also had a good working relationship with officials at the Treasury Department. He is often seen at Congressional hearings at the elbow of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, who has relied on him heavily as a senior adviser.
He is most closely identified among industry executives and regulators as a strong, almost obsessive, proponent of high capital standards. He worked closely with regulators from around the world in coming to a uniform standard that ties bank capital -- its cushion against losses -- to the riskiness of its assets.
He has also been behind the Fed's decisions in recent years to gradually permit banks, in limited instances, to underwrite corporate securities. That a practice has been restricted by the Glass-Steagall Act, which was written during the Great Depression as a remedy to the banking crisis.
 
A Full Plate
 At the F.D.I.C., Mr. Taylor will have his hands full. The insurance fund that protects bank deposits has been rapidly depleting because of the increasing number of bank collapses. At the same time, regulators have been under considerable political pressure not to be too harsh on the industry for fear that the banks will further tighten credit while the economy is struggling to recover from recession.
Mr. Taylor has had significant experience handling banking and savings crises. Most recently, he served as Washington's senior regulator in London when authorities from around the world decided to seize dozens of B.C.C.I.-related banks. Earlier this year, he was the Fed's top man supervising the seizure and rescue of the Bank of New England. And in the mid-1980's he was involved in supervising banking crises in Ohio and Maryland.
Last year Mr. Taylor served a brief stint during a pivotal point in the savings and loan bailout as the acting president and chief executive of the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Cabinet-level body headed by Mr. Brady that sets overall policy for the bailout. He replaced Daniel P. Kearney, whose departure was a setback for the bailout and came after Mr. Kearney clashed with Treasury officials who had been seeking to assert greater control over the effort.
After graduating from Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa, in 1961, Mr. Taylor became an examiner with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. He left in 1969 to run the lending department of a bank and then in the 70's moved to Rouse & Company, where he ran the developer's real estate finance operation. He returned to the Fed as a superviser in 1976.

HEADLINE: 'Mirror Image' Chemistry Yielding New Products

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
LEGIONS of chemists are invading a looking-glass world of mirror-image molecules, and a boom in chemical research is producing new drugs, pesticides and even perfumes that exploit the differences between these molecular twins.
Scientists believe that mirror-image chemistry may also shed light on the nature and origin of life itself. On earth at least, the building blocks of life are mostly left-handed molecules rather than the random mixture of left-handed and right-handed molecules found in extraterrestrial objects like meteorites. 
 Many chemicals important to life are combinations of mirror-image twins, in which one partner may cure disease, quell headaches or smell good, while its mirror-reversed counterpart may be poisonous, smell repugnant or simply be inert. Scientists are investigating the chemistry of thousands of such pairs, learning to make pure forms of the desirable twins, and thereby creating many new products.
Looking-glass chemistry depends on the fact that some chemicals come in two forms, which differ in the same way that a left hand differs from a right hand.
Chemical compounds that come as mirror-image pairs are sometimes compared with left-hand and right-hand gloves and are referred to by chemists as "chiral" (pronounced "KYE-ral"), or handed molecules. Each twin is called an enantiomer (pronounced en-ANT-ee-oh-mer).
Despite the close resemblance of such twins, the differences in their biological properties can be profound.
In 1960, hundreds of European babies whose mothers had taken the sedative thalidomide were born deformed. Some chemists believe that one of the two mirror-image molecules contained in thalidomide may have been responsible, and that had thalidomide been purified to exclude the evil, mirror-image twin, the disaster might never have occurred.
Because the left- and right-handed twin of a chemical pair often behave very differently from each other in the body, chiral twins are coming under increasing scrutiny among chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturers, biologists, agronomists, entomologists and regulatory agencies. As a sign of the trend, a new professional journal, Chirality, began publication two years ago.
"There's been enormous recent progress in asymmetric synthesis," said Dr. Ernest L. Eliel, a chemist at the University of North Carolina. Asymmetric synthesis is a class of chemical techniques that produce a single enantiomer of some compound, rather than a mixture of both twins, as most chemical processes produce. Many pesticides are mixtures of chiral twins, of which often only one is active, Dr. Eliel said, and when economically feasible, it is better to manufacture the potent enantiomer alone, unmixed with "ballast." The makers of pharmaceuticals are especially concerned that the chemical handedness of a drug may influence its efficacy and safety. For example, one enantiomer may have a potent biological effect, but, in rare cases, according to Dr. Paul J. Reider, director of process research at Merck and Company, its mirror-image twin may have the opposite effect.
In the case of drugs, he said, a pharmacologist may ask whether both enantiomers are metabolized, stored or excreted by the body in the same way.
Typical of the chiral drugs widely used in pain-relieving products is ibuprofen, a compound developed by Boots Pure Drug Company in England whose mirror-image enantiomers have distinctly different properties. The left-handed twin is about four times more potent than the right-handed twin.
In itself, this might be grounds for manufacturing the left-handed enantiomer in pure form.
But pharmacologists have discovered that enzymes in the body are able to take right-handed ibuprofen and convert it into the more potent left-handed form.
This means that there would be little point in incurring the extra manufacturing costs of separating the mirror-image. Ibuprofen, sold today as an ingredient in more than 50 pain remedies, is therefore manufactured as a mixture of equal parts of left-handed and right-handed molecules.
Some chemicals must be prepared in pure form containing only one chiral twin. One is a substance called cyclopropane carboxylic acid. When manufactured as an equal mixture of left-handed and right-handed molecules, it has a foul smell. But if only one twin is produced, the result is a substance used commonly in the perfume industry.
Dr. Reider estimated that some 70 percent of the latest drugs are manufactured "asymmetrically" to consist wholly or largely of one enantiomer. Examples are the blood-pressure drug Vasotec, the anti-cholesterol drug Lovastatin and steroids used in the treatment of arthritis and other diseases.
Chiral twins are sometimes produced separately for different uses. Eli Lilly & Company, for example, makes the sedative drug Darvon and its mirror-image twin, a cough medicine named Novrad, spelling Darvon backwards.
Chiral differences are also important to pheromones, natural chemical odors secreted by animals as signals. Pheromone signals are used to mark territorial ranges, to invite reproductive partners and to warn off predators, among other things.
One of the chemists developing synthetic pheromones to lure insect pests to their destruction is Dr. Donald S. Matteson of Washington State University at Pullman. Most of these pheromones must consist of only one chiral twin to work; the use of the wrong twin or of an equal mixture of both twins may not work at all.
Dr. Matteson's group has synthesized four insect pheromones that are identical in their handedness to the natural ones. To do so, they used natural handed molecules derived from sources like pine trees to create templates for starting out the pheromone molecules with the correct handedness.
 
Don't Drink Looking-Glass Milk
 In Lewis Carroll's tale "Through the Looking Glass," Alice wonders whether "looking-glass milk" on the other side of the mirror would be fit to drink. Dr. Matteson answers that it would not, because biologically active molecules in the milk, notably sugars and proteins, would have the wrong handedness for Alice to digest, unless her own chemistry were converted to its mirror image by passing through the looking glass.
But the very indigestibility of wrong-handed compounds may have its uses. The sugars that are used by the body, for example, are right-handed; left-handed sugars are indigestible. This fact is the basis of at least one patent for a sweetener made from a left-handed sugar that supposedly is non-fattening.
Wrong-handedness is also a possible basis for the development of new antibiotic drugs.
Amino acids, the building blocks from which proteins and the other chemical ingredients of life are assembled, are chiral molecules that can take either left-handed or right-handed form. But with the exception of glycine, which has no handedness, the amino acids in almost all living things are exclusively left-handed.
A bizarre exception to the left-handed rule is a microorganism called Bacillus licheniformis, which makes the protein in its cell wall from right-handed amino acids. Scientists believe the organism does this to make itself indigestible to the killer cell phagocytes in animal blood that would normally attack it.
Drug companies study the use of molecular wrong-handedness to poison disease-causing bacteria without poisoning their human hosts.

 Dr. Reider explained that although human beings and other animals can metabolize only the left-handed enantiomer of the amino acid alanine, bacteria contain an enzyme capable of converting right-handed alanine to the digestible left-handed variety. The strategy of a drug designer might therefore be to attach a suitable poison to right-handed alanine molecules. Because the human body could not metabolize the right-handed compound, it would not be affected by the poisonous booby trap. But a bacterium could devour and metabolize the right-handed compound, thus poisoning itself.
Although the boom in chirally pure substances began only recently, the realization that mirror-image twins behave differently dates to the early 19th century. In 1844, the German chemist Eilhardt Mitscherlich discovered that although a solution of commercial tartaric acid in water twists a beam of polarized light to the right, a solution containing a related compound, sodium ammonium paratartrate, has no effect on the light beam.
In 1848, Louis Pasteur discovered that the paratartrate actually consists of two different kinds of crystals that can be clearly discerned under a microscope. Using tweezers, he separated the crystals and dissolved them in separate solutions. Passing polarized light through each of the solutions, he found that one solution twisted the light to the right and the other an equal angle to the left. The reason the unseparated paratartrate solution had no effect on the polarized light beam, Pasteur realized, was that the light-twisting effects of its two enantiomers canceled each other out. The reason the constituents behave oppositely is that their molecules are mirror images of each other.
Many methods are used today to synthesize or separate enantiomers, but some still involve variations of Pasteur's approach.
With the new emphasis on chiral chemistry, government officials in Europe, Japan and the United States wonder whether there is a need for regulations that address the handedness of drugs.
Some chemists believe too little money is available for research to determine the pharmacological differences between enantiomer twins.
 
Work on Anesthetics
 Dr. Jerrold Meinwald of Cornell University and his associates have devised chemical methods for separating the enantiomer pairs in three common anesthetics, halothane, enflurane and isoflurane. Their success with these technically difficult separations means, in principle, that enantiomers could be produced in sufficient quantity to conduct clinical trials. Because small amounts of anesthetic are metabolized by patients, it would be useful to determine any differences in the toxicity of their enantiomers, Dr. Meinwald said.
"Scientists really don't know much about how anesthetics work," he said, "and study of their enantiomers might shed light on this question, while possibly helping to eliminate the small risk of dangerous side effects that some anesthetics have."
But funds are lacking for large-scale animal tests of anesthetic enantiomers, he said, and without these, further research is stymied.
The pharmaceutical industry has counseled caution in regulations concerning the handedness of drugs. The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association said last year that each case should be decided on its merits by the manufacturer.
The Federal Food and Drug Administration essentially agrees.
Dr. Judi Weissinger, assistant director of the agency, said, "The F.D.A. is not going to insist on some inflexible checklist" of analyses and trials of chiral drugs. Instead, she said, the agency would continue to alert manufacturers to prudent guidelines.
Underlying all chiral chemistry is the fundamental question of why the amino acids making up virtually all living things are exclusively left-handed.
The fact that they share the same handedness is easily explained. "To fit biological molecules together properly, you must use molecules with the same chirality. The helical DNA molecule, for instance, could not be assembled from a mixture of enantiomers. The components must all have the same handedness," said Dr. Eliel, the University of North Carolina chemist.
But why are they left-handed and not right-handed?
Many scientists believe that the direction of handedness resulted from the flip of a chemical coin, and that once the pattern was established, subsequent molecular development had to follow suit.
But some theorists say they believe that left-handed biology may have its origin in the "weak" nuclear force. This force, which drives certain types of radioactive decay, is not precisely even-handed but has a slight left-handed bias. A group of British investigators found in 1985 that the mixing of the weak force with the electromagnetic force would slightly favor the formation of left-handed amino acids.
But right-handed and left-handed amino acids appear to exist in roughly equal quantities in meteorites that hit the earth. And an analysis published last month in Physics Today by three Soviet scientists, Vladik A. Avetisov, Vitalii I. Goldanskii and Vladimir V. Kuzmin, argued that the weak force is far too weak to have determined the direction of biological handedness.
Scientists may never know what gave life its chiral bias, but on one point they agree: without an initial spin, no one would be here thinking about it.


GRAPHIC: Molecules that exist as mirror-image twins often have very different properties. The left-handed and right-handed versions of the carvone molecule have the same composition -- 10 carbon atoms, 14 hydrogens and one oxygen -- and their structures are mirror images.

"The Importance Of Being Handed"
 Chiral chemicals are handed in the same way that hands themselves are either left or right. The direction of a molecule's handedness determines the types of interaction a chemical can have with other chemicals.
 
Atlanine
This amino acid is one of the building blocks of life. Animals can use only the left-handed form. Bacteria can use the right-handed form by converting it to left-handed alanine.
 
Thalidomide
 This sedative deformed babies born to women who took it. Some scientists say only one form may have been at fault, while the twin may have been harmless.

HEADLINE: Phoenix Asking if Bias Played Role in 9 Killings

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Without a clear motive in the slayings of nine people at a Thai Buddhist temple last weekend, residents of this desert city were left to confront the question of whether this was an anti-Asian hate crime.
Officials said they were still pursuing all possible motives in the crime, and offered no evidence that racism was behind the killings of the six monks, one nun and two disciples at the rural temple early Saturday. 
 The Maricopa County medical examiner, Dr. Heinz Karnitschnig, said that some of the victims were hit by shotgun blasts as they had their hands raised, and that all nine were then killed with shots from a small-caliber gun to the head or neck as they lay face down on the ground. The authorities said there were no signs of a struggle.
Some Asian and non-Asian residents voiced concern that the killings were a racist hate crime, given a national context of concerns about harassment against Asians and the rapid growth of the state's tiny Asian population.
In Arizona, according to the 1990 census, Asians and Pacific Islanders increased by 150.6 percent since 1980, to 55,206. The census counted 16,303 Asians in Phoenix; only about 2,000 of them are Thai. The city's total population in 1990 was abot 983,000.
 
Comfortable in Phoenix
 Officials said the state had not experienced a significant level of anti-Asian harassment to date, and some members of the Thai community here said they felt comfortable in Phoenix.
A spokesman for the Phoenix Police Department, Sgt. Kevin Robinson, said the city had not seen a pattern of harassment of Asians. Addressing another possible motive in the killings, he said Asian gangs did not have a significant presence here.
"Regarding hate crimes against Asians, we are not finding anything specific, no sort of pattern that has been going on," he said.
At the Siam restaurant in Glendale, not far from the temple, the manager, Prakong Garland, said she had always felt comfortable in Phoenix.
"We never bother anybody and I never have problems," she said. "I like the hot place in Arizona. And over here are nice people."
Her restaurant was the site today of a meeting of 50 people along with Thailand's Ambassador to the United States, who arrived here from Washington. She said the main issue was the question of whether to return the remains of the victims to Thailand for a ritual cremation.
The crime has been front-page news in Thailand and the Government there has asked American authorities to give the investigation top priority, The Associated Press reported. But it said news organizations there were not focusing on the killings as a crime resulting from bias against Asians.
"The reaction has been very sad, shocked, quite strong," the Ambassador, Birabhongse Kasemsri, said.
 
Low-Level Harassment
 Ashok Jain, president of the Arizona Asian American Association, said Asian residents faced a constant low level of harassment that ranged from verbal insults to the throwing of eggs.
He and others cited two recent instances in which abusive graffiti, including swastikas, were painted on a Chinese Christian church and on a wall outside the Japanese-American Citizens League in Glendale.
The temple, Wat Promkunarum, moved to its rural setting 20 miles west of downtown Phoenix after neighbors in the city had complained about the crowds of worshipers it attracted and the sounds of unfamiliar Thai music.
Helen Zia, the president of the New York chapter of the Asian-American Journalists Association, said that on the national level an anti-Asian climate had been growing, fed both by angry memories of the Vietnam War and resentment of Japanese economic success. In a telephone interview, she said these sentiments seemed to be directed at Asians in general, ignoring national distinctions.
Although no national figures have been gathered, she said, "There has been a significant increase in anti-Asian hate crimes, from harassment to assault to deadly violence."
She cited instances that ranged from attacks on Vietnamese fishermen in the late 1970's, to the killing of a Chinese man, Vincent Chin, in 1982 in Detroit by men who resented Japanese auto companies.
In recent cases, she said two white men in Wilmington, N.C., had attacked a group of Chinese and Vietnamese men, killing one of them, and in Houston last August a group of white supremacists had beaten to death a Vietnamese teen-ager.
The shocking nature of the temple killings here and the absence of public evidence about its motives have fueled fears of racism among some residents.
Rabbi Albert Plotkin of Temple Beth Israel here, said: "Hate crimes are a plague around the nation. I call it a disease like the plague, like the black death, that is spreading, and unfortunately we are as susceptible to it as anyone."
 
'Not an Asian Hate Crime'
 But Manny Wong, publisher of The Asian-American Times, a monthly newspaper here with a circulation of 5,000, said: "I hate to say this, but I don't think it is. It is not an Asian hate crime, stereotyping these Asian people." His theory is that the killing involved a war among religious sects.
Speaking to reporters outside the temple, Sheriff Tom Agnos of Maricopa County said investigators were leaving all possibilities open, including robbery, gang violence and personal vendetta.
But he offered the strongest evidence to support robbery as a motive, saying bedrooms had been ransacked and rings may have been removed from the hands of the victims.
But he said the temple itself had been left undisturbed, and worshipers said it contained gold and jade statues as well as a "money tree" hung with donations of dollar bills.
 
Searching for Vehicle
 In the first public sign of a clue to the killers, investigators today asked for help in finding a late-model red and white Ford Bronco II with tinted windows that was seen leaving the scene on Saturday morning.
Voicing the sentiments of the community, Sheriff Agnos said, "I think this crime is horrendous and I believe the community will not tolerate anything like this."
As small groups of Thai mourners stood outside the temple, where police investigations continued today, Annie Walker, a resident of Phoenix who said she had no ties to the Buddhist community, arrived in tears to place a large bouquet of chrysanthemums by its gate.
"All I wanted to do is bring flowers," she said. "It doesn't hurt."
She placed them near a bouquet of bougainvillea that had been brought earlier by other non-Thai mourners, bearing a card reading, "To the family and members of Wat Promkunaram."

Is Baseball Slap Happy On Fines?

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
MAYBE it's the recession. Eight years ago George Steinbrenner made disparaging comments about National League umpires, and Bowie Kuhn, then the commissioner, fined him $50,000. Last week Lou Piniella questioned a National League umpire's integrity, and Bill White, the National League president, fined him $1,000.
If White's action was a slap on the wrist, what was the $500 fine he levied against Rob Dibble for throwing a baseball at a batter running to first base? Given Dibble's previous transgressions -- he has served seven games' worth of suspensions for two incidents earlier this season -- White's fine was a wag of the finger that said: "Now, Robby, you did a naughty thing so you be a good boy and don't do it again." 
If that was what White told Dibble while fining him what amounted to less than 20 percent of one day's pay, the world will not know it. At least not from White. The man who was visible and audible for 18 years as a broadcaster on Yankee games has become baseball's Claude Rains. Without the screen magic that aided Rains, when news conferences are held following owners' meetings on such matters as National League expansion, this once frank and friendly fellow becomes the invisible man.
But White's inaccessibility and unwillingness to comment publicly are only a footnote to the primary topic here: his relatively light penalties for what his predecessors viewed as serious baseball offenses.
"Dibble has accepted counseling and I think that had a lot to do with it," said Piniella, the Cincinnati Reds' manager, of White's decision. The manager's own volatile behavior hardly makes him a good role model for his tempestuous relief pitcher.
"He's already missed seven games," added Piniella. "I think the counseling was the most important consideration."
Dibble apparently was supposed to have begun -- but he didn't -- counseling long before the July 23 incident that prompted the latest penalty. The volatile pitcher fielded Doug Dascenzo's suicide squeeze bunt between the mound and the first-base line. He picked up the ball, ran five steps toward the line and straddled it before he fired the ball at Dascenzo's legs. Earlier in the season, he was suspended first for throwing a pitch behind a batter's head and then for throwing a ball into the outfield stands and injuring a woman.
Obviously, Dibble has a short attention span, and it's difficult to understand how a $500 fine is going to get his attention for longer than the time it takes him to write the check.
In the same game, Andre Dawson flung 15 bats onto the field in protest of his ejection for arguing a third-strike call. Rarely the source of trouble, Dawson was suspended for one game, a penalty that could cost him $18,132 in pay. If he warranted a one-game ban, Dibble, a three-time loser, should have received seven games. That penalty would cost Dibble $18,269. Seems like it would have been a good idea because someone had better stop Dibble before he really hurts somebody.
While talking about Dibble's latest episode, Piniella did not disclose that White had fined him, too. But the $1,000 penalty was paltry compared with the $5 million lawsuit Umpire Gary Darling has filed against Piniella for defamation of character. The day after a game in which the Reds had a home run taken away, Piniella charged that Darling was biased against the Reds. "I've hired a lawyer," Piniella said, declining to comment on the lawsuit.
The irony of the legal action is that Richie Phillips, the umpires' union lawyer, who filed the suit, should hope as hard as Piniella that a judge throws it out. Phillips is the last person who should want the umpires testifying under oath about what they think and do. Players, whose relationship with umpires prompts images of two armed camps, would wait in line to testify about what umpires have said and done on the field.
The lawsuit aside, should managers make the kind of comment Piniella did about Darling?
"I never make comments about an umpire," said Sparky Anderson, the dean of major league managers. "I don't like to settle my problems with an umpire in the paper. If he missed a call, I know it, he knows it, the world knows it. Television shows the replays for everyone to see."
At the same time, the 22-year veteran thinks the lawsuit is absurd. "If we're going to be petty," he said, talking about the action, not the amount, "we're going to see policemen out on the field for a fight between two teams carrying people off. We can carry this so far off the scope, it becomes laughable."
And the next time a player is moved to throw a ball at a runner, he'll tell the league president he plans to seek counseling.

HEADLINE: Universities Become Full Partners to Cities in South

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, Ala.

 BODY:
When the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa opened an extension here in 1936, it was designed to be just that -- a small offshoot in the city, offering courses to students who could not attend the main campus.
But today, it is the University of Alabama at Birmingham, not its parent institution, that is the state's hotbed of ideas and progress. 
 U.A.B. is now the largest employer in the state; it runs the state's most comprehensive hospital, which recently opened a $104 million clinic designed by I. M. Pei, and it counts its economic impact on the region at about $1 billion a year.
The story here has been repeated across the South, as urban universities have become the economic generators in their cities. As their economic importance has grown, these universities -- in New Orleans, Charlotte, Atlanta and other cities -- have also increased their roles as community leaders, attacking social problems, preserving cultural institutions or generally filling a leadership role once played by business leaders.
And they have played an equally important role in changing the character of the population around them, not only by providing employment but also by making a college education more accessible to poor inner-city residents.
 
Transforming Cities
 "U.A.B. just simply took Birmingham into the First World economically," said H. Brandt Ayers, editor and publisher of the Anniston Star, in Anniston, about 70 miles to the east.
Educators and sociologists say this is part of a broad trend, apparent for some years in the Northeast and now reaching its full impact in the Middle West and especially in the Sun Belt.
As textile, shipping and manufacturing industries that fueled cities like Birmingham and New Orleans began to shrink or die over the last 20 years, the public urban universities increasingly replaced them as major employers and shapers of the new urban landscape.
"Urban universities are doing for the cities in the 1990's what the land-grant colleges did for the rural areas in the 1800's," said Greg O'Brien, president of the University of New Orleans, which is part of the Louisiana State University system.
 
Taking It to the People
 Land-grant colleges and universities were developed to bring public higher education to the country, with a mandate to focus on agriculture and mechanical arts. Now urban universities, created for the most part less than 40 years ago, have also changed the socioeconomic profile of people who get college educations.
The classic pattern in the South and Middle West, where the big state universities were in small towns, was that only those urban youngsters with solid family incomes were likely to go off to college for four years. The urban universities have brought the classrooms to the population centers, eliminating travel and boarding from the cost of a college education.
It seems a simple truth, but the concept that education dollars ought to be spent where people live seemed hard to grasp for Southern legislators, who were attuned to spending their higher education budgets mainly in towns like Tuscaloosa, Oxford, Miss., and Athens, Ga.
When money and students began to flow into the new urban universities, it changed not only local economies but also the educational pecking order within many state university systems.
 
Housing, Race Relations and More
 "We are in the midst of a transfer in our economy from an industrial economy to sophisticated service industry," said Marguerite Barnett, president of the University of Houston, which has established an institute to help revitalize Texas school districts. "With most of our people living in cities, a diverse new population, it is the urban university that is on the cutting edge of change."
Ivory-tower isolation and the traditional town-gown divisions common to small university towns have begun to change, too. Although most university administrators insist they are nonpolitical, many have used the weight of their payrolls to push local governments for improvements in public services and race relations.
Otherwise, the educators argue, they cannot attract the faculty members they need to sustain their reputations and lure the hundreds of millions of dollars in Federal contracts and grants that enrich the local economy.
For example, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte chose a site north of Charlotte and created a new town, University City, which has attracted numerous corporations and improved the region's economy. Georgia State University in Atlanta has a partnership with the local school system to train teachers and administrators, and is working with a mayoral task force to develop residential housing downtown.
 
Partner to the City
 As the profiles of urban universities have risen so has their ability to attract the kind of star talent that only the more prestigious regional universities, like Vanderbilt in Nashville and Emory in Atlanta, had lured for years. After persuading the Coca-Cola Company to endow a jazz chair at its institution, the University of New Orleans got Ellis Marsalis, a highly regarded teacher who is the father of the jazz musicians Wynton and Branford Marsalis, to be the first to hold it.
The university also helped resuscitate the New Orleans Symphony after it was closed for nearly a year, a typical example of the community-university links that have developed.
"Very few public urban research institutions will simply be located in their cities in the 21st century," Dr. Barnett said. "They will have to be a partner in their cities if they're going to continue to thrive."
One theme at these universities in the Deep South is that the painful passage through the civil rights struggles of the 60's gave some communities a more open attitude toward diagnosing and treating other community problems.
"History and truth are so close to the surface here that we live with a great sense of reality in the South," said Tennant S. McWilliams, vice president of academic affairs at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. "We've got problems, but the only way to get out from under them is to confront them."
 
Opening Doors for Blacks
 U.A.B. reaches deep into the public life of Birmingham, providing assistance to 90 public schools, research to a burgeoning number of small businesses and design for a model school in a new industrial research park.
To tighten the political bond between the university and the city, U.A.B. gave leave to one of its faculty members to work on the staff of the city's first black Mayor, Richard Arrington Jr.
"It sits right in the middle of the black community, and in its scope, sensitivity and comprehensive commitment to urban life, I doubt there is another university that can match it," Mayor Arrington said.
Because Birmingham once represented segregation at its most monolithic, U.A.B.'s impact is sometimes most easily measured in its impact on educational opportunity for blacks.
 
Tight-Fisted Legislature
 Twenty-five years ago, the city had no accredited public college that admitted blacks. Today one-fifth of U.A.B.'s 16,500 undergraduates are black, the highest percentage of black students at any predominantly white institution in the state.
Twenty-five years ago, blacks were barred from what was then the state's only medical school, and they could not get nursing or paramedical training in Birmingham. Today 14 of the 165 first-year students at U.A.B.'s medical school are black, and four of them ranked in the top 10 percent of their undergraduate classes.
The university is also deeply involved in the effort to build a civil rights museum here.
Such activities can create strains between urban universities and their state legislatures. The Alabama Legislature, historically hostile to Birmingham, is one of the nation's most tight-fisted with education spending. While most state universities draw half of their operating budgets from their legislatures, U.A.B. received only 25 percent, or $162 million of a $633 million budget for the 1990-91 school year.
Thus, though Birmingham reaps enormous benefit from U.A.B., it is Federal tax dollars in the form of grants and contracts, scholarships and fees from its hospital services that sustain the university.
 
Cultivating Its Garden
 That local business leaders recognize the benefits of the university is evident, however, in a recent capital fund-raising drive. Some of the city's top corporate executives led it and helped raise $67 million, a noteworthy development in a city whose business executives have seldom exerted the kind of leadership exhibited by counterparts in Atlanta, Charlotte, Houston and other Sun Belt cities.
The struggle to raise money is mirrored in a kind of bootstrap approach to academics that flies in the face of political efforts to end affirmative action and may be unique to U.A.B.
When the university here decided to boost its number of minority faculty members, for example, it eschewed raiding other universities in favor of a long-term effort to develop its own pool of talent. It has a 10-year, multilevel program that provides support for high school students through post-doctoral candidates. Short-term needs are supplied through visiting professorships. The program costs $850,000 a year.
"That's hard state money, and we take it right off the top," said Charles A. McCallum Jr., the university's president. Largely because of the program, U.A.B. has 44 black doctoral students in mathematics and science.
In some states, legislatures have recognized the enlarged role of urban universities in sustaining cities. An urban college consortium in Ohio got its Legislature to reinstate $30 million in state financing for its programs after initial cuts, by showing the economic advantages the colleges bring the state.
At the Federal level, Congress may finance the Urban Grant University Program of the Higher Education Act for the first time since it was enacted in 1980. The program would provide financing for just the kind of city-university partnerships that have been growing across the country.
"Urban universities form a very special function in education, and that role can be expanded as one city after another undergoes transition," said Representative Thomas Sawyer, Democrat of Ohio, who along with Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon, has proposed $10 million in financing for the program. "That same engine that drove the economy of this nation during the shift from agriculture to urban industrial dominance has the same potential in an urban setting."

Travers Hits Town, Excitement Follows

BYLINE: By Joseph Durso

DATELINE: SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y.

 BODY:
These are the best of times and the worst of times in horse racing, and nobody in the business seems to know how to keep the former from being obliterated by the latter.
They are the best of times at Saratoga Race Course because this is Travers Week, the week of the 122d running of the Travers Stakes, "the midsummer Derby." 
 It marks the first time since the Kentucky Derby that the archrivals for 3-year-old honors have raced together on the same track:
Strike the Gold, who won the Derby; Hansel, who won the Preakness and Belmont Stakes, and Fly So Free, the winterbook favorite for the Derby, who revived and won the Jim Dandy Stakes here two weeks ago.
They will race the Derby distance, too, a mile and a quarter. They also will make this year's Travers the most dramatic race since the Kentucky Derby on May 4 and the most important before the Breeders' Cup championships on Nov. 2. And if that's not enough theater for one race, the winner also pockets the lion's share of a $ l million purse.
All three of the main contenders worked out on the track this morning while the glow of the best of times began to gather round the barns. But everybody remembered that these were also the worst of times in the racing business. The inflated economy of the 1980's has burst in the 1990's, collapsing the price of everything from a horse farm to a horse.
At the yearling sales here last week, in an auction held in a pavilion one block from the main gate to the track, the average price for a horse plunged 40 percent from last year.
Even the wealthy Arab and Japanese investors kept their hands in their pockets this time. At the Keeneland sales in Kentucky three weeks ago, the best yearlings in the thoroughbred business went for 11 percent below last year's average, even though the royal Maktoum family of Dubai spent $25 million of the $75 million paid for the horses.
Gimmicks won't help.
At Belmont Park, they printed 25,000 buttons with pictures of Meadow Star and Lite Light for their duel in the Mother Goose Stakes in June, and only 17,472 customers showed up. Another brainstorm was announced today when the New York Racing Association and the New York State Lottery unveiled a giveaway game involving "scratch-off tickets" with a horse-racing theme.
But the main focus of horse racing, and of its promotions, marketing ploys and advertising campaigns, should be the horse. And that's why Travers Week marks a return to the best of times at Saratoga after one of the worst of weeks. The star of the show is the horse.
It's not easy to win the Travers. Only one favorite has won it in the last five years (Easy Goer in 1989). Affirmed didn't win it. Conquistador Cielo didn't win it. Alysheba ran sixth in it. When it's run next Saturday again, two of the three big horses in the race won't win it, maybe all three.
Strike the Gold ran first in the Derby, sixth in the Preakness, second in the Belmont and third in the Jim Dandy. His chief tormentor, Hansel, ran 10th in the Derby, first in the Preakness and Belmont, third in the Haskell Invitational. The winner that day was Lost Mountain, who had run 12th in the Derby and seventh in the Belmont. And Fly So Free, last year's juvenile champion, won five straight before running second in the Blue Grass, fifth in the Derby and first in the Jim Dandy.
Tom Bohannan, who trains Lost Mountain, tried to get a handle on all this gyrating and came up with this: "Strike the Gold just got beat by Fly So Free, and Hansel beat Strike the Gold, and we just beat Hansel. I feel confident."
So does Nick Zito, who galloped Strike the Gold in the morning sunshine and said, "Now, if we can just get a few more days like this, we'll be in good shape."
Hansel galloped a mile and a half this morning with his regular exercise rider, Pam Fitzgerald, who said, "He'll be back tomorrow, then he'll walk Wednesday, gallop Thursday and gallop again Friday."
Fly So Free was on the track before 6 o'clock this morning, galloping two miles under Bob Caputo, his regular exercise rider. Scotty Schulhofer, who trains the colt for the Broadway music publisher Tommy Valando, reported that the countdown to the big race would be this: a half-mile workout Wednesday, some walking Thursday, galloping Friday, jogging Saturday.
"We had a little setback," Schulhofer said. "He jarred his shoulder a little in the Jim Dandy. But he's doing fine now. He's a tough horse. He's even a tough horse to gallop. Bob earns every penny when he gets on him. The Travers comes down to a matter of who gets the best trip. Whoever has the best luck will win the Travers."
Now, that's what you'd call a horse race. And, for one week, at least, the best of times at the race track.

Not Half Likely

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
Surely President Bush will not run for re-election. To do so would make little or no sense, and the President, like him or not, is eminently sensible.
He is far too sensible, for instance, to reveal such an explosive decision until the country's most formidable Democrats finish reading themselves out of the contest. When political opponents are busy knocking themselves out, why intervene? 
 Once these Democrats have all dropped out, they can of course drop right back in after Mr. Bush says he won't run either, but by then it will be too late. We have all heard these Democrats say they were not dropping out because they feared running against Mr. Bush. It wasn't fear of Bush that cooled their zeal. No siree.
They were dropping out because they had previous engagements, because they wanted to spend more quality time with the children, because they had to take the car to the shop, because the doctor had told them they needed another four years of fiber-rich diet and fresh air before running for President.
All America would laugh to see them rush back into the fray once Mr. Bush dropped out. Knowing how deadly such laughter can be would probably keep them permanently sidelined, guaranteeing Mr. Bush's hand-picked successor a romp to the White House, sealing his reputation for political genius and assuring him generous ink in the history books.
Why won't the President go for a second term? Four reasons:
1. Second-term curse:
Second terms usually become failures, if not catastrophes. Since 1900 only Theodore Roosevelt escaped the second-term curse. Woodrow Wilson's ended with the Versailles Treaty calamity and his Republican opposition triumphant. Franklin Roosevelt's was nearly ruined by his arrogant attempt to pack the Supreme Court and a deepening of the Great Depression. Truman's produced the Korean War. Eisenhower's produced the humiliation of the U-2 affair and spreading national ennui that contributed to the triumph of his Democratic opposition. Nixon's started and ended with Watergate. Reagan's is too recent to judge coolly, but despite triumphs Gorbachev gave him there is something terribly sad about those lingering last images of the tired old man so out of touch with his own job that an Oliver North could bring him close to ruin.
President Bush, who knows his history, must realize that he would be defying prohibitive odds by taking a second term.
2. Wisdom of Joseph P. Kennedy:
The founder of the Kennedy dynasty, when asked why he cleverly got his fortune safely out of Wall Street before the 1929 market crash, replied, "Only a fool holds out for top dollar." Going for a second term would for Mr. Bush be tantamount to holding out for top dollar. His first term with its historic successes in foreign policy and war has blessed him with a popularity and stature almost inconceivable for any President in his third year in office. To risk losing so much glory by defying the second-term curse would take a reckless, impetuous personality quite alien to Mr. Bush's solid conservative nature.
3. Lethal domesticity:
What President today wouldn't hate domestic policy? Everything needs to be done and there is no money to do anything, at least no money obtainable by Presidents loyal to the Reagan way of life. Prognosis: Society is likely to continue coming apart, continuing a trend that is already turning the country into angry, bickering tribal units defined by common economic, racial, age, sexual, regional and ethnic bonds. In 1988 Mr. Bush proved he knew the Pledge of Allegiance, but he hasn't shown much interest in saving us from becoming one nation highly divisible. Foreign, not domestic, policy is his bag. A second term would confront him with four years of domestic crises that might defeat Solomon, much less a Republican President with a surly Democratic Congress.
4. Age and health:
He is just the right age to enjoy his large, loving family in reasonably good health and bask for many years in the world's admiration of his statesmanship, but four years of the second-term curse offer only melodrama for his biography.
The President's choice to be next? Secretary of State Baker, provided of course that somebody has enough nerve to get his dander up by saying he's too wimpish to dump Dan Quayle.

HEADLINE: New York Should Cap Hiring of City Workers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Every few years, New York City goes through such a budget crisis as we have now. The scenario seems the same. Recession sets in, therefore receipts to the city decrease, thereby causing layoffs of city workers. After the good times return, politicians hire workers back in greater numbers than before the crisis. In our recent crisis we have 50,000 more workers than we had at the end of the last crisis, in the late 1970's. 
 I would suggest that a cap be put on the number of workers in city government, with a small increase allowed when population increases. This would prevent politicians from hiring great numbers of unneeded workers and would protect the future population of the city from the whims of today's politicians. The city must be run in a businesslike fashion to stop the budget crises that reappear every 10 years.

HEADLINE: We Need a Single-Payer Health-Care System

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You are mistaken in your July 22 editorial endorsing Alain Enthoven's "managed competition" plan as the fix for our broken health care system. Mr. Enthoven's plan would force all but the wealthy into an insurance company-run health maintenance organization chosen by the employer or government "sponsor." 
 Doctor-patient relations would be repeatedly disrupted as employers and sponsors switched H.M.O.'s in search of the cheapest rates. Insurers owning the H.M.O's would still selectively market to the healthy and shun the sick, despite safeguards you suggest. "Cream skimming" -- through gimmicks like offering free exercise club memberships to attract healthy subscribers or by not putting facilities near neighborhoods with high rates of expensive diseases like acquired immune deficiency syndrome -- would remain an easier way to prosper than improving efficiency.
While "managed competition" would perpetuate discrimination and maximize disruption, it probably would not slow health care inflation. According to the General Accounting Office, a Canadian-style national health program would save $67 billion on bureaucracy in the first year alone and hold down increases through enforceable budgetary limits.
Such administrative streamlining is characteristic of single-payer systems, whether Canadian or Swedish, where government pays virtually all health care bills. This eliminates the enormous overhead of insurance companies (15 percent of premiums in the United States, against 1 percent in Canada and 2 percent in Sweden) and relieves doctors and hospitals of most billing-related paperwork.
In contrast, Mr. Enthoven's plan would leave all the health bureaucracy and add another layer -- the government agencies that would buy group coverage from private insurers. No country has maintained a multiple-payer structure, as Mr. Enthoven envisions, while achieving single-payer efficiency. The H.M.O's Mr. Enthoven praises took 19 percent of total premiums for their administrative overhead in Medicare's managed-care demonstration project, an even higher level of inefficiency than traditional indemnity insurance plans. Moreover, the inflation rate in managed-care plans has been no less than for traditional indemnity plans.
A Canadian-style single-payer plan would contain costs, cover all the uninsured and improve coverage for most other Americans, while guaranteeing patients a free choice of doctors. Contrary to your assertions, Canada has pulled its weight (per capita) in medical research and surpasses us in efforts to weed out incompetent physicians. Modest waits for a few high-technology services are not caused by the Canadian payment system, but by Canada's lower expenditures for care -- almost $1,000 lower per capita than in the United States.
The G.A.O. concluded that our levels of spending with the Canadian system's efficiency would assure us of high-technology care, universal coverage and an end to the cost spiral. In short, the best health care in the world at an affordable price.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Coca Dreams, Cocaine Reality

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IT is no surprise that Washington is sending the Green Berets to Peru: As Willie Sutton might have said, that is where the coca is.
What ought to surprise, say economists who study illegal markets, is the drug busters' faith that harassment of Peruvian coca farmers will affect the supply of cocaine in Miami or Modesto. At best, argues Peter Reuter of the Rand Corporation, intervention will push coca cultivation into other parts of the Andes. At worst, it will further enrich the Shining Path guerillas, who sell protection services to the coca farmers. 
 According to the State Department, some 70 percent of the world's coca is grown in Peru. The crop is currently worth some $500 million annually -- enough, says Melanie Tammen, a researcher at the Cato Insitute in Washington, to support one million people in the country's upland valleys.
While small amounts of cocaine are made and used in Peru -- it takes 500 pounds of the raw material to yield one pound of the finished product -- the bulk is concentrated as paste and sent to Colombia for manufacture and shipment to market.
Washington has been supporting Peru's coca eradication since 1980, but to little apparent effect: the total acreage in coca production grew over the decade. The Bush Administration is now turning up the heat, conditioning further aid to the Government of Alberto Fujimoro on the acceptance of American military trainers for the war on cocaine.
Drug experts scoff at their prospects. "There is no good argument for squeezing coca farmers," Mr. Reuter says flatly.
Increasing the risks of growing coca might raise the price needed to induce farmers to grow it, he explains. But at the mid-1990 price of about $350 for 500 pounds, the cost of Peruvian leaf represents a trivial percentage of the $45,000-a-pound street price of pure cocaine in America's cities. Thus raising the price of the leaf by any plausible amount would not make much difference in the total cost, most of which represents payment for risks in transporting and selling the drug.
If one could eradicate coca, there could not be any cocaine to sniff or smoke. But according to Paul Boeker, the president of the Institute of the Americas at the San Diego campus of the University of California, the land in the Andes suitable to grow this hardy plant is virtually unlimited. "Nibbling around the edges of the leaf market," he said, "is terribly inefficient."
Indeed, Mr. Boeker notes, aggressive eradication efforts in Bolivia have backfired. Rather than discouraging farmers, they have functioned like American farm support programs that stabilize prices by keeping marginal land out of use.
The unintended effects of burning coca fields could prove more grave in Peru, which is engaged in a bloody civil war. Pitting the Peruvian and American military against peasants who grow coca to survive could increase support for the Maoist Shining Path guerrillas. And as Mr. Reuter points out, "it raises the demand for protective services from the guerrillas," increasing the guerrilla take from what is reportedly already their primary source of income.
If attacking cocaine at its roots cannot work, what might? The Rand Corporation's research on drug smuggling convinced most people who were paying attention that interdiction at the United States border is an exercise in futility. But Mr. Boeker thinks the cocaine trade is vulnerable at intermediate points in the production and transport chain. As evidence he cites the simultaneous collapse in demand for coca leaf and the run-up in United States street prices after the Colombian Government smashed the Medellin cartel.
Mr. Reuter offers a less optimistic interpretation of the same events. The destruction of the Medellin traffic, he speculates, gave the traffickers in the Colombian city of Cali a temporary monopoly on the cocaine trade.
By this interpetation, the Cali cartel was able to raise cocaine profits by reducing production and exports. United States street prices have since fallen and coca leaf prices have recovered -- facts consistent with the idea that the Cali mob first gained and then lost a hammerlock on the trade.
The trouble with Mr. Reuter's analysis is that it does not provide much hope for a supply-side fix to the cocaine problem. That could explain why Washington, charged with making cocaine disappear, tends to go deaf and dumb whenever confronted with the illogic of calling in the Army.
But the doleful prospects of the Peruvian initiative do not bother Ms. Tammen at the libertarian Cato Institute. "Only an end to drug prohibition in the United States," she concludes, "can make substitute crops viable in Peru and unravel the web of drug-related terror in both nations."

Can Skim Milk Taste Like Whole Milk?

 BODY:
All that the scientists at the Electric Power Research Institute were trying to do was find a way to conserve power in the dairy industry. But, inadvertently, they may have developed a process that makes skim milk taste like whole milk.
Instead of heating milk to drive off water to produce concentrate or powder, as is usually done, institute researchers and representatives of the Dairy Research Foundation chilled it. Some of the water formed ice crystals, which were filtered out. The resulting concentrate was reconstituted by adding water. 
 The researchers were surprised to find that the resulting skim milk tasted better than normal skim milk. "We put the water back in, and it tasted like whole milk," said Robert D. Jeffress, a program manager at the Palo Alto, Calif., institute, which is supported by electric utilities.
"We are not sure why that is, but we have blindfolded taste tests that say so," he added. The difference could be that the milk proteins are preserved when frozen, but partly broken down when heated, changing the taste, he said.
Other advantages of freeze-concentrated milk include less volume, so it is cheaper to ship, and a longer shelf life in stores or home freezers. To test the economics of the process, the institute is backing a commercial-scale operation for removing 700 pounds of water an hour at the Galloway West Company in Fond du Lac, Wis., starting in the fall.
According to officials of the institute, freezing is a more energy-efficient means of concentrating milk and other dairy products than heat evaporation. The most common type of evaporator takes 118 kilowatt- hours to remove one metric ton, or 2,204 pounds, of water, compared with 65 kilowatt-hours for freezing. A typical dairy could save $100,000 a year in power costs by switching methods, they said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends the Day Mixed In Continued Light Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed against major currencies yesterday in another day of quiet trading as the market waited to see if German interest rates are headed up or down.
Gold prices were lower. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted an after-hours bid for gold at $356.50 an ounce, down 95 cents from late Monday. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $1.20 an ounce, to a late bid of $356.30. 
 The dollar was helped early when the Commerce Department announced a five-tenths of a percent rise in retail sales in July, said Lorenzo Troni, vice president of foreign exchange with Paine Webber International Ltd. in New York.
The dollar often moves in the same direction as interest rates, and the retail sales report gave little indication that the Federal Reserve would nudge rates downward to spur the economy.
But trading was very light, Mr. Troni said.
"We're paralyzed awaiting the big news Thursday," he said. The Bundesbank's council is expected to review German interest rates at its meeting tomorrow.
Rumors circulated early yesterday that the Bundesbank would not raise rates, but the talk spurred little market activity, said Mike Ballow, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
"The dollar is basically consolidating right now," Mr. Ballow said.
In New York, the British pound finished at $1.6930, down from $1.6980 Monday. Earlier in London, the pound fell to $1.6938, from $1.6975 late Monday.
In Tokyo, the dollar was unchanged from Monday at 136.40 yen. Later, in London, it closed at 136.50 yen, and in New York, the dollar was quoted at 136.45 yen, down from 136.55 yen Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Monday, included: 1.7325 German marks, up from 1.7245; 1.5145 Swiss francs, up from 1.5120; 5.8960 French francs, up from 5.8670; 1,300 Italian lire, up from 1,293, and 1.1462 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1463.
In gold trading earlier in London, the metal fell to a late bid price of $357.00 an ounce, from $358.25 bid late Monday, and to $356.80 an ounce in Zurich, from $358.25 late Monday.
In Hong Kong, gold fell 77 cents to close at a bid $358.26.
Silver for August delivery fell 2.8 cents an ounce, to $3.925, on New York's Comex. Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $3.95 an ounce, from $3.98 bid late Monday.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Rose 0.5% in July

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Consumers continued a cautious pickup in spending in July, pushing retail sales up five-tenths of 1 percent, the Government said today. It was the first three-month string of increases in nearly a year.
But analysts, noting that the spending was far from robust, said the figures supported the view that the recovery would be much weaker than the average since World War II. The report also failed to dispel concerns about whether the economy could avoid a "double dip" recession, turning down after a period of growth. 
 "The bottom line is that there is a bit of a pickup, but some real question about whether it is sustainable," said David Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York Government-securities dealer.
 
Need for Jobs
 Sandra Shaber, an economist at the Futures Group in Washington, suggested that the spending pace could be maintained "only if we have improvements in the job market and in earnings. Judging by recent trends, that hasn't happened yet."
On the sales report, bond prices fell initially on the belief that interest rates would stay high, but then recovered later. [Page D13.] The figures helped lift stock prices, with the Dow gaining 7.38, to 3,008.72, in heavy trading. [Page D6.]
The Commerce Department said the July sales totaled a seasonally adjusted $153.7 billion, up from $152.9 billion in June. It also revised its initial estimate for June to a one-tenth of 1 percent gain from a two-tenths of 1 percent decline.
 
Strong Upward Revisions
 Even May's revised 1.2 percent increase was stronger than the 1 percent first estimated. It was the first time sales had risen for three consecutive months since July through September 1990.
Most analysts say the economy resumed growing in the second quarter. But they caution that any recovery will quickly falter without consumer participation. Retail sales account for half of overall consumer spending, which itself represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
Laurence H. Meyer, head of a St. Louis economic forecasting company, said that while the report "suggests that consumer spending has a fair amount of momentum going into the third quarter, it doesn't alter very much our views that over all the recovery is still struggling."
Still, Mr. Meyer said, the July report with its revisions "gives us some confidence we can avoid slipping back into recession."
Automobile sales, which represent about one-fifth of retail purchases, jumped 1.1 percent in July following gains of nine-tenths of 1 percent in June and five-tenths of 1 percent in May. It was the first three-month string of advances in this recession-battered sector since June through August 1989.
"Deep discounts and incentives in automobile sales are driving recent improvements in retail sales," said Richard W. Rahn, an economist with the United States Chamber of Commerce. He also questioned whether the pace could be maintained.
Excluding the auto category, sales were up three-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Gain in Durables
 Sales of durable goods -- expected to last more than three months -- increased seven-tenths of 1 percent following a three-tenths of 1 percent gain a month earlier.
Customers increased purchases of furniture and other home furnishings by 1.9 percent, erasing an eight-tenths of 1 percent drop in June. But they continued to avoid building-material outlets, where sales fell eight-tenths of 1 percent after declining three-tenths of 1 percent a month earlier.
Sales of nondurable goods like food and fuel advanced four-tenths of 1 percent, after a one-tenth of 1 percent gain a month earlier.
Department-store sales jumped 2.8 percent, wiping out a 2 percent decline in June. Apparel sales inched up one-tenth of 1 percent after a six-tenths of 1 percent drop a month earlier. Drugstore sales posted a seven-tenths of 1 percent gain after a 1.1 percent increase the previous month.
Sales at restaurants and bars held steady after posting a 1.1 percent gain a month earlier. But grocery- store sales were off three-tenths of 1 percent after increasing six-tenths of 1 percent in June.

HEADLINE: Short-Term Rates Off Again; Further Drop Is Expected

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
The recent decline in yields on short-term securities, both money market funds and certificates of deposit, gained momentum in the last week, and rates will likely drop even lower, said Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor, an interest rate publication based in North Palm Beach, Fla.
Commenting on what he called the very strong decline in the seven days that ended yesterday, Mr. Heady said: "The bottom of the down cycle is not yet in sight. The latest decline in savings yields follows last week's easing of the Federal funds rate and Monday's drops in Treasury bill rates." 
 He noted that a bit of history will be set by the lower yields on money market accounts effective tomorrow, in that for the first time in eight years and eight months the average money market account yield for New York commercial banks fell below the 5 percent level, to a 4.98 percent yield. It was that many years ago, in December 1982, that Congress first authorized the bank money market accounts. On average, the banks in the last seven days cut their money market account yields by 9 basis points, to the 4.98 percent level.
Among the major banks in the New York area, the largest change in the return on money market accounts was reported by three banks, where yields all fell 21 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. The banks were the Bank of New York, the European American Bank and the Republic National Bank of New York.
Both European American and Marine Midland reported that their yields on three-month certificates of deposit declined 21 basis points, the biggest drop among the New York banks. In six-month certificates, European American reported the biggest decline, with a drop of 26 basis points. Mr. Heady called all of these "pretty sharp declines."
New York commercial banks on average reduced their yields by 11 basis points on the six- and the three-month certifcates, to 5.42 percent and to 5.23 percent, respectively.
At savings institutions, the yields were down 4 basis points on average on both the six- and three-month certificates, to 5.94 percent and 5.66 percent, respectively, while the money market average yield was off 2 basis points, to 5.50 percent.

GRAPHIC: Table: "Bank Money Accounts"
 
Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Aug.14 1991. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

Treasury Bond Prices Advance

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Bond prices advanced again and long-term interest rates fell in active trading yesterday, staging a turnaround from morning trading when prices fell after a Government report suggested that consumer spending in the third quarter might be picking up.
The retail sales report, which showed that sales rose by five-tenths of a percent in July, was slightly better than most analysts had expected. 
 Dealers initially interpreted the figures as suggesting the economy may in fact be recovering at a more vigorous clip than most Wall Street economists currently maintain, and sold securities. But big institutions were rumored to have bought after prices dipped, and the decline was reversed.
"It's been a busy day," one government bond trader said. "A lot of securities have been trading, and I think some of the bonds that were auctioned last week have moved off of dealers' books."
 
Gain in Retail Sales
 The retail sales gain was the third monthly gain in a row, the first time in nearly a year that has happened. Nevertheless, analysts said underlying employment and income trends offered scant evidence to support the view that consumers are in a position to provide much stimulus to the economy.
"The numbers were a tad stronger than expected, but I think consumers are struggling to get ahead at this point," said Joseph Carson, chief economist at Chemical Bank. "The lack of income growth makes it difficult to increase spending. And Corporate America is not making any money, which is being reflected in more layoffs."
Mr. Carson said he expected consumer spending to remain weak for the remainder of the year, but he added that the decline in interest rates should help set the stage for a rebound in early 1992.
The drop in interest rates "will allow consumers to reliquify their balance sheets," he said. "Hopefully, that will be enough to get us growing next year."
 
Yield Declines to 8.16%
 In the market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent bonds of August 2021 that were auctioned last week were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 8.16 percent, down from 8.20 percent late Monday.
Among Treasury note issues, the new 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered in when-issued trading at a price to yield 7.90 percent, compared with 7.93 percent late Monday.
In the secondary Treasury note market, the 7 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at a price of 101 25/32, up 5/32, to yield 7.43 percent. And the 6 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 25/32, up 1/32, to yield 6.44 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates, which have fallen sharply recently, were little changed yesterday.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.28 percent in late trading, unchanged on the day. And six-month bill rates rose by one basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point, to a late offered rate of 5.38 percent.
 
New-Issue Activity Up
 New-issue activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market remained heavy.
The Grand Metropolitan Investment Corporation, a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan P.L.C., the giant British-based food company, offered $900 million worth of securities through an underwriting group led by Morgan Stanley & Company.
The securities, all guaranteed by Grand Met, were offered in maturities of 5 years, 10 years and 20 years.
The $300 million worth of 8 1/8 percent five-year notes were priced at $99.94 to yield 8.14 percent, 70 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
The 8 5/8 percent 10-year notes were priced at $99.70, to yield 8.67 percent, 76 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The final $300 million of 9 percent 20-year debentures were priced at $99.174, to yield 9.09 percent, 92 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds at the time of pricing.
All three maturities are rated A-2 by Moody's and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. All are noncallable for life.
 
Imperial Oil Bonds
 J. P. Morgan Securities acted as lead manager on an offering of $200 million worth of 10-year notes for the Imperial Oil Company.
The 8.30 percent notes, which mature Aug. 20, 2001, were priced at $99.80 to yield 8.33 percent, 41 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The issue is rated AA-1 by Moody's and AAA by Standard & Poor's.
Goldman, Sachs & Company acted as lead manager for an offering of $100 million worth of 15-year notes for the Eaton Corporation.
The 8.90 percent notes, which mature Aug. 15, 2006, are noncallable for life. They were priced at $99.625, to yield 8.946 percent, a percentage point over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-2 by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate securities, traders said prices of most issues rose by about 1/8 point in active trading.

HEADLINE: EXPERTS WORRIED BY KUWAIT FIRES

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Aug. 13

 BODY:
Nearly six months after the Iraqis blew up hundreds of Kuwaiti oil wells, about 40 percent of the wells have been capped but the short- and long-term health effects still look grim.
At an international conference here on the Kuwaiti oil fires arranged by Harvard's School of Public Health and Center for Middle Eastern Studies, Prof. Richard Wilson, a Harvard physicist and specialist in risk analysis, estimated that 50,000 people in the Kuwait region "will have their lives shortened in some way" in the next several years because of the smoke. 
 The estimate, covering an area from Basra, Iraq, to Bahrain, assumes that there is no safe threshhold dose for pollutants that are known to be poisonous in high doses, like sulfur dioxide and small particles of soot.
 
Comparison to London Fogs
 But another speaker, George D. Thurston, of the New York University Institute of Environmental Medicine, said a preliminary analysis of average concentrations of pollutants indicated that their could be 1,000 extra deaths in Kuwait if the fires took a year to put out, a schedule that he noted was optimistic. He based his data on analysis of severe London fogs of 1952 and 1962; some of the components of the pollution in London, including soot and acid, are present in Kuwait.
Others were less willing to attach numbers to their health estimates, but many expressed frustration with gaps in knowledge about what is being emitted and how much most people are exposed to, in a situation with wide variability in air quality from place to place and time to time.
A French team and a Japanese team compared air quality in Kuwait with 24-hour average values in, respectively, Paris and Tokyo, and found that Kuwait was no worse. But the Kuwait average hides tremendous variations over periods of a few minutes, the researchers found. Short-lived high concentrations of sulfur dioxide can trigger asthma attacks in people who are susceptible, medical experts say, and the Middle East has a higher incidence of asthma than most of the world.
 
Impact of Short Doses
 But the significance of short, severe doses of other forms of pollution is not so clear. One question concerns the effects of chemicals called polyaromatic hydrocarbons, which are known to cause cancer over extended periods and appear in Kuwait at far higher-than-normal levels.
Much of the analysis contrasted with the early verdict of the Environmental Protection Agency, which said that there were no acute hazards. But James E. Makris, who lead the first E.P.A. mission to Kuwait City right after the war, said that his agency's assessment had been borne out. Early fears that wells would emit hydrogen sulfide gas or heavy metals, which can kill large numbers of people promptly, were unfounded, he said.
The conference was held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and was jointly sponsored by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development and the United Nations Development Program, with participation by the World Health Organization and other international agencies.
 
A Shift in Winds
 In Kuwait itself the short-term outlook is worrisome. Natural weather patterns seem likely to make the living conditions in Kuwait City worse in coming months. The "shemal" winds, part of a counter-clockwise movement across southern Asia and the Indian ocean, had been blowing from the northwest in recent months, bringing clean air to Kuwait City and carrying the smoke from the biggest oilfield over the Persian Gulf or uninhabited desert. Now, however, the wind has died down, allowing smoke to collect.
Kuwait is still struggling to establish a system to predict particularly bad days and warn residents to stay inside. Health officials now hope to have such a system in place by October.
Progress on extinguishing the fires is slow. According to Dr. Faisal Al-Jassem, of the Kuwait Petroleum Company, between 740 and 750 wells were blown up, and as of Monday, 291 of those had been capped. Huge crusts of coke, a product of partial burning, have built up at some wells, and must be chipped away to expose the wellhead. Firefighters have recently called in tanks to shell the crusted wells.

Kansas City Fed Bank Names New President

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City yesterday named a career officer, Thomas M. Hoenig, as the bank's new president, succeeding Roger Guffey, who is retiring.
The 44-year-old Mr. Hoenig, who will take office on Oct. 1, has been with the bank since 1973, always in bank supervision and currently as senior vice president of the Bank Supervision and Structure division. As president of one of the Federal Reserve's 12 regional banks, he will become one of the Fed's policy makers, a group that has the power to change the nation's short-term interest rates. 
 Mr. Hoenig has not spoken publicly on monetary policy. Mr. Guffey, who has served since 1976 as the Kansas City Fed's seventh chief executive, has had the reputation of being more concerned about inflationary pressures than some of the Fed's other policy makers. Besides the 12 regional bank presidents, the Fed's seven governors, headed by Alan Greenspan as chairman, sit on the policy-making body known as the Federal Open Market Committee.
Mr. Greenspan and the governors always sit as voting members of the committee, which meets in Washington every six weeks. The presidents rotate as voting members, with five having votes at a given time. Mr. Hoenig will become a voting member next Jan. 1, three months after he takes office.
Mr. Hoenig, born in Fort Madison, Iowa, joined the Kansas City Fed as an economist in the supervision division, having earned M.A. and Ph.d. degrees at Iowa State University. He was named a vice president in the supervision division in 1981 and senior vice president in 1986.
The bank's board of directors appointed him to his new job as president, with the board of governors in Washington confirming the appointment.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City has jurisdiction over an eight-state district containing more than 3,000 banks and savings and loan associations eligible for Fed services. Besides Kansas, the district includes Colorado, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Wyoming and parts of Missouri and New Mexico.

In a scaled-down version of the broad recommendations made last year by his Commission on the Adirondacks, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is to propose measures to restrict development along many Adirondack lakes and preserve large tracts of back-country forest.
While less encompassing than called for by the commission that he had appointed, the Governor's package is still the most significant package of legislation affecting the Adirondacks in two decades, and it foreshadows what will likely be an intense legislative struggle next year during the centennial of Adirondack Park. 
 Mr. Cuomo's proposal, for instance, would reduce the number of houses that could be built along many Adirondack lake shorelines, while the commission plan would have prohibited shoreline construction on some lakes altogether.
And the Governor's package is expected to focus on tax breaks and other incentives to keep privately held plots of land out of development, while shying away from the costlier alternative of large-scale state purchases of land or the more stringent approach of prohibiting new construction.
No firm cost estimate was ever attached to the Cuomo commission's recommendations -- some officials said they would have cost a few hundred million dollars while others said all the land it urged the state to buy could cost $1 billion.
In any event, by focusing on tax breaks, the Governor's measure would be considerably less expensive, but also far-reaching. Mr. Cuomo is expected to issue a renewed call for passage of a dedicated state fund for environmental projects, which the Legislature resisted this year.
The Governor's plan also provides measures to insure greater representation of local Adirondack governments on the Adirondack Park Agency, the state agency that must approve any development project within the park.
Mr. Cuomo's plan will be formally unveiled in the next few weeks, and state lawmakers are not expected to consider it until next year's legislative session.
But several people familiar with his proposals said they focused on some of the most critical problems identified by the commission without adopting some of the strongest measures it advocated. The commission report, while supported by many environmental groups and park residents as a visionary document, was interpreted in some Adirondack communities as an economic death knell.
It has remained unaddressed in the last year and a half.
The panel, warning of a "last clear chance" to protect the wilderness character of the Adirondacks, called for massive state purchases of land and some of the most restrictive zoning measures affecting privately held land in the eastern United States.
The Governor has repeatedly pledged to offer legislation to aid both the park's spectacular natural heritage and its battered economic base. The Adirondacks, a patchwork of public and private land, represents the largest wilderness area east of the Mississippi. It is also home to some of the poorest communities in the state.
Mr. Cuomo appointed the commission in January 1989, warning of dangers of "unbridled land speculation" in the Adirondacks amid intense publicity about sales to developers of several large long-forested tracts.
 
Applications to Build
 Largely because of the recession, many of the more dire predictions have not yet materialized and some planned developments have been put on hold, although the Adirondack Park Agency has reported record numbers of applications for construction permits in recent years.
And while critics of the commission have cited the slowed pace of activity as proof that the commission's recommendations were excessive, many environmental groups have argued that a rebound in the economy could bring a burst of development in the park and that now is the time to head it off.
Many of these groups have also called on the state to buy up available land now, while prices are in decline. But with last fall's defeat of the $1.9 billion environmental bond act and the state's fiscal turmoil, Governor Cuomo has repeatedly stated that New York has no money to buy land anytime soon.
Late last month, Mr. Cuomo said confusion over the recommendations of the Adirondack commission, which was headed by Peter A. A. Berle, the National Audubon Society president, had caused the defeat of the bond act because many upstate residents feared that the state wanted to buy up too much land.
 
Berle Commission
 "The Berle Commission -- that killed it," Mr. Cuomo told a Plattsburgh newspaper. "I would not have chosen that concatenation of the bond issue and the Adirondack Commission. It was too confusing. This is my problem, my responsibility. It was my commission; it was my mistake."
Mr. Berle was traveling in the Soviet Union today and was unreachable, his office said.
Since the commission report was issued, the Governor has been under pressure from all sides on the Adirondack issue. Preservation groups have urged him to embrace the report in full, while many local government and business leaders have castigated it as big-brotherism and urged the Governor to leave them alone to regulate park affairs.
 
'Visionary Document'
 The interest in the issue has remained ardent: By one Adirondack resident's count earlier this year, no less than 14 groups have been formed in the last few years purporting to represent the true views of Adirondackers.
The Governor's chief adviser on environmental affairs, Francis Murray, declined to discuss specifics of the legislation. But he said the Governor wanted to issue it soon so that there would be plenty of time for public discussion of the proposals before the Legislature acts.
Mr. Murray described the committee's report as "a visionary document," but added, "I don't think that the people on the commission believed that all of their vision would be realized within the next few years."
The last major actions concerning the Adirondacks were taken by the Legislature in the early 1970's, under pressure from Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller. That is when of many of the current zoning laws -- which the commission described as insufficient to preserve much of the park's shoreline and back country -- were put in place.

British Air Cuts U.S. Fares To London and Rivals Join In

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
British Airways has introduced discounts of up to 15 percent on its flights between the United States and London this fall, and three carriers -- American, Continental and United -- have quickly matched them. Other carriers competing on the trans-Atlantic routes are expected to follow.
Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines said yesterday that they were studying the British Airways specials. "Everybody will match," said Edmund Greenslet, publisher of The Airline Monitor, a trade journal. 
 But analysts said the cuts on the London routes did not necessarily indicate that discounts on other routes to Europe were in the offing. On the other hand, autumn "is the time of year when you get more incentive pricing," Mr. Greenslet said.
 
Discounts on Hotels, Too
 In addition to the 15 percent discount on air fares, British Airways is offering savings of up to 35 percent on hotels and other travel costs. The specials apply to round trips to London that depart between Oct. 15 and Dec. 13 and return by Jan. 4, 1992.
The airline flies to London from 17 cities, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Its new round-trip New York-London fare, for example, will be $428 on weekdays.
British Airways, which saw its business drop between 20 percent and 30 percent in the first quarter because of the war in the Persian Gulf and the recession, customarily offers specials in the fall, when leisure travel slows.
But this year, the advance notice offered to fliers and the depth of the discounts are greater, said John Lampl, a spokesman for the airline. "They're a stimulator to get people traveling again," he added. The airline's market share on the United States-Britain routes is 39 percent.
 
International Travel Flat
 Industry data show that international travel was largely flat in May and June. Robert Decker, an airline analyst at Duff & Phelps/MCM, said he expected that newer data would show the pattern continuing through the summer.
"International travel seems to be coming back at a fairly steady pace," Mr. Decker said.
With increased competition on the routes to Britain, carriers are marketing London heavily as a tourist destination. The exposure, combined with the discounts, should encourage more vacationers to sign up for the specials, said Steven E. Heydt, senior vice president of Liberty Travel.

HEADLINE: Brown's Gospel: Community Policing

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

 BODY:
At 6-foot-3, in a dark suit and tie, Lee P. Brown was an imposing figure as he stood between murals of Jesus in the garden and Jesus weeping over Jerusalem. In the humid Harlem church, his sweating listeners hung on his words. He told them that their ministry was to be good parents. Teach moral discipline and spiritual idealism to their children, he said, and then go out and improve the community and city.
The message, sprinkled with biblical allusions and lines from spirituals, could have been delivered by a minister. Indeed, Mr. Brown confided, he once had given serious thought to becoming one. "But," he said with a wry smile, "you can see from my current position the Lord had other plans for me." 
 The other plans he spoke of included trying to make the city a safer place. "Even though I did not go into the ministry, I am reminded every day in the position I now occupy that you don't have to be a minister to be part of God's program," Mr. Brown said on a recent Sunday at the annual Men's Day ceremony of the Childs Memorial Temple Church of God in Christ, at Amsterdam Avenue and 147th Street.
Such talk is not what one expects from the Commissioner of an urban police department of about 27,400 uniformed members and 7,400 civilians, but it helps set Mr. Brown apart from other police leaders, especially as he goes around the city speaking to citizens and to police officers about his vision of modern-day policing.
 
More Officers on Foot Patrol
 In the year and a half since he came to New York from Houston, where he was the Chief of Police for eight years, Mr. Brown has spoken at hundreds of gatherings, many of them at churches. At each one, he has preached the gospel of community policing.
Thousands of new officers are to be added to foot-patrol duty so that when the department is fully staffed in 1994, Mr. Brown foresees each officer becoming familiar with a group of streets. With the help of residents, they are to try to solve recurring crime problems rather than just respond to crimes after they occur.
The reaction from the public has generally been enthusiastic. The reaction from the police has been more guarded, with the more cynical officers seeing his plans as unrealistic in light of the complexity of the city and the intricacies of the police bureaucracy.
"There is a lot of preacherman in him, no doubt about that," said Thomas A. Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, a watchdog organization that monitors developments in crime and criminal justice.
Other commissioners have set a moralistic tone, Mr. Reppetto said, like Patrick V. Murphy, who took over during the Knapp Commission's investigation into police corruption in 1970. But he added, Mr. Brown "is something unusual."
 
'Something Unusual'
 The 53-year-old Mr. Brown, who grew up in a religious family in the African Methodist Episcopal Church tradition in Fowler, Calif., has said he most admires Jesus Christ, Mohandas Gandhi and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
And while Mr. Brown never chose the ministry, the eldest of his four children, Patrick, 31, did, and is a minister in Chicago.
Mr. Brown is a native Oklahoman whose family migrated to California, where his father was an agricultural worker and his mother a cook. He holds a master's and doctorate in criminology from the University of California at Berkeley and a master's in sociology from San Jose State University.
He got into criminology by chance. He won a football scholarship to Fresno State University, where he planned to major in physical education and become a football coach. But a friend who gave him a ride to registration chose to major in criminology and because "phys ed" was not available that day and Mr. Brown needed a ride home, he made the same choice.
In the 35 years since, Mr. Brown has held jobs ranging from foot patrolman to Public Safety Commissioner of Atlanta and has developed his theories of community policing. While some may view the concept as simply "putting the cop back on the beat," to Mr. Brown it is a philosophy, an ideal form of cooperative effort between the community and the police officer in preventing crime rather than just responding to it. And for Mr. Brown philosophy must be rooted in a value system.
At a promotion ceremony at Police Headquarters in lower Manhattan last month, he explained why officers needed such values.
"One of the great demands for any member of the Police Department is to be able to adhere to values in the face of the collapse of values all around us," he said. "To be a police officer in urban America today is to bear witness to that collapse. We witness it in the utter disregard for human life that begins at so early an age."
Mr. Brown created a set of values, the first to be committed to writing in the New York department's history. It reads: "In partnership with the community, we pledge to: protect the lives and property of fellow citizens and impartially enforce the law; fight crime both by preventing it and by aggressively pursuing violators of the law; maintain a higher standard of integrity than is generally expected of others because so much more is expected of us; and value human life, respect the dignity of each individual and render our services with courtesy and civility."
After reading the code at Childs Memorial Temple, he said, "As you can see, the values of the Police Department are not all that different than the values we learn about in church."
At the promotion ceremony, he said it was easy to pay lip service to such values.
 
Values to Live By
 "But it is quite another to live by them when as police officers you confront just the opposite every day," he said. "So why should the police be different? Because we know the difference between right and wrong. Because we know the difference between decency and indecency. Let me ask it another way: If we don't stand by values, who will? If we don't set an example, who will?
"Most people who live in the worst areas of this city are good people trapped there by their economic plight. On streets where the dealer or the mugger would rule, the cop may be the only powerful symbol of decency left."
The values have been sent to precincts and been incorporated in the training program at the Police Academy. Seminars dealing with their meaning will be held for every officer, he said.
In an interview, Mr. Brown said: "I have a role to determine the culture of this organization. That's the role of a leader in any organization."
 
Molding a Culture
 He added, "I happen to believe that values are a key element in terms of helping to mold that culture. If you don't know what you stand for, then you can't provide the guidance to the organization to go in the direction that you want to go."
Bishop Norman N. Quick, pastor of Childs Memorial, said he was pleased with Mr. Brown's approach. "Police officers are given by statute a lot of force and a great deal of authority," he said, "and I think it's very important that they have and hold it in proper perspective."
Acknowledging that Mr. Brown's view of the police and the community working together might be criticized as idealistic, Bishop Quick said: "We need that. Our people need to be inspired by idealism."
In other places, the reaction has been much the same.
Dr. Arthur Caliandro, senior minister of the Marble Collegiate Church, said he had known Mr. Brown's predecessor as Commissioner, Benjamin Ward, a tough administrator, and liked him. "But there's a different approach with Lee Brown," he said. "I didn't sense any hardness. It's easy in our city to get hard and cynical. I sensed a tremendous patience with humanity."
But police officers have reacted with more skepticism.
An officer in Brooklyn said: "I think he has a good heart and he means well, but I think he's a little naive to the needs of the city. He's got an unrealistic view. It may have worked in Texas, but it won't work in New York because there are just so many people here."
 
Too Idealistic?
 A veteran narcotics officer in Manhattan said most police officers did not object to the code of values.
"I think most cops become police officers because they want to do some good," he said. "Nobody objects to Brown's ideas of what the department should be. Where the problem comes is a lot of guys think it's very idealistic and not realistic."
Robert Harris, president of the senior choir at the Williams Institutional Christian Methodist Episcopal Church in Harlem, where Mr. Brown also has spoken, is a retired Bronx homicide detective.
He said that while many police officers would resist change, others were hungry for a value system. "Believe it or not, a lot of police on the street are religious," he said. "To walk the street you have to believe in a supreme being or you end up alcoholic, divorced or both or worse."
He agreed with Mr. Brown's philosophy of policing and felt others should give it a chance.
Mr. Harris had another thought. "You know, a lot of police executives retire and go on to work as executives in security firms," he said. "When he leaves the department, I predict he's going to become a minister, mark my words. That's going to be his second career."

HEADLINE: Clifford Resigning as Chairman Of Bank That Had Secret Links

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Clark M. Clifford, a towering figure at the intersection of law and politics in the capital for nearly half a century, resigned today as the chairman of Washington's largest bank holding company, apparently under pressure from Federal regulators and the board of the bank he led for nine years.
Federal regulators and investigators have said that First American Bankshares Inc. was secretly controlled by the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, a loosely regulated international banking concern that was seized last month after auditors reported that the bank had a complex past that included bribery, money laundering and bank fraud. 
 Mr. Clifford's law partner and protege, Robert A. Altman, who was president of the First American Corporation, also resigned today. The corporation was one of several holding companies that form the First American group's intricate structure.
 
Temporary Chairman Named
 For now, First American said Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, a former United States Attorney General and former general counsel of the International Business Machines Corporation, would serve as First American's chairman.
Banking officials said the Federal Reserve Board and Charles McC. Mathias, the former Republican Senator from Maryland who is on First American's board, helped force the resignations that commenced the latest chapter in the B.C.C.I. saga and precipitated the dizzying decline of Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman from their highly lucrative bank posts.
Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman have consistently insisted that they were unaware that B.C.C.I. held any controlling interest in First American.
The resignations also crystallize how much Mr. Clifford's long relationship with First American and B.C.C.I. had tarnished his once-illustrious reputation in the twilight of his career as a lawyer, lobbyist, adviser to Democratic Presidents and an unchallenged symbol of rectitude in Washington.
Mr. Clifford, who is 84 years old, represented the Arab-owned, Pakistani-run B.C.C.I. when it first tried to acquire American banks in the late 1970's.
The crux of Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman's problems is that law enforce- ors with B.C.C.I. money. If they were aware that B.C.C.I. controlled First American, and lied to regulators about it, they could be charged with fraud.
Neither man has been formally accused of any wrongdoing.
Last month, the Federal Reserve moved to fine B.C.C.I. a record $200 million for "secret arrangements" that allowed the foreign bank to acquire First American but were in violation of agreements with the Fed that barred B.C.C.I. from having any ownership interest in First American. Those commitments were made by Mr. Clifford.
Mr. Mathias, who had taken a leading role in managing the bank earlier this year when the B.C.C.I. connection was first discovered by the Fed, took the leading role in demanding the ouster of Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman, banking officials said.
 
'The Fed Wanted Them Out'
 "The Fed wanted them out," one official said, "and Senator Mathias played the leading role."
Mr. Mathias declined through a spokesman to discuss the specifics of how the resignations came about.
Frank Mankiewicz, the bank's public relations counsel, disputed the assertion that the resignations of Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman had been forced. Rather, he said, they had chosen on their own to resign for the good of the company.
Mr. Katzenbach, the new chairman, is expected to attempt to extricate First American from B.C.C.I. and eventually to sell the bank to new owners. But those tasks will be complicated by the fact that B.C.C.I.'s shares in First American have been seized by foreign bank regulators and are tied up in court proceedings in London and New York.
Mr. Katzenbach said in a statement that the Fed had tentatively endorsed a plan for a trust to be established holding First American shares.
"Constructive ownership of the bank will be in the trust," Mr. Mathias said. He added that the legal issues might take a long time to resolve and that the trust would allow the bank to continue operations until that occurred.
An order freezing B.C.C.I.'s assets in the United States, including the First American holding, was extended last Friday by Federal Bankruptcy Judge James Garrity in New York. It would prevent the movement of any First American shares. But Harvey Miller, a bankruptcy lawyer representing a claim against B.C.C.I., said that if the Fed asked Judge Garrity to revise his order to permit such a transaction, it would likely be granted.
 
Three Inquiries Under Way
 The Fed, the District Attorney in Manhattan and a Federal grand jury here are investigating whether Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman knowingly misled regulators with their repeated assurances over the years that B.C.C.I. would not be involved with First American.
Robert M. Morgenthau Jr., the District Attorney in Manhattan, is investigating because First American has a branch in New York. Law enforcement officials have said that one of his objects is to see whether B.C.C.I. used First American to launder money.
In a statement issued late today, Michael Cherkasky, chief of the investigation division for District Attorney Morgenthau, said, "We have been informed of the resignations, and they will not impact on our ongoing investigation."
The officials said that Mr. Clifford had been interviewed extensively by New York City investigators, though he has not appeared before the New York grand jury. They said Mr. Altman had not yet been interviewed in New York.
 
Indictments in Manhattan
 So far, Mr. Morgenthau's investigation has yielded indictments against B.C.C.I. and two of its top executives for bribery, money laundering and fraud. The bank pleaded guilty in 1990 to money laundering charges in Tampa, Fla., and was fined $15 million.
First American officials said that neither Mr. Clifford nor Mr. Altman had received any special compensation for their resignations.
Over the years, Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman profited handsomely from their B.C.C.I. dealings. At one point, both men borrowed 100 percent of the purchase price of First American stock on highly favorable terms from B.C.C.I.
But the action that raised the issue most profoundly of whether Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman knew of the B.C.C.I. role in First American was a series of stock transactions in 1988 in which the two made a profit of $10 million in less than two years. A secretive subsidiary of B.C.C.I. in the Cayman Islands subsidized a buyer who officials have said was a small-time money-lender who purchased most of the stock at three times the price paid by Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman.
And B.C.C.I. is said to have made a $2.2 million commission on the deal.
 
Audit Earlier This Year
 An audit earlier this year showed that some First American shareholders used money from B.C.C.I. to buy their shares in First American in 1982 and never repaid the loans, making B.C.C.I. the secret owner.
Throughout the year, Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman said they were unaware that B.C.C.I. held a controlling interest in First American. In June 1981, Mr. Clifford, relying on his reputation, assured Federal regulators that B.C.C.I. would have no role in First American, an assertion he repeated several times in the ensuing years.
Mr. Clifford now contends that he was gulled by the founder and former head of B.C.C.I., Aga Hassan Abedi, a Pakistani who is at the center of the unfolding B.C.C.I. story.
But investigators and Federal regulators have said there is much evidence that makes the claim that they were unaware of B.C.C.I.'s involvement less plausible.
 
Dual Role as Lawyers
 Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman, as lawyers, represented both B.C.C.I. and First American. The group of original stockholders in First American who were represented by the two lawyers were assembled by Mr. Abedi.
In his statement of resignation today, Mr. Clifford said that First American "has been operated honestly and without control from B.C.C.I." He added that he and Mr. Altman had resigned because the publicity about B.C.C.I. and First American could have an adverse impact on the bank.
"Mr. Altman and I must insure that this public attention does not adversely affect the company," Mr. Clifford said in a statement.
He also said he was gratified that First American customers had remained loyal throughout the affair.
But despite statements that the bank remains in strong condition, a confidential report from the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates nationally chartered banks, gave the bank a rating of "4" on a scale of 1 to 5, 5 meaning that a bank is about to fail. The bank has struggled recently with bad real estate loans reflecting the recession in the Washington area.
The Comptroller's office said an institution with a "4" rating was one in which "a high potential for failure is present but is not yet imminent or pronounced."
Jack W. Beddow, chief executive of the bank's holding company, said that there had been some impact on the bank as a result of the growing difficulties surrounding its association with B.C.C.I., but that it was "mild" and depositors were overwhelmingly remaining confident in the bank. "There have been phone calls, inquiries and some confusion, but that is all," he said.
Mr. Katzenbach, who now practices law in Morristown, N.J., said he was "honored to have the opportunity to help guide First American into a new chapter in its distinguished history."

HEADLINE: Breaking the Beirut Hostage Impasse: New Mideast Alignments Clear Way

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
A powerful confluence of national interests has contributed to the surprisingly abrupt progress toward freeing the Western hostages held in Lebanon, according to specialists inside and outside the Bush Administration.
In the long regional struggle that has brought hostage-taking to the fore as a widely condemned tactic, each of the major parties has either taken part in or witnessed military, political or economic turmoil that has changed national equations. 
 Years of bleak stalemate in efforts to release the hostages may have given way to a recognition by the disparate powers with influence and bargaining leverage that it is time to resolve the issue finally, thereby removing what has become a signficant barrier to economic progress and political development in the region, the specialists said.
As was demonstrated briefly last week with the abduction of the Frenchman Jerome Leyraud, hostage-taking is not likely to soon disappear from the region. But for Iran, Syria, Israel, Lebanon, the United States and some Western European nations, the time may have arrived for successfully closing out an ugly chapter of confrontation that has obsessed and dominated the region's conscience and haunted American politics.
 
A Self-Propelled Iran
 Trying to answer the question "why now?" Richard Murphy, the former Assistant Secretary of State who supervised United States policy in the Middle East for most of the 1980's, said that while Syria has been maneuvering for several years to win the release of the Western hostages, Iran's post-revolutionary leadership has not been able to make a clear-cut decision to press the pro-Iranian militants in Lebanon to release their captives.
"The Syrians have never wanted to push Iran," Mr. Murphy said, "and Iran wasn't interested for a long time. But now the Syrians don't have to push them, because the Iranians are self-propelled -- not that there still aren't divided councils in Teheran."
"Local politics" in Lebanon among the kidnapping groups is also a factor, an Administration official asserted. "They've held those people for six years and haven't gotten anything for the Islamic revolution," he said. "And hostages are only valuable if they are traded."
The precise change in Iran that helped set off the release of two hostages in the last week remains a mystery, but Mr. Murphy argues that in the multifactioned ruling environment of Teheran, events today probably represent the culmination of forces that have been building for years. And those forces are well known.
 
Culmination of Forces
 After its eight-year war with Iraq ended in 1988, Iran was devastated economically. Its agricultural base has declined as its population has soared. Even before the death in 1989 of the uncompromising revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Teheran was looking to marshal massive resources to rebuild a shattered economy. That could happen only with Western investment and technology.
"I think we are finally seeing it work out," said Mr. Murphy.
Did the final factors include United States relief flights to Iran last spring, when hundreds of thousands ofIraqi Kurds overwhelmed Iranian refugee centers? Mr. Murphy said that might have added to the momentum.
Another factor is that the United States, after a period of mixed signals that included the covert arms-for-hostages trading in the Iran-contra scandal, might have convinced Teheran's leaders that future trade, transfers of technology and financing cannot flow while Terry A. Anderson and his fellow hostages remain chained to radiators in Beirut's basement dungeons.
For Syria, the end of the cold war and the American-led struggle against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq provided an obvious pretext for President Hafez al-Assad to reposition himself as an ally of the West. But what began as a tactical and perhaps transitory realignment by Mr. Assad might be turning into a strategic transformation for the man who came to prominence in the Middle East as the chief rejectionist.
 
Fulfilling Assad's Interests
 "Ever since he came to power, Assad's interests have not been fulfilled by going the peaceful route," said Graham Fuller, a Rand Corporation analyst who served as a senior Middle East specialist in the Reagan Administration. "What Syria got out of being the leader of the hell-no crowd -- oil money, leadership of the Palestinian cause and Soviet arms -- made him a dominant force for 15 years.
"Now for the first time," Mr. Fuller continued, "Syria is benefiting more from peace than from controlled confrontation and to me that is the real revolution in Syrian thinking."
Thus, Syria's interests in Lebanon's hostage problem are far more subtle and vital to Mr. Assad's survival as a regional power.
Since Lebanon was destabilized with the outbreak of civil war in the mid-1970's, Mr. Assad has been engaged in a struggle with Israel for effective control of his western flank, Lebanon. After two major Syrian military incursions into Lebanon and the humiliation of the Israeli invasion in 1982, Syria has forcefully backed a new Government in Beirut and emerged the demonstrable victor; Lebanon's new leadership is and is likely to remain pointedly pro-Syrian.
 
Removing Threats to Israel
 To keep Israel from reasserting a major role in Lebanon through partial occupation and military incursions against guerrilla bases, Mr. Assad must remove the security threats that face his sworn enemy, some analysts argue.
One way to do that would be to win the freedom not only of the Western hostages, but of Israel's captive servicemen held by either pro-Iranian militiamen or Palestinian guerrillas. Once that is done, a Syrian-backed effort to demilitarize southern Lebanon and disarm the still independent militias there would, over time, remove Israel's pretext for continued occupation.
How Syria brings peace to Lebanon also has a direct effect on the Middle East peace process, which has reached the sensitive stage of convening an international peace conference for direct talks between Israel and its Arab enemies.
 
Fine Line for Israelis
 Mr. Assad's performance in bringing security to southern Lebanon will bear directly on any argument he makes that Israel should return to Damascus control over the Golan Heights, seized in 1967.
According to Willaim Quandt, Middle East specialist at the Brookings Institution who served in the Carter White House, Israel will have to walk a fine line in responding to the "good will" and momentum of the hostage releases last week while not giving away its leverage over the kidnappers.
Among its hundreds of Arab prisoners whose freedom is sought by the kidnappers, Israel's main leverage is Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, who Israel accuses of being a spiritual leader of the Party of God in South Lebanon. Israel abducted Sheik Obeid in 1989.
"If they go ahead and release Sheik Obeid and this leads to the release of American hostages, they are going to get some credit in the United States," Mr. Quandt said. "If it doesn't cost them too much, they will seek to get it."

HEADLINE: Future Looks Grim For Theater Center In Los Angeles

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 13

 BODY:
When it opened in a converted Greek Revival bank building six years ago, hopes were high that the Los Angeles Theater Center would form the nucleus of a SoHo-like arts district to revive the seedy Spring Street area downtown. The city pumped more than $27 million into the experimental multi-cultural theater company.
But today the nearby storefronts are mostly vacant, petty drug dealers and homeless men gather in littered doorways and the daring young company teeters on the brink of financial collapse, a stark example of the risks in using the arts as a tool of urban redevelopment. The city has said no more money, and The Los Angeles Times has refused to run the company's advertisements for failure to pay. 
 By most accounts, the theater center, which has produced nearly 100 plays in its short, busy life, has been a considerable artistic success and a boon to the city's vibrant Hispanic, Asian and black theater scene. On Monday night, the cast of "The Phantom of the Opera" gave a special cabaret-type performance, raising $40,000, the center said. Combined with $175,000 raised earlier and an anonymous donation of $100,000 today, the group has $315,000 of the $500,000 needed by the end of the month, the center said today. The $500,000 would allow it to complete a season scaled back to just 7 plays from the 14 it used to produce.
 
'A Major Tragedy'
 But almost all those in the Los Angeles theatrical world agree that the money would provide only a temporary reprieve from the inevitable and that the company cannot survive much longer. Its probable demise has set off deep soul-searching among those in the arts about why the nation's second-largest city, ranking behind only New York City, and seat of the movie industry, cannot support a public theater or create a downtown arts district.
"This is a major tragedy for Los Angeles: its loss will not easily be repaired," said the president of the California Institute of the Arts, Steven D. Lavine, whom Mayor Tom Bradley appointed last year to lead a special study of the theater center.
"No other major American theater has such a diverse audience and diverse casting," Mr. Lavine said. "They pushed the edges of audience taste. Part of the problem is that L.A. has relatively new cultural institutions and less of a history of facing this kind of setback. We are not practiced at organizing ourselves to address an emergency, as New York has had to do often."
Under the leadership of William Bushnell, the 1,215-seat theater complex opened in 1985 and quickly became one of the largest of most productive nonprofit public theaters in the United States, comparable in many ways to Joseph Papp's Public Theater. It supports theater laboratories for Hispanic, black and Asian actors and playwrights. Its provocative, often iconoclastic productions, including "The Illusion" and "August 29," won critical acclaim.
"It was a much needed component of cultural life: it offered a lot of experimentation," said the director of the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, Adolfo V. Nodal, who oversees the theater.
The center's current productions include Reza Abdoh's "Bogeyman," which blasts critics of public financing of the arts, and "Bowl of Beings" a biting satire by Culture Clash, a trio of Hispanic actors signed by Fox Television for a sitcom.
The theater was to have been the centerpiece of the city's efforts to breathe new life into Spring Street, once the center of Los Angeles business life but now full of low-price clothing stores, residential hotels and drug dealing. Despite an investment of $65 million in the area from the Community Redevelopment Agency, the revival has failed. The restaurants and nightclubs that opened soon after the theater center have all become bankrupt, and only two of the many planned developments -- a state office building and a condominium -- have opened. Though ticket sales are good, many Angelenos are frightened to enter the area after dark. In 1989, the center sold $3.5 million in tickets, according to the city's latest statistics. The center also earned $430,000 in other income, from such concessions as the bar and from rentals to other outfits.
The center has had a paid attendance of about 200,000 a year in recent years, and it plays to 67 percent capacity on average nights, below the attendance at comparable theaters elsewhere in the nation, which have had 80 to 90 percent capacity. The center has been quite successful in selling season subscriptions, deriving about a third of its income from such sales, which is higher than the industry average of 29 percent. But it lags in single-ticket sales, partly because residents here have been unwilling to "brave a trip to Spring Street," the Lavine report says.
The larger reasons for the center's troubles, though, have had to do with its financing and a 34-member board that has been unable to raise sufficient private funds.
"The real costs of operating a complex like that were not thought through from the beginning," said Gordon Davidson, the artistic director of the Center Theater Group, which operates the Mark Taper Forum theater at the Music Center of Los Angeles County. "There was aggressive producing, but not sufficiently diversified backing. At the same time, other things did not happen on Spring Street."
There was also the issue of Mr. Bushnell, a forceful, frequently abrasive figure who made as many enemies as friends for the theater. "He kind of runs over people in order to get what he wants, and in some cases, he has made enemies," said Daniel S. Lewin, a former stage manager for the Los Angeles Theater Center. "But the place wouldn't exist if he wasn't that way."
For his part, Mr. Bushnell cites a combination of factors, including the recession, which has left the city strapped. "If I were a better politician in the traditional American way of never really saying what you feel, I probably wouldn't have had some of the problems I've had," he said.
The turning point came last year when the theater center asked for a $32 million subsidy over 5 years. An infuriated Los Angeles City Council balked, but approved a plan by which the redevelopment agency transferred title of the theater center to the city's Department of Cultural Affairs and paid off $5.3 million in bonds. Mr. Nodal, the director of the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, said efforts were being made to reorganize the operation so that a consortium of theater companies or another operator, possibly including local universities, may take over the center, with the company remaining only as a tenant.
The company's beleaguered board is to meet on Thursday evening to decide whether to stage more productions. The center's fate was unclear today, but Mr. Nodal said that whoever ultimately runs it, "the building is not going to get turned into a bowling alley."

HEADLINE: Taking Lessons From Restaurants That Still Fill Their Seats

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
NEW YORK snaps to attention in autumn, not just with school and Broadway openings, but with new restaurants. This fall, the list of restaurants to open is almost as brief as that of Democratic Presidential candidates. But where kitchens are being built, and menus conceived, there is optimism.
"I think I know what it takes," said Arnold Israel, a former advertising and promotional executive who is opening his first restaurant, a refurbished edition of the Art Deco One Fifth at Fifth Avenue and Washington Square in about a month. Paradoxically, the recession made it easier for him to open the restaurant now than during the boom years of the past decade because his initial investment was considerably less than it would have been then and it was easier to negotiate favorable terms for the space.
"The economics are good now but you still have to be prepared to work 16 hours a day to cater to your customers," he said last week. "By giving people excellent food, service and value you can sustain it beyond the initial flush of curiosity."
A sound philosophy does not guarantee success, of course, but now that much of the glamour in the New York restaurant business is gone, this year's crop of intrepid restaurateurs will try to follow the lead of establishments that are weathering the recession and transition from the free-spending 80's to the cautious 90's.
In New York and around the country, these perennial magnets continue to fill their tables night after night. In contrast to the hot spots that briefly attracted a feeding frenzy of fashionable crowds before closing down, these durable restaurants have in common a businesslike attitude of dedicated professionalism.
"Successful restaurants like the Gotham Bar and Grill are about fabulous consistency and constantly paying attention to detail," said Richard Lavin, who is working with Mr. Israel as a consultant. "We think we're all headed for Broadway, but we must be willing to edit all the time."
Like the Gotham Bar and Grill, there are other places known for top-notch food in relaxed but stylish settings that were established in the early 1980's and are still going strong. Union Square Cafe, Elio's and Provence are some notable examples. Some restaurants, ranging from formally elegant to brassy, like Le Cirque and Jim McMullen's on the Upper East Side, Cafe des Artistes on the West Side and Smith & Wollensky and the venerable Palm in midtown, have been enjoying even longer successful runs. Commander's Palace in New Orleans, Legal Seafood in Boston and Joe's Stone Crab in Miami are all examples of restaurants in other cities around the country that continue to succeed regardless of the economy.
A casual neighborhood spot like Isabella's, with its sidewalk cafe on the Upper West Side, which opened in late 1987, never enjoyed the high profile of some others but has become solidly established. Stephen Hanson, one of the owners, said that to date, business in 1991 is outpacing that in 1990 by about 6 percent.
A few newer places at various price levels, including Aureole, Trattoria dell'Arte and Zarela, have been around long enough for the novelty to have worn off, but are still packed with diners night after night.
"Business is up by 20 percent," said Sheldon Fireman, the owner of Trattoria dell'Arte. "There's no magic, it's all hard work and having a flexible attitude that doesn't dictate to the customers but keeps them happy and coming back."
And judging from the many customers who dine there week after week, Coco Pazzo, the busy Italian spot on the Upper East Side that is scarcely a year old, appears to fit the profile of a place settling in for a long run rather than one doomed to become a fashion victim. "People come in here, look around and asked, 'What recession?' " said John Fanning, the maitre d'hotel.
The key, of course, is nurturing repeat business. Successful restaurateurs say their regular customers make up anywhere from 40 to 90 percent of their business, which may explain why neighborhood restaurants that depend on a local clientele seem to be thriving. Eddie Schoenfeld, an owner of Vince and Eddie's near Lincoln Center, is opening another restaurant on the West Side in September, Fishin Eddie on West 71st Street.
"We hope we can continue to satisfy the needs of this neighborhood," he said. "It's very important to understand your marketplace."
It's not only the neighborhood places that hope to cultivate a local clientele. "We do not want to be that once-a-year special occasion sort of place," Peter W. Tischmann, vice president and general manager of the newly restored St. Regis, said of the hotel's luxuriously appointed restaurant, Lespinasse. "We want to be the kind of place people will come back to because they like the food and the service and because they can afford it."
"Having repeat customers makes a place recession proof," Mr. Tischmann said, "but to do that we must first establish ourselves." Lespinasse will open Sept. 10 with Gray Kunz, formerly of Adrienne in the Peninsula across the street, as chef.
Mr. Tischmann said a three-course lunch would cost $35, comparable to many of the top midtown restaurants. But the price of a three-course dinner, including extras like chocolates and petits fours, will be $50, $5 to $20 less than most of the competition.
But delivering value is not just about low prices. In the past few years a number of Manhattan restaurants like Hubert's and Rakel restructured their menus and cut prices but still went out of business. "New Yorkers are sophisticated and they understand about prices," said Sirio Maccioni, the owner of Le Cirque.
"It goes back to perceived value and that can happen at any price level," said Drew Nieporent, owner of Montrachet and an owner of TriBeCa Grill. Mr. Nieporent says that TriBeCa is extremely busy, and that Montrachet has "hung in there."
"Your customers have to buy what you're delivering," he said. "And it's not just the food. For some it's the room or the service or the greeting at the door. Maybe they really like just one dish."
Indeed, there is a host of elements that contribute to a restaurant's success. And unlike in the flush economic climate a few years ago when droves of people would show up at the latest multimillion-dollar cattle barn with sponged walls, halogen sconces and $25 grilled chicken, close attention must be paid to every one of them.
Mr. Hanson said that when he opened Coconut Grove, his first restaurant, in early 1987, it was meant to be trendy. "It was less well-conceived and that wasn't wise because trends pass," he said. "By the time I opened Isabella's I had a better understanding of how important it was to attract people from the community. You have to work much harder at service." Unlike Isabella's, Mr. Hanson said, business at Coconut Grove is off about 8 percent.
"Customers are much more demanding these days; they are very aware of prices and are very sensitive to the details on how they are treated -- on the phone, when they come in, by the waiter, everything," said Elio Guaitolini, co-owner of Elio's, which opened at Second Avenue and 84th Street in 1981 and where some customers dine as often as two or three times a week. "We have to be much more careful than we were three years ago when the mood was lighter," he said.
Marc Sarrazin, who runs an informal personnel agency for chefs in addition to being an owner of DeBragga & Spitler, wholesale meat purveyors to the restaurant industry, believes it is important for restaurants to deliver according to expectations. "There is room for great restaurants at every level, but there has to be harmony," he said. "Customers can sense when there is tension, when the kitchen and dining room are at odds. We should give them more credit."
Pretension is out and personalization is in. Even at Le Cirque, where the social and power scene makes it seem as if the 80's never went away, Mr. Maccioni can be seen patrolling the dining room with an eagle eye; he's not above aligning the salt and pepper shakers or instructing a waiter to remove plates.
Mr. Maccioni and others also pointed out how important it was to refresh a restaurant. At the Gotham Bar and Grill, for example, Jerome Kretchmer, an owner, and his chef, Alfred Portale, are developing a complete four- or five-course dinner for the first time. "It's just to give our steady customers the possibility of a new experience," Mr. Kretchmer said.
Charles Palmer, chef and co-owner of Aureole, said nothing can be taken for granted. "Business has been great, but if there is any lapse it could go the other way. This place is not cheap but I guess people perceive it as value." The complete dinner at Aureole is $55.
And just as chefs and owners are paying careful attention to the details of greeting and service as well as to the quality of food, they are forever fine-tuning costs so they do not have to increase prices in the face of higher expenses. "We no longer have the guys from Wall Street coming in and showing off with $400 bottles of port," Mr. Palmer said.
These former big spenders, it seems, are also going to bed earlier these days. Fashionably late no longer seems fashionable and many restaurants, even the highly successful ones, are trying to devise ways, like not closing for vacation, to compensate for the decline in business after 9:30 or 10 P.M. It's a situation the newcomers will have to face. These hours around the edges of the prime dining times can often make the difference between profit and loss.
Along with the high-rolling party atmosphere, out went the dilettantes who regarded having a stake in a restaurant as a way of nourishing their egos but who never wanted to do the hard work.
"When you think of the great restaurants of Europe, they're about the people who run them, not two-or-three-million-dollar installations," Mr. Sarrazin said. "In the past few years the restaurant business became distorted, a monster. Maybe now it's getting back on a better track."

HEADLINE: When a Fellow Needs A Friend, Not Just a Buddy

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

 BODY:
"THERE is much about our experience as men that can only be shared with, and understood by, other men," Sam Keen, a writer and philosopher, says in his best-selling book on men, "Fire in the Belly." And he says, "Only men understand the secret fears that go with the territory of masculinity."
What's going on here? After listening for a generation to women's complaints that men should open themselves emotionally and be more vulnerable in their relationships, some men are heeding the advice, Mr. Keen says. But with a twist: They are increasingly confiding in other men about the nature of manhood and friendship itself. 
 There is, say Mr. Keen and others who track the progress of men in unsettling times, a growing sense of a need to restore respect for masculinity and male friendships in American society.
Whether it's a condition of aging members of the post-war generation, economic downturn, family relations broken by divorce or a loneliness bred by a corporate culture that rewards rootlessness, there are signs that thoughtful men are exploring ways to find one or two others with whom they can share their innermost feelings.
"The men's movement today, which is building all the time, is made up of men who went after success, got it, and now question its values," Mr.Keen said in a telephone interview from his Sonoma, Calif., home. Those who haven't yet made it, he said, "are still aspiring to get all those things Madison Avenue says will make them happy."
Evidence of the search is seen in what Americans are reading this year: Both "Fire in the Belly" (Bantam Books, $19.95) and "Iron John: A Book About Men" (Addison-Wesley Publishing, $18.95) by the poet Robert Bly, have been at the top of the best-seller lists for months. These two books, while quite different in style, suggest that contemporary American man spends most of his time reacting to the presence of women in his life and very little on sorting out the mysteries of his own identity. Both authors say they are not "women bashers." In fact, they say, they welcome the gains achieved by women. But they also wonder whether men have become confused, compromising their natural instincts in deference to women's legitimate complaints about sexism.
"Women are coming out into activity just as the men are passing them going the other way, into passivity," Mr. Bly writes. "During the last 30 years men have been asked to learn how to go with the flow, how to follow rather than lead, how to live in a nonhierarchical way, how to be vulnerable, how to adopt consensus decision-making. Some women want a passive man if they want a man at all."
A lot of ridicule has been directed at Mr. Bly's evocation of ancient myths of "hairy men" who guide boys through intitiation rites into manhood, and some researchers have dismissed the "maleness movement" as a fad.
"It's appealing on one level, but I frankly do not put much faith in its longevity," said Dr. Robert E. Gould, a New York Medical College psychiatrist, author and feminist. "Men can't just jump into the wilderness and beat some drums to find themselves."
But the books obviously touch a nerve: after a generation of complaints by the women's movement about men's vices, some champions of manhood are talking up its virtues and finding a receptive audience.
They tell men that happiness lies in responding to positive, even admirable, aspects of their nature like physical exuberance in youth and being a mentor in later years and not feeling guilty if they need close male friendship apart from female claims on their time and emotions. To turn one's back on biology and history, both authors seem to say, is not only folly but damaging to both sexes.
It is a summons that can be unsettling if men, mainly those past 35, respond only to find they are entering the second half of their lives without friends other than business acquaintances and neighborhood pals.
Strong, abiding friendships between men have been a bedrock strength in most cultures, past and present. But in the United States, the competitive drive for success, as well as, in some cases, a homophobia that is part of their social experience, has left many successful middle-aged men shorn of deep, trusting relationships with other men.
Dr. Robert S. Weiss, director of the Work and Family Research Bureau at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, says men differ in their friendships with other men more than in any other area of their lives. In "Staying the Course" (Free Press, 1990), Dr. Weiss observes that some successful men have dozens of friends while others are not sure they have any.
Some men who cannot confide in other men find it easy to confide in women, especially wives, Dr. Weiss said in an interview, and while many men may bare their inner feelings while drinking or under the guise of kidding, they are not taken seriously.
For most adult men, work and family dominate adult lives. If divorce, loss of employment or some other crisis coincides with midlife questions and disillusion, the man who is without valued friends to fall back on is set adrift in dangerous, uncharted waters, often beyond the reach of family and his weekend sports companions or drinking buddies.
Corporate men in particular, Mr. Keen said, "are the men most deprived of true male friends; friendship doesn't thrive in a social ecology that stresses speed, constant preoccupation and competition."
Men without enduring friends can either suffer alone or do something about it. The old answers are rent-a-friend: $100-an-hour psychoanalysts or, at less cost, group therapy sessions for men. Men who feel confident enough to reach out and trust someone are creating other alternatives.
In northwestern Ohio, for example, a group of eight business and professional men recently formed a group that meets every six weeks over dinner to discuss serious elements of their lives that range from critical bread-and-butter decisions to heterosexual intimacy to issues of middle age.
"As men, from the age of 5 we were taught to put our dukes up against each other and keep them there," said Barry Heermann of Yellow Springs, Ohio, a 47-year-old business consultant. "In the group we mentor each other, care about each other, and there is a kind of surrender that I don't think men are used to experiencing."
A Manhattan group, fed by somewhat different needs, was formed recently by six men enrolled in a noncustodial therapy class for fathers, conducted at the 92d Street Y. When the four-week course ended, the men continued to meet on an informal basis in their own homes.
"Going through divorce can be a very isolating experience for a man," said a group member, Kenneth Berk, a Manhattan optometrist. "He finds he is divorcing not just his wife but many of his friends. I discovered I didn't have the wide circle of friends I thought I had. Most were husbands of my wife's friends, and when we separated they all began to pussyfoot around me. I'm not a criminal, but I feel like an outcast."
Like divorce, loss of a job can be shattering if there are no close friends to help a man through the crisis of self-doubt.
John Mennell, 30, a business analyst in New York, suddenly found himself on the street last November when his department at Bankers Trust was closed
His code is that a man takes the hard knocks "and keeps plugging away." He admits to feeling a need for a friend's comforting words and advice, but "you don't want to have to ask; there's an understanding among men, it's wrong to ask."
Breaking down those kinds of barriers, says Chuck Layer, a 56-year-old native of Kentucky who lives in Short Hills, N.J., was what led him to strike up a friendship with Tom Walker, of Edison. They met through their wives, both Wall Street executives, and hit it off on several levels. Both men once held top financial jobs and both now work out of their homes as consultants.
"When you work at home the computer, telephone and fax machine can isolate you socially," Mr. Walker, a gregarious 49-year-old Texan, said with a smile. But what brought him and Mr. Layer together was something more than companionship.
"Since turning 50," Mr. Layer explained, "for the first time in my life, I wanted to really talk to another man. I didn't want to chat about the weather, sex or night baseball. I wanted to learn more about my feelings and what makes me behave the way I do."
This spring the two met for lunch. "We skipped all the slick things we men use to sell ourselves -- what big deals we had pulled off, our golf handicaps -- and talked about meaningful subjects," Mr. Layer said. "What our parents were like, our relations to our fathers. We shared parts of our lives that were musty and deep."
Mr. Walker agreed. His neighbor Richard Kulbis, 46, is a front-porch pal and fishing buddy. But his talks with Mr. Layer helped him realize "there is a lot more to life than beating last year's income." "We are all looking for some way to talk, but getting across that bridge the first time is the hard part," Mr. Layer said. "Once across, it's marvelous how much unbundling we can do if you accept another man as a non-threat. He's not invading my little sandbox. I can let my guard down a little bit. He can be my close friend."

HEADLINE: The Swamp President

 BODY:
George Bush coupled his 1988 campaign pledge to be the "environment President" with a promise to resist further erosion of the nation's valuable wetlands. "My position on wetlands is straightforward," he said. "All existing wetlands, no matter how small, should be preserved."
Mr. Bush's latest proposal for managing wetlands, however, will certainly result in wetland loss, at least by present Federal standards. Shaped more by politics than science, it represents a grievous disappointment to conservationists. And it plunges wetlands policy into a swamp of controversy that's sure to grow when the proposal is offered for a 60-day public review later this week. 
 But this much can be said for his plan: It may have defused a far more dangerous threat to wetlands being hatched in Congress.
"Wetlands" is a broad term applied to ecosystems ranging from prairie potholes to vast tidal marshes. Until the 1970's, wetlands were treated with contempt -- as mosquito-filled swamps to be diked, drained and turned into cropland, shopping malls and subdivisions.
Scientists finally persuaded Congress that wetlands are remarkable biological systems deserving protection. They filter pollutants, replenish water supplies, nourish organisms essential to the food chain and provide habitat for wildlife. The result was the Clean Water Act of 1972, which requires anyone seeking to fill a wetland to obtain a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers and submit to review by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The law slowed the loss of wetlands. But it suffered from indifferent enforcement by the Corps and the failure of various agencies to agree on what a wetland was. In 1989, Government experts finally arrived at a common definition: A wetland is any ground that has mucky or peat-based soils, nourishes specific plant life and is saturated for at least seven straight days per year.
The new definition brought more acres under protection. It also brought howls from farmers and developers who discovered they had been plowing or building on land previously thought to be "dry." Led by oil and gas interests, which hope to drill on protected land, they have lobbied fiercely for changes.
Two weeks ago the Administration caved in. Overriding the strenuous objections of Environmental Administrator William Reilly, the President's Council on Competitiveness invented a much looser definition of wetlands -- 21 days of saturation instead of 7. The change will surely lead to the exploitation of wetlands now protected by the stringent 1989 regulations. But will it violate Mr. Bush's 1988 campaign pledge for no "net loss" of wetlands?
It's hard to say. When Mr. Bush made his pledge, environmentalists generally agreed that there were perhaps 100 million wetland acres genuinely worth saving. The White House insists that the new policy will leave those acres intact. Conservationists disagree -- violently.
In any case, the Bush proposal is preferable to Senate and House bills that would also ease the definition of a wetland and, worse, would eliminate the E.P.A.'s veto power over permits and its authority to establish environmental standards.
Alarmingly, the House version, drafted by oil and gas interests, has already picked up 170 co-sponsors. Instead of seizing on something truly destructive, Congress would be well advised to let Mr. Bush try working his way out of the wetlands swamp and strike a sensible balance between wetlands protection and economic growth.

HEADLINE: Peace-Weary Iraqis Flee for Jordan, to Rest or to Head West

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Aug. 14

 BODY:
The 34-year-old Iraqi Christian had a close family, good friends, a Ph.D. and a well-paying engineering job in Iraq.
But when Baghdad lifted travel restrictions on Iraqis in May, for the first time in nearly a decade, he decided like thousands of others to risk it all: he headed to Jordan in search of a scarce visa to the West and a new start in life, far from the hardship of postwar Iraq. 
 "We are fed up with wars," he said. "We want a better life." Like many newly arrived Iraqis, he said bitterly that he had spent nearly a decade in the army, first in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war and then in the Persian Gulf war.
Like others, he would not give his name for fear of reprisals by the Iraqi authorities against relatives in Iraq.
Since reaching Amman a month ago, the Iraqi said, he has lived in two rooms with nine others, hoping that relatives in Europe will help him get a visa before his money runs out. He said he was determined not to go back.
Officials say that 130,000 Iraqis have come to Jordan since the war, but that most have left; about 20,000 remain.
Many Iraqis come simply to unwind from the war and conditions at home, to stock up on cheaper food and medicine, or to gain access to international phone service to make their first calls to relatives abroad since communications were knocked out in the gulf war.
"They are coming here, settling down, waiting to find out what the situation in Iraq will be like" and whether economic sanctions on Iraq will be eased, said Wahil Aljabari, co-owner of Abdun Real Estate, which like other real estate agencies here has been flooded by requests for rentals.
Most of the Iraqis, particularly Assyrians, Chaldeans and other Christians who have relatives abroad, have flocked to Western embassies in search of entry to favored destinations like the United States, Canada or West Europe.
Others wind up at the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. About 1,500 have sought refugee status, said the office's head, Carl Von Seth; 110 have qualified.
For some, it is the last hope of starting a new life. A 32-year-old Assyrian Christian who says he deserted the Iraqi Army during the Iran-Iraq war and helped smuggle others to Iran was turned down for refugee status.
But he shows up at the United Nations office most days, hoping officials will reconsider because he has a family to support and it too afraid of arrest to return to Iraq. "I don't know what I can do," he said, "where I can go."

HEADLINE: Hints of an Ouster Strain Bhutto's Successor

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Aug. 12

 BODY:
A year after the abrupt ouster of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, her successor, Nawaz Sharif, is widely believed to be under threat of an equally sudden and unceremonious exit.
Mr. Sharif is spending much of his time this week forcing a smile for photographers and trying to reassure political allies and his opponents that he expects to retain his post for some time. 
 There is no hard evidence to suggest that Mr. Sharif is facing an immediate challenge to his leadership. But that has not stopped Pakistani politicians and journalists from circulating rumors of an imminent military coup tied to the retirement this weekend of the nation's army chief, Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, and the furor created by Mr. Sharif's draconian response to a national crime wave.
The response, a constitutional amendment that if adopted in its original form would have given the Prime Minister broad authority to suspend civil rights, was seen as a grab for power at the expense of the military and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan.
The President's influence is never to be underestimated. It was Mr. Khan who took his constitutional authority to the limit last August and dismissed Ms. Bhutto, and it was his allies in Parliament who this year helped to drastically water down the constitutional amendment offered by Mr. Sharif.
While Western and Asian diplomats scoff at the suggestion of an imminent coup -- this is a nation prone to conspiracy theories, they point out -- many agree that Mr. Sharif, whose political prospects seemed bright just a few weeks ago, will not serve out his five-year term.
"I don't think the Prime Minister will fall any time soon," said a Western diplomat in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. "But if I were him, I certainly would keep looking over my shoulder. The atmospherics now are similar in some ways to what we had in the days before Ms. Bhutto was forced out."
Political figures say Mr. Sharif's future may also be determined by his handling of the scandal surrounding the Pakistani-run Bank of Credit and Commerce International -- specifically, of suggestions of illegal deals between the bank and senior Pakistani military officers.
Aides to the Prime Minister are reported to be advising Mr. Sharif to limit Pakistan's cooperation with investigators in the United States and Britain if only to avoid offending military leaders with close ties to B.C.C.I.
Ms. Bhutto, who is now the opposition leader in Parliament, has seized on the Prime Minister's troubles, accusing the Government of trying to impose "civilian martial law" in the guise of an anti-crime crackdown.
In an interview, Ms. Bhutto said followers of her Pakistan People's Party in the southern province of Sind were being subjected to a harassment campaign by Mr. Sharif's allies that included detention without charge and threats of violence.
On Aug. 4 she led a well-publicized, daylong hunger strike in front of Parliament House in Islamabad to protest the "repression" of the Sharif Government. Her followers sponsored similar hunger strikes in cities across Pakistan.
The scion of a large Pakistani business family and, by most accounts, an able and amiable politician, Mr. Sharif was elected Prime Minister in October and has won praise from the diplomatic corps and business community for a series of ambitious economic changes, including proposals for the privatization of large industries.
His troubles began in late June, when 19 members of 2 families were found slain, their throats cut, in their homes in Punjab Province, where Mr. Sharif had previously been the Chief Minister. No one has suggested any involvement by anyone associated with Mr. Sharif.
The killings remain unsolved and were shocking not only for their savagery -- the victims included nine children -- but also because they occurred in the relatively affluent and peaceful Punjab. The killings came in the midst of a surge in lawlessness in the country and especially in Sind, where scores of people, including Western business executives, have been killed or kidnapped this year.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher Amid Speculation on Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished higher yesterday against most major currencies, as investors weighed the Federal Government's report of a small rise in consumer prices against an expected rise in German interest rates.
Gold prices also moved higher. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted an after-hours bid of $357.60 a troy ounce, up $1.10 from late Tuesday. 
 The dollar rose despite speculation that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates after a report that the Consumer Price Index rose only two-tenths of 1 percent in July, keeping the annual inflation rate to just 2.7 percent.
Expectations of lower rates would normally depress the dollar because they make investments in dollar-demoninated securities less attractive to foreign investors.
"I'm a little bit surprised that it's holding up as well as it has," Peter Iversen, a vice president with Shawmut Bank of Boston, said of the dollar. "The numbers this morning would be a good environment for a rate cut in America."
Most attention remained focused on the Bundesbank's council meeting today, at which it will review interest rates.
In New York, the British pound finished at $1.6860, down from $1.6930 Tuesday. Earlier in London, the pound fell to $1.6860, from $1.6938 late Tuesday.
In Tokyo, the dollar was unchanged from Tuesday, closing at 136.40 yen. Later in London, it rose to 136.60 yen, and in New York to 136.50 yen, up from 136.45 yen Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Tuesday, included: 1.7375 German marks, up from 1.7325; 1.5222 Swiss francs, up from 1.5145; 5.9095 French francs, up from 5.8960; 1,301.25 Italian lire, up from 1,300, and 1.1432 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1462.
In precious-metals trading, gold for current delivery rose $1.50 a troy ounce, to a late bid of $357.80 on New York's Commodity Exchange. Earlier in London, gold fell to a late bid price of $356.90 a troy ounce, down from $357.00 bid late Tuesday.
Silver for August delivery rose 2.9 cents an ounce, to $3.954 on New York's Comex.

Bell Atlantic Plans Early Retirements

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 14

 BODY:
The Bell Atlantic Corporation said it would offer early retirement to 3,500 employees in a cost-cutting move. The action is similar to one taken earlier this week by the Atlanta-based BellSouth Corporation, which said that 3,100 of its managers would take early retirement. BellSouth said Tuesday that the action would result in a charge of 18 cents a share against third-quarter earnings. 
 The weak economy has hurt the nation's phone companies by cutting the number of new service connections, forcing them to reduce operating costs. Bell Atlantic, based in Philadelphia, said employees would be entitled to a full package of increased benefits if they retire by Dec. 15. Others who retired after that date would still receive some increased benefits. Bell Atlantic said 6,300 employees would be eligible to apply for the retirement incentives, and the 3,500 applicants with the most seniority would be selected, Bell Atlantic shares fell 37.5 cents today, to $47.125, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Business Inventories Decline 0.3%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Business inventories fell three-tenths of a percent in June, the fifth straight decline, the Government said today in a report that analysts said should mean increased production and jobs as soon as consumers resume spending.
"The minute demand picks up, we will have a spurt in production," said Evelina Tainer, an economist with the First National Bank of Chicago. 
 Gilbert Benz, an economist with the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York, said increased orders would force manufacturers to produce more because not enough goods were stockpiled to satisfy the demand.
The increased production, he added, will benefit the economy because "that will mean more people employed, making more money and spending more money" and thereby stimulating further production.
The Commerce Department report showed that demand was beginning to pick up. Business sales inched up two-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $536.9 billion in June, their third consecutive monthly advance. There were gains of 1.0 percent in May and 1.5 percent in April.
 
Long Stretch of Declines
 The inventory liquidation through June marks the longest stretch of declines since inventories dropped for eight months -- from August 1982 through March 1983 -- as the economy emerged from the 1981-82 recession.
Today's report showed inventories totaled a seasonally adjusted $808.9 billion, down from $811.7 billion a month earlier. May's six-tenths of 1 percent shrinkage was even more than the five-tenths of 1 percent reported in the department's initial estimate last month.
The combination of inventory cuts and sales increases resulted in a 1.51 inventory-to-sales ratio, meaning it would take 1.51 months to exhaust the backlog at the June sales pace. The ratio was unchanged from May.
"The 1.51 ratio is considered very comfortable when compared to previous business cycles when it was much higher," Mr. Benz said.
The ratio had jumped to 1.75 during the 1974-75 recession and to 1.74 during the 1981-82 downturn. It averaged 1.49 in 1990.
 
Retail Inventories Off
 Retail inventories in June declined two-tenths of 1 percent for the second straight month. Manufacturers trimmed their stockpiles by four-tenths of 1 percent after cutting them by eight-tenths of 1 percent a month earlier. Wholesale inventories dropped four-tenths of 1 percent following a seven-tenths of 1 percent decrease the previous month.
Retail sales, on the other hand, edged up one-tenth of 1 percent in June, a much slower pace than the 1.2 percent rate in May. But the Commerce Department said earlier this week that retail sales were up five-tenths of 1 percent in July, for the first three-month string of increases in nearly a year.
Manufacturers' sales also slowed in June, rising three-tenths of 1 percent after a 1.4 percent gain a month earlier. Sales on the wholesale level were flat after slipping one-tenth of 1 percent the previous month.

Further Decline Is Expected For Money Market Yields

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
A further decline in short-term money rates is expected by Walter S. Frank, chief economist for the IBC/ Donoghue's Money Fund Report.
"One should expect that because of the Federal Reserve's actions in encouraging lower rates recently, money market yields will decline somewhat further," he said. "The whole bond market is strong, with higher prices and resultant declining yields." 
 Mr. Frank said that in the case of tax-free funds, "there has been very little change over the past week." The supply of municipal issues available to investors has slowed after a deluge a few weeks ago. "The market now is relatively stable," he said.
 
Newcomers Join List
 Total assets of the tax-exempt funds covered by the Money Fund Report rose by $383 million, to $88.4 billion, for the week that ended on Monday. But Mr. Frank said, "Actually, there was an outflow because we added 10 new funds to our list." With the newcomers excluded, there was an outflow from tax-exempt funds of about $80 million.
For tax-exempt funds, the average seven-day simple yield was 3.95 percent, while the seven-day compound yield was 4.03 percent. The 30-day simple yield was 3.89, and the 30-day compound yield was 3.97.
Two New York funds tied in terms of highest yields. They were the Boston Company New York Tax-Free Money Fund and Salomon New York Municipal Money Market, both with a seven-day compound yield of 4.46 percent.
Among Connecticut funds, the highest was reported by the Dreyfus Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund, with a 4.23 percent yield. In New Jersey, the top-yielding fund continued to be the Calvert Tax-Free Reserve New Jersey Fund, with a 4.88 percent compounded seven-day yield.
For the 15th week, the top-yielding tax-free fund was the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund of Milwaukee, with a seven-day compound yield of 5.03 percent.
 
Taxable Assets Rise
 Assets of the taxable funds rose by $2.7 billion, to $454 billion, in the week. Funds that are newly reporting to Donoghue's accounted for $900 million of that increase. The net comparable inflow, therefore, was $1.8 billion, Mr. Frank said. The average maturity of securities held by the taxable funds rose to 58 days, from 56 days, which he called "a very long maturity."
The seven-day average simple yield for taxable funds dropped by 4 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.40 percent, and the seven-day compound yield dropped 5 basis points, to 5.54 percent.
For the 30-day period, the simple yield dropped 2 basis points, to 5.44 percent; the 30-day compound yield was also down 2 basis points, to 5.59 percent.
The yield leader among the taxable funds was Merrill Lynch C.M.A. Money Fund, with a compound yield of 6.82 percent for the seven-day period. Mr. Frank said the fund used a different accounting method from that of most other funds reporting to Donoghue's.
Nationwide, The Bank Rate Monitor said that average yields on money-market accounts was 5.18 percent, down from 5.20 percent a week ago, while the average yield of six-month certificates was 5.67 percent, down from 5.76 percent.

Newsprint Mill Given To Workers

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
The Kimberly-Clark Corporation and The New York Times Company will give their Spruce Falls newsprint mill in northern Ontario to an employee-led group of investors as part of an agreement announced today by the Ontario government.
The agreement also requires Ontario Hydro, the state-owned power company, to buy the mill's hydroelectric power plant for $140 million (Canadian). 
 The two American companies promised to lend the new mill owners $60 million at low interest rates. Ontario Hydro will provide the mill owners 103 megawatts of power for 10 years and $34 million. And Tembec Inc., a Montreal-based paper company, will inject $25 million in equity and loans and $15 million for investment in upgrading the mill in return for a 40 percent stake in the mill.
The agreement came after months of tense negotiations over the fate of the Spruce Falls Power and Paper Company Ltd., the joint venture through which the American companies owned the mill and power plant. The mill is the only large employer in Kapuskasing, the market center for the vast but thinly populated region some 500 miles north of Toronto. The power plant is at Smoky Falls on the Mattagami River, about 50 miles farther north.
 
Two-Part Deal
 Kimberly-Clark, which owns 50.1 percent of Spruce Falls and has represented both American companies in the negotiations, proposed last March to give the aging mill to the employees if its previously negotiated preliminary agreement to sell the power plant to Ontario Hydro could be quickly completed. That preliminary argreement included 80 years of free power for the mill.
Darwin E. Smith, Kimberly-Clark's chairman and chief executive, made the proposal as an alternative to his plans to shut down all but the mill's most profitable operations so that it could be easily sold. The cutback would have eliminated 1,200 of the 1,450 jobs by the end of this year.
The deal announced yesterday will also eliminate hundreds of jobs, but it will do so gradually. The business plan worked out by the employee group and Tembec projects a total employment of 800 next year and 670 after 1994. An additional 200 workers will be temporarily employed in construction to modernize the mill.
"I am pleased that the government has been able to bring about a new partnership between business and labor to maintain jobs at the mill," Ontario's Premier, Bob Rae, said in a statement.
Neither Kimberly-Clark nor the Times Company had any comment. The deal will not affect either company financially as both had previously taken write-downs to cover their anticipated costs in disposing of Spruce Falls.
The main sticking point in Mr. Smith's original proposal had been the unwillingness of Ontario Hydro to complete the purchase of the power plant without assurances from the Government that it would receive environmental permits to expand the plant. The utility's only interest in the Smoky Falls plant is as part of broader plans to develop a number of hydroelectric sites on the Mattagami and other northern rivers.
Government officials pressed Mr. Smith to accept partial payment for Smoky Falls, with additional sums to be paid if the environmental reviews approved its expansion. But Mr. Smith refused, saying the original deal was fair. Faced with economic decimation of one of the province's key northern settlements and fierce protests from northern Ontario residents who have contended that their interests were frequently overlooked in Toronto, government officials finally worked out an arrangement that included a promise to pay the utility up to $247 million (Canadian) if the expansion was not approved.
Although unable to put pressure on Mr. Smith to share Ontario Hydro's environmental risk, government officials did persuade Kimberly-Clark and the Times Company to increase their loans for upgrading the mill to $60 million from the $40 million the companies originally offered.

Prices on Bonds Rise Sharply

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Bond prices soared and long-term interest rates fell yesterday to levels not seen since early February, driven by good news on inflation and another sign that the economic recovery may be stalling out.
The two-tenths of a percent increase in the July Consumer Price Index was in line with market expectations, as was the four-tenths of a percent rise in prices excluding food and energy. 
 What encouraged analysts was the fact that when compared to a year ago, inflation is almost certain to decelerate even more over the balance of 1991.
The year-over-year comparisons are expected to be favorable because last year was affected sharply by the surge in oil prices that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August, which caused consumer and wholesale prices to climb.
"The key to this whole situation is that for the 12 months ended in July inflation is up 4.4 percent," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Co. "But by the end of the year, we will be at 3.5 percent. It's not going to be hard to get an improvement from last year."
Richard B. Berner, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said an improvement in inflation is "baked in the cake. You can't help but get good numbers."
 
Consumer Price Outlook
 While consumer prices will come down compared to where they were a year ago, Mr. Berner said the 2.7 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index since the start of 1991 is probably not sustainable.
"But I am not looking for any appreciable increase" from that level, he added.
Sagging 10-day auto sales, which came in at a seasonally adjusted rate of 6.2 million units for early August, also helped to lift bond prices. For the last two reporting periods, vehicle sales had averaged about 6.6 million units.
"The car sales numbers give you a further indication that what we are seeing is not a typical recovery from recession," one bond trader said.
The combination of good inflation news and weak economic data increases the odds that the Federal Reserve Board will move again soon to lower short-term interest rates, analysts said.
"I think the Fed will move again, sometime in early September," Mr. Liro said.
The only way the central bank might not choose to lower the overnight federal funds rate by another quarter point, to 5.25 percent, and to cut its discount rate by half a point, to 5 percent, would be if the August employment report is unusually strong, he said. That report is expected to be released on Sept. 6.
As has been the case for much of the week, market participants said that trading activity was brisk.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the new 8 1/8 percent bonds of August 2021 were offered at a price of 100 22/32 late yesterday, up more than a point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 worth of securities, to yield 8.06 percent, down from 8.16 percent late Tuesday. It is the lowest yield on the benchmark issue since early February.
"You can't rule out bond yields falling below 8 percent," Mr. Berner said. "The tougher question is if yields can fall through the lows we saw when the economy was clearly in recession."
In late February bond yields fell as low as 7.96 percent.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 15/32 late yesterday, up 5/8 of a point, to yield 7.80 percent. And the 6 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 31/32, up 6/32, to yield 6.33 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates also fell.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.28 percent in late trading, unchanged on the day. But six-month bill rates fell by five basis points, or five one-hundredths of a percentage point, to a late offered rate of 5.33 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by 10 basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.34 percent.
 
Investment-Grade Bonds
 Activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market was highlighted by a two-part global offering of $1.40 billion worth of securities backed by receipts due on Citicorp credit cards.
The bulk of the issue consists of $1.25 billion worth of five-year notes. The 8 percent securities were priced at $99.48, to yield 8.132 percent, 72.5 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing. These securities are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The remaining $155 million worth of securities carry an 8.25 percent coupon and were priced at $99.14, to yield 8.465 percent, 1.05 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the 7 7/8 percent five-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
UBS Securities Inc. acted as lead manager for the transaction. It is the first time the Swiss-based firm has acted as lead underwriter on an asset-backed transaction.
In other developments, Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager on an offering of $125 million worth of 10-year first mortgage bonds for Baltimore Gas & Electric.
The non-callable securities, which mature Aug. 15, 2001, carry a coupon of 8 3/8 percent and were priced at $99.50, to yield 8.45 percent, 58 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-1 by Moody's and A-plus by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, prices of most long-term issues rose by as much as 3/4 of a point, traders said. Prices of most shorter-term maturities rose by about 1/4 of a point.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about 1/4 of a point.

Route Sales Put T.W.A. in Black

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Trans World Airlines Inc. said yesterday that it earned $336.9 million in the second quarter, mainly because its sale of prized London routes erased what otherwise would have been a loss.
T.W.A. said its $53 million operating loss was more than offset when the carrier sold London routes out of New York, Los Angeles and Boston to American Airlines for $445 million. 
 T.W.A.'s earnings for the quarter compared with net profits of $103.4 million for the period a year earlier.
The privately owned airline is considered one of the weakest and most heavily indebted United States carriers. T.W.A.'s owner, the financier Carl C. Icahn, recently struck a deal with creditors that gave the airline more time to get its finances in order.
T.W.A. said revenues were $926.9 million in the second quarter of 1991 and $1.23 billion a year earlier. For the first six months of 1991, T.W.A. reported revenues of $1.75 billion, down from $2.24 billion for that period in 1990.
T.W.A., based in Mount Kisco, N.Y., attributed its most recent troubles to the Persian Gulf crisis and the recession, which cut deeply into passenger traffic. Airlines have since lured many travelers back, but they did so by cutting some ticket prices so low it has been difficult to show much of a profit.

Valuing Stocks In Terms of Gold

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
THE American stock market finally reached a new high this year, breaking the record set 15 years ago. But even now, prices are only 11 percent above the peak in 1976.
If that paragraph sounds absurd, it is because you are no doubt used to thinking of stock prices in terms of dollars. In terms of gold, it is true. 
 As measured in gold terms, stocks set their previous record on Aug. 31, 1976, when an ounce of gold would buy just a bit more than the dollar value of the Standard & Poor's 500. On that date, the S.& P. stood at 102.91, while gold was at $104.38 an ounce.
That record stood for nearly 15 years, until it fell in February and an ounce of gold was no longer enough to buy the S.& P. 500, a relationship that had not existed since the ownership of gold by Americans became legal at the end of 1974. Yesterday, the S.& P. 500 stood at 389.90, while gold was just $357.80.
The S.& P. 500 is cited in the above example because it is the broadest of the standard market indexes. The relationship is even more stark in terms of the Dow Jones industrial average. Because that average has risen less than the S.& P. 500 in the last 15 years, it remains, in gold terms, 10 percent below its level of August 1976.
Whether that is at all relevant depends on whether the idea that gold is money has died. It is certainly on the rocks, as the death of gold as an investment has been widely heralded. To hear those most bearish on gold tell it, gold is just another commodity, one with production in excess of real demand for uses in jewelry and industrial processes. To make matters worse, better mining techniques threaten to expand the gold supply.
But gold still has its adherents, even if markets have not been friendly to them. To J. David Edwards, the chief investment officer for United Services Advisors, a mutual fund company whose largest funds specialize in gold stocks, the high value of stocks in relation to gold shows just how undervalued gold has become.
"You can very easily say that gold has not kept up its purchasing power," he said yesterday. "But I take the contrarian approach, that there is a tremendous catch-up potential in the value of bullion."
Gold prices surged in the late 1970's amid concern about inflation, then stagnated in the 1980's, when the threat of inflation receded. Stock prices suffered in the inflationary times and boomed in the 1980's.
Now, with the biggest problem facing the financial system appearing to be declining values, there would seem to be no need for a hedge against inflation. But William H. Tehan, a money manager for P. R. Herzig & Company and a man with a good record on gold, argues the opposite.
"We are now in a credit and asset deflation," he said yesterday. "It will be more bullish for gold than was the period of inflation. When capital flees from credit, it seeks the protection of real money."
James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, is a bull on gold and a bear on stocks. Both opinions, he readily acknowledges, have been wrong of late.
"It seems to me that the low price of gold is symptomatic of a state of mind in financial markets," he said yesterday. "If caution were a stock, it would be making new lows. If speculation were a stock, it would be making new highs."
To Mr. Grant, that is an unhealthy situation. But he concedes that even when fear rises these days, gold does not seem to benefit.
"For a bull on gold, it is quite demoralizing to see what happened in Hong Kong," he said, referring to the brief run on several banks last week, in the wake of the worldwide seizure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. "They had a run on banks, but they did not buy enough gold to run the price up."

HEADLINE: Helping Hands Await Immigrants in Ontario

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Toronto Welcome House, an Ontario agency helping 40,000 immigrants a year get jobs and settle into this city's ethnic enclaves, is something of a family enterprise for the Xus, formerly of Beijing.
Both Xu Huilian, who holds a doctorate in plant science, and his wife, Xu Liwei, who has a master's in economics, are using it to improve their English and learn computer skills. 
 While they attend classes in a four-story building in downtown Toronto, their 3-year-old daughter, Xu Xianhuizi, nicknamed Chieko, romps in the nursery, getting her first exposure to English.
Mr. Xu, Mrs. Xu and other classmates, including Zerihun Tensa, who worked as an accountant in his native Ethiopia, Susana Arenas, a former industrial production superviser in Peru, and Mathavan Nallalingan, a bookbinder from Sri Lanka, are all hoping to be able to send off their first English resumes soon.
Forty years ago, three-quarters of the people who lived in metropolitan Toronto were of British origin. Today, 40 percent of the population are immigrants, and more than a quarter can speak neither English nor French. About 20 percent are what Canadians call visible minorities.
The liberalization of immigration policies since the 1960's has not only transformed cities like Toronto, often called Canada's New York, but also challenged Government policies of trying to absorb hundreds of thousands of new citizens a year with a miminum of friction.
Toronto's claim to one of the best records on race relations of any major North American city is owed in large measure to creative absorption programs like Welcome House, which have been studied by American municipalities, including New York City, and by representatives of the Governments of France, Britain, Sweden and Norway.
For the newcomers, the 40 Welcome House settlement officers in downtown Toronto and 55 other mainly contract employees at four other sites in the metropolitan area offer a variety of counseling services, like advice on housing, the job market and schools and on how to set up a business, cope with taxes, and obtain welfare or a driver's license. In addition, there are the language and computer-training classes and the day-care center.
The settlement officers work closely with organizations in the local ethnic communities to help the new arrivals assimilate.
"It's an example of a government-community partnership working well, for everyone's benefit," said Shamira Madhany, senior manager of the program, herself from India by way of Uganda.
Ethnic community organizations are a much more important part of local life here than in the United States. Canada has always maintained greater emphasis on maintaining the cultural distinctiveness of its immigrant groups, whereas people of various nationalities entering the United States tend to be absorbed more quickly into the great American personality. It is what demographers call the "salad bowl" as opposed to the "melting pot."
While apparently effective, the Toronto Welcome House network is not cheap. The Ontario provincial government is spending $2.2 million on its administration this year, up from $1.9 million last year.
But Elaine Ziemba, the official in charge of the entire program, makes no apologies. She is a 49-year-old former social worker brought into Ontario's first Socialist government last year by Premier Bob Rae.
As Minister of Citizenship with Responsibility for Human Rights, Disability Issues, Senior Citizens and Race Relations, Mrs. Ziemba has the longest official title of any of the 30 provincial ministers.
"Compared with what the new citizens will eventually give back to this country in terms of living up to their full potential, that money is really very little," she said.
Mrs. Ziemba added that the agency's programs "are helping people become extremely good citizens, giving them the tools to participate fully in Ontario life."

SERIES: Neighborhood Politics: Choosing the Council -- An occasional look at the races for New York's new City Council.

BYLINE: By E. R. SHIPP

 BODY:
As much as any of New York City's 51 new Council seats, the five miles and many neighborhoods of District 7 illustrate the difficulty of mandating diversity and matching a seat to a particular racial or ethnic group.
The complexities come in the form of more than 66,000 registered voters of all stripes -- poor blacks in the public housing projects of Manhattan Valley; upper-middle-class blacks and whites who own homes in a historic section of Harlem; Irish and Jewish New Yorkers who fled to Inwood when blacks began moving into the area in the 1950's and 60's, and a relatively recent wave of immigrants, primarily Hispanic, in Washington Heights.
 
New Yorkers of All Persuasions
 When the New York City Districting Commission created District 7, its members expected that it would be represented by a black who would replace the white incumbent whose district was being folded into the new tuning-forked shape creation. 
 But now that the campaign has begun, many are not so sure. The very diversity of the neighborhoods the commission linked together may undermine its vision of a Council on which New Yorkers of all persuasions -- but especially black, Hispanic and Asian residents -- would be able to elect someone who looked like them.
"You have a lot of Dominicans in the Seventh," said Selwyn Carter, a political analyst for the Community Service Society, a nonprofit advocacy organization. "They could be feeling that Seven is also theirs, just as the blacks in Harlem feel that Seven is theirs and the whites in the northern part feel it's theirs. And each of them, you could argue, has a legitimate claim."
In district after district, neighborhood after neighborhood, the way the diversity translates into ballots cast is proving to be more complicated than was foreseen even by the commission. How the varying groups within District 7 come together or compete in the new setting will make a major statement about how politics is being practiced in the city.
District 7 is a particularly pointed example. Forty-two percent of its 151,428 inhabitants are black, 38 percent Hispanic, 17 percent white and 2 percent Asian.
Eight men and women have announced their intentions to run, including Republican and Conservative Party candidates who are unopposed. In the Democratic primary, scheduled for Sept. 12, there could be one white man -- Stanley E. Michels; one Hispanic man -- Jaime T. Garcia; two black men -- C. Vernon Mason and Keith S. Mitchell; and two black women -- Peggy M. Shepard and Frankye Graves. It is a situation that could so splinter the vote that many politicians and residents see it leading to the election of Mr. Michels.
Mr. Michels represented much of the district for years in the old District 6, and many white and Hispanic residents who are following the race say they are happy with him.
But many blacks, previously part of the old District 8, have been represented by blacks and would see it as a step backward if a white won the seat. Dominicans, who are growing more politically astute, are demanding a voice. "We have nothing in common, absolutely nothing -- except that we are human, of course," one resident, Michael Adams, said of District 7.
Ask residents about what pulls their neighborhoods together. The first reaction of a black man living in a residential hotel on 126th Street, a Dominican woman living on 150th Street and a white man living in an Irish stronghold near 215th Street is that not much does.
 
From Odors to Stolen Flowers
 What is on their minds ranges from the stop sign that everyone ignores at 126th and Broadway to the overcrowded schools in Inwood; from the unreliable A train once celebrated by Duke Ellington to the store of empty apartments that some landlords hold on to in hopes of converting their buildings to cooperatives or condominiums. They are concerned about foul odors emanating from a sewage-treatment plant on the Hudson River and a crematorium on Riverside Drive. And, of course, the flowers being stolen from window boxes in Hamilton Heights.
Blacks, especially, complain that when the area changed, stores went from white ownership to Dominican and Korean, bypassing them.
For all their differences, there is at least one common concern: drugs and crime that drive many of the law-abiding citizens off the streets and behind locked doors at sundown.
"I couldn't see any other issue that's bigger than that," said John Galvin, an Irishman who has lived his entire life in Inwood. He was born on Post Avenue.
"At nighttime I wouldn't walk down Post Avenue now if you paid me," he said the other day as he drank beer in a neighborhood bar. "It's a bad neighborhood. It's drugs down there. Anytime there's drugs, there's crime. They go together hand and foot. I'm afraid."
Until 30 years ago, this part of upper Manhattan was predominantly white -- Irish and Jewish, in the main. Blacks remember the pride they had in moving up the hill from central Harlem into neighborhoods like Sugar Hill and Washington Heights.
Calvin Copeland, who owns one of the area's most popular restaurants, on 145th Street, remembers moving to 150th Street more than 35 years ago. His was the second black family in a building of 64 apartments.
"I would say that after a matter of a year, there was only one white family left," he said. "Everybody moved out like we had leprosy."
As newer waves of immigrants, most of them Dominican, move into the area, the older residents feel squeezed. The streets teem with people all hours of the day and night: some of them seeking a respite from apartments in which families live doubled and tripled up, others involved in drugs.
Ybelice Simancas's family moved to Washington Heights from the Dominican Republic 19 years ago. Now, Ms. Simancas, who works in a luncheonette in a bingo parlor on 181st Street, said: "It's not a good neighborhood. I'm planning to move soon."
Tom Mullany, who has lived in Inwood since 1963, is also thinking of leaving.
"That's the big question for the first time in my life," Mr. Mullany, a telephone company executive, said. "I've lived in New York City since I was born, never left, never lived any other place. And in the last year, year and a half, I've never seen my city change as much. Just a general letting things get out of control."
 
One Problem: Name Recognition
 Though the campaign season has just begun, it is already evident that any candidate will have an enormous task trying to appeal to everyone in the district. Name recognition alone can be a problem.
Democrats outnumber Republicans 50 to 1, according to the Republican candidate for the seat, Ronald Perry. But nearly half the voting-age population never even bothers to vote -- people like Michael Layton, who lives in the Grant housing project on Broadway at 125th Street.
"The system is not working as far as I'm concerned," said Mr. Layton, a Vietnam veteran and unemployed construction worker, as he played cards with neighbors in a city park. "People lose hope when they don't see nothing changing."
Up in Inwood, Mr. Mullany, a former candidate for public office himself, was surprised to know that there were more than two candidates in the race: Mr. Michels and Mr. Mason, a lawyer who often takes on controversial causes, from the Tawana Brawley case to the defense of a City College professor under fire for racially charged remarks he made in a recent speech.
"Who is Peggy Shepard?" Mr. Mullany asked.
On 145th Street, Crosby Barnes, a man who seems to be a walking encyclopedia on the area, could barely place Mr. Michels. "His name, I've heard it once or twice," he said.
But everyone, he and Mr. Mullany agreed, has heard of Mr. Mason, a man whose very name frightens many whites. Ms. Shepard, a state housing official who has been active in local community affairs for years and is a Democratic district leader, said that Mr. Mason had become "the Willie Horton in the race" -- a black figure viewed as menacing by whites who will vote for the candidate most likely to keep him from obtaining office. Neither Mr. Mason nor Mr. Michels responded to messages left with their offices.
Still, Mr. Barnes said, many blacks see Mr. Mason as a champion of blacks facing all kinds of injustice.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Rose 0.2% in July

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Held in check by the sharpest drop in grocery costs in nearly four decades, consumer prices rose just two-tenths of 1 percent in July, the Labor Department reported today.
The slight rise helped to hold the 1991 inflation rate so far to 2.7 percent, less than half last year's pace of 6.1 percent. 
 The small, seasonally adjusted rise in the Consumer Price Index was viewed as both a symptom of the recession and a necessary ingredient of a sustained recovery. It followed an identical rise in June.
The financial markets, which expected good news on inflation, were encouraged, and bond prices soared to levels not seen since early February. [Page D17.] The Dow Jones industrial average rose sharply early in the day when the data came out, although it fell back later to close 3.35 points down. [Page D10.]
 
1.2% Drop in Grocery Prices
 The July data largely reflected a 1.2 percent drop in grocery prices, the largest one-month decline since 1953. The grocery numbers included a 12.7 percent drop in prices for fresh vegetables as crops rebounded from earlier weather problems.
In addition, energy prices fell for the seventh time in eight months.
Prices excluding the volatile food and energy items -- considered a good measure of core inflation -- rose four-tenths of 1 percent, the same rate as in June.
A senior Bush Administration official said subdued inflation would revive consumer spending and lower interest rates, but some private forecasters warn that the economy could suffer a relapse.
"Inflation prospects are terrific," said Robert Brusca, an economist at Nikko Securities Company International Inc. But he added, "We do not have a recovery in the bag."
Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher said: "Very low inflation is a welcome development for consumer purchasing power. This news creates the right environment for possible additional reductions in market interest rates."
 
Fed Would Have Leeway
 Dampened inflation gives policy makers at the Federal Reserve, who are scheduled to meet privately Tuesday, leeway to stimulate economic growth with lower interest rates if necessary, economists said. The last move by the Fed to push short-term interest rates down came Aug. 6, with a quarter of a percentage point cut in the Federal Funds rate.
Despite subdued price rises, the Labor Department also said today that Americans' purchasing power -- as measured by inflation-adjusted average weekly earnings -- slipped 1.4 percent in July after rising nine-tenths of 1 percent in June. The drop came from a large decrease in average hours worked and a slight dip in average hourly earnings.
In another report, the Commerce Department said business sales in June rose a weak two-tenths of 1 percent. Businesses still managed to shrink their inventories by three-tenths of 1 percent. That should pave the way for new orders, increased production and job gains when consumer demand strengthens.
Two private surveys showed business executives were not becoming more optimistic about the economy.
The United States Chamber of Commerce said only 40 percent of 7,057 businesses surveyed in August believed the economy is headed up, compared with 46 percent in June.
 
Optimism Index Slips
 The National Federation of Independent Business, which represents smaller businesses, said its optimism index slipped to 100 in July from 101 three months earlier.
The July inflation report reflected improving fruit and vegetable crops following severe weather earlier in the year. The price of both lettuce and tomatoes fell more than 20 percent for the month.
The various changes left the Consumer Price Index, before adjusting for seasonal variations, at 136.2 in July, compared with 130.4 a year earlier. That means a market basket of goods and services costing $136.20 last month would have cost $130.40 in July 1990.

HEADLINE: Domestic Auto Sales Fall 9.4%

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 14

 BODY:
The recovering United States automotive market stumbled in early August, as sales of cars and trucks made in North America fell 9.4 percent from levels a year earlier.
Moreover, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales from Aug. 1 to 10 was 6.2 million, down from 6.7 million in late July and 6.9 million for all of July. The rate for the year so far has been 6.2 million, including the dismal sales of late winter and early spring. 
 Analysts said the expiration of aggressive sales incentives in late July might have contributed to the decline. Scott Merlis, an automotive analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company in New York, also noted that relatively weak July payroll statistics might have been reflected in the decline in automotive buying.
Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, called early August sales a disappointment. "The latest sales pace only confirms that this will be a slow and bumpy recovery for the auto sector," he said in a statement.
 
'Steeper Than Expected'
 Harvey Heinbach, an automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company in New York, said that after two months of stronger results, "we've all been expecting a down-draft, but this was a little steeper than expected."
Mr. Heinbach speculated that the Big Three's sales to daily rental fleets in June and July had bolstered total vehicle sales during that period, but that the fleets had now completed their purchases of 1991 models, so overall sales became weaker.
Because auto makers have been building cars and trucks at a conservative pace, dealer inventories are at a six-year low, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry newsletter. Thus, some sales may have been lost because of shortages of specific vehicles, Mr. Merlis said. Still, auto makers should have less trouble than in previous years in clearing the way for new models. The 1992 cars are already being shipped.
In any case, the latest 10-day results do not necessarily portend a trend, analysts said.
In the first 10 days of August, the three United States and six Japanese auto makers assembling vehicles in North America posted sales of 223,494, down 9.4 percent from 246,708 a year earlier. Car sales were 139,643, down 7.4 percent from last year's 150,877, and light-truck sales, which include mini-vans and sport utility vehicles, were 83,851, down 12.5 percent from last year's 95,831.
The General Motors Corporation, the industry leader, sold 59,935 cars in the 10-day period, or 8.7 percent fewer than a year earlier, and 34,790 light trucks, a drop of 16.7 percent. G.M.'s Buick and Oldsmobile divisions posted higher sales, however, partly because of strong demand for two redesigned, higher-priced models, the Buick Park Avenue and Oldsmobile 98. G.M.'s Pontiac division showed the biggest sales decline.
The Ford Motor Company sold 40,318 cars, a drop of 16.6 percent, and 27,564 light trucks, a drop of 19.5 percent. Ford's Tempo compact car, Club Wagon van and Explorer sport-utility vehicle were among the very few models to post gains.
Sales for the Chrysler Corporation were estimated by Ward's at 14,300 cars and 18,200 light trucks. Chrysler discloses its sales on a monthly basis.
The Honda Motor Company was the only member of the Japanese Big Three to show an increase over last year. Honda's car sales rose 60.8 percent, to 12,245 cars, in early August. Honda said the increase might reflect pent-up demand for the Accord model, which was in short supply in July.
The Nissan Motor Company's car sales fell 13.4 percent, to 1,704, while truck sales rose 3.3 percent, to 2,372. The Toyota Motor Corporation's car sales fell 13.8 percent, to 7,391.
The Mazda Motor Corporation's car sales fell 31.4 percent, to 1,114. Meanwhile, the Mitsubishi Motor Corporation's car sales more than doubled, to 1,814, and sales of Subaru cars, which are made by Fuji Heavy Industries, rose 47.6 percent, to 822.

HEADLINE: BANKS IN U.S. SHUN A LOAN TO MOSCOW

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
American banks have not put up any money to finance Soviet purchases of American grain, despite the Bush Administration's efforts to facilitate such loans.
No American banks participated last month in a $600 million loan to the Soviet Union for grain purchases, even though the United States guaranteed repayment of almost all of the principal and half of the interest, banking and grain industry executives said. 
 Despite the Government loan guarantees, American bankers said that they were worried about the declining ability of the Soviet Union to pay its bills and that their own financial problems had limited their ability to make loans to anyone. Eventually four European banks stepped forward to make the loans, reportedly under pressure from their governments. The loans have an adjustable interest rate that is initially set slightly below 7 percent.
 
Believed to Be a First
 Agriculture Department and banking officials said they could not recall a previous instance in which a major guaranteed agricultural-export loan had been claimed entirely by foreign banks.
The absence of American banks is likely to embarrass the Administration, which certified the Soviet Union as creditworthy when it arranged the guarantee. It also spells further trouble for the crippled and shrinking Soviet economy, which desperately needs foreign loans and investment to try to make itself competitive in world markets. In essence, the European banks are charging the Soviets the equivalent of an interest rate exceeding 20 percent on the very small portion of the loan that is not guaranteed by the United States.
The situation could be a vicious circle for the Soviet Union if a disappearance of loans deprives it of the foreign currency needed for imports, which are needed to keep the economy running and creditworthy.
"Declining industrial imports feed back into declining output," said Joseph S. Berliner, a professor emeritus of economics at Brandeis University who has been studying the Soviet economy since 1950.
Some American banks did discuss the loans with Soviet officials, but the Americans wanted even higher interest rates than what the Europeans got, bank executives said. Now, if the Soviet Union defaults on these loans, American taxpayers will end up reimbursing the European banks.
 
A Sharp Increase
 Banking officials said that for a $1 billion guaranteed loan last year the Soviets paid three-eighths of a percentage point above the short-term rate at which banks borrow from each other. For the $600 million this summer, the margin increased to almost one percentage point, so that the profit margin for banks between their rough cost of borrowing money and the interest rate they charge has nearly doubled. The six-month international interbank lending rate is currently at 5.94 percent, and the Soviet loans carry an interest rate adjusted every six months to account for changes in this rate.
The higher rates reflect a calculation by the banks that the Soviets might not repay the loans. If the return on the guaranteed portion of the loan is calculated at the current rate for comparable borrowing by the United States Government and if the considerable extra processing costs of agricultural loans are excluded, then the Soviet Union is paying an interest rate of more than 20 percent on the 2 percent of principal and several percentage points of interest that it is obtaining on the strength of its own creditworthiness.
Government-guaranteed loans for countries buying American agricultural products are not new; nor is allowing the Soviet Union to use this financing mechanism when it buys American corn and wheat.
But after the United States found itself stuck in recent years with $2 billion in guaranteed agricultural loans to Iraq, Congress imposed tighter rules last year on who was eligible for such guarantees. The new rules require that the President certify the creditworthiness of any nation before it can qualify for the borrowing program, but the rules set no guidelines for determining creditworthiness.
Therein lies a problem. Although the Soviet Union has paid back other such grain loans, its fast-deteriorating economy has led many in Congress and outside to see it as a problem credit. But the Bush Administration wants dearly to promote continued Soviet purchases of American agricultural products. In the weeks leading up to last month's economic summit meeting, the Administration was also seeking ways to help the Soviet Union even while opposing any program of direct government aid from the leading industrial nations.
 
Giving Guarantees
 Over some opposition, President Bush granted a Soviet request for $1.5 billion in loan guarantees on June 11, certifying at the time that the Soviet Union was creditworthy.
The first $600 million worth of guarantees was given to Moscow immediately, with another $500 million scheduled for October and a final installment of $400 million planned for February. The guarantees state that if the Soviet Union defaults on a loan covered by the program, the United States will repay 98 percent of the principal plus the first 4.5 percentage points of interest on that 98 percent of the principal.
But American banking and Agriculture Department officials say the Soviets quickly ran into difficulties in finding banks willing to lend.
"There is significant risk that's uncovered" by the government guarantee, which includes only half of the interest payments on such a deal, said a top trade-finance executive at a large American bank. "None of us want to smash our balance sheets."
 
Request Reportedly Denied
 
 
Soviet officials asked for the guarantee to be raised from 98 percent, which is the standard for countries with credit problems, to 100 percent, said an Agriculture Department official who insisted on anonymity.
The Administration turned down the request. "As long as you're able to place those loans, albeit with European banks in this case, there's no inclination to raise it," the senior Administration official said.
Executives at several American banks said they were reluctant to lend not only because of concerns about creditworthiness, but also because of the heavy paperwork involved in government guaranteed loans, their own weak capital bases, and a desire to limit their already considerable holdings of similar loans to other countries.
American banks lent money to the Soviet Union under a $1 billion export loan guarantee last year. But continued upheaval in the Soviet Union has led to growing worries about a possible default. "Nobody would like to explain to anyone, including your own kids, why you didn't anticipate something drastic would happen," an American bank official said.
The American branches of four European banks agreed to lend the money instead. The Banque Nationale de Paris agreed to lend nearly $300 million; London-based Barclays Bank, $150 million; Rabobank Nederland of Utrecht, the Netherlands, $100 million; and Paris-based Banque Indosuez promised about $60 million, officials at those banks said.
 
Paid Out Periodically
 The loans have a maturity of three years and are disbursed periodically as each shipment of American agricultural products is sent. Because pieces of these loans are often resold to other banks, American banks could later participate in the loans indirectly if they change their minds.
The Agriculture Department does not receive the paperwork from banks until after the grain is actually shipped, and department officials said they did not know who had made the loans.
American bankers contend that the European banks came under pressure from their governments to make the loans. Western European governments have been more worried than Washington about the potential for civil disorder and large-scale emigration from the Soviet Union, and have been lending the nation huge sums at concessionary rates.
European bankers mostly deny that political considerations played a role. "This was an independent assessment," said Sharon C. Delezenski, the senior vice president in charge of trade finance and commodities and Wall Street lending at Banque Nationale de Paris, which is owned by the French Government.
But another European banker took a different view. "I was mildly surprised that anybody would take Soviet risk," said the banker, who insisted on anonymity. "It's not an obvious risk to take."
The United States loan guarantees also have the unusual effect of subsidizing European banks in their efforts to establish relationships with American exporters, he added.
Finding lenders for the remaining $900 million may prove difficult if conditions in the Soviet Union do not improve, an American bank official said. Ms. Delezenski said her bank had agreed to lend no more than $300 million of the entire $1.5 billion package, only to find that Moscow wanted to use almost all of this money for the first installment.
Some Latin American countries had trouble borrowing even with guarantees from the United States when their debt problems were most severe in the early 1980's.
Some members of Congress were critical of the guarantees before they were given in June, and the role of the European banks is likely to draw criticism when Congress returns next month from its recess.
"This shows what we were saying all along -- they're not creditworthy, and this is a giveaway to the Soviet Government and a taking away from the American taxpayer," said an aide to Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey.
But a senior Administration official responded that the participation of European banks showed that the Soviet Union could still borrow if it paid a high enough interest rate.

WITH the BankAmerica Corporation having agreed to buy the Security Pacific Corporation, attention in California banking circles is shifting to a deal that has not yet happened: an acquisition of First Interstate Bancorp by Wells Fargo & Company.
Wells Fargo and First Interstate have not given any firm indication that they are interested in a merger, and it is unclear whether the two companies have even held any discussions. But many analysts, investors and industry executives say a deal is almost a sure thing, if not immediately then in the long run, in response to BankAmerica's agreement, announced Monday, to buy Security Pacific for $4.4 billion in stock. 
 Wells Fargo and First Interstate, California's third- and fourth-largest banking companies, need the economies of scale that would come from a merger in order to compete with the combination of BankAmerica and Security Pacific, the state's two largest banks. That, at least, is the reasoning offered by proponents of such a deal.
But any deal would hold perils as well as opportunities for both Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, and First Interstate, based in Los Angeles.
First Interstate has been plagued for years by a staggering level of troubled loans, and despite vigorous efforts by the company to identify and work out the problems, it is far from certain that there are not more nasty surprises lurking in its portfolio. Last month First Interstate reported a loss for the second quarter of $80.3 million, in contrast to a profit of $95.1 million in the 1990 period. The loss was caused primarily by a $295 million provision for loan losses, $159.8 million more than the company was forced to set aside for loan losses in the first quarter.
Wells Fargo is stronger financially and is considered to be better managed. But there have been troubling signs in the last few months that its loan portfolio, too, could hold some big problems. In the second quarter, the company had a sharp rise in problem loans, many of them to companies that did leveraged buyouts in recent years, and it also remains vulnerable to further weakening in the California commercial real estate market.
As a result of the loan problems, Wells Fargo's earnings fell sharply in the second quarter, to $14 million, or 21 cents a share, from $232 million, or $4.40 a share, in the second quarter of 1990.
Still, analysts think the logic of a deal will ultimately propel the companies together.
"It's a transaction that makes a tremendous amount of sense," said Thaddeus W. Paluszek, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company.
The main impetus to a transaction would be the chance to cut operating costs by reducing corporate staffs and eliminating redundant branches and back-office operations like data processing. The merger of BankAmerica and Security Pacific, for example, would allow the banks to cut $1 billion a year from operating expenses over the next three years, the companies projected; the savings in a Wells Fargo-First Interstate combination would be lower but still substantial, analysts said.
 Carl E. Reichardt, Wells Fargo's chairman and chief executive, has a reputation as the industry's most aggressive cost-cutter. (He once eliminated the budget for the Christmas tree on an executive floor at the company's headquarters.) First Interstate, despite considerable progress in the last year under its chairman, Edward M. Carson, remains highly inefficient by comparsion.
Wells Fargo, with assets of $55 billion, spent $940 million on general and administrative expenses in the first six months of the year, said James Hanbury, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Company. First Interstate, with assets of $50 billion, spent $1.3 billion in the same period.
A deal in which Wells Fargo bought First Interstate would also give Wells Fargo First Interstate's 14-state, 1,051-branch network throughout the West and Southwest, instantly making the combined institution a dominant player not just in California, but in Texas, Arizona, Nevada, Washington, Oregon and other states. Big banking companies increasingly believe they must have huge regional networks to compete as banking slowly becomes a national business.
Unless it is battered by loan losses, something most analysts do not expect, Wells Fargo would have little trouble financing an acquisition. Its stock, which closed yesterday at $77.625, up $1.125, is well above the book value of $58 a share, meaning that buying First Interstate with stock would be financially attractive to Wells Fargo. First Interstate closed yesterday at $35, a share, down 12.5 cents;at that price the company would be valued at about $2.1 billion.
What remains unclear to outsiders is the chemistry between the companies, and in particular between Mr. Reichardt at Wells Fargo and Mr. Carson at First Interstate. Mr. Carson seems to admire Mr. Reichardt's style, at least as far as it entails running an efficient operation. But more than one bank merger has failed to come off when the top executives involved could not agree on their respective roles or on the roles of their respective management teams.

HEADLINE: Salomon Violations Detailed

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Salomon Brothers Inc. said yesterday that it had provided the Government with evidence that it had violated rules governing bids for Treasury bonds at the April auction. The disclosure followed its report last week of transgressions at three other auctions.
The firm also said that it had routinely overstated the quantities of Treasury securities it traded so that it could increase its chance of being allocated enough of each new issue to satisfy all its customers. It pledged to discontinue the practice. 
 Salomon also said a committee of independent members of its board would be appointed shortly to review the situation.
 
Facing Lawsuits
 Salomon already faces private lawsuits from traders in securities markets who contend that the leverage Salomon had over bond prices as a result of its activities cost them money.
Salomon noted yesterday that it and various employees also faced possible criminal fines and sanctions. Under the securities laws, the sanctions might include suspending or banning Salomon from acting as a broker-dealer or primary dealer in Treasury securities, but there is no indication that the Government currently plans such a step.
Salomon is one of the three largest firms in the Treasury securities market, where $115 billion worth of issues are traded daily. At the end of last year, $2.2 trillion in Treasury securities were outstanding.
 
$1 Billion Practical Joke
 The announcement included surprising details on the extent of the previously disclosed violations, including an admission that a managing director whom it did not name caused the firm to make an unauthorized $1 billion bid in the name of a customer at the February auction as part of a practical joke on a fellow employee. Salomon said the managing director had been suspended.
Four men were suspended last week. They were reported to be Paul Mozer, the head of government bond trading; Thomas Murphy, a top deputy; Christopher Fitzmaurice, a trader, and Henry Epstein, a clerk. A Salomon spokesman declined last night to confirm the names of the suspended employees, but said that no new suspensions had taken place.
Yesterday's disclosures came on a day when Richard C. Breeden, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, told reporters in Washington that the actions of Salomon's powerful bond trading unit demonstrated that the "honor system" was not an adequate method of policing securities markets. The government securities market is far more lightly regulated than the stock market or commodities markets.
Some of the details in yesterday's announcement indicated that Salomon's bidding violations did not leave the firm controlling as large a percentage of the securities sold at the recent auctions as had been rumored. For example, although some reports suggested the company ended up with as much as 85 percent of the two-year notes sold at the May auction, Salomon said yesterday that the firm acquired 44 percent of the issue, just nine percentage points more than the allowable limit.
Salomon said two actions put it over the 35 percent limit in May. It bid $2 billion for a customer and then repurchased $500 million of the notes at the auction price; also, it held $497 million of the notes on a when-issued basis before the auction began. Those purchases came on top of its routine bid for the maximum 35 percent.
 
Questions on May Auction
 That part of the report did not address one of the most persistent rumors surrounding the May auction, namely that Salomon acted in concert with outside investors to control a much larger percentage of the notes and squeeze prices upward. Dealers said the price impact of Salomon's activity seemed more evident in May than in the other months in which, according to yesterday's report, Salomon actually went further over the 35 percent limit.
In December 1990, for example, Salomon bid the maximum 35 percent for its own account and, without authorization, $1 billion using a customer's name, leaving it with 46 percent of the four-year notes.
In February, Salomon submitted three bids for 35 percent of the five-year notes, two of which were unauthorized bids in customers' names. Salomon said yesterday it ended up with 57 percent of the notes. Salomon said that it ended up with 30.2 percent of the 30-year bonds that were involved in the practical-joke incident.
In the April auction of five-year notes, the firm exceeded the 35 percent limit by bidding the full amount for its own account and repurchasing $600 million worth of notes from a customer who wanted $1.9 billion of them. Salomon had bid for $2.5 billion in the customer's name to make sure that it would be allocated enough to fill the order.
Following Salomon's announcement, Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, likened the firm's actions to "high-stakes games of 'Jeopardy' being played with investors' and taxpayers' money." His subcommittee will be drafting proposed changes in securities laws this fall, which may include tighter rules for the auction and trading of government securities.
Louis Crandall, chief economist at R. W. Wrightson & Associates, said, "That kind of arrangement sounds almost Japanese," referring to recent scandals at Japanese securities houses.
Indeed, Wall Street is wondering whether the Government's desire to have Japan do more to regulate its markets may encourage it to come down harder on Salomon than it might otherwise have.
Questions about how far up the chain of command the problems ran remain unanswered. Salomon conceded in yesterday's announcement that John H. Gutfreund, its chairman and chief executive; Thomas W. Strauss, its president, and John W. Meriwether, a vice chairman, had all been informed by April of at least one transgression -- an unauthorized bid in February. But a decision to tell the Government was not carried out. Indeed, the Government was not told about that or any other rule violation until Aug. 9, when the Government was also told about the delay in reporting, Salomon said yesterday.

HEADLINE: Banking's Ultimate Goal;
Mergers Set Stage for National Operations And Perhaps a Healthier Financial System

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The recent spate of bank mergers, involving 5 of the country's 10 largest banks, has done little to correct one of the American banking system's greatest weaknesses -- the lack of geographic diversification that leaves banking companies vulnerable to regional economic downturns.
The weakness of New England's banking system and the problems before that in Texas have been widely attributed to a patchwork of state and Federal laws that limited banks in those areas to their local markets. If those banks had been part of a larger company, the losses from a local economic downturn could have been absorbed by other parts of the company, and the damage to the banking system would have been much less. The problems of New England and Texas are among the reasons the Treasury Department's banking-overhaul proposals would allow nationwide branching. 
 The largest American banks have long wanted a system similar to those in countries like Britain and Japan, with unlimited nationwide branching that allows banks to become much larger. In recent years that desire has come closer to being fulfilled as some states allowed out-of-state banks to buy local banks, and as Federal laws allowed out-of-state buyers to take over troubled institutions.
While bankers involved in the recently announced mergers say that diversification and nationwide banking are their goals, their immediate plans are more limited, aimed at solving today's problems.
Large banks are concentrating on their local markets, where the opportunity to cut duplicated branches, employees and computer centers can bring savings that quickly bolster profits. The BankAmerica Corporation, for example, sees $1 billiion in annual cost savings resulting from merging its operations with those of the Security Pacific Corporation.
But BankAmerica officials say the merger with a former California competitor does not mean they have abandoned their goal of becoming a truly national bank -- a goal they pursued unsuccessfully earlier this year when they tried to leapfrog across the country and buy the Bank of New England. But Fleet/Norstar Financial Group of Rhode Island submitted the winning bid for the bank.
Executives at the Chemical Banking Corporation, which acquired the troubled Texas Commerce Bank in the late 1980's, have said they will consider national banking plans, but only after they have put their own house in order following Chemical's merger with the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation early next year.
For NCNB, based in Charlotte, N.C., plans for a national bank are clear from the new name -- Nationsbank -- that it announced at the time it disclosed plans to acquire Atlanta-based C&S/Sovran, whose scope of operations is not much greater than NCNB's existing business.
 
A View From Newark
 "The quickest, most dependable savings for banks come from mergers within their own or contiguous markets," said Anthony Terraciano, chairman of the First Fidelity Bancorporation of Newark. Mr. Terraciano, who has been acquiring branches and deposits of failed savings insitutions in New Jersey and raising capital from a Spanish bank while First Fidelity heals its wounds, added that "over a reasonable period of time the consolidation trend will lead to diversification."
"But there will be an interim period," he continued, "when the consolidation appears to result in increased concentration."
Edward E. Furash, a Washington bank consultant, said, "What we are seeing now is just the first stage of merger mania, where large institutions use cost savings to strengthen themselves so they can better withstand the economic shocks in the regions they operate."
The diversification so far, Mr. Furash said, has been by product lines not geography. For example, NCNB becomes a bit more consumer-oriented with the acquisiton of C&S/Sovran, while BankAmerica becomes stronger in corporate-processing businesses like cash management, where Security Pacific does well.
 
A Matter of Efficiency
 Geoffrey Nicholson, a director at the Boston Consulting Group, said that when banks began creating national branch systems, they would be looking for new kinds of benefits, not the quick cost savings that come from merging with neighbors. Outside their local markets, he said, "the efficient banks will be looking for less-efficient banks which can be improved and operated more profitably with a change in ownership."
Some analysts have estimated that mergers of banks in different markets could still produce cost savings equal to 10 percent to 20 percent of the non-interest expenses of the acquired bank. These would include less spending for top executives, legal advisers and advertising.
Also, they noted, advances in communications and computers foster consolidation of operations. NCNB, for example, has shifted back-office processing to a low-cost site in Dallas far removed from its banks in the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida, but close to its large Texas bank subsidiary.
With about 10,000 banking companies and 12,300 banks, the merger trend clearly has far to go. Only a handful of companies have managed to spread a significant part of their business outside their region, and their efforts to expand are still opposed by thousands of banks in small towns that see little opportunity in diversification. For them, the lack of diversification is a penalty they willingly accept for the privilege of keeping other banks out of their market.

HEADLINE: It's Thursday in the Park With Paul

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
This is what Ken Harlin did at lunchtime yesterday: Checked the weather forecast for today. (Humid, with a chance of thundershowers.) Looked at the sky. (Hazier by the minute.) Changed his mind about spending last night in Central Park. (Some New Yorkers will consider doing anything for a good seat at tonight's Paul Simon concert.)
Almost anything, anyway, which is why Mr. Harlin set his alarm clock for 6 A.M. and planned to head for the park as soon as he got up. Mr. Harlin -- who is 44 years old and says he has attended "every single New York Philharmonic concert and Metropolitan Opera performance in the park for the last 15 years, even when it rained" -- said he would stake out his territory and plant the red-and-yellow flag he made during Mr. Simon's last concert in the park, with Art Garfunkel, in 1981. 
 "This is a New York event," said Mr. Harlan, the supervisor of the circulation and reserve section at the Columbia University East Asian Library, "and it's free."
Like so many New York events, the logistics defy logic, or what passes for logic in mind-slowing midsummer. For the Simon concert, scheduled to start between 7:15 and 7:45 P.M. on the Great Lawn, there will be 150 extra cellular phones in the park, not to mention 160 portable toilets, a portable hospital and a 50-foot tower for television cameras that also has an observation deck for the police.
There will also be the biggest backstage setup the Parks Department says it has ever seen and, above the stage, a 15-by-30-foot television monitor so the crowd can see what Mr. Simon and his 17-piece band from seven countries are up to.
Cable-television viewers can see what that are up to, live, beginning at 7 P.M., on HBO. Radio listeners can hear them on more than 200 stations from coast to coast, adding millions to the inevitable crowd estimates. Mr. Simon will have no opening act, but he will be introduced, by Mayor David N. Dinkins. The concert is expected to last two and a half hours, a spokesman for Mr. Simon said.
Already, the suspense is building among municipal record-keepers: Will more people turn out than turned out for the New York Philharmonic (800,000 on July 5, 1986)? Will the throng match the one that heard Simon and Garfunkel (400,000 on Sept. 19, 1981)?
 
Even Rehearsals Draw
 "That was the most amount of people I'd ever seen," Mr. Simon said before a rehearsal last night. Even his rehearsals are well-attended: more than 1,000 people lolled on blankets and settled into folding chairs.
The figures do not include the only-in-New-York attempts at demonstrating influence. "Everybody and his and her grandmother is calling me for tickets," said the Parks Commissioner, Betsy Gotbaum. "It's a free concert. I'm not a ticket agent. They say, 'What, the Parks Commissioner doesn't have tickets?' It's a nightmare."
There were 675 V.I.P. tickets, fewer than used to be set aside for previous concerts because the big backstage setup gobbled up the space for 325 V.I.P. seats. The 675 have long since been given away, but Mrs. Gotbaum's phone is still ringing. "I hate it," she said.
Economists preach that there is no such thing as a free lunch, and even a free concert has a price. Stewart Desmond, a Parks Department spokesman, said HBO was paying the costs of the production. He said the company was donating $400,000 to the Parks Foundation to cover the city's expenses, estimated at about $150,000 on overtime for police, sanitation and parks workers. The rest will be spent on parks programs around the city.
Mr. Simon will be taking his music to the park tonight. (The rain date is tomorrow.) The Parks Department, the Emergency Medical Service and the police will be taking their cellular phones, and there are also 20 emergency call boxes in the park that use cellular hookups. Nynex Mobile Communications, which provides cellular service, installed a special antenna on Belvedere Castle so the phones can all get dial tones at once if necessary.
The police say additional officers will be assigned to the park, and city officials hope their presence will keep the evening from turning into a rerun of a Diana Ross concert in July 1983. Bands of young people robbed fans leaving the performance. More than 30 people were arrested and at least 40 were hurt.
Mr. Simon said before last night's rehearsal that he expected no problems tonight. "The city is so conscious of the black eye we all took because of that," he said, referring to the 1983 concert. "That's part of what the $400,000 goes for."
For some, the only worry was getting a seat. David Randall, a 19-year-old college student, showed up last night with an inflatable mattress and 40 sheets. The mattress was to sleep on, though he ended up taking it to a friend's apartment nearby rather than sleeping in the park. The 40 sheets were placeholders for friends who wanted to attend the concert.
"I like Paul Simon," he said. "I just haven't memorized all his lyrics yet."

HEADLINE: White Canarsie Resident Charged In Group Attack on a Black Man

 BODY:
A white unemployed mover was charged yesterday in the slashing of a black man in a playground in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn earlier this month. The attack was one of 14 bias-related incidents in Canarsie since July 1, the police said.
The suspect, Richard Ferrente of 2125 Rockaway Parkway in Canarsie, was identified by the victim from a police lineup yesterday evening, the police said. 
 Mr. Ferrente, 26 years old, was charged with second-degree assault, aggravated harassment and violation of the city's civil rights law. He will be arraigned today in Brooklyn Criminal Court, the police said.
Detective Capt. Richard A. Ward said the police were looking for three other men in the incident. He said Mr. Ferrente did not wield the knife in the slashing but had pushed the victim, Michael Mark, to the ground and yelled racial epithets at him while Mr. Mark was with his 4-year-old daughter.
Captain Ward said Mr. Ferrente and his companions had attacked Mr. Mark "because he was black."
Mr. Ferrente and the three other men had spent the evening of July 31 drinking beer in the playground of Public School 272 in Canarsie, Captain Ward said. About 3:25 A.M. on Aug. 1, he said, Mr. Mark -- who lives in the East New York section of Brooklyn but was visiting his mother in Canarsie -- and his daughter passed by the playground at Seaview Avenue between East 99th and East 100th Street.
Captain Ward said the four men began "yelling racial slurs" at Mr. Mark until they reached East 102d Street near Avenue N, where Mr. Ferrente pushed Mr. Mark to the ground. Then, Captain Ward said, another man cut Mr. Mark with a razor. His daughter was unharmed.
Mr. Mark was treated at Kings County Hospital Center for a six-inch gash on his arm.

The Perils With a New Folk Hero

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW

 BODY:
JOHN DALY, the new glittering golfer, may be hazardous to your health, and to his own, and with dangerous ramifications that could reach even into our gross national product.
John Daly is now hailed as a folk hero because he performed a kind of miracle by winning the Professional Golfers Association Championship on Sunday. 
 He is Cinderella Man: he was the last player entered in the tournament -- in fact, he was originally the ninth alternate, as the world now knows, and got into the field of 151 only when another golfer dropped out at the last moment because his wife was going into labor. So Wednesday night John Daly (Arkansas-born) jumped into his car in Memphis and drove fast for seven and a half hours and found himself Thursday afternoon playing on a formidable course in Indiana he had never seen before, and shot 69.
Daly is 25 years old and a rookie on the PGA Tour, and now he is being linked with people like Jack Nicklaus and Lee Trevino -- whose first tournament victories were, like Daly, in a major championship -- and Jack Fleck, another former miracle worker, who as an unknown beat Ben Hogan in a playoff for the 1955 United States Open championship (and was rarely heard from again).
Few people had known of Daly before last week, when he took the lead on the second day of the P.G.A. Championship and kept it to the final, tearful, Mother Goose end.
Just last month, in fact, he said he was nearly broke. "I'm young and I'm hungry," he said. "Basically, I'm starving."
At the P.G.A. Championship, in which there was a $230,000 first prize, he was walloping the ball for cosmic distances. And he played so fast that on Sunday one of his drives nearly hit the score-bearer in the group ahead of him. He plays like Mike Tyson fights -- Tyson is so eager to do damage that he runs into the ring without even putting on socks. (Daly wears socks, but at the P.G.A. he didn't appear to have time to tie his shoe laces properly, and retied them at almost every tee.)
But now to the really dangerous aspects about Daly. For one thing, there's the swing, a huge, powerful thing that subverts the adage of "hit it easy." Ray Floyd, a former P.G.A. winner himself, said: "My back got sore just watching him."
Golfers are odd people. As soon as they see something that may work for someone else, they start fooling around with it, too; pros and amateurs alike.
"On Monday, a woman who I give lessons to started swinging with her elbow higher than normal," said Don McDougall, the club pro at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club in Southampton, L.I. "I asked what she was doing. She said, 'I want to hit the ball like John Daly.' I said, 'Please, let's get that elbow back down a little, O.K.?' "
Not only can a new swing begin to throw everyone off their game -- golfers are forever studying the intricacies of every muscle twitch in their stroke -- but it can throw their necks and backs and hips out of whack, too. Even John Daly is vulnerable: What happens when he really starts to age and becomes, say, 28?
So we have medical reasons for not copying John Daly's style, as well as psychological ones. Golfers ponder too much, anyway, and golf has probably put more people on the couch than even, as we say in the love game, relationships.
Daly also distorts the genteel elements of the old game. Daly gave his caddie, Jeff (Squeaky) Medlen, an assignment in the P.G.A. Each time he handed Daly a driver, Squeaky was instructed to squeak, "Kill!" This inspired Daly. He is known to his peers as Wild Thing and Macho Man and, naturally, Killer.
And what a hazard Daly-imitated play would present for those who own homes along the golf course. Golf balls, as in a P. G. Wodehouse story, would crash through their windows like never before. Picture the consternation at a tea party: "Excuse me, madam, but I'm bunkered in your piano."
Daly, born in Dardanelle, Ark., is a self-taught golfer. A few years ago a pro suggested that he modify his swing. Daly looked at the man with the disdain you save for someone who moves his shadow across your putting path. Absolutely not, Daly told the pro. Yet if everyone who waggles a golf stick stopped seeking advice, imagine the effect on the economy.
Golf pros, golf videos, golf books and magazines -- an entire instructional industry would unravel like a cheap suit. People would be jobless. Crime might increase. There would be a general drain on everyone.
Sure, John Daly's a great rags-to-riches story, and yes there's a refreshing joy to his big, bold game. But there are also the potential dangers to society of this exciting noncomformist. From here on, he must be watched very closely.

Checketts Counting On Ewing Back at Center

BYLINE: By SAM GOLDAPER

 BODY:
Forget the talk of Patrick Ewing's possible escape from New York via the trade route.
Dave Checketts, the Knicks' president, said yesterday that he expected Ewing to be the starting center when New York opens its National Basketball Association season on Nov. 1 against the Magic in Orlando, Fla. 
 "Patrick is a Knick and we expected it would be that way before he filed for arbitration and after it," said Checketts, speaking at a basketball charity event in Manhattan. "It's not like everyone is waiting around outside the teepee to see if the peace pipe has been smoked. Life goes on. He's our center. In all our talks, he has never given me any indications that he wants to be traded, not before the arbitration and not after it."
 
Silence From Ewing
 Ewing has remained silent on whether he wants to stay a Knick since an arbitrator ruled on July 29 that he was one of the league's four highest-paid players as of June 1 and thus ineligible to become a restricted free agent. After the arbitrator found in the Knicks' favor, Checketts said that if Ewing wanted to be traded, he would try to accommodate him. But after Checketts's latest statement, it matters little since Ewing has four years remaining on his contract. The important thing now is whether Ewing comes back as a happy or an unhappy Knick.
Checketts can make him a happy Knick by re-opening negotiations for a contract extension. He did that before Ewing filed his arbitration grievance on June 21. He offered to add two years to Ewing's contract and rocket his salary to an average of $5.4 million a year, making him the highest-paid player in team sports.
Ewing rejected the deal and the offer was withdrawn when Ewing filed for arbitration. Negotiations could start again. They might even be going on now during Ewing's silence.
"Checketts and I have maintained an open dialogue since he became the Knicks' president in March," David Falk, Ewing's lawyer-agent, said yesterday. "Patrick is the New York franchise and we're working behind the scenes to resolve the issues in a way that will be beneficial to both parties."
Checketts confirmed that he had spoken with Falk several times, even as late as yesterday morning. Although both sides presented their cases to Daniel Collins, the arbitrator, Checketts said he had "dropped Patrick a note."
"At some point we will have a conversation when Patrick is ready," Checketts said. "Meanwhile, we're getting on with life and I hope he is."
Asked if he was concerned about Ewing's image being soured because of the issues over the last several months, Checketts said: "Yes, but people tend to forget. This has been a summer of discontentment with the recession and unemployment and people find it difficult to understand why Patrick turned down so much money."

 
 
REBOUNDS
 DAVE CHECKETTS said he did not expect any problems signing GREG ANTHONY, the top draft choice. "Every team is so tight under the salary cap," he said, "and the agents know how much money there is out there for a team to spend." . . . The Knicks added a Patrick to their roster, signing PATRICK EDDIE, a 6-foot-11-inch center from the University of Mississippi, who averaged 9.7 points and 8.1 rebounds in the Los Angeles Summer League. . . . The trading of JAMES EDWARDS from the Detroit Pistons to the Los Angeles Clippers Tuesday is expected to stand despite threats that he would not report for his physical examination but play instead for a team in Bologna, Italy. "A player under an N.B.A. contract may not play in Europe until his contract has expired," said GARY BETTMAN, the league's general counsel. "Mr. Edwards is under contract through the 1991-92 season."

HEADLINE: Alaska Offers Californians An Additional Water Spigot

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 14

 BODY:
California gets two-thirds of its gasoline from Alaska, so why not water also?
That, in essence, is the proposal Gov. Walter J. Hickel of Alaska brought to Southern California today to solve this parched region's water problems. "We have an awful lot of fresh water," he said. "Can we get it down cheap enough? That depends on how thirsty you get." 
 Governor Hickel wants to build a pipeline to pump water 2,000 miles down the Pacific Coast, supplying nearly 10 percent of California's current water use. It has drawn fire from environmentalists, who maintain that it would not only cause environmental damage in Alaska but also encourage California to continue to waste water.
 
'A Thirsty Vampire'
 "For years, California has acted like a thirsty vampire," said Robert Hattoy, regional director for the Sierra Club. "Building a pipeline would be like putting a faucet in a blood bank."
Still, few water experts have entirely dismissed the notion. The Office of Technology Assessment, a research arm of Congress, has begun a preliminary study of the pipeline's feasibility at the behest of two lawmakers from California and one from Alaska, and held a workshop here today at the Los Angeles County Hall of Administration.
One of the lawmakers, Representative Edward R. Roybal, Democrat of California, is sponsoring a bill to authorize a more thorough study.
If ever undertaken, the project would be an engineering feat comparable in ways to digging the Panama Canal.
The pipeline would carry water from the mouths of one or two of Alaska's great rivers, the Stikine and the Copper, which disgorge billions of gallons of fresh water annually into the Pacific Ocean, and funnel it down the coast and then overland to Lake Shasta in Northern California. From there, the water would flow through the State Water Project to Southern California and possibly to other states as well.
 
Cost Estimate: $110 Billion
 According to a preliminary study prepared by Fluor Daniel, the California-based engineering firm, the project would require four undersea aqueducts and land-based pumping stations every 150 miles along the coast. It would cost $110 billion and take 15 years to build.
Most at today's session agreed that the plan was technically feasible, but there was much doubt its economic or political feasibility. It would probably require substantial Federal aid, changes in Federal and state laws and agreements with Canada.
After all that it could then fail if Californians find a cheaper way to obtain additional water. The staff of the Office of Technology Assessment found that the pipeline was neither needed nor economically feasible.
Though not new, the notion gained new life recently after conversations between Governor Hickel and Kenneth Hahn, a veteran Los Angeles County Supervisor. "The big question is what will happen to California if we do not have water," Mr. Hahn said. "Will it become a desert again?"
 
Trillion Gallons a Year
 Harold C. Heinze, Alaska's Commissioner of Natural Resources, said the pipeline would carry about a trillion gallons a year, a little less than a tenth California's current demand.
He and Mr. Hickel said the project's environmental effects would be minimal because the water would be drawn only at the rivers' mouths and would constitute only half a percent of the water discharged in southeast Alaska.
Mr. Heinze said that for its part Alaska would gain jobs for building and maintaining the pipeline and money that would be used in part to provide safe water supplies and sewerage to 30,000 to 50,000 rural Alaskans. He cited no specific income figures.
Many at the workshop doubted that California needed to import water.
The five-year drought has forced new thinking about water allocation, with many arguing that California has plenty of water if it makes more efficient use of it. Already, efforts are under way to store more water, to reclaim waste water, to conserve, to desalinate and to shift more water away from farming to urban uses.
"I do not believe we need to divert more water from other states," said Christine E. Reed of Santa Monica, a member of the board of the Metropolitan Water District, the politically powerful agency that distributes water to 15 million people in Southern California.
 
Call for Conservation
 Both Mr. Hattoy of the Sierra Club and Tom Cassidy of American Rivers, a Washington-based environmental group that focuses on rivers, said California should concentrate on conservation. They asserted that the estuaries and wetlands at the mouths of Alaskan rivers were prime fishing grounds that might suffer from changes in salinity caused by the project.
"The Copper River delta is one of the most productive waterfowl habitats in the world," Mr. Cassidy said in an interview, adding that it was "offensive" to sell this river water "to the highest bidder."
Mr. Hattoy said the pipeline would bring roads, housing and other industrialization associated with its construction through hundreds of miles of mostly undeveloped coastline. "We are not just downhill from Alaska," he said.
But economic rather than environmental realities are probably the greater threat. While California's population continues to grow, the question is how can pipeline water compete with local water that studies suggest could cost 10 times less for urban users.
Mr. Hickel said new technology, along with economies of scale, could reduce the cost. "We are here saying this might be a solution," he said.

HEADLINE: Richard A. Snelling, 64, Is Dead; Governor of Vermont for 9 Years

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Gov. Richard A. Snelling of Vermont, a Republican who blended fiscal conservatism and concern for the environment during nearly nine years in office, died Tuesday night at his home in Shelburne, Vt., just south of Burlington. He was 64 years old.
 Mr. Snelling's body was found by his state police driver near his pool about 8 A.M. yesterday. 
 Dr. Paul Morrow, the State Medical Examiner, performed an autopsy yesterday afternoon and later reported that the Governor had died of cardiac arrest resulting from hardening of the arteries. Mr. Snelling died about 12 hours before his body was found, Dr. Morrow said.
The Governor's chief of staff, Elizabeth Edwards, said Mr. Snelling's associates did not think he had suffered any previous heart problems.
At 3 P.M. yesterday, Lieut. Gov. Howard Dean, 42, was sworn in to fill the rest of Mr. Snelling's term, which ends in January 1993. Dr. Dean, a Democrat who teaches medicine at the University of Vermont, had been Lieutenant Governor since 1987. In Vermont, the governor and the lieutenant governor are elected independently, and the lieutenant governor's position is part time.
 
Death Termed 'a Real Shocker'
 Among those mourning Mr. Snelling was a Democratic predecessor, Philip Hoff, who said: "His governorship in the last year came at a propitious time. We needed a person in that office who was a fiscal conservative while at the same time recognizing human need."
In an appearance in Pittsburgh with Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, President Bush said: "It's a real shocker. He was a good man and a good Governor of his state."
Mr. Snelling, a self-made millionaire, had barely begun his fifth two-year term. He had served four terms from 1977 to 1985, and decided to run again last year because of concern for the state's economic health.
Most of his energy in the last five months was devoted to balancing the budget. At his urging, the Legislature passed the largest tax increase in Vermont's history, more than $90 million, while imposing deep cuts in programs.
 
'Constantly on the Move'
 "Mr. Snelling is not the kind of Vermonter who waits for the sap to start running in the maple trees," a reporter for The New York Times once wrote of the Governor. "He is constantly on the move. He flies his own plane and plays tennis aggressively, despite a knee injury he got while playing football at Harvard."
Richard Arkwright Snelling was born on Feb. 18, 1927, in Allentown, Pa. After attending the University of Havana and Lehigh University, he served in the Army in 1945 and 1946. In 1948 he earned a bachelor's degree from Harvard University.
Mr. Snelling moved to Vermont in 1953, settling in Shelburne, where he founded Shelburne Industries, a manufacturer of ski equipment that made him wealthy. In 1959 and 1960 and again from 1973 to 1976, he served in the Vermont House of Representatives.
He was elected Governor in November 1976. Admirers praised his record of attracting industry to the state.
In 1978, after a large court award against a ski resort, Mr. Snelling signed a bill establishing in law what had long been believed in a state where the ski industry is vital: skiers are responsible for their own safety.
 
Concern for the Environment
 And in a state where land use and the environment are also constant concerns, he opposed a plan to allow mining for uranium and barred the sale of phosphate detergents, which pollute water by fostering the growth of algae.
In 1981 and 1982, Mr. Snelling served as president of the National Governors' Association. In that role, he tried to cooperate with President Ronald Reagan's New Federalism, under which about 35 Federal programs were to be turned over to the states. The concept, Mr. Snelling said, was akin to the New England town meeting, making sure government stays close to the people.
But he forcefully objected when Mr. Reagan did not offer Federal financing to support those programs and imposed budget cuts placing additional burdens on the states. He called the President's approach to cities and states "an economic Bay of Pigs."
Mr. Snelling is survived by his wife, Barbara; two daughters, Diane, of Hinesburg, Vt., and Jacqueline Mansfield of Washington; two sons, Mark, of Richmond, Vt., and Andrew, of Sterling, Ill., and seven grandchildren.

HEADLINE: The Stick Congress Gave Castro

 BODY:
Once again Fidel Castro has caught Washington off guard, lowering the minimum age for foreign travel from 60 to 20 years. This has opened floodgates for an illegal exodus of Cubans -- and created a painful dilemma for Americans:
Having regularly censured him for reining Cubans in, how can critics now condemn him for letting them out? 
 The game has a further twist. Cuba's new boat people, lancheros in Spanish, automatically obtain the right to settle and work in the United States under a special law that applies only to Cubans.
The newcomers merely need to make themselves known to the Immigration Service to obtain a right for which other foreigners must wait years. And the same Cuban Adjustment Act also applies to as many as 30,000 Cubans who have illegally overstayed their tourist visas. Thus Mr. Castro is beating on America with a stick Congress gave him -- meanwhile ridding his island of potential troublemakers.
Efforts to repeal this dated law have been torpedoed by lawmakers from Florida who are moved by concern for the state's large Cuban community. But if Congress does not quickly plug this hole, a million Cubans may well sail right through it.
Cuba's desperate economic situation drives this new migration. Typically, Cubans are allowed only two bread rolls a day and barely a pound of meat a week. This is the result of wretched planning, loss of trade with no-longer-Communist Eastern Europe and dwindling aid from a Soviet Union whose leader Mr. Castro despises.
There is some truth to claims that Mr. Castro's revolution has provided low-cost housing, free medical care and schooling. But so has democratic Costa Rica. With fewer resources, it has made comparable social gains and done so without enduring a one-party tyranny under a dictator for life. Rather than generate wealth, Cuba rations poverty.
Small wonder that requests for tourist visas have swamped the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, forcing it to suspend further applications after issuing 40,000 visas. Small wonder, too, that Cuban youngsters, endlessly exhorted to choose Socialism or death, respond by braving shark-infested waters in little boats.
The result is the biggest exodus since the Mariel boatlift in 1980 that sent 125,000 Cubans to southern Florida, including felons spitefully released from prison. Most of the Marielitos have resettled successfully but it took years of frustrating negotiations to repatriate the criminal remnant. One such trauma is enough.
The Cuban Adjustment Act makes America turn an unjust face to the rest of the world, giving Cubans preference over Haitians, Salvadorans or people from all other countries. And it gives Fidel Castro the power to push, send or dump whomever he wishes to the United States. Such a law is difficult to explain and impossible to defend. Its repeal will be an early order of business when Congress comes back to work.

The Broad Impact Of the Gulf War

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
IT'S been a year since Iraq invaded Kuwait -- and half a year since the United States and its coalition partners defeated Iraq in a land war that lasted 100 hours. This seems like a good time to assess the effects of the Persian Gulf war on the American economy.
This was a unique war in American history in terms of its effect on the budget and the economy, both because it was fought out of inventories and because America's allies paid for the war, at least in the short run. Indeed, the United States made a "profit" on the war during the fiscal year 1991, which ends on Oct. 1. 
 Total pledges from coalition partners to the United States came to $54 billion. Thus far, the amount received has been $46.6 billion, of which $41.8 billion was in cash and $5.4 billion in kind, especially fuel. The Office of Management and Budget expects that by the end of this year, cash contributions will reach $48.2 billion, bringing the combined cash-and-kind grants to the $54 billion pledged.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that United States incremental costs for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm came to $15 billion. Hence, with cash receipts expected to total $48 billion this year, it says the United States will have received $33 billion more than the incremental costs of the war this year.
However, Richard G. Darman, director of O.M.B., has testified that the total costs to the United States of stopping Iraq were $61 billion, implying that American outlays exceeded foreign contributions by at least $7 billion. But the Darman figure includes transfers from already budgeted military outlays to the gulf operations plus estimated future costs of replacing equipment lost in the war.
One issue is how much lost equipment should be replaced, given American plans to scale back military expenditures. The inflow of foreign capital not only offset America's budget costs but also helped reduce the United States balance-of-payments deficits. America's foreign balance swung from a $23.4 billion deficit in the fourth quarter of 1990 to a $10.2 billion surplus in the first quarter of 1991.
The gulf crisis either triggered or aggravated the American recession. Just before the invasion, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned of the dangers of recession and said the Fed was prepared to ease credit, if necessary, to prevent a recession. But other economists said, before the crisis erupted, that the Fed had been too tight and was endangering a weak economy.
But when Iraq's invasion came, the Fed did not ease off, caught between uncertainties of whether to fight the looming recession or an inflation aggravated by climbing oil prices. The oil shock of 1990 proved much less severe than the two oil shocks of the 1970's. After the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti supplies, oil prices initially soared from a pre-invasion average price around $18 a barrel to slightly above $40 by the late fall. But they fell back to roughly $21, as greater shipments came in from other producers, and world oil demand lagged.
Still, some industries were hard hit. The airlines saw the cost of jet fuel, which had been 60 cents a gallon before the invasion, soar to $1.40 a gallon by mid-October. Even after fuel prices began to ease, the outbreak of a ground and air war created a severe reenue problem for the airlines because traffic fell. Trans-Atlantic traffic dropped 50 percent.
The gulf crisis hurt consumer confidence and snagged business spending on new plant and equipment. The slide into recession, together with the steep costs of bailing out the savings and loan associations, deepened the Federal budget deficit. The Congressional Budget Office this week estimated that the budget deficit in the coming fiscal year would reach $362 billion, up from $279 billion in the fiscal year 1991. The ballooning deficit will come down painfully slowly, and it aggravates the nation's savings, investment and growth problems.
Symmetrically, Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, says, as the gulf crisis tipped the economy into recession, its end helped stop the recession and start the recovery. The council is forecasting 3.6 percent real economic growth in 1992. The Congressional Budget Office puts next year's growth rate at 3.3 percent, and the consensus of private economists polled by Blue Chip Economic Indicators sees 2.7 percent growth next year.
Even with a slower-than-usual recovery, the expected swing in inventories from an annual rate of decline of $30 billion in the final quarter of 1990 and the first half of 1991 to a positive rate of $20 billion in inventory building, required to maintain existing inventory-to-sales ratios, would give the economy a $50 billion lift. And, with the gulf war fading into memory, and fears of inflation shrinking, the Fed is freer to nourish the recovery with easier money and credit.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Rose 3.7% in July

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
The housing industry continued its slow but steady recovery in July, with construction of new homes and apartments rising for the fourth straight month, the Commerce Department said today.
Housing starts rose 3.7 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.07 million units. The increase, which was better than analysts had expected, followed revised gains of 5 percent in June and six-tenths of 1 percent in May. Starts rose 7.7 percent in April. 
 In addition, applications for permits to build new houses -- a measure of future activity -- rose for the sixth month in a row.
 
A Lackluster Recovery
 The housing industry, which has been in a long and painful slump, has been leading the economy out of a recession that began in July 1990, analysts say. But the housing recovery, like that of the overall economy, is far less vigorous than the rebounds from other recessions.
"It's great to have a recovery, but this is not a really robust one," said Dave Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders.
Underscoring that point, the regional pattern of housing starts was mixed, with construction dropping in both the Northeast and the Midwest.
Nevertheless, the last time housing starts nationally rose for four straight months was more than a decade ago, from July to October 1980.
"These numbers are a good sign that the housing sector is still on track," said Tom Holloway, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.
"That's particularly important at this juncture because the overall economic recovery has been fragile at best, and it needs all the help it can get from the housing sector," he said.
 
A Forecast of Weakness
 The weakness of the economy was underscored by a report today from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which said that the recession probably ended between April and June but that unemployment would remain high, averaging 6.7 percent this year and 6.2 percent in 1992. The unemployment rate in July was 6.8 percent.
The forecast raises the question of whether there will be enough job opportunities to insure sufficient income growth to create a durable economic revival.
Since January, when housing starts sank to an annual rate of 847,000, their lowest level since 1982, the monthly pace of construction has bounced back 26 percent, encouraged by lower interest rates and stronger consumer confidence.
But Mr. Seiders of the home builders group said that for all of 1991 he anticipates only about 1.05 million new houses will be started. That would be the weakest performance in 45 years, since 1.02 million starts in 1946. Housing starts peaked in 1986 at about 1.8 million units.
Rates for 30-year mortgages are now down to about 9.25 percent while adjustable-rate mortgages can be found as low as 7 percent, Mr. Seiders said. Most of the strength in housing is in single-family homes, he added.
 
One Indicator Is Up
 Applications for building permits increased in July by three-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of one million units, after a 3.4 percent rise in June, pointing to more increases in construction activity ahead.
Permits for single-family homes were up 1.5 percent, to an annual rate of 792,000 units in July. Permits for apartments fell by 4.1 percent, to a rate of 210,000 units.
The last time permit applications rose for six straight months was between February and July 1983, as the economy was emerging from the 1981-82 recession.
Construction dropped 27 percent in the Northeast, to a rate of 106,000 new houses a year, and also fell in the Midwest, by 4.5 percent, to a rate of 235,000. The decline in the Northeast, however, followed gains of 27.2 percent in June and 22.6 percent in May, and analysts said a pullback from those levels was not surprising. They added that the May and June increases were a better reflection of the general improvement in the market.
In the big Southern market, starts climbed a solid 15 percent, to a rate of 448,000, and were up 11.5 percent in the West, to 281,000 units a year.
The actual number of new houses that contractors started in July was 105,400, up from 103,200 in June but fewer than the 111,200 that were started in July 1990, just as the economy was entering recession.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Holding a Library in Your Hands

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
If the Sony Corporation has its way, handheld computers will no longer be novelties. Sony, in its aggressive search for new markets, is preparing to introduce its own handheld computer, the Data Discman, that plays disks containing a shelf full of reference works. The company wants millions of consumers to punch these devices for, say, an encyclopedia entry on asteroids, the proper spelling of accommodate, or the right wine to serve with veal.
Several much smaller companies have tried for years to build a market for such products, with only limited success. The Franklin Electronic Publishing Company of Mount Holly, N.J., has sold more than four million palm-sized computers, but is still struggling to make a profit. The entrance of a company with the technical and marketing prowess of Sony will provide the first real test of the consumer's appetite for portable information devices. 
 The introduction of the Data Discman will also be the first big test for the new Sony Electronic Publishing Company and its 29-year-old president, Olaf Olaffson. The group, formed in April, is under pressure to insure that a compelling selection of electronic books will be ready in time to insure the Discman's successful introduction for the Christmas season.
 
Disputes Over the Disks
 But the company is still squabbling over contracts with the outside developers who will create the reference material for disks. Some developers say the contract delays are likely to push the introduction of the Data Discman back until next year, although Mr. Olaffson said the project was on track. Contracts for 20 titles have now been signed, he said.
Sony's product does have a distinct advantage over the single-purpose devices on the market. Like a compact disk music player, the Data Discman can play different disks, allowing a single machine to serve as encyclopedia, dictionary and wine guide. But the electronic Bible made by Franklin, for example, delivers only the Scripture; you cannot pop in a cartridge that lists baseball statistics. Franklin and other competitors are planning to introduce models that will play different cartridges.
Several advances have made the palmtop computers possible. Engineers continue to shrink electronic components. The price of computer memory chips has fallen dramatically in recent years. Morton E. David, chief executive of Franklin, said the cost of memory in Franklin machines was declining by about 30 percent a year, to $7.50 for each machine, from $48 a few years ago.
Franklin's products range in price from $39 for a spell checker to nearly $400 for an electronic encyclopedia. Sony has been selling a $450 Data Discman in Japan for about a year, and the product is expected to cost about that much in the United States. The disks are likely to cost $30 to $50.
The devices are far easier to use than personal computers and require no technical expertise. The machines are operated by miniature keyboards with simple command keys. Can't recall the name of one of mythology's worst scoundrels? Type the phrase "Norse god of evil" into the Franklin encyclopedia and press the enter key. The name Loki, and a short description of his treacheries, pops up on the screen in a fraction of a second.
To keep the machines portable, the screens are fairly small. Franklin's encyclopedia displays about 50 words of text at a time. Many schools are buying the devices as learning aids.
The handheld computers are currently intended for consumers, but both Franklin and Sony are contemplating business uses. A stock analyst could have volumes of Standard & Poor's reports on one of the machines. An accountant could carry volumes of regulations in a pocket.
For some uses, the electronic devices will replace books, Mr. David of Franklin said. "In five years, the paper dictionary will be the anomaly," he said.
Franklin has fended off assaults from other large consumer electronics makers. In 1989, the Smith Corona Company brought out a poorly designed product that sold slowly. The company quietly retreated from the market.
 
Created the Market
 Franklin has transformed itself from a bankrupt maker of Apple computer clones into the leader of the small but growing $140 million market for handheld reference devices. Franklin effectively created the market in 1986 with a spelling corrector.
In the fiscal year ended March 1991, Franklin had sales of $54 million and lost $5 million. Mr. David and analysts attribute the loss to weak economic conditions and the price cutting necessary when Smith Corona liquidated its inventory to leave the business. Analysts predict the company will be profitable this year.
Franklin now has nearly 20 different models of computers. Its most sophisticated offering, an electronic encyclopedia introduced this year, costs about $400.
 
Sony's Move Called Helpful
 After withstanding the competition from Smith Corona, Mr. David maintains that Sony's looming presence does not concern him. "There is this perception that it is a great threat to Franklin, but I see it a great boon," Mr. David said.
He explained that retailers who will have prominent displays for the Sony product will surround them with cheaper Franklin devices. "I think it will result in the sale of a lot of Franklin products," he said.
Paul Elliot, an analyst with Cowen & Company in New York, said Sony's entry would lend the entire category legitimacy, aiding Franklin. Franklin, he added, already has plenty of material to install on the machines. "Sony doesn't sell these products yet and Sony has to get the data bases," he said.
The flexibility of Sony's product is expected to give it an important edge. But Mr. David of Franklin said that within 18 months his company would introduce its own device to play multiple titles. In a recent interview, Mr. David showed off the prototype of a device that will hold separate, removable cartridges containing different programs.
Without such flexibility, Franklin and other electronic publishers, like Selectronics Inc. in Pittsford, N.Y., "will go the way of the dinosaur," said one publishing executive. Selectonics, which is under financial pressure, sharply scaled back its operations last month.
Texas Instruments and Seiko also offer spell checkers and similar devices, but appear to have far less ambitious plans than Sony.
 
Bumpy Road to Market
 Sony has sold 70,000 to 100,000 of its palm-sized computers in Japan in little more than a year, industry executives said. Sony will say only that sales have been better then expected.
Despite Sony's size and sophistication, there are signs that the Data Discman's road to market has not been smooth. Mr. David of Franklin said his friends at Sony had told him that the company was divided over the wisdom of introducing the Data Discman. For Sony, the technology is relatively dated. The Discman is powered by an 8-bit chip -- less powerful than the chips used to drive the latest video games. Sony executives have privately demonstrated a more advanced version of the product, dubbed the Bookman, which has a bigger screen, animation and audio capabilities.
For Sony, the danger is that what the electronics industry calls "pro-sumers," the eager consumers who rush out to buy new technology, will be upset if their Data Discmans are outdated in 18 months. Sony executives say that the market has room for both machines, and that the Data Discman will pave the way for more advanced portable information devices.
 
Signs of Tension Seen
 Publishing executives, who asked not to be identified, said they also saw signs of tension between Sony's hardware and software executives. One publisher said that if Data Disc faltered because of a lack of good software from Mr. Olaffson's group, "there would be fireworks and celebration at Park Ridge," the site of Sony's hardware group.
Mr. Olaffson and Mike Vitelli, president of personal audio products, the Sony unit handling the hardware, denied reports of internal strife. Mr. Olaffson also played down the pressure on his group, saying, "I sleep at night."

HEADLINE: Dow Slips From Early Gain, Losing 6.94

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The stock market yesterday repeated its pattern of recent days, scoring impressive gains in the morning but sliding back at the close.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been perched just above 3,000, closed below that barrier, and even secondary stocks, which had shown strength throughout the week, finally fell. 
 "You have to expect some profit taking, especially after the run they had," Gene J. Seagle, director of technical research for Gruntal & Company in Stamford, Conn., said of the secondary issues.
The Dow, after jumping 16 points in early trading, traded in a narrow range most of the rest of the day before finishing at 2,998.43, off 6.94. Weakness was also felt on the broader market, as the New York Stock Exchange composite of all Big Board stocks fell 0.25, to 213.38.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.57, to 389.33, while the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter issues declined by 2.01 points, to 515.67. Traders on the American Stock Exchange fared better, as the composite index rose 0.21, to 367.99.
 
Moderately Heavy Volume
 Volume on the Big Board was a moderately heavy 174.7 million shares, down from 212.7 million yesterday. Advances led declines by a slim margin, 792 to 782.
Mr. Seagle noted that yesterday's market lacked leadership and was affected by several factors. One, he said, was dealers adjusting their positions ahead of today's "double witching hour," the simultaneous expiration of stock-index futures and options contracts.
"Then there is the Salomon Brothers situtation, which has affected the market psychologically," he continued. "There was the afternoon disruption of program trading and not much coming from bank stocks, which had been one of the cores of this week's strength. A modest increase in housing starts for the month of July had no apparent impact."
Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trades, said three of the day's four program sells came in the afternoon, with the net effect being a decline of 15.67 in the Dow.
 
Pressure on Salomon
 Shares of Salomon Brothers, which have been under pressure since last week over disclosures of irregularities involving bids at certain Treasury auctions, fell 4 3/4, to 26 7/8, in heavy trading. Other brokerage stocks fell yesterday, including Merrill Lynch, down 3/8, to 41 7/8.
Black & Decker rose 3/4, to 16 7/8, after the toolmaker said it would privately sell 150,000 shares of convertible preferred stock to the Newell Company, a consumer hardware concern, for $150 million. Shares of Newell fell 1 1/8, to 38,
General Electric, accused by the Justice Department of defrauding the Pentagon of more than $30 million on the sale of jet engines to Israel, fell 3/8, to 72 5/8.
Motorola rose 3/8, to 68 3/8, as Lawrence Hassis, a Kemper Securities analyst, rated the company a long-term buy based on a pickup in profitability by the fourth quarter and 1992.
 
New T2 Medical Shares
 T2 Medical fell 2 7/8, to 61 7/8, as 390,000 shares of previously restricted stock became available on Wednesday. The company said the stock was used two years ago to buy a physician-owned medical center.
Storage Technology, which has a merger pending with XL/Datacomp, fell 2 3/4, to 44 1/4, as it received a downgrade from Stephen Cohen, an analyst with the Soundview Financial Corporation.
UAL, where flight attendants for United Airlines are about to vote on a tentative labor contract, rose by 2, to 139 1/2.
Ricky Harrington, director of equity investments for Marion Bass Securities in Charlotte, N.C., said yesterday that stocks and bonds, which have been rising in tandem lately, were likely to go their separate ways shortly, leaving stocks in a difficult position.
"If the economy continues to grow at a mild pace, there may be a short decoupling where both markets go off in different directions," he said. "But if the economy begins to slip back under, the decoupling would be a long one. The verdict may come in the fall."
Right now, he added, the market seems to be saying that it believes the economy will make the recovery.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Report on Starts of Housing Helps to Push Dollar Ahead

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished higher yesterday against most major currencies as an encouraging report on United States housing starts outweighed the effects of a long-awaited rise in German interest rates.
The Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, increased the nation's discount rate a full point, to 7.5 percent, and the Lombard rate a quarter-point, to 9.25 percent. 
 The rate rise would tend to weaken the dollar against the German mark as investors seek more marks to buy higher-yielding German securities. But traders said that while the dollar stalled somewhat in the morning, it improved later.
"All this rate hike business has been built into the price the past week or so," said Kevin Lawrie, director of foreign exchange at the Bank of Boston. Against the German currency, the dollar rose more than a pfennig in New York yesterday to close at 1.7490 marks, up from 1.7375.
On the other hand, the Labor Department's housing starts report was "remarkably better than expected, so the dollar started to stabilize a bit," Mr. Lawrie said.
The 3.7 percent increase was the fourth consecutive monthly advance -- the longest string of monthly advances since July-October 1980, the Government said. The report suggested a slow but steady recovery from the recession.
The housing news and the dollar's rise could indicate a shift in investor attitudes toward lower United States interest rates, which could tend to weaken the dollar, said Walter Simon, a vice president at Bank Julius Baer & Company.
"I think people are beginning to think that maybe lower interest rates mean a better chance for a better recovery, therefore a stronger dollar," he said.
He predicted the dollar would continue gaining strength over the next eight months or so, as the economy strengthens.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 136.59 yen, up 0.19 yen from Wednesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 136.08 yen, while in New York, it was quoted at 137.05 yen, up from 136.50 yen.
In New York, the British pound finished at $1.6720, down from $1.6860 Wednesday. Earlier in London, the pound rose to $1.6870, up slightly from $1.6860 late Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Wednesday, included: 1.5355 Swiss francs, up from 1.5222; 5.9490 French francs, up from 5.9095; 1,310.75 Italian lire, up from 1,301.25, and 1.1436 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1432.
In precious metals trading, gold for current delivery in New York fell 80 cents a troy ounce to a late bid of $357.00 on the Commodity Exchange. And the Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid of $357 a troy ounce, down 60 cents from late Wednesday.
Earlier in London, gold prices rose to a closing $358.35 an ounce, from $356.90 an ounce late Wednesday, and to $357.80 in Zurich, up from $356.50 late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Security Prices Mixed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed in light trading yesterday, as traders took profits by selling long-term bonds but continued to buy shorter-term issues.
Prices, which have risen for the better part of two weeks, continued to rise during overnight trading in Asia and later in Europe, but selling began after the Government announced that housing starts rose by a stronger-than-expected 3.7 percent in July. The rise was the fourth in a row in a sector that in the past has been an important element in previous economic recoveries. 
 A report from the Labor Department that initial unemployment claims edged up in the week ended Aug. 3 softened the impact of the housing data somewhat. But with a weekend approaching, dealers were in a mood to pare their positions.
"The housing starts data were a reminder that things don't point universally in the direction of lower interest rates," said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. "And once bond yields get in the vicinity of 8 percent, the market seems to get tired. That is basically what happened today."
The announcement late Wednesday that provided further details about Salomon Brothers' activities in the government securities market was a major topic of conversation yesterday.
 
Reviewing Salomon Relationship
 Based on the most recent disclosures, some money management firms said they were reviewing their relationship with Salomon.
"Anybody who works in Treasury securities is going to have some contact with Salomon at some point, and we have been dealing with them since the firm was founded in 1971," said Randy Merk, a vice president at Benham Capital Management in Mountain View, Calif., a firm with around $5 billion in Treasury securities under management.
"What has happened on the Treasury side is unfortunate," Mr. Merk added, "and we have decided to review whether or not we will cut back our Treasury business with them."
Bloomberg News Service reported that the Pacific Investment Management Company in Newport Beach, Calif., a firm with $32 billion in fixed income assets under management, was also reviewing its relationship with Salomon.
But others said they expected to continue doing business with the firm.
"What happened is astounding, shocking, unbelievable," said Marshall B. Front, an executive vice president at Stein, Roe & Farnham, a Chicago-based investment advisory firm with close to $10 billion in fixed income assets under management.
"But as misguided as their behavior appears to have been, they have been and continue to be a firm with unusual expertise in the Government bond market. Unless they are stopped from doing business, which I doubt, we will continue to do business with them."
Traders said the selling pressure that appeared yesterday had nothing to do with worries about Salomon's future in the Government securities business.
 
Secondary Securities Market
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 100 14/32, down 10/32, to yield 8.08 percent, up from 8.06 percent late Wednesday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered late yesterday at 100 10/32, down 5/32, to yield 7.82 percent. But demand for the 6 7/8 percent two-year notes remained strong, and the issue rose by 1/8 point, to a late offered price of 101 3/32, to yield 6.27 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates rose slightly.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.27 percent, down one basis point, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by two basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.31 percent.
Issuance of new investment-grade corporate debt remained heavy yesterday.
Among the issuers was the Tenneco Credit Corporation, which offered $250 million worth of 10-year notes through an underwriting syndicate led by the First Boston Corporation.
The 9 5/8 percent notes were priced at $99.566, to yield 9.693 percent, 1.90 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The notes, which are noncallable for life, are rated Baa-2 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Capital Cities/ABC Inc. offered $250 million worth of 30-year bonds through an underwriting group led by Salomon Brothers.
The 8.75 percent securities, which mature Aug. 15, 2021, were priced at $99.10, to yield 8.836 percent, 75 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021.
The securities are rated A-1 by Moody's and A-plus by Standard & Poor's.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Aug. 5.
M-2, the monetary aggregate most closely monitored by the Fed, posted a modest $1.2 billion increase during the week. Still, the rise was enough to prevent the aggregate from falling below the 2.5 percent rate of growth the Fed has set as the low end of its target growth range for M-2 this year.
The money report had no impact on prices in the credit markets. Analysts said the numbers were not likely to provide any additional weight to speculation that the Fed may decide to ease monetary policy further when members of its policy-making Open Market Committee meet in Washington on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: On a March to Hartford, Jackson Rallies Crowds

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: MERIDEN, Conn., Aug. 15

 BODY:
It had taken two days to cover the 20 miles from New Haven, 20 miles of hot pavement lined with factories and warehouses, car dealerships and fast-food restaurants, tire stores, tanning salons and kung fu schools.
People had come out to watch: A half-dozen salesmen and yard workers from Colony Lumber in Wallingford. The salesmen and mechanics from Century Toyota. Construction workers. An elderly couple in front of their house on hot, straight Route 5, which had not seen so much excitement, they said, since the neighborhood store had a big lottery winner. 
 Coming into this city of 59,500 on Wednesday afternoon, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the more than 200 marchers behind him found crowds along the streets. The pace picked up. New people stepped in line. The chanting rang louder: "Rebuild America! Keep hope alive!"
Small, low-key, but curiously in tune with the unsettled state of Connecticut, Mr. Jackson's "Rebuild America" march from Bridgeport to Hartford began its fifth day today as he and his group set off for a nine-mile hike through rural Berlin into the city of New Britain.
 
A Friendly Reception
 Except for the drivers trapped in the traffic behind the marchers, the reception is friendly and welcoming for the marchers, whose goal is to call attention to the social and economic ills in this wealthy state's cities and towns. People are not sure why Mr. Jackson is here, but he seems to be doing something. And these are times when they think someone should, indeed, be doing something.
On the steps of City Hall here, Mayor James L. Pellegrini stood next to Mr. Jackson and said, "This is the one person in the country right now who is championing the cause of the city."
Drawn by the distress signal that Bridgeport sent up when it tried to file for bankruptcy protection, Mr. Jackson's National Rainbow Coalition has found in Connecticut a handy-sized demonstration project. The state's economy is deep in recession, with real estate, banking and insurance badly wounded, and its large military contractors threatened with thousands of layoffs.
Its three largest cities, Bridgeport, Hartford and New Haven, are among the nation's poorest, but their budget problems are shared to some extent by the rest of the state's cities and suburbs, rich and poor. The state government is without a budget, six weeks into its fiscal year.
 
'A Piece of America'
 "If this is the wealthiest state, with a manageable-size population," Mr. Jackson said, "think of those states with more population and fewer resources."
"This is a kind of biopsy, a piece of America."
The immediate goal is unlikely to bear fruit: On Saturday a final rally at the State Capitol in Hartford will call on the legislature to convene a special session to address the needs of cities and towns on issues from affordable housing to tax relief to education. The General Assembly has been in special session since June 6, trying unsuccessfully to reach agreement on a budget.
But the longer-term goal is almost by definition vague, embracing and, in a time of economic uncertainty, always appealing: "The purpose of our march is to mobilize the people to fight for change," Mr. Jackson told a rally in Meriden.
 
'Educate Our People'
 In a populist appeal to common-sense fairness, Mr. Jackson asked the crowd at day's end: "If we can fight a $50 billion war to bail out Kuwait City, what about New Haven?"
If sending someone to Yale costs less than sending him to jail, "We choose Yale over jail. Educate our people."
And so people have come out to watch as the police motorcycles and patrol cars clear the way. A lumber salesman said, "He's trying to do something." A Toyota salesman: "The state definitely needs the help Jesse can give."
Bob Weug, who had walked the entire way from Bridgeport with a group of homeless veterans from Stamford, said, "Those other countries have their problems, but good grief, don't we have our own?"
 
Chant as the Message
 Asked the marchers' message, Dorothy Durgan of Meriden gave a typical response, repeating the chant, "Rebuild America!" Her daughter, Melanie, gave another common answer: "We don't get a lot of things here, so this is exciting."
Sasha Natapoff, a member of Mr. Jackson's policy staff who helped organize the march, said: "If we march by and people really don't know what's going on, that's O.K. That's what the march is for. That's why we have signs. That's why we have chants."
But most people said the issue was jobs, and they were all for anything Mr. Jackson or anyone else could do about that. Passing some construction workers today, Mr. Jackson waved to them and said: "These people do not fit the stereotype of who identifies with us. These guys are Joe Sixpacks."
"A lot of people in towns and cities look at their problems and think it's just them," said Chris Donovan, a union representative with the Congress of Connecticut Community Colleges who helped organize the stop in Meriden. "This shows it's not an individual problem. It may be structural."

HEADLINE: Weekly Jobless Claims Show a Rise

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose in the week ended Aug. 3, after two weeks of declines, the Labor Department said today.
Some analysts said the rise confirmed a return to a sluggish economy after a brief spurt of activity in the wake of the Persian Gulf war. 
 A total of 408,000 people filed first-time claims for unemployment benefits in the week, the latest period for which data were available. That was a rise of 8,000 from the week before. Economists had expected about 401,000 new claims for the period.
Until the latest report, unemployment-claims numbers had generally been falling since they reached a peak in late March of 543,000, analysts said. "Labor market conditions are backsliding," said Robert Brusca, chief economist at the Nikko Securities Company International.
The latest four-week average was 409,250, up from 406,000 in the prior four-week period.
"We've seen the four-week average running between 403,000 and 409,000 for the past five weeks," said Stephen Slifer, senior economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc. "It looks like, after a rebound following the gulf war, suddenly it has plateaued."
The number of people actually receiving benefits under regular state programs rose to 3,315,000 in the week ended July 27, the latest period for which that figure was available. That was an increase of 30,000 from the prior week's seasonally adjusted revised level of 3,285,000, the department said.

HEADLINE: Quick Rebuff for New Weicker Tax Plan

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. gave the state some new budget and income tax proposals today that were almost immediately dismissed by lawmakers as unpassable. The plan broke a record for having the shortest lifespan yet -- about half a day -- among the dozens put forward over the last six months.
And the fiscal pace shows every sign of quickening. Legislative leaders said late in the day after a meeting in the Governor's office that Mr. Weicker had promised to veto any further attempts to keep the state running temporarily. Connecticut, now the only state without a budget in place, has been meeting its obligations since the July 1 start of the fiscal year by passing two-week resolutions while lawmakers struggled to reach a compromise over Mr. Weicker's effort to create an income tax.
 
3 Budgets, 3 Vetoes
 The leaders said that the threatened veto, which the General Assembly could probably not override, would force a vote on a full-year budget as early as Monday, though no one was at all sure what kind of budget lawmakers might be called to vote upon and whether forcing a vote would actually end the crisis. The current extension expires at 12:01 A.M. Monday, but Mr. Weicker has said he will keep the government running that day. 
 Since May the House and Senate have passed three budgets that would have resolved the state's revenue problems primarily by an expansion of the 8 percent sales tax. All were vetoed by Mr. Weicker, a third-party Governor who has insisted on overhauling the state's revenue system, saying he wanted to lower business taxes, stimulate the economy and make the tax rates more fair to the poor.
Mr. Weicker's new proposal was for a "piggyback" income tax, under which taxpayers would pay the state 21 percent of whatever they paid the Federal Government.
 
Marathon on Monday
 But even those legislators who support an income tax said yesterday that they do not support the new plan.
The Senate President, John B. Larson, a Democrat from East Hartford, said he be lieved there would be a push in his chamber instead for a plan that would tax the incomes of only the wealthiest residents, with the vast majority of taxpayers exempt. Such a tax has already been condemned by Democrats in the House.
Mr. Larson said that he expects a marathon session as early as Monday in which the Senate would take up one of the various budget bills that have already been drafted -- perhaps Mr. Weicker's, perhaps some other plan -- and propose amendments around the clock until some combination of good sense or exhaustion allows a budget to pass.
Both Mr. Larson and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Richard J. Balducci, a Democrat from Newington, said they strongly disliked the proposal made by Mr. Weicker today. And even the Governor seemed lukewarm about it in a morning news conference in his office.
"What is dangerous to the process is to have anyone go ahead and say, 'This is my plan, take it or leave it,' " Mr. Weicker said. "It's not my plan, it's a proposal."
The proposal would impose an income tax that would exactly mirror the Federal tax code, but with a smaller bite. The sales tax, now the highest statewide rate in the nation, would be lowered to 6 percent from 8 percent. The corporate profits tax would be lowered over two years from 13.8 percent, also the highest rate in the nation, to 10.5 percent.
The income tax formula would translate into a 1.6 percent state income tax for a family earning $23,800 in adjusted gross income, rising to 6.5 percent for the very wealthiest filers. Mr. Weicker initially proposed in February a flat 6 percent tax on adjusted gross income, which he modified in June to a progressive plan with a top rate of 6.75 percent.
Mr. Balducci said he favored a plan now before the House that would impose a 4 percent flat-rate income tax, with a 6 percent sales tax and slightly lower corporate taxes. Mr. Larson said he remains unconvinced about the wisdom of any income tax.
One of the handful of Republicans who have broken ranks with the party to support the concept of a wage tax, Senator Lawrence J. Bettencourt, a Republican from Waterford, also said he would likely oppose Mr. Weicker's most recent offering. But he said he remained open to other ideas that might be proposed on Monday.

HEADLINE: More Airlines Reduce Fares

 BODY:
Pan American Airways and Virgin Atlantic Airways yesterday announced lower fares on some international flights.
The announcements follow fare cuts by British Airways, American Airlines, United Airlines, Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines. 
 In response to a British Airways offer of 15 percent off some tickets, Virgin Atlantic said it would cut economy fares on trans-Atlantic flights by about 12 percent. Virgin Atlantic said fares from the United States to London would cost $449, down from $539, starting Sept. 15, and $359, down from $459, starting Oct. 15.
United Airlines said it would probably match Virgin Atlantic's new fares.
Pan Am is offering 25 percent off on flights to most of its destinations this fall. For those flights, passengers are required to buy tickets by Aug. 31 for travel between Sept. 1 and Oct. 26.
Pan Am, based in New York, said travel on those flights must originate in the United States and Europe to destinations in the United States, Europe, the Caribbean, Mexico and South America. The airline said the lower fares did not apply to the Pan Am Shuttle, which operates between New York, Boston and Washington.

HEADLINE: Soviet-Chevron Oil Venture Mired In Fears of Capitalist Exploitation

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 15

 BODY:
The largest Soviet-American business venture ever, a Chevron Corporation plan to develop huge oilfields in Kazakhstan, has become enmeshed in this nation's traditional fear of capitalism and the new muckraking of its free press, leaving President Mikhail S. Gorbachev pressing to get the deal back on track to reassure skeptical foreign investors.
The proposed 25-year, multibillion-dollar venture between Chevron and its Soviet partners in the rich Tengiz oilfields is being restudied and renegotiated at the highest levels of the Gorbachev Government after a series of critical newspaper articles that warn of capitalist greed exploiting Soviet resources under the guise of perestroika, Mr. Gorbachev's program of economic restructuring. 
 And people like former Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze are cautioning that the proposal for the oilfields near the Caspian Sea is being misunderstood at home while the world's business leaders follow it closely as a major test of whether the Government can stifle the old Communist bureaucray and make foreign investment inviting.
"It is no secret that the United States will judge our readiness to cooperate by the success or failure of this project," Mr. Shevardnadze wrote in a newspaper essay. He said that in his most recent trip to the United States, he found political and business leaders pointing to the proposed Chevron deal as a test of Soviet resolve to move toward market capitalism.
In endorsing the Chevron venture, Mr. Shevardnadze said Soviet skepticism was understandable since "it has been dinned into our heads since childhood that capitalists do nothing but rob other states by buying up their wealth for peanuts." But he wrote that the Soviet Government had invested two billion rubles in developing the Tengiz fields since 1979 "with no payoff at all" under a Communist system notorious for wasting resources and abusing the environment.
"Should we continue to 'develop' our natural resources in the same barbaric way or should we turn for help to knowledgable and skillful people equipped with advance technology and experience in running business and making profit?" he wrote, raising the Chevron deal to a prime test case of Mr. Gorbachev's vows to shed the past and find maximum profit in the nation's resources.
 
'Dirty Deal' Asserted
 His warning was carried this week in Moscow News, the freewheeling independent newspaper that has also focused on the privacy of the negotiations over the oil proposal, calling it a "dirty deal" that would mean a hundred-billion-dollar windfall for Chevron with the nation being "plundered and sold for a mere song."
Among other things, the controversy has apparently featured an odd tandem of opponents in the Kremlin bureaucracy disclosing critical internal documents to news reporters in an attempt to stop the plan. Chief among the documents were two Internal Ministry studies recommending against the proposal. President Gorbachev reportedly overruled those traditional ministry views in his determination to push the bureaucracy toward capitalist innovation.
A critical question is how foreign investors will fare as the nation tries to create a new union treaty and redefine power sharing between the republics and the central Government. Kazakhstan's authorities already are openly mistrustful of Kremlin officials in the Chevron deal and are vowing to take greater control of it.
Chevron officials, after gingerly complaining about press distortions and denying accusations that bribes had been paid to clear the way for the plan, have been declining to make further comments.
[A Chevron spokesman, Larry Shushan, said in a telephone interview from the company's San Francisco headquarters, "Because we are currently in negotiations, and negotiations are in something of a sensitive stage, we don't feel it's appropriate to comment on the status of the joint venture."
[In an interview published Aug. 5 by an industry trade magazine, the Oil and Gas Journal, the president of Chevron Overseas Petroleum Inc., Richard Matzke, said: "It would be a terrible mistake to imply that this thing has fallen apart. We've been hunkered down in the trenches the past month until the dust settled over events we don't think were really directly related to our project."
 
Dated Oilfield Techniques
 The proposed joint venture is generating attention not only for its large scope and potential profits but also for its attempt to create a pioneer business venture even as the Soviet economic rules are being rewritten in an environment of the greatest political flux.
One economic goal in this period is to decentralize authority to the republics, including Kazakhstan, yet leave the central Government in Moscow in a position to encourage credibility among outside investors. Still unknown is precisely how the central Government and the Kazakhstan Government might share in the Soviet profits from the proposal.
The Tengiz resources, which some specialists say could produce profits well in excess of $100 billion, beckon as the Soviet Government suffers increasing shortages of hard currency export profits, in part because of dated oilfield techniques that leave it unable to compete in the world market.
The deal may be no less important for the United States as an additional hedge against the power of the OPEC oil cartel in the volatile Middle East.
The latest negotiations involve Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir I. Shcherbakov, Mr. Gorbachev's chief executive for economic change. He said in an interview that, prompted by the Soviet leader's personal order to deal with the controversy, progress was again being made on a deal that has been pursued for four years across the prized Tengiz fields, which cover 8,900 square miles.
Mr. Shcherbakov said ministry opponents who had been quietly leaking their concerns to curious reporters were summoned to air grievances in negotiating fashion before Soviet supporters and Chevron officials in recent weeks, with a delegation sent to negotiate further with Chevron in the United States.
In one apparent result of the newspaper scrutiny, Mr. Shcherbakov said Mr. Gorbachev's Government now wanted "independent evaluators" to estimate the value of the Soviet investment in the joint venture, known as Tengizchevroil, whose oil extractions would be split 50-50. Chevron executives have said the Tengiz field holds two and a half times as much oil as Prudhoe Bay in Alaska.
Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of Kazakhstan, has been looking to the Chevron plan as the key to some elaborate marketeering plans. He said through his office that his "trust in Chevron remains complete," but that he, too, wants "independent evaluators" because he does not trust Moscow's experts.
While the details of the proposal have never been officially released, Moscow News quoted its sources as saying that the promised 50-50 split of development expenses and profits would prove "lopsided," with the Soviet partner contributing $850 million in equipment and expenses to make the fields work, and Chevron only $20 million, expertise and a $150 million loan.
But Kommersant, another independent weekly respected for its business coverage, reported the deal would involve more than $1 billion in foreign infrastructure investments in Tengiz within the first three years. The paper said Mr. Gorbachev ordered a feasibility study of the project in January 1990, and then four months later, shortly before meeting with President Bush, rejected a letter opposing the project from the Oil and Gas Ministry, the Government's traditional oil monopoly.
A protocol of intentions was signed in June 1990 to have Chevron be the partner in developing the Tengiz reserves, but the plan has not yet proceeded to registry with the Government. The deal includes the possibility of elaborate related development in Kazakhstan through the American Trade Consortium to use some of the hard currency profits to open medicine and food processing plants.
The consortium, which pursues joint ventures as a group, includes Chevron, Archer-Daniels-Midland, Eastman Kodak, Johnson & Johnson, RJR Nabisco and the Mercator Corporation, a New York merchant bank.
Mr. Shcherbakov said the latest negotiations were also re-evaluating the deal's potential profits and the ways of exporting this money, always a critical issue in joint ventures, as well as on the rather complicated refining methods required in the Tengiz fields, which some experts say might be twice as productive of the Siberian oil fields.
"We're dealing with a classic moving target," said one Western official familiar with the Chevron proposal. "The Soviets' learning requirements about capitalism is an enormous task after all the decades of fear and ignorance, and this is being amplified by the press demanding to know details of ongoing business negotiations."
The official also noted the difficulties of trying to work out a multilevel deal amid the assorted rivalries of two governments -- the center and sovereignty-hungry Kazakhstan -- and of Chevron's own home office, where basic concerns include the question of whether there will be enough political stability for long-term profits.
