HEADLINE: Excerpts From the Ethnic Press

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
DURING the past month, a newspaper aimed at the city's South Asian population reported on the diversification of the New York police force, a Chinese-language paper explored the heated rivalry among passenger van companies, a Pakistani paper publicized the mysterious death of a woman, and a Korean paper wrote about the reverse migration to South Korea.

The Colors of Blue: Police Dept. Diversifies 
Efforts by the New York Police Department to diversify the force may finally be paying off. The 2010 graduating class shows an increase in enrollment from minorities, including Indians and South Asians, who typically have an inherited distrust of the police. According to numbers provided by the department, the 2010 class of 1,147 recruits has a total of 203 (18 percent) recruits born outside the United States. Among them are six each of Indian and Bangladeshi origin and three of Pakistani origin.
The numbers did not include those of South Asian origin born in the United States or those from countries like Guyana (10) and Trinidad and Tobago (7) who could be of Indian descent.
Going by these numbers, it seems that suspicion may be waning and interest may be growing in a nontraditional career. And in choosing this career path, Indian-origin recruits may be helping the department improve its image on the streets of this metropolis.
''This recruit class is a true reflection of New York City,'' Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly told Desi Talk in a statement. ''They come from 51 countries and speak 47 languages.
''They've left behind careers in law, medicine and business because police work was their calling.''
ELA DUTT, Jan. 7 Desi Talk, aimed at the South Asian population, is published weekly and has a circulation of about 15,000.
Vans on Brooklyn's Eighth Avenue Battle Over Customers
The battle among small vans on Eighth Avenue in Brooklyn still has not been resolved peacefully. This month, three legally operated van companies on Eighth Avenue held a meeting with Precinct 72 to request that police strengthen enforcement against small vans that violate laws. ...
Wu Rong, an owner of a van company, said small van companies had been operating on Eighth Avenue for many years. In the past, to get more business and expand their territories, these companies caused much conflict. ...
In November 2010, the three legally operated van companies met with Officer Frank Siclari, the community relations liaison, to report the rampant problems. The problems were curtailed after police intervened, but soon after, other van companies arrived, and the problems started again.
''Recently, more companies, even those from Staten Island, came to Eighth Avenue to take away business,'' Wu said. ''Now, there are so many Chinese people living in Eighth Avenue. From Brooklyn to Chinatown, the routes between the two places are very popular. Many people are envious of the business.''

Death of Pakistani Woman In Queens Remains A Mystery
Nadia Saeed, a 40-year-old Pakistani mother of three, left her home at 8 a.m. on Jan. 4 for a morning walk. But she never returned. Her body was found that evening in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, near the Verrazano Bridge, several miles away from her Queens home. Family members said Nadia had moved back to Pakistan with her husband, Azhar Saeed, and their children, but they returned to the United States about three months ago to claim their American citizenship. They came to stay at a family friend's home on 241st Street and Hillside Avenue, in Bellerose, Queens. ...
The Police Department, which confirmed Nadia's death on Jan. 5, has not yet released any details.
THE PAKISTAN POST, Jan. 13 (Translated from Urdu by the New York Community Media Alliance.) The paper, with offices in Jamaica, Queens, publishes weekly and has a circulation of about 46,000.
Going Back to Korea
Mr. A., a former resident of Whitestone, Queens, who had managed a business in Flushing for over a decade, left the United States and returned to South Korea. No longer able to endure the long-term economic recession, he closed his business and left home. ...
The trend of reverse migration has increased in the New York Korean community recently, largely as a result of the continued economic downturn. New York Koreans who have returned -- or plan to -- are not just the elderly, who want to live out the rest of their days in the country of their birth, but also Korean businessmen, who see no other way than to give up their businesses.
Since 2010, the most outstanding aspect of this reverse migration is that it now includes Korean construction businessmen and workers, plumbers, electricians and metal workers. ...
According to experts in the local Korean construction industry, with the economic depression continuing for so long, the business has taken a direct blow, with contracts -- and, thus, jobs for plumbers, electricians, metal workers, among others -- rapidly dwindling. Added to this is the recent emergence of Chinese construction companies or businesses, some of which have been accused of price dumping, further weakening the Korean standing in the trade.

HEADLINE: Yearning for Respect, Arabs Find a Voice

BYLINE: By ANTHONY SHADID; Nada Bakri and Hwaida Saad contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- In Yemen, the chants invoked Tunisia, a continent away. A Lebanese newspaper declared that all of the Middle East was watching Egypt. A long-dead North African poet's most famous poem has become the anthem of a moment the most enthusiastic call revolutionary.
Since Sept. 11, 2001, conflict has pitted the West against the Arab world, as war in Iraq and Lebanon, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Bush administration's policies forged grander narratives of ''them against us.'' Last week, as more protests erupted in Yemen, Jordan and Egypt and as the United States remained largely on the sidelines, the struggle in the Middle East became firmly about ''us.'' 
For the first time in a generation, it is not religion, nor the adventures of a single leader, nor wars with Israel that have energized the region. Across Egypt and the Middle East, a somewhat nostalgic notion of a common Arab identity, intersecting with a visceral sense of what amounts to a decent life, is driving protests that have bound the region in a sense of a shared destiny.
''The experience of Tunisia will remain the guiding light for Egypt and may be so for people in Yemen, Sudan and the rest of the Arab world looking for change, with a readiness to accept risk, especially given that even the worst possibilities are better than the status quo,'' Talal Salman, the editor of Al Safir, wrote on Friday.
A chant in Egypt put it more bluntly, playing on the longstanding chants of Islamists that ''Islam is the solution.'' ''Tunisia,'' they shouted, ''is the solution.''
Unlike Eastern Europe, whose old order dissolved with breathtaking speed in 1989, Arab countries are distinct in their ideologies and governments, though they often share the same complaints of their citizens and some degree of support by the United States. But rarely has there been a moment when the Middle East felt so interconnected, governments so unpopular and Arabs so overwhelmingly agreed on the demand for change, even as some worry about the aftermath in a place where alternatives to dictatorship have been relentlessly crushed.
The Middle East is being drawn together by economic woes and a shared resentment that people have been denied dignity and respect. From Saudi Arabia to Egypt and beyond, many say, there is a broad sense of failure and frustration.
''After so many years of political stagnation, we were left with choices between the bad and the worse,'' said Fadel Shallak, a Lebanese writer and a former government minister. ''Now there's something happening in the Arab world. A collective voice is being heard again.''
As a unifying force, an older Middle East had the Voice of the Arabs, the wildly popular radio station of Gamal Abdel Nasser, Egypt's charismatic but repressive leader from 1956 to 1970. Its mix was oratory, propaganda and music, most memorably of Umm Kulthum, the iconic Egyptian diva. Today it is Al Jazeera, the news network, and though his popularity pales before the singer's, the Tunisian poet, Abul-Qasim al-Shabi, whose work has seemed to define the protests and their ambitions.
But even Al Jazeera has turned its gaze inward. Always provocative and critical of the United States and Israel, it has covered the Egyptian protests breathlessly, as it did Tunisia's, sometimes even egging the protesters on. It is joined by Facebook and Twitter, which have stitched together disparate places bound by a common language.
Egypt shut down Internet services in the country on Friday, in a remarkable demonstration of how powerful those tools have become. Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, reverted to a more old-fashioned tactic reminiscent of the feuds Nasser had with his Arab colleagues: he complained to the leader of Qatar, where Al Jazeera is based. The channel, he said, was aiding those ''seeking to ignite dissent.''
That is, no doubt, true. It describes, as well, Facebook and Twitter messages, some of which have turned into a 21st-century Middle Eastern version of agitprop.
On Facebook, a group in Jerusalem pledged support for Egypt and Tunisia. The Arab world, it said, ''is moving from darkness to light ... from dictatorship to freedom.''
The changes may have deep repercussions for the United States. Mouin Rabbani, an analyst in Jordan, said economic frustrations mirrored resentment at governments perceived as agents of the United States and its allies. In fact, a more democratic Arab world, given recent polling, is likely to be much more hostile to American policy.
But the preoccupation now is internal.
''Had they been able to resolve the underlying economic issues, people would have overlooked the corruption, the mismanagement, the autocratic rule,'' said Abdel Aziz Abu Hamad Aluwaisheg, a Saudi economist, speaking from Riyadh. ''But when they failed to do the bread and butter issues, people started looking at their governments.''
That may have forged an idea of common cause, where protesters in the most remote locales take their cues from like-minded people in faraway places.
In Tunis on Friday, a group of Tunisian protesters gathered outside the Egyptian Embassy in solidarity. ''Mubarak out!'' they chanted. A Lebanese newspaper quoted Tunisian activists offering this advice to their Egyptian counterparts: Protest at night, wear plastic bags to avoid electric shocks, wash your face with Coca-Cola to fend off the effects of tear gas and try to spray black paint on the windshields of police vehicles.
''I wish I could join them, and I wish these protests could get rid of all these regimes,'' said Mona Sibai, an Egyptian woman living in Beirut. ''I feel proud.''
Laith Shbillat, a veteran dissident in Jordan, said: ''People want their freedom, people want their bread. People want to stop these lousy dictators from looting their countries. I'd follow anybody. I'd follow Vladimir Lenin if he came and led me.''
Mr. Shbillat mentioned Shabi, the poet, who died as a young man in 1934. ''If one day, a people desires to live, then fate will answer their call,'' his most famous poem went. ''And their night will then begin to fade, and their chains break and fall.''
''He's leading us from his grave,'' Mr. Shbillat said.

HEADLINE: COLLECTING; Buyers Spread the Wealth in Arizona

BYLINE: By ROB SASS

 BODY:
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.
TRICKLE-DOWN economics has its detractors, but a rising tide did seem to lift all cars at this year's whirl of Arizona collector auctions.
A year ago, only the high end of the market seemed to have much life: collectors with ready cash mostly snapped up the rarest and best cars. Since then, the prosperity at the top has filtered down to the middle of the market. At the five major auctions that took place around Phoenix on Jan. 18-23, even entry-level cars did well, and prices seemed to firm up across the board.
What's more, buyers signaled a nascent market trend by enthusiastically bidding for unrestored cars in original, but well-preserved, condition. 
Bidders remained picky: the best cars in all price ranges found active bidders at strong prices, while lesser offerings continued to sell for what seemed, by recent standards, like bargain prices.
''Over all, the market seems quite stable, and there is even some spiking on certain cars taking place,'' said Charlie Goodman, a collector from San Rafael, Calif. ''It's getting harder for auction companies to feed the demand for high-quality cars, because people are holding onto these cars, seeing them as investments that can be enjoyed as well.''
Barrett-Jackson started the party with bidding on Tuesday, Jan. 18, with its usual policy of no reserves, meaning every car that reached the block went to the high bidder. As the Barrett-Jackson sale has evolved into a lifestyle event with gavel-to-gavel cable TV coverage, it has become a gateway for new collectors. The chief executive, Craig Jackson, said more than half of both bidders and consigners this year were first-timers at a collector car auction.
What could have been this year's high sale at Barrett-Jackson, a 1963 Pontiac Bonneville ambulance presented as the vehicle that carried President Kennedy's body from Andrews Air Force Base to Bethesda Naval Hospital, brought $132,000 (including the 10 percent buyer's premium) after its provenance was questioned. Before the sale, the buzz in Scottsdale was that the Pontiac could bring close to $1 million.
Barrett-Jackson's $70 million in sales were up 11 percent from 2010. The second-highest total was $35 million for Gooding & Company, and third place went to RM Auctions with $31 million.
At Gooding in particular, bidders responded strongly to unrestored cars. A 1931 Rolls-Royce Phantom II Henley Roadster sold for $935,000, a 1953 Fiat 8V Supersonic for $1.7 million and a 1962 Mercedes-Benz 300SL roadster for $951,500. All three were largely original, unrestored cars and all broke world auction records, exceeding by comfortable margins the established prices for meticulously restored examples.
RM also had several surprising sales, including a record-breaking $1.375 million for a pristine 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing. None of these graceful cars with roof-hinged doors had previously topped $1 million at an auction.
Russo & Steele, whose 2010 sale here was disrupted by a violent storm that blew down its tents and damaged dozens of cars, made an impressive comeback. Its total sales of $21 million included a remarkable $1.7 million for a 1970 Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda convertible.
Online Correction: January 28, 2011, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article missstated Barrett-Jackson's sales figures. The company's had $70 million in sales that were up 11 percent from 2010, not $68.5 million in sales that were up 5 percent from 2010.

HEADLINE: LETTERS;Eurotrashed

 BODY:
I read with great interest Paul Krugman's review of the issues facing the euro. What he failed to point out, however, was that many of the policies that got Europe and its currency into so much trouble are in the process of being repeated by the Obama administration -- deficit spending on runaway government expenditures, unaffordable social programs, unfunded public pension funds, among others. Shouldn't Europe's problems be a siren call for the United States to return to a policy of living within its means and of individual responsibility?
MARK JACKSON Scottsdale, Ariz. 
Of course, Krugman was correct regarding Europe and the euro. When I was the United States ambassador to the European Union (then the European Communities) in the late '80s, as preparation for the advent of the euro was taking place, the crosscurrents were strong and visible. It couldn't possibly succeed, as predicted by many, without a finance ministry for all of Europe, not possible then or foreseeable now.
A real look at European debt, which is far greater than the narrowly reported official deficits, bodes badly. Bailouts are being affected by the imposition of rising and unsustainable interest rates. Just look at recent bond yields in Portugal, Ireland and Greece. And what will happen when more onerous austerity programs are initiated to meet new budgetary targets? Will the E.U. survive? Of course it will. It has succeeded in quelling thousands of years of internal warfare. But the euro and current E.U. structure -- well, that's another matter.
ALFRED H. KINGON Bronxville, N.Y.
Krugman suggests four ways the European crisis could play out. Whatever measures the European monetary union adopts to pull itself out of the current economic crisis, success will rely in part on the adherence to the two primary conditions of the European Stability and Growth Pact of 1997, which require that member countries keep their annual budget deficits no higher than 3 percent of G.D.P. and their national debt below 60 percent of G.D.P. These conditions have been breached time and time again by several countries -- France and Germany being among the most frequent offenders -- and yet no sanctions have been imposed. Had the fiscal and borrowing conditions been observed, the current crisis would almost certainly have been much less severe.
Sanctions need to be imposed on countries that breach these fundamental conditions. Various proposals have already been floated, ranging from possible ejection from the monetary union to temporary loss of voting rights until an offending country adheres to the rules. In my view, the real test for future viability of the euro is whether the political leadership is willing to insist on adherence to its fundamental financial rules. If past is prologue, then the prospects for this happening look dim.
ARNOLD CLIFT Former Deputy Secretary, World Bank Saxtons River, Vt.
Krugman suggests that European countries that share the euro might find it easier to correct their financial difficulties if they had their individual currencies back. Can you imagine the financial chaos if those individual currencies were floating on the world market financial exchanges? I believe countries like Ireland and Greece have a better chance to correct their monetary problems with the more stable euro. Further, Krugman argues that geographically isolated countries like Iceland benefit from having their own currencies. In the age of computer banking and economic globalization, this assumption carries little credibility. The fiscal problems in Europe would have occurred no matter what currencies they were employing. Greed and poor financial management in the private and governmental sectors are recurring universal problems.
RICHARD S. EMRICH Plymouth, Mich.
Krugman omits an important part of the history of European integration: the Treaty of Rome. This was the brainchild of the French economist Jean Monnet and was adopted by the original six that formed the Common Market -- France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Britain chose not to join, and when it later attempted to gain admission, it was vetoed by Charles de Gaulle. Ultimately, Britain did join the Common Market, accepting the terms of the Treaty of Rome that provided for the ultimate full integration of its members. The progression was to be a common market that integrated the economies, followed by political union and, only then, the adoption of a common currency.
This idea of a United States of Europe was actually conceived by Winston Churchill after the war. Had this taken place, the problems that Krugman discusses never would have arisen. It was grandiosity that subverted this vision through the enlargement of its membership and the creation of the European Union that replaced the Treaty of Rome. Unable to adopt its own constitution, it has relied on a treaty as its fundamental document. With a powerless parliament and a burdensome bureaucracy, it has put the cart before the horse by adopting a common currency without political union. By including countries like Ireland, Greece and Spain that did not have the kinds of economies of the original six, this experiment was doomed to fail.
Yes, Europe has succeeded in creating the world's largest economy, but without true political integration, it is a chimera.
RICHARD CUMMINGS, PH.D. Sag Harbor, N.Y.
Krugman was somewhat disingenuous in his praise of the flexibility of a national currency in his examination of the problems facing some of the Eurozone economies. For starters, he points out that in the absence of a national currency, nations have few recourses but to drive down wages and benefits in order to dig their way out of a crisis (i.e. become more competitive). But if they possessed a national currency, they could achieve the same effect without the political trauma by degrading the currency, and he rightly cites Milton Friedman's defense of floating currencies as support for this argument. But what he doesn't point out is that when a nation degrades its currency, it is effectively robbing the savers in that nation. It is hard to believe that he does not realize this is a consequence of currency degradation. Effectively he is arguing for taxation by stealth. For democratic purposes, if the government is going to deprive people of their wealth, it should do it openly through taxation, so that it can be held accountable. This is difficult to do when the taxation is masked by currency degradation, and that applies to both the euro and the greenback.

HEADLINE: Innovation Is Doing Little for Incomes

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
MY grandmother, who was born in 1905, spoke often about the immense changes she had seen, including the widespread adoption of electricity, the automobile, flush toilets, antibiotics and convenient household appliances. Since my birth in 1962, it seems to me, there have not been comparable improvements.
Of course, the personal computer and its cousin, the smartphone, have brought about some big changes. And many goods and services are now more plentiful and of better quality. But compared with what my grandmother witnessed, the basic accouterments of life have remained broadly the same. 
The income numbers for Americans reflect this slowdown in growth. From 1947 to 1973 -- a period of just 26 years -- inflation-adjusted median income in the United States more than doubled. But in the 31 years from 1973 to 2004, it rose only 22 percent. And, over the last decade, it actually declined.
Most well-off countries have experienced income growth slowdowns since the early 1970s, so it would seem that a single cause is transcending national borders: the reaching of a technological plateau. The numbers suggest that for almost 40 years, we've had near-universal dissemination of the major innovations stemming from the Industrial Revolution, many of which combined efficient machines with potent fossil fuels. Today, no huge improvement for the automobile or airplane is in sight, and the major struggle is to limit their pollution, not to vastly improve their capabilities.
Although America produces plenty of innovations, most are not geared toward significantly raising the average standard of living. It seems that we are coming up with ideas that benefit relatively small numbers of people, compared with the broad-based advances of earlier decades, when the modern world was put into place. If pre-1973 growth rates had continued, for example, median family income in the United States would now be more than $90,000, as opposed to its current range of around $50,000.
Will the Internet usher in a new economic growth explosion? Quite possibly, but it hasn't delivered very good macroeconomic performance over the last decade. Many of the Internet's gains are fun -- games, chat rooms, Twitter streams -- rather than vast sources of revenue, and when there have been measurable monetary gains, they often have been concentrated among a small number of company founders, as with, say, Facebook. As for users, the Internet has benefited the well-educated and the curious to a disproportionate degree, but apparently not enough to bolster median income.
Beyond the income slowdown, there is a further worry: an increasing share of the economy consists of education and health care. That trend is not necessarily bad, but in these two areas, results are often hard to measure. If health care costs rise 6 percent in a year, for example, that counts as higher G.D.P., but how much is our health actually improving? It's an open question. America spends more on health care than other countries, but those expenditures don't seem to produce uniformly superior results. And while there have certainly been gains in medical treatment, we may be overvaluing them. In education, we are spending more each year, but test scores have stagnated for decades, graduation rates are down and America's worst schools are disasters.
There is an even broader problem. When it comes to measuring national income, we're generally valuing expenditures at cost, rather than tracking productivity in terms of results. In other words, our statistics may be deceiving us -- by accepting, say, our health care and educational expenditures at face value. This theme has been emphasized by the PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel in his public talks and by the economist Michael Mandel in his writings. And I've stressed it in a recent e-book, ''The Great Stagnation.''
Sooner or later, new technological revolutions will occur, perhaps in the biosciences, through genome sequencing, or in energy production, through viable solar power, for example. But these transformations won't come overnight, and we'll have to make do in the meantime. Instead of facing up to this scarcity, politicians promote tax cuts and income redistribution policies to benefit favored constituencies. Yet these are one-off adjustments and, over time, they cannot undo the slower rate of growth in average living standards.
It's unclear whether Americans have the temperament to make a smooth transition to a more stagnant economy. After all, we've long thought of our country as the land of unlimited opportunity. In practice, this optimism has meant that we continue to increase government spending, whether or not we can afford it.
In the narrow sense, the solution to the stagnation of median income will not be a political one. And one of the hardest points to grasp about this quandary is that no one in particular is to blame. Scientific progress has never proceeded on an even, predictable basis, even though for part of the 20th century it seemed that it might.
Science should be encouraged with subsidies for basic research, as well as private charity, educational reform, a business culture geared toward commercializing inventions, and greater public appreciation for the scientific endeavor. A lighter legal and regulatory hand could ease the path of future innovations.
NONETHELESS, advancing discovery is not a goal to be reached by the mere application of will. Precisely because there is no obvious villain and no simple fix, and many complex factors behind success, science as a general topic doesn't play a big role in American political discourse. When it comes to understanding our macroeconomic predicament, we often seem to be missing the point.
Until science has a greater impact again on average daily living standards, the political problem will be in learning to live within our means. Because neither major party seems to support a plausible path to fiscal balance, or to acknowledge how little control politicians actually have over future income growth, we unscientifically keep living in an age of denial.

HEADLINE: Report Tracks Increasing Anxiety

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER

 BODY:
Garden City
DR. BRUCE STILLMAN, the president of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, hires a lot of scientists. But many of the 1,130 postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, medical doctors and others don't live on the Island. They commute from Brooklyn or Manhattan.
''They don't want to live on the two acres or the quarter acre'' that typifies suburban plots, Dr. Stillman said. The 24- to 32-year-olds entering the work force after a decade in higher education aren't ready to ''spend their weekends mowing the lawn.''
Instead, this global cache of high-tech workers ''want to live in other communities with people like them,'' cities or villages with ''cool downtowns.'' On the Island, such places are scarce.
Dr. Stillman discussed these issues on Jan. 20 at Adelphi University in Garden City, at the unveiling of the Long Island Index 2011 Report on the Island's economy and quality of life. As a housing problem emblematic of the area, the lab's residential angst seemed relevant to an event titled ''Getting It Done: Aligning Long Island's Development Processes with Sustainable Economic Growth.'' 
''If we can't provide the housing the scientists need and the types of vibrant communities that young researchers want,'' Dr. Stillman said, ''we will face barriers to success that should not exist.'' Unsuitable housing, he said, might keep spin-off companies out of the area, or hinder the research center's plan to team with Stony Brook University and Brookhaven National Laboratory on an innovation center. Moving forward, Dr. Stillman said, he hopes housing challenges will not become ''our Achilles' heel.''
The report -- prepared by the Regional Plan Association and relying on surveys of planning and building officials in towns, cities and incorporated villages -- confirmed that with 20 percent of its housing as rental units, the Island has a smaller stock of rental housing ''than any other part of the metropolitan region.''
Ann Golob, the director of the Index, put it this way: ''We are the king of the single-family home, with few rentals, condos, town houses or garden apartments as options for those who don't want, or can't afford, a single-family home.''
Long Islanders are ever more anxious about how they can maintain their lifestyle, the report found. An affordable home -- defined as costing no more than $254,500, or two and a half times the 2009 median income for the region -- ''has become a rare commodity.'' Average pay is at a 10-year low, down 3 percent from 2000, while average wages across the nation have grown 4 percent.
Leonie Huddy, the director of the Center for Survey Research at Stony Brook University, which conducted the poll, compared the Island with other suburbs. ''Taxes always come up as the single most important problem,'' she said, adding that 81 percent of Long Islanders describe property taxes as a serious or extremely serious issue.
''We also have angst about young people leaving the Island,'' she said, noting that 75 percent of those surveyed called the problem serious, versus 48 percent in Westchester County and 44 percent in New Jersey. There are 15 percent fewer 25- to 34-year-olds on the Island than in 2000; the decline is the largest in the region.
More than 60 percent of Long Islanders cited lack of affordable housing as a very or extremely serious problem, and 50 percent reported having trouble paying the rent or mortgage. Substantially more people see these as troublesome issues in Long Island than in northern New Jersey, Westchester or Connecticut.
Also, only 21 percent of those neighboring suburbs rated the Island as an excellent or good place to live. ''In the 1950s,'' Ms. Golob said, ''we were the most desirable suburban location, envied by our neighbors for our affordability, beauty and jobs. No more. Our neighbors are disenchanted with our traffic, high taxes and expensive cost of living.''
Nancy Rauch Douzinas, the president of the Rauch Foundation, which sponsors the Index, said that previously it had studied how reconfiguring downtown areas could ease the Island's housing, job and tax woes with minor impact on single-family neighborhoods or open space. Last year it identified 8,300 acres of potential land in more than 150 downtowns and rail station areas, mostly in parking lots.
''We need 21st-century solutions to replace the 1950s ones,'' Ms. Douzinas said, ''and we need to revise, redesign and adapt our habitat for living.''
This time, with the focus on planning, the Index drew up a Top 10 list of impediments to downtown development. Among them, it found, ''No two municipalities function the same.'' Because of the tangled web of incorporated and unincorporated villages, towns, cities and counties, ''different rules, different processes, different staffing levels'' make it hard to get things done.
How long does it take to move through the approval process?
''Seventy percent of jurisdictions do not set target dates for planning reviews,'' Ms. Golob said, adding that ''timelines for project approvals and building reviews are indefinite and variable,'' hampering ''even the most well-designed projects.''
Successful revitalization projects studied by the Index's researchers ''started with a comprehensive plan defining what the residents wanted,'' she added. They ''did not start with a proposal from a developer that then had to be tweaked, changed, argued, bargained about.''
The low number of rental units isn't surprising. Rental units are not allowed without a special permit; in 45 percent of villages they aren't allowed at all. Accessory housing is prohibited in 70 percent of villages. ''Our codes make it hard or downright impossible to build them,'' Ms. Golob said.

HEADLINE: COLLECTING; Buyers Spread the Wealth in Arizona

BYLINE: By ROB SASS

 BODY:
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.
TRICKLE-DOWN economics has its detractors, but a rising tide did seem to lift all cars at this year's whirl of Arizona collector auctions.
A year ago, only the high end of the market seemed to have much life: collectors with ready cash mostly snapped up the rarest and best cars. Since then, the prosperity at the top has filtered down to the middle of the market. At the five major auctions that took place around Phoenix on Jan. 18-23, even entry-level cars did well, and prices seemed to firm up across the board.
What's more, buyers signaled a nascent market trend by enthusiastically bidding for unrestored cars in original, but well-preserved, condition. 
Bidders remained picky: the best cars in all price ranges found active bidders at strong prices, while lesser offerings continued to sell for what seemed, by recent standards, like bargain prices.
''Over all, the market seems quite stable, and there is even some spiking on certain cars taking place,'' said Charlie Goodman, a collector from San Rafael, Calif. ''It's getting harder for auction companies to feed the demand for high-quality cars, because people are holding onto these cars, seeing them as investments that can be enjoyed as well.''
Barrett-Jackson started the party with bidding on Tuesday, Jan. 18, with its usual policy of no reserves, meaning every car that reached the block went to the high bidder. As the Barrett-Jackson sale has evolved into a lifestyle event with gavel-to-gavel cable TV coverage, it has become a gateway for new collectors. The chief executive, Craig Jackson, said more than half of both bidders and consigners this year were first-timers at a collector car auction.
What could have been this year's high sale at Barrett-Jackson, a 1963 Pontiac Bonneville ambulance presented as the vehicle that carried President Kennedy's body from Andrews Air Force Base to Bethesda Naval Hospital, brought $132,000 (including the 10 percent buyer's premium) after its provenance was questioned. Before the sale, the buzz in Scottsdale was that the Pontiac could bring close to $1 million.
Barrett-Jackson's $70 million in sales were up 11 percent from 2010. The second-highest total was $35 million for Gooding & Company, and third place went to RM Auctions with $31 million.
At Gooding in particular, bidders responded strongly to unrestored cars. A 1931 Rolls-Royce Phantom II Henley Roadster sold for $935,000, a 1953 Fiat 8V Supersonic for $1.7 million and a 1962 Mercedes-Benz 300SL roadster for $951,500. All three were largely original, unrestored cars and all broke world auction records, exceeding by comfortable margins the established prices for meticulously restored examples.
RM also had several surprising sales, including a record-breaking $1.375 million for a pristine 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing. None of these graceful cars with roof-hinged doors had previously topped $1 million at an auction.
Russo & Steele, whose 2010 sale here was disrupted by a violent storm that blew down its tents and damaged dozens of cars, made an impressive comeback. Its total sales of $21 million included a remarkable $1.7 million for a 1970 Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda convertible.

HEADLINE: LETTERS; Eurotrashed

 BODY:
I read with great interest Paul Krugman's review of the issues facing the euro. What he failed to point out, however, was that many of the policies that got Europe and its currency into so much trouble are in the process of being repeated by the Obama administration -- deficit spending on runaway government expenditures, unaffordable social programs, unfunded public pension funds, among others. Shouldn't Europe's problems be a siren call for the United States to return to a policy of living within its means and of individual responsibility?
MARK JACKSON Scottsdale, Ariz. 
Of course, Krugman was correct regarding Europe and the euro. When I was the United States ambassador to the European Union (then the European Communities) in the late '80s, as preparation for the advent of the euro was taking place, the crosscurrents were strong and visible. It couldn't possibly succeed, as predicted by many, without a finance ministry for all of Europe, not possible then or foreseeable now.
A real look at European debt, which is far greater than the narrowly reported official deficits, bodes badly. Bailouts are being affected by the imposition of rising and unsustainable interest rates. Just look at recent bond yields in Portugal, Ireland and Greece. And what will happen when more onerous austerity programs are initiated to meet new budgetary targets? Will the E.U. survive? Of course it will. It has succeeded in quelling thousands of years of internal warfare. But the euro and current E.U. structure -- well, that's another matter.
ALFRED H. KINGON Bronxville, N.Y.
Krugman suggests four ways the European crisis could play out. Whatever measures the European monetary union adopts to pull itself out of the current economic crisis, success will rely in part on the adherence to the two primary conditions of the European Stability and Growth Pact of 1997, which require that member countries keep their annual budget deficits no higher than 3 percent of G.D.P. and their national debt below 60 percent of G.D.P. These conditions have been breached time and time again by several countries -- France and Germany being among the most frequent offenders -- and yet no sanctions have been imposed. Had the fiscal and borrowing conditions been observed, the current crisis would almost certainly have been much less severe.
Sanctions need to be imposed on countries that breach these fundamental conditions. Various proposals have already been floated, ranging from possible ejection from the monetary union to temporary loss of voting rights until an offending country adheres to the rules. In my view, the real test for future viability of the euro is whether the political leadership is willing to insist on adherence to its fundamental financial rules. If past is prologue, then the prospects for this happening look dim.
ARNOLD CLIFT Former Deputy Secretary, World Bank Saxtons River, Vt.
Krugman suggests that European countries that share the euro might find it easier to correct their financial difficulties if they had their individual currencies back. Can you imagine the financial chaos if those individual currencies were floating on the world market financial exchanges? I believe countries like Ireland and Greece have a better chance to correct their monetary problems with the more stable euro. Further, Krugman argues that geographically isolated countries like Iceland benefit from having their own currencies. In the age of computer banking and economic globalization, this assumption carries little credibility. The fiscal problems in Europe would have occurred no matter what currencies they were employing. Greed and poor financial management in the private and governmental sectors are recurring universal problems.
RICHARD S. EMRICH Plymouth, Mich.
Krugman omits an important part of the history of European integration: the Treaty of Rome. This was the brainchild of the French economist Jean Monnet and was adopted by the original six that formed the Common Market -- France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Britain chose not to join, and when it later attempted to gain admission, it was vetoed by Charles de Gaulle. Ultimately, Britain did join the Common Market, accepting the terms of the Treaty of Rome that provided for the ultimate full integration of its members. The progression was to be a common market that integrated the economies, followed by political union and, only then, the adoption of a common currency.
This idea of a United States of Europe was actually conceived by Winston Churchill after the war. Had this taken place, the problems that Krugman discusses never would have arisen. It was grandiosity that subverted this vision through the enlargement of its membership and the creation of the European Union that replaced the Treaty of Rome. Unable to adopt its own constitution, it has relied on a treaty as its fundamental document. With a powerless parliament and a burdensome bureaucracy, it has put the cart before the horse by adopting a common currency without political union. By including countries like Ireland, Greece and Spain that did not have the kinds of economies of the original six, this experiment was doomed to fail.
Yes, Europe has succeeded in creating the world's largest economy, but without true political integration, it is a chimera.
RICHARD CUMMINGS, PH.D. Sag Harbor, N.Y.
Krugman was somewhat disingenuous in his praise of the flexibility of a national currency in his examination of the problems facing some of the Eurozone economies. For starters, he points out that in the absence of a national currency, nations have few recourses but to drive down wages and benefits in order to dig their way out of a crisis (i.e. become more competitive). But if they possessed a national currency, they could achieve the same effect without the political trauma by degrading the currency, and he rightly cites Milton Friedman's defense of floating currencies as support for this argument. But what he doesn't point out is that when a nation degrades its currency, it is effectively robbing the savers in that nation. It is hard to believe that he does not realize this is a consequence of currency degradation. Effectively he is arguing for taxation by stealth. For democratic purposes, if the government is going to deprive people of their wealth, it should do it openly through taxation, so that it can be held accountable. This is difficult to do when the taxation is masked by currency degradation, and that applies to both the euro and the greenback.

HEADLINE: In California, a Proposed Cut Angers Local Officials

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Nobody around here doubts that the pie is getting smaller. With the state facing a $25 billion budget gap, cuts have to come from somewhere.
So in the two weeks since the newly installed Gov. Jerry Brown released his budget proposal, the howls of complaints have come from nearly every corner. But perhaps the loudest protests have come from city and county officials, who say that after years of slashing local budgets, Mr. Brown's cuts could cripple them.
Most significant, the governor is proposing to eliminate local redevelopment agencies, which funnel hundreds of millions of dollars to real estate projects meant to improve struggling areas. Such projects, he argues, cannot be immune to cuts while other basic services, like education and health care, are trimmed yet again.
''You're all riled up,'' Mr. Brown said recently at a meeting with city leaders from across the state. As a former mayor himself, Mr. Brown says he is empathetic to their concerns, but he has not backed off his own demands. ''I look all across it, and none of it looks good,'' he said. ''But tell me where else to draw the lines. It's a zero-sum game right now.'' 
Redevelopment agencies were created in the 1940s as a way to revitalize blighted areas. Now, city and county officials say that such projects have sharply improved once-sagging neighborhoods, but critics say they are simply a gift to private developers. Mr. Brown said eliminating the agencies would save the state $1.7 billion this year.
City officials across the state argue that gutting the agencies will kill the state's most important economic development program. Chris McKenzie, the executive director of the California League of Cities, which is leading the push against the cuts, said the projects created by the agencies generate $2 billion in tax revenue and 300,000 jobs annually.
''Right now, this is the only way we are creating anything that will give people affordable housing and jobs,'' Mr. McKenzie said. ''For the state to get rid of that is unthinkable. It's like a farmer eating his seed corn. Why would you destroy the very thing that is going to protect jobs in the future, year after year?''
''Cities have been far, far ahead of the state in making the tough decisions,'' he added, ''and they all think this is something worth keeping.''
The way redevelopment money is used varies widely, from fire stations in one city to sports stadiums in another. In Riverside County, one of the areas hardest hit in the downturn, officials say they have primarily used the money to build fire stations and libraries in particularly poor parts of the county. San Diego officials relied on its redevelopment funds to overhaul downtown, creating the Gaslamp Quarter, a prime tourist attraction, and a nearby baseball stadium.
''Downtown was a really tough place, and now it's one of the most vibrant downtowns anywhere,'' Mayor Jerry Sanders said. ''We stand to lose that, and that's the very thing that is keeping residents in a place like downtown. We need the tax base to stay there if we are going to keep what we have.''
The same redevelopment agency is now trying to create a football stadium just east of downtown, but critics say there is little evidence that the project is worth the public money.
''The problem is, once an area is declared blighted, that distinction never goes away,'' said Christopher Sutton, a lawyer who is involved in a lawsuit against San Diego over their redevelopment money. ''Why should we have this pool of money cordoned off? It can't be touched at all for other government services. If we're in such a terrible budget situation, why should this be exempt?''
After meeting with mayors of the state's largest cities last week, Mr. Brown referred to the redevelopment money as a ''piggy bank'' that should be opened to pay for other local needs.
The state controller, John Chiang, said he planned to review the spending of 18 redevelopment agencies to examine how the money is spent and whether projects are ''engines of local economic and job growth or are simply scams providing windfalls to political cronies.''
In recent days, several cities have rushed to transfer money from their redevelopment agencies to specific projects, in an effort to make an end-run around the governor's proposal. The Los Angeles City Council allocated $52 million,which will be used to create a parking garage for a new art museum downtown. The museum is being financed by the philanthropist Eli Broad.
The state is also pushing to transfer the cost of many services from the state to county governments, requiring them, for example, to provide all mental health services for the poor and to run their own parole programs.
While many county officials say they would welcome the autonomy, they are skeptical that the state will provide enough money for them to do so. The current proposal includes a tax stream for the next five years, but John Tavaglione, the president of the California State Association of Counties, said many worry that the money is not guaranteed in the long term.
''If they shift without funding for the future, we are going to be in an even bigger mess,'' said Mr. Tavaglione, who is also a supervisor in Riverside County. ''This is the worst any of us has seen since the Great Depression, and I don't see it getting any better. The difference between the local governments and the state is that we've all bitten the bullet and been cutting. The state is only starting to do that now.''
Riverside, he said, has eliminated 2,000 positions in county government in the last two years, even as more and more residents are reliant on county services like public health clinics and work placement programs.
In Los Angeles County, officials estimate that they will absorb more than $1.2 billion in costs from the state. County officials across the state also worry that the changes will further overwhelm their already overcrowded county jails.
None of the complaints seem to surprise the governor, who has taken on the task of balancing the budget with a sort of missionary glee.
''The hallways are going to be crowded in the coming months with people who say, please keep the money coming. And my message is, the money is not there,'' Mr. Brown told reporters last week. ''My message is, if not you, who?''

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Jan. 31 about Gov. Jerry Brown's proposal to cut California's redevelopment funds referred incorrectly to a $52 million allocation by the Los Angeles City Council. The money will be used to create a parking garage that city officials requested for a new art museum downtown. The money is not for the museum itself, which is being financed by the philanthropist Eli Broad.

HEADLINE: Comcast Takes Over NBC Universal

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Comcast, the nation's largest cable TV company, took control of NBC Universal late on Friday, making it the first cable company to own a major broadcast network.
The takeover gave the cable distributor a 51 percent control of NBC Universal, which owns the nation's fourth-ranked broadcaster, NBC; the Universal Pictures movie studio and related theme parks; and a bevy of cable channels including Bravo, E and USA. 
The deal had raised fears that Comcast might abuse its control of NBC Universal to favor the 23 million who rely on it for cable TV service and the 17 million who pay for Internet connections.
But the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission forced Comcast to make the full suite of NBC Universal content available as a single package to online competitors on terms comparable to those reached with more established rivals, like Dish Network and DirecTV.
NBC Universal is also expected to match new deals for smaller chunks of programming between other media firms and online video providers if it has comparable programming on hand. As an example, NBC Universal might have to make ''The Real Housewives of New York City'' from Bravo available to Netflix if Viacom makes a similar deal for ''Jersey Shore,'' the MTV show.
The company also had to give up the decision-making power associated with its 32 percent share of Hulu, the online video service it co-owns with the Walt Disney Company, the News Corporation and Providence Equity Partners. Hulu is one of the services that makes viewing shows like ''30 Rock'' possible online.
The rules highlight the new battleground for entertainment in the home between traditional power players like Comcast, which has lost subscribers in the economic downturn, and companies like Netflix, which added them with its cheap service and compatibility with a range of devices.
In the deal, Comcast paid General Electric just under $6.2 billion in cash and contributed its pay TV channels like E Entertainment Television and the Golf Channel, worth $7.25 billion, to NBC Universal.
G.E.'s stake in NBC Universal fell to 49 percent from 80 percent, but G.E. plans to diminish that to zero by being paid out from the venture over about seven years. This week, G.E. bought out the 20 percent stake held by Vivendi of France for $5.8 billion in order to complete the deal.

HEADLINE: Ripped And Righteous

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
It is Jack LaLanne you can thank, or curse, for all the gyms: in exurban strip malls, suburban manses, downtown hotels. The health club he opened in Oakland, Calif., in 1936 was one of their seeds and templates, an endorphin emporium that pointed the way.
With ''The Jack LaLanne Show,'' he also had a hand in the spread -- a contagion, really -- of television programs exhorting viewers to rise up from their La-Z-Boys and of infomercials hawking workout equipment. An army of spandex missionaries was unleashed.
But that's not the whole of his legacy, or the most interesting (some might say insidious) part.
That sense of failure you feel when you haven't exercised in days? That conviction that if you could pull off better push-ups, you'd be a better person through and through? These, too, are his doing, at least in part. What he left behind when he died last week, at the toned old age of 96, was not only a sweaty culture of relentless crunching and spinning but also the notion that fitness equals character, and that self-actualization begins with the self-discipline to get and stay in shape. In the post-LaLanne landscape, it's not the eyes but the abdominals that are windows to the soul. 
''There seems to be a whole substitute morality, where your obligation is to go to the gym and not ask why,'' says Mark Greif, a founding editor of the literary journal n+1 and the author of a widely discussed 2004 essay, ''Against Exercise.'' ''If you don't, you become a sort of villain of the culture.''
The message that perspiration is a gateway to, and reflection of, higher virtues is captured in health club slogans like ones used by the Equinox chain over recent years: ''Results aren't always measured in pounds and inches.'' ''My body. My biography.'' ''It's not fitness. It's life.'' The same idea is encoded in the language of personal improvement. A ''new you'' usually means a trimmer, tauter version, not someone who has learned to speak Mandarin or picked up woodworking skills.
And the pectoral is political. The current president and his predecessor have made ostentatious points of their commitments to fitness routines. Whatever the differences in their ideologies, intellects and work habits, George W. Bush and Barack Obama both let voters know that they carve out time almost daily for cardio or weights or both. And while that devotion could be seen as evidence of distraction (Bush) or vanity (Bush and Obama), each politician safely counted on a sunnier takeaway. In this country, at this time, steadiness of exercise signals sturdiness of temperament, and physical leanness connotes mental toughness.
Bill Clinton worked out less diligently, which was freighted with its own meaning: waistline as weather vane. Americans monitored his fluctuating physique as they wondered how well he was keeping all of his appetites in check.
Some conflation of the physical and the moral spans virtually all of human history. It's present in the writings of the ancient Greeks, for whom athleticism was much more than mere sport. Christians long ago designated sloth one of the seven deadly sins, though they meant a dearth of industry more than a deficit of treadmill time.
And the philosophy that one form of self-control begets another -- that careful maintenance of the body yields more than corporal benefits -- has countless historical precedents. In the early 19th century, the American preacher Sylvester Graham advocated sparse, vegetarian-style eating as a hedge against impure thoughts, particularly sexual ones. He was nutritionist and moralist both.
In his own way, Mr. LaLanne was also a moralist, proselytizing about diet and exercise. To go back and look at his language is to be struck by its religious flavor.
He once compared himself to Billy Graham, saying that while Mr. Graham (no relation to Sylvester) was ''for the hereafter,'' he was ''for the here and now.'' He called what he was doing a crusade, adding, ''To me, this one thing -- physical culture and nutrition -- is the salvation of America.''
And he admitted that exercise wasn't always pleasurable or diverting. You did it because it was right and good and true -- because it would better you. The Protestant work ethic pulsed through every one of his jumping jacks.
For Mr. LaLanne, proper physical stewardship involved not ascetic denial so much as activity, activity, activity. You must run! Or at least pump your fists up and down as you walk fast, preferably on an incline! Don't forgo hammer curls! The true believer has a self-punishing -- and often solitary -- regimen. And he or she achieves inner peace only because of it.
Or so his disciples assert. ''The physical is just sort of the vehicle to live with more intention, more mindfulness, more focus,'' says Amanda Rose Walsh, a personal trainer in Manhattan. She tells her clients as much: ''In order to have a healthy mind and soul and spirit, you have to start with the physical. You start with the body to get to deeper levels.''
And if you don't succeed? To be unfit is to be unfit: a villain of the culture, indeed.
Listen to the way doughy contestants are introduced (and how they talk about themselves) on TV weight-loss shows, which promise redemption through rigorous calisthenics. Saddlebag thighs and love handles are woven together with career frustrations and domestic strife -- all of them the wages of sloppy living. Moving past these humiliations and rejoining polite society are contingent on serious gym time.
Look at the title of the best known of these shows, ''The Biggest Loser.'' Is that mirthful wordplay or a pointed double entendre, referring not just to the eventual champion but also to the poor fatsos still wallowing in shame?
There's a bullying strain to the modern fitness ethos, a blurred line between cheerleading and hectoring. And it's hard not to wonder whether that kind of intimidation -- in addition to the social and economic realities of diet and exercise -- helps explain the paradox that for all the newfangled aerobic machines and reduced-rate January gym memberships, Americans aren't noticeably haler and healthier.
When exercise comes wrapped in value judgments, does it wind up entangled in an anxiety that threatens the very resolve to get fit? As Mr. LaLanne was siring new methods for shaping up, he was fathering something else, too: a potent, and in some cases immobilizing, strain of contemporary guilt.

HEADLINE: A Bank Crisis Whodunit, With Laughs and Tears

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
TRULY startling revelations were few in the voluminous report, published last Thursday by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission on the origins of the financial panic. This is hardly a shock, given the flood-the-zone coverage and analysis of the crisis since it erupted four years ago.
Yet the report still makes for compelling reading because so little has changed as a result of the debacle, in both banking and in its regulation. Providing chapter and verse, for example, on the bumbling and siloed management at the nation's largest banks is enlightening, in that many of these institutions are even bigger than they were before. With too-big-to-fail institutions now larger than ever, we are almost certain to go through another episode like 2008 in the not-too-distant future.
For those who might find the report's 633 pages a bit daunting for a weekend read, we offer a Cliffs Notes version. 
Let's begin with the Federal Reserve, the most powerful of financial regulators. The report's most important public service comes in its recitation of how top Fed officials, both in Washington and in New York, fiddled while the financial system smoldered and then burned. It is disturbing indeed that this institution, defiantly inert and uninterested in reining in the mortgage mania, received even greater regulatory powers under the Dodd-Frank law that was supposed to reform our system.
The report shows how the Fed refused to exert its authority on predatory lending. On Page 94, we learn that from 2000 to 2006, it referred a grand total of three institutions to prosecutors for possible fair-lending violations in mortgages.
The Fed ''succumbed to the climate of the times,'' its general counsel, Scott G. Alvarez, told commission investigators. It is hard for a supervisor to challenge banks when they are highly profitable, other officials said. Richard Spillenkothen, head of supervision at the Fed until 2006, attributed its reluctance to ''a desire not to inject an element of contentiousness into what was felt to be a constructive or equable relationship with management.''
Is it any shock, then, that neither the Federal Reserve Bank of New York nor the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a partner in regulatory inadequacy, saw that the S.S. Citigroup was headed for the shoals? This depressing case is chronicled in depth in the report.
In testimony last September, Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said that his organization ''has moved vigorously to address identified problems.''
BUT back a few years, as regulators were coddling bank managers, some executives were busily telling their investors that everything was just dandy. On Page 248, we learn about dire events at Countrywide Financial, the subprime lender.
On Aug. 2, 2007, Countrywide's access to crucial market financing dried up; commercial paper investors would not buy its obligations, the report quoted Angelo R. Mozilo, the company chief executive, as saying. But Eric P. Sieracki, the company's chief financial officer, said in a statement that day that Countrywide had plenty of liquidity and had experienced ''no disruption in financing its ongoing daily operations, including placement of commercial paper.''
This rather interesting take on reality prompted Moody's to reaffirm the company's A3 debt rating. Two weeks later, Countrywide drew down all of its $11.5 billion in credit lines, signaling extreme distress to the markets. The stock plunged; a few months later the lender was taken over in distress by Bank of America.
Mr. Sieracki declined to comment, but his lawyer said on Friday that the Aug. 2 statement was accurate at the time Mr. Sieracki made it.
On Page 264, the report lays out Citigroup's silence about the ticking time bombs it had shoved off its balance sheet but that would soon have to be repatriated, generating enormous losses. A spokeswoman for Citigroup said that it was a different company today, and that it had overhauled its risk management and bolstered its financial strength.
We already know, of course, that our government moved mountains to help the banks during the crisis. But the report adds to our understanding of events by describing how the Treasury Department changed the tax code to benefit banks acquiring weaker institutions. Never mind that the Constitution allows only Congress to write tax rules.
I.R.S. Notice 2008-83 came out of nowhere on Sept. 30, 2008, the report noted on Page 371. It removed existing limits on the use of tax losses that could be taken by a bank when it acquired a troubled institution. The change appeared just as Citigroup was mounting its $1-a-share bid for Wachovia. (The beleaguered bank was headed by Robert K. Steel, a former under secretary of domestic finance at Treasury who had left his post two months earlier. ''Secretary Paulson had recused himself from the decision because of his ties to Steel,'' the report said, ''but other members of Treasury had 'vigorously advocated' saving Wachovia.'')
Two days after the tax change, Wells Fargo topped Citi's proposal by offering $7 a share. The change in the code had made such a deal more economical for Wells because it could reduce its taxable income by $3 billion in the first year after acquiring Wachovia. Previously, Wells could have reduced its income by just $1 billion in Year 1.
''They were changing the rules on the fly to the apparent advantage of banks who wanted to get something for nothing out of this crisis,'' said Janet Tavakoli, president of Tavakoli Structured Finance in Chicago. ''Why aren't people being questioned and held accountable for that?''
As it turned out, Wells did not benefit from the code change because it had no taxable income to offset, the report said. I.R.S. Notice 2008-83 was repealed in 2009.
For those of you who've wondered why there have been so few prosecutions of mortgage fraud during this epidemic, your answer is on Page 164. ''The terrible thing that happened,'' said William K. Black, a former fraud investigator in the savings-and-loan crisis who is a professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law, ''was that the F.B.I. got virtually no assistance from the regulators, the banking regulators and the thrift regulators.''
Finally, if it's comic relief you're after, turn to Page 105 for an interview with Angelo R. Mozilo, former chief executive of Countrywide Financial, a lender that profited by roping unsuspecting borrowers into poisonous loans.
Mr. Mozilo, the commission said, described his company as having ''prevented social unrest'' by providing loans to 25 million borrowers, many of them members of minority groups. Never mind that throngs of these loans have resulted in foreclosures and evictions. ''Countrywide was one of the greatest companies in the history of this country,'' Mr. Mozilo maintained, ''and probably made more difference to society, to the integrity of our society, than any company in the history of America.''
You cannot make this stuff up.
Do further bailouts lie ahead? Neil Barofsky, special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, seems to think so. When the government stepped in to save Citigroup in 2008, ''it did more than reassure troubled markets -- it encouraged high-risk behavior by insulating risk-takers from the consequences of failure,'' he said in his report to Congress last week.
''Unless and until an institution such as Citigroup is either broken up, so that it is no longer a threat to the financial system, or a structure is put in place to assure that it will be left to suffer the full consequences of its own folly,'' he said, ''the prospect of more bailouts will potentially fuel more bad behavior with potentially disastrous results.''

HEADLINE: The Name Rings a Bell

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
MANY people would dream of being fawned over by Renee Zellweger. Not, apparently, Raphael De Niro.
One recent Wednesday morning at the Greenwich Hotel -- the understated chic celebrity magnet that Mr. De Niro helped his father, Robert, open in 2008 -- Ms. Zellweger leapt from her couch when she spotted him. She hugged him. She introduced him to her boyfriend, Bradley Cooper, and to Mr. Cooper's parents. She ticked off prices of various apartments for sale that Mr. De Niro, a real estate broker, had e-mailed to her. Then she smiled and gushed, ''You know your stuff.''
Mr. De Niro was unfailingly polite but all business. He chatted briefly and moved on with a tour of Manhattan real estate that had played a major role in his life: the SoHo loft his grandmother renovated in the late 1960s; the once-drug-infested playground near where he grew up and where he now takes his toddler son, Nicholas; the Mercer Street building where he made one of his first sales; Tribeca Grill, the restaurant his dad created in 1990, which helped transform the neighborhood. 
Each downtown block, it seemed, had a story: climbing up the water tower on the roof of his father's Hudson Street loft building; bringing his G.I. Joe figures to his grandfather's studio on West Broadway, where he played among easels, stacks of books by Joseph Conrad and Brendan Behan, and a pair of squawking green Amazon parrots.
''It's exactly the way it was,'' Mr. De Niro said as he walked among the paintbrushes, canvases and old-school kitchen, which the family has preserved as a kind of shrine since his grandfather Robert De Niro Sr. died in 1993.
Of the restaurant, where Grandpa's moody paintings still hang, he said: ''We had a lot of family meals and birthdays here. We still do.''
Enough nostalgia. Mr. De Niro headed uptown to show off some of his newer listings. In the six years since he got his broker's license, he has sold $600 million in properties, landing among the top 10 sellers each year at Prudential Douglas Elliman, one of the city's largest firms. Next month, his 11-person team -- which includes his wife, Claudine DeMatos, and two De Niro cousins -- is expected to make the company's top 5.
In a real estate market where infighting and lawsuits are standard tools of combat, Mr. De Niro, at 34, has emerged from the recession as the broker of choice for downtown developers and high-profile clients.
Plenty of rival brokers attribute Mr. De Niro's success to his last name, saying many of his sales began with referrals that his father or Elliman's top management had handed him. But connections alone cannot explain multiple eight-figure deals when similar properties sit idle for months.
Mr. De Niro, a cigarette smoker more introspective than gregarious, made many of his sales in the stomach-churning real estate days after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. He refused to share the names of clients, but they include megalomaniacal financiers who spend years waffling over purchases, boldface names who bring entourages on apartment tours and temperamental celebrities (Naomi Campbell, a former companion of his father's, was one).
Yes, he acknowledged, his father's stardom has opened doors, and sellers and buyers alike often ask him for favors like tickets to the Tribeca Film Festival, of which Robert De Niro was a co-founder. But now, he said, he is largely operating in a stratosphere where people are unmoved by fame.
''People can say whatever they want, but at the end of the day, no one is buying a $10 million apartment because my dad is Robert De Niro,'' he said. ''Many of them have more money than my dad.''
His dad, for what it's worth, says he always tries to help his son. ''I put him in touch with people,'' Robert De Niro said. ''Sometimes they don't even call him back.''
Several early skeptics who dismissed Raphael De Niro's credentials have become fans. Developers including Steve Witkoff, who converted the Cipriani building at 55 Wall Street, and Richard Born, who built the Richard Meier towers on Manhattan's West Side, count on him for his habits of arriving five minutes early to appointments, returning their calls faster than anyone else and playing down his pedigree.
''Anybody can be out there selling a home when times are good,'' said Gerard Longo, another major developer, for whom Mr. De Niro has sold at least $80 million in condominiums over the past two years. ''He has clearly become a go-to guy in tough times.''
THE De Niros never had a portfolio to rival the Trumps, or the blended fortunes of the Tishmans and the Speyers, but real estate runs deep in De Niro blood. The family, Raphael De Niro said, talked about real estate as ''an art, like finding jewels where people may not have found them.''
Driving through the still-sleepy downtown streets that Wednesday morning, Mr. De Niro talked about how his father's parents were involved in the conversion of SoHo from a manufacturing district into an artists' haven decades ago. His grandmother Virginia Admiral, who lived and taught art classes in the loft she renovated at Spring and Lafayette Streets, he recalled, ''would always say that all great fortunes were built on real estate.'' His great-uncle Jack DeNiro, often called by the family ''Jack of All Trades,'' worked in commercial and residential real estate here and in Florida.
Raphael's mother, the actress Diahnne Abbott, renovated the West Village town house the family bought in the 1970s, removing ugly metal cabinets and painting over lime-green walls. Robert De Niro had transformed a raw two-story space at the top of 110 Hudson Street, and he was buying up a series of buildings in TriBeCa that he converted to restaurants, offices and, eventually, the hotel.
Raphael was 10 in 1986 when he moved to Manhattan -- to that ivy-covered town house -- from what he remembers as the idyllic streets of Brentwood, Calif. When he talks about this, Mr. De Niro's face tightens. He describes moving back to New York City, commuting on the subway uptown to the Bank Street Grammar School, and being ''thrown into the fire.'' He hesitates before describing how he remembered New York City in the 1980s.
''It was dirty,'' he said. ''It was loud. There was a lot of drug use. There were a lot of murders.''
His parents, and his paternal grandparents, were divorced, but he had a cocoon of relatives whose homes formed ''a huge triangle.'' He lived on one corner of the triangle with his mother and sister, Drena De Niro, in the town house near the James J. Walker Park. He headed to SoHo to run errands for his grandmother while she was teaching, or to play at his grandfather's studio, filled with art and poetry. The third point of the triangle was his father's growing TriBeCa empire: Raphael still remembers conversations about how the bar for Tribeca Grill should look, and about the design of offices for film companies at 375 Greenwich Street.
(He and Ms. DeMatos, whom he met through a nightclub owner in 2004 and married in the Bahamas in 2008, live a few blocks up Greenwich, in a 2,500-square-foot apartment they bought for $2.9 million in 2009; they are expecting their second child in March.)
The De Niros were always wealthy, but Raphael always worked. From age 10, he helped set up tables at street fairs. As a teenager, he folded and unfolded rugs at a store on Bleecker Street. He briefly was a doorman at a building in the East 70s, until residents found out his father's identity.
There also were somewhat more glamorous jobs, though Mr. De Niro said that ''seeing it from my perspective as a kid didn't make it that glamorous.'' He glued clamshells onto a set for the 1993 movie ''A Bronx Tale,'' which his father directed. He was a production assistant on ''Witness to the Mob,'' a 1998 television movie about Salvatore (''Sammy the Bull'') Gravano, which his father produced. He appeared in films starring his father, like ''Awakenings'' and ''Raging Bull.''
Chuck Low, an actor, a downtown developer and a friend of Robert De Niro's, said he thought Raphael could succeed as a professional actor, but knew that he was not interested. In 1995, Mr. Low took him, instead, to a Wall Street trading floor; Mr. De Niro shakes his head at the recollection.
''There was something about it I didn't like,'' he said. ''I come from a world of artists and hippies and liberals.''
When he was younger, he was tormented by the New York tabloids.
In 1991, when he was 15, newspapers reported his arrest for spraying graffiti on an N train in the Canal Street station. Asked about the incident, Mr. De Niro said his juvenile record was sealed and should never have been published, adding, ''I was totally a victim of my circumstances.''
The New York Post reported in 1998 that he got into a fistfight outside the nightclub Veruka, and four years later that he got angry at a friend for spending too much time in the bathroom at Wye Bar. ''I was never arrested; I was never convicted of anything,'' he said of these episodes. ''I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.''
Through what Mr. Low called Raphael's ''growing pains,'' the young man started thinking more seriously about real estate (he had taken courses on the subject at New York University before dropping out). When Mr. De Niro talked about properties, Mr. Low recalled, he ''asked the right questions.''
IN 2003, Mr. De Niro started helping his father with plans for the Greenwich Hotel. Mr. Born, a partner on the project, said Raphael back then seemed to be ''a little bit of a wild kid'' and he at first thought of him as ''our partner's son who initially wanted to sit in on meetings.''
Then the younger De Niro started asking questions. Why would the hotel ask movie stars paying $500 a night to pay for incidentals like minibar snacks? Why not provide a professional gym rather than a typical hotel treadmill and weight stand, given that many guests had to stay in shape as part of their profession?
''He clearly knows a lot of celebrities and understands their lifestyle,'' said Mr. Born, adding that he started finding the son's input ''materially beneficial.''
Mr. De Niro began thinking about becoming a broker. In 2004, he met Gary Cannatta, an executive vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, through a friend over drinks. Mr. Cannatta encouraged Mr. De Niro to get his broker's license and hired him later that year.
His first exclusive listing was 303 Mercer Street, a three-bedroom, two-bath apartment owned by the model Carmen Kass, the girlfriend of a good friend. Mr. De Niro sold it for $1.65 million, which he said was less than the $1.8 million asking price but more than what Ms. Kass had paid, which was about $900,000. Also in 2005, he helped the magician David Blaine find a pied-a-terre in Chinatown for $1.675 million, which Mr. Blaine said in an interview was ''exactly what I needed.''
On his first anniversary at Prudential Douglas Elliman, Dottie Herman, the chief executive, wrote him a personal note: ''I couldn't be prouder to have someone like you in our company.''
Mr. De Niro was gracious but cautious. He initially turned down Ms. Herman's request to appear in Avenue magazine, and he had passed up the chance to represent his father on a 2004 deal.
Developers started seeking him out. Mr. Born, who had met Mr. De Niro while working on the hotel, asked him in May 2008 to find a buyer for a 12-room unfinished duplex penthouse at 166 Perry Street. The sale closed last March for $14.8 million (far from the asking price of $24 million for the completed apartment, but a rare luxury sale at the time). ''He's the guy who pulls someone out of a hat,'' Mr. Born said.
Indeed, what people in the industry say is most impressive about Mr. De Niro is how his career thrived as the market tanked with the economy in 2007 and 2008.
Mr. Longo, who converted the Pearline Soap Factory in TriBeCa into condominiums, said he was hesitant, at first, to work with Mr. De Niro. He could not imagine how anyone, never mind a relative neophyte, could sell eight lavish 3,000-square-foot spaces in the stagnant climate of early 2008.
By late 2009, Mr. De Niro had sold them all, mainly to finance executives. The prices were discounted 15 percent to 35 percent from the original asking price, according to StreetEasy.com. Justin Timberlake bought one of the apartments.
So when Mr. Longo finished the nearby Fairchild apartment building at 55 Vestry Street in April 2009, he enlisted Mr. De Niro to sell its 21 apartments, most priced from $2.5 million to $5 million. Mr. De Niro has sold 18. The average discount has been 10.2 percent, according to StreetEasy.
Mr. Longo said he most admired Mr. De Niro's emphasis on making the buildings ''a part of the fabric of the community.'' He had Mr. Longo rent a booth at the Tribeca Film Festival to advertise the project and donate money to Tribeca Partners, which cleans up neighborhood streets. He also supplied buyers with information about local day care centers. ''No one was moving property, and he clearly was,'' Mr. Longo said.
NOW, Mr. De Niro is moving uptown, working stretches of Midtown, the Upper East and Upper West Sides and the ''gold coast'' apartments ringing Central Park. While driving north, he explained that ''$10-million-plus buyers want to be uptown.''
At the Time Warner Center, Mr. De Niro has a listing for a 4,800-square-foot apartment on the 76th floor with five bathrooms (asking price: $38 million). He was also selling an apartment two floors below -- that has been taken off the market -- with 3,000 square feet, three bathrooms and a view that is ''almost like being in an airplane'' (asking price: $18.5 million).
Standing in the silent halls of the sprawling 74th-floor space, Mr. De Niro pointed out the reservoir in Central Park and the bridges on the horizon that looked like Tinkertoy constructs; and, to the north, the seven-bedroom penthouse at the Park Laurel that he sold a year ago for $24 million (it was listed for $28 million).
These are never easy sells; with some high-end clients, he said, ''you have to swallow your pride.''
The son does not much resemble his father, but sometimes, when he is talking, or not, De Niro expressions familiar from the big screen appear in his face. Raphael said the two men talk nearly every day and ''have traveled the world extensively together'' -- they are clearly very close.
The elder Mr. De Niro said he did not push his son toward or away from real estate. ''I was very careful not to say anything to influence him,'' he said. ''As a parent, the most important thing is that he's happy with what he's doing.''
The younger Mr. De Niro can never be sure, of course, how much sellers -- or buyers -- care about his name. But these days, when he appears in the tabloids, it is almost always about real estate.

HEADLINE: And Now, the Cheerleader in Chief

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Hours before President Obama delivered his State of the Union address, a senior adviser to the president confided that his tone would be ''self-consciously optimistic.'' And so it was.
Gone was the president who told the nation in his inaugural speech that it was ''time to set aside childish things,'' and who spent much of his first two years bemoaning the mess his predecessor had left. In his place was an upbeat and forward-looking Mr. Obama, serving up rosy economic news (''The stock market has come roaring back'') and lauding America's greatness and can-do spirit. (''We do big things.'')
It was perhaps no accident that Mr. Obama took Lou Cannon's biography of that other optimist and purveyor of American exceptionalism, Ronald Reagan, with him to Hawaii over Christmas. Or that one of the Washington wise men the president consulted recently was Kenneth M. Duberstein, a chief of staff to President Reagan.
''Optimism,'' Mr. Duberstein said in an interview, ''is a force multiplier.'' 
One axiom of politics is that the optimistic candidate wins, as Jimmy Carter discovered after his so-called ''malaise'' speech (he never actually used the word) during the 1979 energy crisis. He lost to Mr. Reagan a year later. And people forget that Mr. Carter, the peanut-farming Georgia governor with the toothy grin, seemed the sunnier candidate in his 1976 campaign against Gerald Ford, who used his 1975 State of the Union address to inform Americans that ''the state of the union is not good.''
Still, happy talk can take a political leader only so far, and there are hazards in Mr. Obama's sudden surge of rhetorical sunshine, especially when nearly 1 in 10 Americans is out of work, the federal deficit exceeds $1 trillion and Mr. Obama's prescription -- targeted ''investment'' in areas like education, clean energy and high-speed rail -- requires spending of the sort that makes many Americans deeply uneasy.
''The risk is that people think you don't know what you're talking about,'' said Mr. Cannon, the Reagan biographer. ''Reagan thought that the bills they passed in 1981, the budget bill and the tax reduction bill, were going to bring in pretty quick prosperity, and then instead we went into a recession. That's why his ratings went down. There were a lot of Americans who thought he was talking through his hat.''
Many a politician has suffered when optimism collides with reality. In 2006, as Americans watched the bloodshed escalate in Iraq, George W. Bush insisted that the country had not descended into civil war; his party lost Congress that year. And Democrats felt the wrath of voters last fall after the ''recovery summer'' Mr. Obama promised did not pan out.
All presidents are cheerleaders in a sense; keeping Americans' spirits high is part of the job description. As David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior adviser, said, ''I don't think the American people are looking for the president to curl up in the fetal position and curse the darkness.''
The trick is for presidents to balance optimism with realism -- ''to convey optimism without illusions,'' in the words of Michael Waldman, who was chief speechwriter in the Clinton White House. There was considerable debate last week about whether Mr. Obama had struck the correct balance. (Mr. Axelrod, for the record, believes he did.)
''The problem with this speech is he's talking so much about winning the future that he's in danger of losing the present,'' said Richard Norton Smith, the presidential historian, who counts himself an Obama admirer. ''I could imagine millions of people out there watching that speech, thinking to themselves, 'Well, these are good ideas, but how is that going to get me a job?' ''
Some Republicans accused Mr. Obama of ignoring the facts. Peter Wehner, who advised Mr. Bush and is now a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center here, wrote that the president ''spoke as if he were living in an alternate universe -- one where a $14 trillion debt and trillion dollar-a-year deficit don't exist.'' Mr. Obama, he said, ''is misreading the public mood.''
Perhaps, but polls show the mood improving. Two years ago, 7 percent of Americans thought the economy was getting better, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll. As of this month, that figure is 30 percent -- not a knock-your-socks-off statistic, but one that provides a defensible foundation for lines like, ''We are poised for progress.''
Politically, such rhetoric is perfectly timed. Mr. Obama is setting up his re-election campaign, and after two years stuck in legislative battles, he needs a positive vision to mobilize voters. His paean to American greatness (''not just a place on a map, but a light to the world'') was part of that, and he responded forcefully to Republicans like Sarah Palin, who accuse the president of not embracing American exceptionalism, the idea that the United States is unique and superior to other nations.
''Part of it is clearly political,'' said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University historian, adding: ''In many ways the first two years he was like Carter -- he was just dealing with one crisis after another, and he sounded that way. And now I think he's trying to shift and sound more like Reagan.''
Mr. Axelrod hears neither Mr. Carter, nor Mr. Reagan, nor any president other than Mr. Obama. He draws a straight rhetorical line to the State of the Union address from earlier speeches like the heavily biographical 2004 keynote to the Democratic National Convention, in which Mr. Obama spoke of America as ''a magical place.''
The State of the Union address, Mr. Axelrod said, was not so much a shift but a ''matter of returning to first principles'' for a president who had to temper his rhetoric when his administration was ''functioning as a triage unit arriving in the middle of an economic calamity.''
Now that Mr. Obama has emerged from triage, his challenge is to convince the country that he can turn his rosy vision into reality. Implicit in his speech was a promise: If you agree with my ideas, this is the kind of country you can have. But Republicans in Congress already say they won't approve any more spending, which could result in gridlock on Capitol Hill. And if the fragile recovery teeters or slips, Mr. Obama could wind up looking like he tried to sell the nation a bill of goods.
Going forward, the president must also convince voters of something else: that he believes his own words. Mr. Reagan oozed an infectious optimism; he liked to tell the story of the boy who got a pile of manure for Christmas and declared, ''There must be a pony in here somewhere.'' Mr. Obama is more cautious, more cerebral by nature -- ''a little more head, a little less heart,'' as Mr. Cannon said.
Mr. Smith, the historian, said that what made Mr. Reagan so extraordinary was not that he told Americans ''we were made for great things,'' but that ''he made us believe it.'' Mr. Duberstein, the former Reagan chief of staff, drew on an old Reaganism to sum up Mr. Obama's situation.
''This,'' he said, ''is a trust-but-verify moment.''

HEADLINE: Calling for Restraint, Pentagon Faces Test of Influence With Ally

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER; Mark Landler contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The officer corps of Egypt's powerful military has been educated at defense colleges in the United States for 30 years. The Egyptian armed forces have about 1,000 American M1A1 Abrams tanks, which the United States allows to be built on Egyptian soil. Egypt permits the American military to stage major operations from its bases, and has always guaranteed the Americans passage through the Suez Canal.
The relationship between the Egyptian and American militaries is, in fact, so close that it was no surprise on Friday to find two dozen senior Egyptian military officials at the Pentagon, halfway through an annual week of meetings, lunches and dinners with their American counterparts. 
By the afternoon, the Egyptians had cut short the talks to return to Cairo, but not before a top Defense Department official, Alexander Vershbow, had urged them to exercise ''restraint,'' the Pentagon said.
It remained unclear on Saturday, as the Egyptian Army was deployed on the streets of Cairo for the first time in decades, to what degree the military would remain loyal to the embattled president, Hosni Mubarak.
The crisis has left the Obama administration to try to navigate a peaceful outcome and remain close to an important ally, and the military relationship could be crucial in that effort.
One fear was the possibility that, despite the Egyptian Army's seemingly passive stance on Saturday, the soldiers would begin firing on the protesters -- an action that would probably be seen as leading to an end to the army's legitimacy.
''If they shoot on the crowd, they could win tomorrow, and then there will be a revolt that will sweep them away,'' said Bruce O. Riedel, an expert on the Middle East and Asia at the Brookings Institution, who predicted that in any event Mr. Mubarak would step down.
A possible successor -- and a sign of how closely the military is intertwined with the ruling party -- is Omar Suleiman, the intelligence chief and a former general, who was sworn in as the new vice president. Mr. Suleiman is considered Mr. Mubarak's closest confidant and a hard-liner, although Obama administration officials say they consider him someone they can work with. In meetings with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, they say, he has shown substance and an ability to deliver on promises.
Mr. Riedel, who was an Egypt analyst at the C.I.A. when President Anwar el-Sadat was assassinated in 1981 and has since tracked the rise of Islamic extremism in that country, said that the Egyptian military would be a critical player in any deal to remove Mr. Mubarak from power.
Unlike the feared Egyptian police forces, which had mostly withdrawn from central Cairo on Saturday, the army is considered professional and a stable force in the country's politics. Egyptian men all serve in the army, which for the most part enjoys popular support.
Mr. Obama met Saturday afternoon with his national security team at the White House about the uprising, but the officials would not say what, if any, decisions had been reached or whether the administration was trying to negotiate a safe exit for Mr. Mubarak.
One former United States official who is close to the Obama administration, Martin S. Indyk, said that it was time for Mr. Mubarak to go, and that the Egyptian military could serve as a crucial transition power.
''What we have to focus on now is getting the military into a position where they can hold the ring for a moderate and legitimate political leadership to emerge,'' said Mr. Indyk, a Middle East peace negotiator in the Clinton administration.
Mr. Suleiman could announce that he would take control as president and hold elections within six months, Mr. Indyk said.
At the Pentagon on Saturday morning, American military officials said that the Egyptian Army was acting professionally and that they had no indications that it was swinging over en masse to the side of the uprising. At the same time, the officials noted, the army had not cracked down on the protests.
''They certainly haven't inflicted any harm on protesters,'' said Capt. John Kirby, a spokesman for Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ''They're focused mainly on protecting the institutions of government, as they should be.''
United States military officials said there was no formal line of communication between the Joint Chiefs and the Egyptian military, although they held out that possibility if the crisis deepened. Admiral Mullen had been scheduled to meet on Monday with Lt. Gen. Sami Hafez Enan, who is Egypt's defense chief and chief of staff of the Egyptian Army. But General Enan was the leader of the delegation of senior Egyptian officials that left abruptly for Cairo on Friday night.
For the Pentagon, the question is how much a military that the United States in large part pays for will be receptive to American influence. Since the 1978 Camp David accords, the United States has given Egypt $35 billion in military aid, making it the largest recipient of conventional American military and economic aid after Israel.
''Is it a force that will listen to us if there is a military takeover and we want them to move to a democratically elected government as soon as possible?'' said Anthony H. Cordesman, an expert on the Egyptian military at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''They will listen. But this is a very proud group of people. The fact that they will listen doesn't mean we can in any way leverage them.''
American military officials said on Friday that they had had no formal discussions with their Egyptian counterparts at the Pentagon about how to handle the uprising. ''In other words,'' said Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ''we didn't say anything to them about how they should handle it, and they didn't tell us about how they were going to handle it.''
But, General Cartwright said, ''hallway'' discussions did take place, and American military officials said contingency plans had been made should the American Embassy have to be evacuated.

HEADLINE: Crawling From the Wreckage Jan. 23-29

 BODY:
THE NEWS The 2008 financial crisis was an ''avoidable'' disaster caused by regulatory neglect, corporate bungling and heedless risk-taking by Wall Street, a federal investigation concluded. 
BEHIND THE NEWS The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission's report, backed by its six Democrats but not by its four Republicans, knocked down other theories, saying low interest rates, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and federal housing policies were not major culprits. Dissenters focused more blame on cheap money and the drive to increase homeownership.
THE NEWS Due in part to the weak economy, the federal budget deficit will hit nearly $1.5 trillion this year, the Congressional Budget Office predicted.
BEHIND THE NEWS Back in August, the office thought the deficit would shrink this year to $1.1 trillion. But that was before President Obama cut a deal with Republicans to extend lowered tax rates. Attention now is on discretionary spending: Mr. Obama proposed a five-year freeze, while Republicans called for deep cuts. Either way, the government will hit its debt ceiling soon, prompting another fight.
THE NEWS Housing prices, which had leveled off and even climbed a bit in mid-2010 after a three-year slump, have begun to slide again in earnest, with average prices in cities across the country falling to their lowest point in many years, Standard & Poor's reported.
BEHIND THE NEWS Analysts disagree over whether the dreaded ''double dip'' has arrived, but the trend is clear. Prices in 9 out of 20 metropolitan areas sank in November to new lows for this economic cycle. By contrast, China imposed rules to keep home prices there from rising too fast.
THE NEWS The Dow Jones industrial average briefly rose above 12,000 for the first time since June 2008, before the financial crisis hit. The gains did not last: Middle East tumult sent the index into retreat by the week's end.
BEHIND THE NEWS Wall Street is beginning to think that the worst is over and that the economy may finally be getting back on track. Corporate profits are healthy and nonfinancial companies are generally flush, analysts said. Still, as the Federal Reserve noted in deciding to continue its loose monetary policies, employment remains weak.
THE NEWS President Obama challenged Americans in his State of the Union address to unleash their creative spirit, set aside partisan differences and rally behind a goal of out-innovating and outcompeting other nations.
BEHIND THE NEWS Mr. Obama outlined what he called a plan to ''win the future'' -- investing in education and fields like high-speed rail, clean-energy technology and high-speed Internet to pave the way for tomorrow's jobs. ''We have to make America the best place on earth to do business,'' he said. ''That's how our people will prosper.''

ZERO-SUM FUTURE
American Power in an Age of Anxiety
By Gideon Rachman
340 pp. Simon & Schuster. $27
Gideon Rachman's ''Zero-Sum Future'' is slightly misnamed. Rachman, the chief foreign affairs columnist for The Financial Times, seems to believe that this future -- an Age of Anxiety -- is already here.
Its predecessor was an Age of Optimism, characterized by faith in free markets as the most efficient allocators of resources, in democracy as the most stable form of government, and in liberal individualism as a universal way of life. This age extended from 1991 to 2008. But since the financial crisis began, we have been in a period of ideological confusion, with no apparent exit. The win-win logic of the Age of Optimism -- in which an ever more efficient global market meant that everyone benefited from growing wealth -- has been replaced by a zero-sum game in which one nation's benefit comes at another's expense. 
''Zero-Sum Future'' is perhaps the best one-volume account now available of the huge post-Communist spread of personal freedom and economic prosperity. Rachman is warmly appreciative of its main characters, whether writers (Francis Fukuyama, Thomas Friedman), politicians (Margaret Thatcher, Bill Clinton), or innovators (Bill Gates).
He rightly begins his story in China, in 1978, with Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms; China's export income more than doubled over the next seven years. In that same year, authoritarian governments in Latin America began to fall, following on the demise of undemocratic regimes in Spain and Portugal. By the early '80s, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan were starting to free the animal spirits of the private sector from government control. Soon Mikhail Gorbachev, trying to inject some dynamism into the stagnant Soviet world, injected just enough to destroy it. And as European unification progressed, the continent that gave the world modern nationalism and imperialism seemed to be laying all our atavisms to rest.
To be sure, the era was hardly one of constant political exhilaration. Thatcher had a brutal streak, to say the least, and Reagan embraced authoritarians when it suited him. European unification was part of liberal globalization, but the way it was accomplished cannot be described as democratic. Economic reform in China went all too easily with bloody political repression.
Yet the happy version of global transformation was coherent and persuasive, and the magnificent expansion of wealth and freedom after 1991 swept all doubts away. During these years, Rachman was employed at The Economist, the signature publication of the Age of Optimism, just as the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, was its special jamboree. ''Most of my career,'' he writes, ''has been spent reporting on a world where things were steadily improving.'' His role as both observer and facilitator of the globalization consensus reminds you that this period was also a time of generational adventure. And in retrospect, it looks like a pretty great one.
Today, however, the rationality and impartiality of market mechanisms -- so crucial to the age's transformation and to its optimism -- are open to question. So, too, is economic freedom, now challenged by high-growth ''state capitalism'' in China and elsewhere. Even democracy has lost its gloss. Rachman laments these extraordinary changes, but when the book turns to analyzing our present Age of Anxiety, it seems to lose its scope and vigor.
''The promoters of free-market economics and democratic politics succumbed to intellectual arrogance and hubris,'' Rachman writes, which appears too private an explanation for an enormous global shift. Similarly, in his prescriptions, Rachman limits himself to advising ''Americans and Europeans.'' This is a curious departure from his otherwise rigorous internationalism. Surely one lesson of globalization is that it cannot be advanced, or even understood, as a story of Western power alone.

HEADLINE: Legislative Emergencies, Real Ones and the Governor's

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Ross Ramsey, the managing editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a regular column.
Abortion politics is back on center stage in Texas, with Gov. Rick Perry putting legislation that failed twice in the last four years on his list of top priorities for the Legislature.
It's up there with voter photo ID, state support for a balanced federal budget amendment to the United States Constitution, eminent domain and a ban on sanctuary cities. 
Why?
Timing is one reason -- it's harder for opponents to stop something at the start of a session. And there's an advantage to taking care of single-subject bills before the big stuff -- like the $15 billion to $27 billion budget shortfall and redistricting -- eats up the legislative bandwidth.
But there's more to this than timing. The governor is setting the agenda, using the early part of the session to serve up red meat to conservatives -- feeding the base. As a side benefit, he's also crowding out some of the headlines about the dire finances.
''We can't afford to give up the good fight until the day Roe v. Wade is nothing but a shameful footnote in our nation's history books,'' Mr. Perry said last weekend at an anti-abortion rally at the Capitol, when he announced that an abortion/ultrasound bill would go on the ''emergency items'' agenda.
Texas lawmakers can't consider legislation during the first 60 days of a session unless the governor declares that legislation an emergency. (Ignore the standard definition of that word: there is no standard of urgency or need required, simply the governor's say-so.)
The bill would require doctors to perform an ultrasound on a pregnant woman and display the images where she can see them shortly before an abortion is done. In addition, doctors would be required to amplify the fetal heartbeats so the pregnant woman could hear them.
Politicians often design their strategies around their most recent fights.
Two years ago, supporters of the legislation requiring voters to present photo IDs waited until the end of the session to bring it up for consideration. Democrats in the House killed the legislation by slowing consideration of everything that was in line in front of the voter ID bill, which pushed it past the deadline, and it never came to a vote.
This time, Mr. Perry put the legislation on the emergency list, and the Senate passed it Wednesday night and sent it to the House.
What's generally known in Austin as the ''sonogram bill'' has a similar history. This is the third time the legislation has been proposed. In 2007, it was passed by the Senate and was up for consideration at the end of the session in the House when the legislative clock ran out. In 2009, it failed when time expired.
Eminent-domain legislation died on the same 2009 House calendar, stuck in the queue as the deadline passed after days of protracted debate over mostly uncontested legislation -- a tactic called chubbing -- that braked legislative work to a near halt.
It should come as no surprise that the Republicans are in a hurry this time. Opponents can talk for weeks, and there will still be time to pass the bills.
Two years ago, the list of emergency items was boring by comparison: hurricane response, windstorm insurance reform, state school improvement and criminal justice financing. Mr. Perry put property-tax relief for elderly homeowners on the 2007 list in order to correct an oversight from a 2006 tax bill.
The five issues he picked for this session are all conservative candy. They'll get Republican lawmakers accustomed to party-line votes right away. And bringing the list in early gives conservative lawmakers a chance to work before opponents can use late-session parliamentary tricks to plug the pipeline.
Mr. Perry's critics are riled up, scratching at him for not including on his list a state budget that's dripping in red ink. Redistricting can't really get going until the detailed census numbers are available, weeks from now. There's no disagreement, however, that the state is short of what it needs to keep doing the things it's doing. The fight there has been over whether it's apocalyptic or just really horrible.
The proposals from the House and the Senate each cut around one dollar in six from the current budget and ignore growth in population and inflation. Mr. Perry and others argue that lawmakers are hard at work on that and couldn't finish their work in the first 60 days of the session even if they wanted to. It's too hard.
So it's not an emergency.

HEADLINE: RUSSIA: From Davos to Reality

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Last week was to have heralded a defining moment for Russia's forward-looking, Obama-admiring, iPad-toting president, Dmitri A. Medvedev. He would escape the shadow of his bare-knuckled mentor, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, by giving the keynote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. What better way for Mr. Medvedev to show that his country had an alluring future, while also burnishing his own credentials as a reformer?
But then a suicide bomber attacked the international arrivals terminal at the country's premier airport in Moscow on Monday, killing at least 35 people, including Westerners, and prompting headlines like this one, in a leading Russian newspaper: ''Calm, Like in Baghdad.'' 
In an instant, Mr. Medvedev's vision of a 21st-century Russia seemed almost beyond reach. It was as if the country's longstanding ills -- whether a seething Islamic insurgency in the south, a corrupt legal and security bureaucracy or just an innate tendency toward social disarray -- would be all but impossible to overcome.
Mr. Medvedev delayed his trip to Davos, then arrived to offer a speech that even some of his own supporters called lackluster. While proclaiming 10 principles that would anchor his policy of modernization, he also struck a note that harked back to the Soviet-style defensiveness of his predecessors. ''We are still learning and are ready to listen to friendly advice, but we do not need to be lectured,'' he said.
Throughout the centuries, Russia has lurched between transformation and consolidation, between embracing the West as the embodiment of change and snubbing it as a danger to what Russia already is. The eight years when Mr. Putin was president, until 2008, were widely seen as a time when the nation focused on stabilization, turning inward as it recovered from the traumatic decade after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.
But lately, the elite has started to fear that stability alone cannot work, that it is calcifying into stagnation. The hope is that innovation from the outside will remedy that.
Mr. Medvedev has responded by proclaiming -- and staking his tenure on -- an overt policy of ''modernizatsiya'' (a Russian word that needs no translation). He regularly invokes the term in a range of contexts, including initiatives to curb corruption and a proposal for a high-technology center outside Moscow modeled on Silicon Valley. When PepsiCo recently bought a major Russian beverage company and promised to upgrade factories, that, too, was an example.
Terrorism, of course, is a threat to the revitalization of any country. But it is not the only persistent problem bedeviling Russia's march forward. Even before the airport suicide attack, Mr. Medvedev's visit to Davos -- as well as his modernization policy over all -- had been dogged by concerns about Russia's capricious legal system, and about whether it was scaring away foreigners. Those rose to the fore just last month, when Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, formerly Russia's richest man, was convicted in a second trial and sentenced to prison until 2017.
Mr. Khodorkovsky was arrested in 2003 after defying Mr. Putin by supporting opposition political parties. His case has long been viewed as emblematic of how the authorities manipulate the courts to punish critics -- a Soviet practice that endures, even in the face of Mr. Medvedev's pledge to tackle what he has acknowledged is Russia's bent toward so-called legal nihilism.
At Davos, Mr. Medvedev tried to play down unease about the case. ''I think that any investor -- be it a Russian or an American investor -- should abide by the law,'' he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. ''Otherwise he can get a prison sentence, the way it happened with Khodorkovsky, and as was the case with Bernard Madoff, who got a longer sentence.''
Still, the combination of the airport suicide bombing and the Khodorkovsky verdict underscored the challenges confronting Mr. Medvedev. Just as daunting, he has to prove that he has the political heft to follow through on his pledges. His Davos audience may have had an obvious question: What does Mr. Putin think about all this?
Russians view Mr. Putin as their paramount leader, and polls indicate that they harbor doubts about whether Mr. Medvedev wields real authority. Mr. Putin speaks of modernization far less often than Mr. Medvedev does, leaving the impression that it is a Medvedev pet project that might not go anywhere.
It is not even apparent how much longer Mr. Medvedev will be president. The election is next year, and he seems to want another term. But if Mr. Putin decides that he wants the job again, as is quite possible, then Mr. Medvedev is expected to step aside. Both men, who say they rule as a tandem, have indicated that they would not run against one another.
''It is clear that Putin has not yet told his associate whether he will let him have a second term,'' wrote a political commentator, Dmitriy Travin of the Center for Modernization Studies at the European University at St. Petersburg. ''But since Medvedev himself does not know, what are his 10 Davos principles worth? One can lay out 100 principles, provided his speechwriters work well. But they would have nothing to do with reality.''
Igor Y. Yurgens, an informal adviser to Mr. Medvedev who heads a research institute with ties to the Kremlin's progressive wing, said the suicide bombing and the Khodorkovsky verdict were jarring because they illustrated how the Russian leadership was so often ensnared in crises or preoccupied with tackling deep-rooted problems left over from the Soviet era.
Mr. Yurgens said Mr. Medvedev did not come across well at Davos, most likely because it was hard for him to immerse himself in the back-slapping atmosphere of a business retreat right after repeated meetings with generals and intelligence officials about terrorism. Nevertheless, Mr. Yurgens said, Mr. Medvedev has no choice but to shake up the country, just as young reformers have done in Russia since Peter the Great in the 18th century.
''This is a civilizational shift,'' Mr. Yurgens said. ''You have to tell a society that has been craving stability that stability will not save you. You need to take risks and go and reform yourself. Stability is not your panacea. Without that, we will have stagnation and go back to where we were in 1980. Brezhnev, Act II.''

HEADLINE: The Power Of the Platform

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
SIZE is the enemy of growth. It is one of the unwritten laws of business, a matter of simple percentages. After all, when a company has $1 billion in yearly sales, an extra $1 billion doubles its size. Add $1 billion in new business to a $10 billion-a-year company, and it amounts to just 10 percent growth. The size-growth tradeoff seems inevitable, an inescapable force like gravity.
Try telling that to Apple, the corporate giant that two weeks ago reported a 71 percent jump in quarterly sales. Apple generates revenue at the rate of $100 billion a year. Its chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, who went on medical leave this month, is ailing, but the company is certainly not. 
Hit products like the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad are fueling Apple's logic-defying growth. The latest entry -- the iPad, introduced in April -- is on track to deliver $15 billion to $20 billion in revenue in its first full year of sales, estimates A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. At that size, if the iPad were a stand-alone company, it would rank within the top third of the Fortune 500.
The software and services that work on Apple's hit products are accelerating its extraordinary expansion. Apple provides the underlying technology and marketplace: iTunes software and the iTunes Store for managing, downloading and buying music and media; iPhone and iPad software for creating applications; and the App Store for sampling and buying them.
The more people buy iPhones and iPads, the more software developers and media companies want to write applications for them, as various as games and digital magazines. And consumers are more likely to buy iPhones and iPads when more entertainment and information applications are available on them. The combination of hardware, software and services is what corporate executives, economists and analysts call a platform. Successful technology platforms sustain and reinforce growth. And this self-reinforcing cycle is known as a network effect. It helps the platform owner and raises a barrier to competitors.
''Apple has hit that magical combination of gradually shifting from a product to a platform strategy,'' says Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T. and author of ''Staying Power: Six Enduring Principles for Managing Strategy and Innovation in an Uncertain World'' (Oxford University Press, 2010).
Successful platforms aren't confined to the technology industry. America's interstate highway system, built by the government, could also be seen as platform. The more that people traveled it, the more opportunity it created for businesses and towns linked to its transportation network -- and the larger the market for Detroit automakers. A Barbie doll, Mr. Cusumano notes, qualifies as a platform, too. Legions of outside suppliers make clothes, accessories and toys for the doll, while online Barbie fan clubs nurture sales.
Still, the technology business -- with its interconnected hardware, software and networks -- tends to be where platform strategies are most prevalent and the payoff greatest. In the corporate market, I.B.M. is pursuing a platform strategy largely focused on its Websphere Internet-based software, using I.B.M. programming tools, technology services and computers. Oracle has built a rival computing platform, surrounding its database software with business applications and hardware.
Google's search service, combined with its in-house advertising marketplace, is the leading Internet platform strategy. In personal computers, Microsoft has been the platform-strategy master. Its Windows operating system running Microsoft's Office productivity applications is probably the most lucrative product platform in history.
Microsoft triumphed in the PC industry, analysts say, by fostering an ecosystem of software developers and hardware makers that relied on the company. Apple, the early leader in PCs, fell behind, despite some stellar products, because it made mostly its own hardware and software, and did not nurture a large community of mutually dependent partners, analysts say.
Things look different for Apple in the market for mobile devices. There is some debate whether Apple has become a platform strategist by design or by default: When it introduced the iPhone in 2007, Apple did not have software tools for outside developers to make applications. That came in 2008.
''The iPhone was such a great product that lots of people wanted to write applications for it,'' says Marco Iansiti, a professor at the Harvard Business School. ''This was a case of the hit leading to the platform, and not necessarily voluntarily for Apple.''
These days, Apple is a platform player, though it is taking a hybrid approach. It has courted outside partners and suppliers but has fairly strict rules for how applications look and behave in its devices. Apple is offering users not just cool gadgets but also the software that glues together their digital lives -- computing, online information gathering and entertainment. It all works better together, the company says, so a person's second or third Apple product will make the first and second device more useful. The strategy is working so far. Even sales of MacBook notebooks were up 34 percent in the recent quarter, far faster growth than in the overall PC industry.
The company is on a roll, Apple enthusiasts say, and it still holds relatively modest shares of huge markets -- less than 20 percent for smartphones, and 4 percent for PC's globally, for example.
BUT concerns lie ahead. And the biggest may be a platform challenge from Google. The iPhone redefined the smartphone, but handsets using Google's Android software are fast attracting users and developers. In 2009, some 25 million iPhones were shipped, compared with about 8 million phones running Android. Last year, Android shipments reached 61 million, compared with about 48 million iPhones, estimates Sanford C. Bernstein.
Like Microsoft in the PC industry, Google supplies the animating software for smartphones but not the hardware. And, also like Microsoft in PCs, it works with many hardware makers, who sell handsets to many mobile carriers.
Until this month, when it added Verizon, Apple sold to just one carrier, AT&T, limiting its distribution -- and, analysts say, the size of the head start it had over Android. In smartphones, like PCs, Apple makes both the hardware and software itself.
''I don't see any problems yet, but the long-term issue for Apple is whether it can keep it up or will its economics break down,'' said David Eiswert, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Global Technology fund, whose largest single holding is Apple.
In one question, Mr. Eiswert sums up the risk: ''Will we eventually see the PC model all over again in this market?''

HEADLINE: The Tea Party Wags the Dog

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
ANY lingering doubts about Barack Obama's determination to appropriate Ronald Reagan's political spirit evaporated just before the State of the Union. No American brand is more associated with Reagan than General Electric, and it was that corporation's chief executive, Jeffrey Immelt, who popped up as the president's new wingman when the White House rolled out its latest jobs initiative on Jan. 21. Obama's speech on Tuesday, with its celebration of the nation's can-do capitalist ingenuity, moved him still closer to Reagan's sweet spot as a national cheerleader. The president even offered a remix of the old Reagan-era G.E. jingle ''We bring good things to life'' -- now traded up to the grander ''We do big things.'' 
Obama's rhetorical Morning in America is exquisitely timed to coincide with the Gipper's centennial -- and, of course, the unacknowledged start of his own 2012 re-election campaign. It's remarkable how completely the G.O.P. has ceded the optimism of its patron saint to the president just as the country prepares for a deluge of Reaganiana. Obama's post-New Year's surge past a 50 percent approval rating -- well ahead of both Reagan's and Bill Clinton's comeback trajectories after their respective midterm shellackings -- may have only just begun.
There was no drama to Obama's address -- just a unifying theme, at long last, as he reasserted the role of government in rebooting and rebuilding the country for a new century and putting Americans back to work. The president wisely left any theatrics to his adversaries, and, as always, they were happy to oblige.
This time we were spared a ''You lie!'' But once Obama segued into a rambling laundry list and the ''prom night'' bipartisan photo ops lost their comic novelty, the night's storyline inevitably shifted to the reliable diva antics of Michele Bachmann, the founder of the House's Tea Party Caucus. For all the Republican male establishment's harrumphing, it couldn't derail her plan to hijack the party's designated State of the Union response with one of her own. More Katherine Harris than Sarah Palin, Bachmann is far more riveting television bait than Paul Ryan, the bland congressman officially assigned the Bobby Jindal memorial slot after the New Jersey governor Chris Christie was savvy enough to take a pass.
The G.O.P. grandees' consternation was palpable. Earlier in the day Bachmann had dispatched an e-mail announcing that her speech would be carried live by Fox News. But when the time came, Fox relegated the live feed to its Web site, forcing viewers to scurry to CNN, of all places, and delaying its own television recap until after prime time in the East. Rupert Murdoch's other major organ, The Wall Street Journal, toed the same line, burying Bachmann's speech in a half-sentence in its print edition the next morning. By then, John Boehner, seconding the disdain of Eric Cantor, was telling reporters that he hadn't watched Bachmann because of ''other obligations.''
What were they all afraid of? The answer cuts to the crux of the right's plight less than three months after its supposed restoration. Having sold itself in 2010 as the uncompromising champion of Tea Party-fueled fiscal austerity, the enhanced G.O.P. caucus arrived in Washington in 2011 to discover that most Americans prefer compromise to confrontation and favor balanced budgets in name only.
A CNN poll this month found that just one American in five regards deficit reduction as pressing enough to justify cuts to Social Security and Medicare. Only one in four would choose balancing the budget if it meant reducing education programs. Indeed, a new Gallup poll reveals that there's exactly one category of government spending that a majority of voters favors slicing -- foreign aid (which amounts to some 1 percent of the budget). Incredible as it sounds, even current government outlays to science, the arts, farmers and antipoverty programs still enjoy 50 percent-plus support.
Bachmann, like such other newly empowered Tea Party tribunes as Rand Paul and Jim DeMint, rattles G.O.P. leaders because she doesn't pull punches in specifying how she would wield an ax. The only public opinion she cares about is that of her base. But as it turned out, Bachmann specified no cuts on Tuesday night, if only because she was too busy attacking Obama with unreconstructed pre-Tucson vitriol. In the end, her substance differed little from Ryan's. She chastised government spending six times (vs. Ryan's 13), and, like him, mentioned the twin federal money pits -- Social Security and Medicare -- not once. For a night anyway, these G.O.P. fiscal hawks were actually less forthright about entitlements than the Democratic president, who at least paid lip service to someday finding ''a bipartisan solution to strengthen Social Security.''
This couldn't last -- and didn't. Within 48 hours, other congressional Republicans were filling in some of the blanks left by Bachmann and Ryan, from privatizing Medicare to eliminating the government agency that regulates product safety. Perhaps the fresh crop of G.O.P. revolutionaries has been too busy revisiting 1776 to study the history of Newt Gingrich's swaggering revolution of 1995. In January of that year, 49 percent of Americans approved and 22 percent opposed the incoming Republican Congress's plans, according to the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll at the time. But as soon as the plans' details emerged, those numbers started to flip. By October 35 percent approved of G.O.P. policies and 45 percent did not. That was a month before the first of the two government shutdowns that put Clinton back on top.
But in 2011, it's not just the revelation of cuts to specific popular programs that threatens to turn Americans against the Republican Congress. New polls show that Americans don't even buy the principles behind these specifics. To hear the G.O.P. wail about it, you'd think the entire country was obsessed with the federal debt -- cited 12 times in Ryan's under-11-minute speech. But only 18 percent of Americans chose the deficit as a top priority for Washington in the most recent NBC/Journal survey and only 14 percent did in the New York Times/CBS News poll. Job creation was by far the top choice -- at 43 percent (Times/CBS) and 34 percent (NBC/Journal).
Health care was a low-ranked priority too in those polls. And for all the right's apocalyptic rants about the national horror of ''Obamacare,'' most polls continue to show that Americans are evenly divided about the law and that only a small minority favors its complete repeal (only one in four Americans in the latest Associated Press/GfK survey). The surest indicator that voters are not as inflamed about either the deficit or ''Obamacare'' as the right keeps claiming can be found in Karl Rove's Wall Street Journal musings. To argue that Americans share his two obsessions, Rove now is reduced to citing polls from either Fox or a Brand X called Resurgent Republic, which he helpfully identifies as ''a group I helped form.''
Obama must be laughing about how the party that spent a year hammering him for focusing on health care over jobs is now committing the same supposed sin. And one can only imagine his astonishment on Tuesday night, when the G.O.P. respondents to his speech each played Jimmy Carter to his Reagan by offering a grim double-feature of malaise and American decline. Hardly had the president extolled record corporate profits and a soaring stock market in his selectively rosy spin on the economy, than Ryan, who has the television manner of a solicitous funeral home director, was darkly warning that America could be the next Greece. Bachmann channeled Glenn Beck to argue that we are living in a nascent police state where government ''tells us which light bulbs to buy'' (G.E.'s, presumably).
The most revealing moment in either Republican response, though, came from Ryan, who, as chairman of the House Budget Committee, implicitly threatened another government shutdown, or catastrophic fiscal meltdown, if the House majority doesn't get its way. ''The president is now urging Congress to increase the debt limit,'' he said with distaste, referring to the vote required possibly as soon as March to allow the Treasury to keep paying its bills. Should the House majority hold that vote hostage to its vision of the budget, it will throw the markets into turmoil and upend our still-embryonic recovery.
It tells you all you need to know about Ryan's tilt to the right that, for all his professed disapproval of increasing the debt limit during an Obama administration, he voted to do sotwice himself during the gushing deficits of the Bush years. Funny he didn't mention that Tuesday night. It tells you all you need to know about the G.O.P.'s overall tilt to the right that not just the Tea Party is making barely veiled threats to play dangerous political games with the debt limit. Mitch McConnell and Cantor did so last weekend, as have a plethora of potential 2012 presidential candidates, from Tim Pawlenty to Gingrich. The Bachmann-Beck-Palin tail is now firmly wagging the Republican dog.
Like virtually every other week since the shellacking, the State of the Union week was another salutary one for Obama. But the state of the union itself could yet be in the hands of radicals whose eagerness to see the president fail is outstripped only by their zeal to make an ideological point, even if it forces America into default.

HEADLINE: The Sudden Uprising in Egypt Unsettles Worldwide Markets

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
On Wall Street, it is what is known as an exogenous event -- a sudden political or economic jolt that cannot be predicted or modeled but sends shockwaves rippling through global markets.
Investors have largely shrugged off several of these unexpected developments recently, including the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, but the situation in Egypt has the potential to cause more widespread uncertainty, especially if oil and other commodities keep surging or the unrest spreads to more countries in the Middle East.
While Egypt's banks and stock market were closed because of the protests there, other Middle Eastern markets declined in trading Sunday, with shares falling by 4.3 percent in Dubai, 3.7 percent in Abu Dhabi and 2.9 percent in Qatar. 
By early Monday morning, Asian markets were also trending lower, with Japan's Nikkei index falling 1.5 percent, while in South Korea, the Kospi index slid 1.4 percent.
Last week, the Dow Jones industrial average nearly surpassed the closely watched 12,000 level, but fell 166 points in late trading Friday as the protests in Egypt intensified and oil prices jumped 3.7 percent to $89.34.
With the United States economy seeming to gain a foothold only recently -- government data released Friday showed the economy grew by 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 -- a sustained increase in oil prices could choke growth, analysts said. It could also undermine the more general optimism that lifted the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by 1.5 percent in January, after a 12.8 percent jump in 2010.
''A one-dollar, one-day increase in a barrel of oil takes $12 million out of the U.S. economy,'' said Jason S. Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington research group. ''If tensions in the Mideast cause oil prices to rise by $5 for even just three months, over $5 billion dollars will leave the U.S. economy. Obviously, this is not a strategy for creating new jobs.''
In early electronic trading on the Nymex oil futures market Sunday night, prices edged higher to $90.23 a barrel.
Until now, the stock market in the United States has defied several outside threats, including the rising risk of food inflation, interest rate increases in China, and sovereign debt troubles in Europe, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of Standard & Poor's Equity Research.
''But as is usually the case, a boxer never gets knocked out by a punch he's looking for,'' he said. ''This could be what triggers the decline. Geopolitical events are very, very hard to model.''
Egypt is not an oil exporter, nor is its stock market a regional heavyweight. As the home of the Suez Canal and the nearby Sumed pipeline, however, it is one of a handful of spots classified as World Oil Transit Chokepoints by the Energy Department, and events there can have an outsize impact on global energy prices.
The 141-year-old canal is just 1,000 feet wide at its narrowest, and it cannot handle supertankers, forcing shippers to rely on the pipeline or smaller vessels to move the crude.
Roughly 2.9 millions barrels of oil a day, 2.6 percent of global production, passed through the canal and the pipeline in 2009, the Energy Department said.
As a percentage of world oil demand, that may not sound like much, said William H. Brown III, a former Wall Street energy analyst who consults for hedge funds and financial institutions.
''But prices are determined at the margin and that's a lot of oil in markets these days,'' said Mr. Brown, who estimates global spare production capacity at 2.5 million barrels, the bulk of it in Saudi Arabia.
While prices are set globally, the immediate impact of any interruption would be felt primarily in Europe, which relies heavily on jet fuel, heating oil and other distillates refined in the Middle East and shipped via the canal and pipeline. Israel is also a major importer of Egyptian natural gas under a pact that dates to the 1978 Camp David accords.
Egypt is a major player in the global grain market, importing more wheat than any other country. Some analysts have speculated that Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries might increase grain purchases to placate angry consumers, which could eventually push wheat prices higher.
Given the confrontations with authorities in Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, many analysts expect oil prices, and global markets, to remain volatile in the coming days, even as the opposition in Egypt rallies around Mohamed ElBaradei.
''I would expect regional markets to remain very unsettled because we don't look any closer to a political resolution than we did on Friday,'' said Ann Wyman, head of emerging markets research in Europe for Nomura. ''Instability in the Middle East makes global markets uncomfortable. We've entered a new and unpredictable phase of transitioning governments in the Middle East.''
Still, a few investors are looking for opportunities in the Middle East and Egypt itself despite the declines there and the expected instability. Egyptian stocks are inexpensive compared with shares in other markets, said David Marcus, chief investment officer of Evermore Global Advisors. ''This is one of the oldest economies on earth.''
''We have to start doing our homework,'' he added, noting that another troubled Mediterranean bourse, in Athens, has rallied sharply this year, after Greece's near-default in 2010. ''Egypt is pulling down the region because people panic and don't ask questions. That makes us much more interested.''

HEADLINE: BIGGER LOSS SEEN AT AFGHAN BANK

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN and JAMES RISEN; Rod Nordland and Ray Rivera contributed reporting from Kabul, and an Afghan employee of The New York Times from Helmand Province.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- Fraud and mismanagement at Afghanistan's largest bank have resulted in potential losses of as much as $900 million -- three times previous estimates -- heightening concerns that the bank could collapse and trigger a broad financial panic in Afghanistan, according to American, European and Afghan officials.
The extent of these losses make it clear that keeping the bank afloat -- something the government has said it is determined to do -- would require large infusions of cash from an already strained budget.
Banking specialists, businessmen and government officials now fear that word of Kabul Bank's troubles could prompt a run on solvent banks, destroying the country's nascent banking system and shaking the confidence of Western donors already questioning the level of their commitment to Afghanistan. 
The scandal has severe political and security implications. Investigators and Afghan businessmen believe that much of the money has gone into the pockets of a small group of privileged and politically connected Afghans, preventing earlier scrutiny of the bank's dealings.
The spotlight on how political and economic interests in Afghanistan are intertwined threatens to further undermine President Hamid Karzai's government. The bank is also the prime conduit for paying Afghan security forces, leaving the American military, which pays the majority of the salaries, looking for new banks to process the $1.5 billion payroll.
As Afghan regulators struggle to find out where the money went, many officials and international monitors concede that the missing millions may never be recovered, raising questions of how the losses could be replaced to keep the bank from failing.
Afghan officials and businessmen have said the money was invested in a real estate bubble that has since burst in Dubai, as well as in dubious projects and donations to politicians in Afghanistan. Millions of dollars have yet to be traced, and some of the money seems to have gone to front companies or individuals and then disappeared.
The Afghan Central Bank and American officials are conducting their own parallel investigations, but the problems are so serious that the International Monetary Fund has not yet renewed an assistance program to Afghanistan that expired in September, threatening an essential pillar of support to a government reliant on international largess as it battles a nine-year insurgency.
Many donor countries may have to delay aid to Afghanistan because of their own requirements that money go only to countries with I.M.F. programs in good standing, Western diplomats said.
Several officials described the bank as ''too big to fail,'' referring to its role in paying the salaries of hundreds of thousands of government employees.
While Afghan and American officials depict a crisis far worse than has been made public, State Department cables released by WikiLeaks show that Afghan and Western regulators were aware of many of the problems, but were most focused on the problem of terrorist financing, rather than the fraud scheme that was the main problem at Kabul Bank.
A stream of complaints about the bank's practices -- many of them the problems that now threaten the bank's survival -- are dutifully recorded in the cables, but diplomats, at least in 2009 and early 2010, seemed not to have realized the profound effect they could have on the financial system as a whole.
Although other banks here have had questionable loan practices, so far it is only Kabul Bank -- where what amounts to an enormous fraud scheme was conducted over a period of years -- whose troubles are sending tremors through the Afghan business community and worrying Western donors.
Deloitte, a top United States accounting firm that had staffers in the Central Bank under a United States government contract over the last several years, either did not know or did not mention to American authorities that it had any inkling of serious irregularities at Kabul Bank. Deloitte was not responsible for auditing the bank's books; a spokesman for Deloitte did not respond to requests for comment.
In an interview this weekend, Mahmoud Karzai, President Karzai's brother and a prominent investor in the Kabul Bank, said that the new president of Kabul Bank, Masood Musa Ghazi, told him in the last several days that there were approximately $800 million in loans still outstanding. These are potentially unrecoverable. Mr. Karzai said Mr. Ghazi told him that of that $800 million, the bank's new management has negotiated agreements for the repayment of about $300 million, but little has been repaid.
Mr. Ghazi, who was appointed after the Central Bank forced a change in the bank's management last fall, did not respond to phone calls or e-mails seeking comment, nor did anyone at Afghanistan's Central Bank.
Kabul Bank has extensive links to senior people in the Afghan government. In addition to Mahmoud Karzai, other shareholders included Haseen Fahim, the brother of the first vice president, and several associates of the family from the north of Afghanistan. Afghan officials said the bank poured millions into President Karzai's election campaign.
It is the loans and personal grants made by the bank to powerful people, including government ministers, that could prove the most explosive, Western and Afghan officials said. ''If people who are thought to be clean and who were held up as 'good' by Western countries suddenly are caught with their fingers in the till, it will cause questions from donors,'' said a Western official in Kabul. ''They will say, 'Why are we here?' ''
Mahmoud Karzai said that he believed the bank's former chairman, Sherkhan Farnood, was responsible for the problems at the bank, saying that he often moved large amounts of money out of the bank on his own, with no oversight. Mr. Farnood could not be reached for comment on Sunday, and has declined to comment in the past. Mr. Karzai and Mr. Farnood were previously business partners, but had a falling-out over the operation of Kabul Bank.
While he was in charge, Mr. Farnood had total control over what loans were made and what money was moved out of Kabul Bank, Mr. Karzai said. He said he was told by the bank's managers that Mr. Farnood took about $98 million out of Kabul Bank to finance the purchase and subsequent operations of Pamir Airways, a small passenger airline in Afghanistan.
In a cable from Sept. 26, 2009, posted by WikiLeaks, American diplomats said that competitor airlines complained that ''Kabul Bank is using its deposit base to subsidize Pamir Air without its depositors' knowledge in an attempt to drive competitors out of business.''
Mr. Karzai said that Mr. Farnood had been given space at Kabul Bank, where he was supposed to be helping the new management find the bank's missing money.
''I think the bank is working with him to figure out what happened to the money, because he knows whom he lent it to and he knows where it is,'' Mr. Karzai said. A spokeswoman for the United States Treasury Department in Washington declined to comment on the American inquiry.
''The situation of Kabul Bank is extremely serious,'' said a Western diplomat in Kabul. ''What you can observe is that the loans were either to fictive operators who did not exist or they were for investments outside the country.''
''Some were loans or personal grants to people linked to one shareholder or another shareholder,'' the diplomat said.
According to businessmen in Kabul, loans were made to people who were fronts for the real beneficiaries. ''Sometimes they would bring a loan document to someone who was a gardener or a cleaner and just ask them to sign it, and they would pay him 500 Afghanis and the person could not read or write more than his name,'' said a prominent businessman here with ties to the banking community.
''Then, when the new bank managers go to look for the money, they go to the gardener's house and they look around and they see there is nothing worth $100, and they have no idea where the money went.''
Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the American Embassy in Kabul, said that officials were working closely with the Afghan government, the I.M.F. and the World Bank. ''Corrective action in response to any instance of abuse, poor banking practices or fraud is essential for public and international confidence in Afghan financial institutions and the development of Afghanistan's financial sector,'' she said.
In Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand Province , a Kabul bank branch has been shut down for a week because employees transferred $1.3 million to Mr. Farnood, who was removed last fall for mismanagement.
In Kabul, the Ministry of Finance is putting out bids for a new bank to pay the salaries of the security forces, which previously had been paid exclusively through Kabul Bank, according to Col. John Ferrari, the head of training programs for NATO's training mission here. Military officials say that none of the $1.5 billion in payroll for the Afghan Army and the police has been reported missing. But concerns over the possibility that the bank could fail was one factor prompting the ministry to seek other banks to process payroll, Western officials said.
A WikiLeaks cable from last February suggested that payments were often delayed so the bank could make money on the overnight interest rates. In a Feb. 13, 2010, cable, Kabul Bank is described as ''the least liquid bank operating in Afghanistan'' and its difficulty in raising cash was so great that it took ''more than two days to process withdrawals and has delayed paying government employee salaries by two weeks in order to place those funds in overnight accounts to collect interest.''

HEADLINE: A Cross Of Rubber

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Last Saturday, reported The Financial Times, some of the world's most powerful financial executives were going to hold a private meeting with finance ministers in Davos, the site of the World Economic Forum. The principal demand of the executives, the newspaper suggested, would be that governments ''stop banker-bashing.'' Apparently bailing bankers out after they precipitated the worst slump since the Great Depression isn't enough -- politicians have to stop hurting their feelings, too.
But the bankers also had a more substantive demand: they want higher interest rates, despite the persistence of very high unemployment in the United States and Europe, because they say that low rates are feeding inflation. And what worries me is the possibility that policy makers might actually take their advice. 
To understand the issues, you need to know that we're in the midst of what the International Monetary Fund calls a ''two speed'' recovery, in which some countries are speeding ahead, but others -- including the United States -- have yet to get out of first gear.
The U.S. economy fell into recession at the end of 2007; the rest of the world followed a few months later. And advanced nations -- the United States, Europe, Japan -- have barely begun to recover. It's true that these economies have been growing since the summer of 2009, but the growth has been too slow to produce large numbers of jobs. To raise interest rates under these conditions would be to undermine any chance of doing better; it would mean, in effect, accepting mass unemployment as a permanent fact of life.
What about inflation? High unemployment has kept a lid on the measures of inflation that usually guide policy. The Federal Reserve's preferred measure, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, is now running below half a percent at an annual rate, far below the informal target of 2 percent.
But food and energy prices -- and commodity prices in general -- have, of course, been rising lately. Corn and wheat prices rose around 50 percent last year; copper, cotton and rubber prices have been setting new records. What's that about?
The answer, mainly, is growth in emerging markets. While recovery in advanced nations has been sluggish, developing countries -- China in particular -- have come roaring back from the 2008 slump. This has created inflation pressures within many of these countries; it has also led to sharply rising global demand for raw materials. Bad weather -- especially an unprecedented heat wave in the former Soviet Union, which led to a sharp fall in world wheat production -- has also played a role in driving up food prices.
The question is, what bearing should all of this have on policy at the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank?
First of all, inflation in China is China's problem, not ours. It's true that right now China's currency is pegged to the dollar. But that's China's choice; if China doesn't like U.S. monetary policy, it's free to let its currency rise. Neither China nor anyone else has the right to demand that America strangle its nascent economic recovery just because Chinese exporters want to keep the renminbi undervalued.
What about commodity prices? The Fed normally focuses on ''core'' inflation, which excludes food and energy, rather than ''headline'' inflation, because experience shows that while some prices fluctuate widely from month to month, others have a lot of inertia -- and it's the ones with inertia you want to worry about, because once either inflation or deflation gets built into these prices, it's hard to get rid of.
And this focus has served the Fed well in the past. In particular, the Fed was right not to raise rates in 2007-8, when commodity prices soared -- briefly pushing headline inflation above 5 percent -- only to plunge right back to earth. It's hard to see why the Fed should behave differently this time, with inflation nowhere near as high as it was during the last commodity boom.
So why the demand for higher rates? Well, bankers have a long history of getting fixated on commodity prices. Traditionally, that meant insisting that any rise in the price of gold would mean the end of Western civilization. These days it means demanding that interest rates be raised because the prices of copper, rubber, cotton and tin have gone up, even though underlying inflation is on the decline.
Ben Bernanke clearly understands that raising rates now would be a huge mistake. But Jean-Claude Trichet, his European counterpart, is making hawkish noises -- and both the Fed and the European Central Bank are under a lot of external pressure to do the wrong thing.
They need to resist this pressure. Yes, commodity prices are up -- but that's no reason to perpetuate mass unemployment. To paraphrase William Jennings Bryan, we must not crucify our economies upon a cross of rubber.

HEADLINE: Within Our Means

 BODY:
In the next two months, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Legislature will have to make very difficult decisions about how to close a $10 billion budget deficit -- which state offices to shutter, which services and aid to cut, which employees to lay off and which taxes to raise. There are no easy fixes left.
Mr. Cuomo has vowed to balance the budget without borrowing or using any of the accounting gimmicks that helped dig New York into this hole. That's good news.
But we are skeptical of his no-new-taxes pledge and his promise to let a surcharge on high earners expire. Extending that one tax until the end of 2012 would add an estimated $2 billion to the budget in the coming fiscal year and $4 billion the following year. 
Without additional revenue, all of the $10 billion will have to come from spending cuts -- a reduction of more than 10 percent for the state's projected $92.3 billion operating budget. Half of that goes to schools and Medicaid and other health care. So the state's most vulnerable citizens -- the poor, the sick, the elderly and schoolchildren -- will inevitably bear the largest burden.
Is there room to cut? Yes. New York spends more per pupil on education and more per enrollee on Medicaid than nearly any other state. Salaries and benefits for state employees outstrip the private sector.
In some cases, such as parts of the Medicaid program, the services are better and would be worth the investment in easier times. In too many cases, those higher costs are the result of Albany's profligacy and its eagerness to reward unions and other special interests.
New York also ranks at or near the top of various surveys of tax burdens. The tax system needs to be reviewed, but there is no way to deal with the budget crises -- near-term and long-term -- without higher taxes.
We need to live within our means. The challenge is to find ways to cut spending equitably and limit the disruption to essential services and the damage to the state's future. Living within our means also requires finding equitable sources of additional revenue.
Mr. Cuomo's budget for fiscal year 2011-12 is due Tuesday. The Legislature must approve a final budget by April 1. That is not a lot of time. Politicians and voters need to use it well, carefully reviewing and debating policy decisions. Here are some of the issues to consider:
THE NUMBERS New York State has a frustratingly opaque budgeting process, but as of November, the state budget office was predicting a breakdown that includes: $24 billion for health care, mainly Medicaid; $23 billion for K-12 education; $17 billion for state employee salaries and benefits; $6.5 billion for local government grants; and $3.4 billion for welfare and other social services.
Mr. Cuomo wants to streamline government and we will certainly hear a lot more about reducing waste, fraud and abuse. These are admirable goals, but there is no way to find $10 billion in savings without making significant cuts from the biggest-ticket items.
MEDICAID New York's Medicaid program-- the joint state-federal health insurance for the poor -- is expected to spend far more than any other state's, including the programs in California and Texas, which have much larger populations.
In part that is due to the high cost of medical care around New York City. But New York's eligibility terms and benefits are some of the most generous in the nation. It ranks near the top in providing ''optional benefits,'' such as dental coverage and long-term care. And it spends more than any other state per enrollee on care for the elderly and disabled.
Any cuts must try to minimize harm to patients and communities. Unfortunately, cuts in Medicaid could be almost three times as painful as other cuts: if Albany cuts $2 billion, local governments automatically cut at least $750 million and New York will lose $2.75 billion in federal funds, for a total reduction of $5.5 billion.
The best place to look for savings is in programs for the elderly and the disabled; as a quarter of the enrollees, they receive almost three-quarters of total Medicaid spending. Some is acute care in hospitals, but a lot is long-term care in nursing homes, clinics and at home, where spending is rising rapidly.
The state may need to restrict allowed home visits, placing an even greater burden on families. More long-term care patients must be moved into managed care plans. To save money right now, Albany will likely have to cut the reimbursement rates to hospitals and other institutions. It will need to focus on well-paid providers, without endangering safety-net hospitals.
New York could get some additional help next year from Washington if it is aggressive about applying for demonstration grants to test cost-saving approaches under the health care reform law. If they work, they could also bring lasting improvements to the program.
EDUCATION New York's average per pupil cost of more than $15,000 is well above the national average of about $11,000. In student achievement, the state trails Massachusetts and Maryland, which spend significantly less. That means New York has two challenges: it must address the quality of instruction and the high costs.
Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature must first acknowledge the historical inequity of education financing -- and guarantee that the poorest districts will feel the least pain. For decades, Albany has starved poor school districts while lavishing money on wealthy districts.
Under a court ruling, Albany in 2007 adopted a new, needs-based funding formula intended to distribute an additional $7 billion over several years to poor and chronically underfinanced districts. The money was distributed for two years, frozen in the third year and cut significantly last year.
This year, the wealthiest school districts should bear much of the burden, and poor districts should be protected as much as possible.
Last year's cuts cost New York City about $440 million in education funds. The Ilion school district, in upstate Herkimer County, is another that has been long neglected, and last year's loss of about $450,000 in state aid hit particularly hard. The district had to lay off 3 of its 145 teachers and did not replace two others who retired. The superintendent worries that he might have to lay off as many as 10 additional teachers this year.
Ilion is doing many of the right things to cut costs. It buys office and payroll services from a consortium and is exploring a merger with three other districts. Even the most ambitious savings pale when compared with the burden of salaries and benefits, which make up about 75 percent of Ilion's costs.
Ilion's problems are deeper than those of many other districts, but the underlying choices are the same. Savings can be found through streamlining and other creative reforms. But with 75 percent of all local education budgets going to pay for teachers' salaries and benefits, that is where much of the money will have to be found.
The unions may have to accept a salary freeze, and even then layoffs may be inevitable. (Last year, the state lost 9,000 of its 220,000 teachers due to the budget cuts.) Teachers will have to agree to pay more into their pensions and health insurance plans, and to raise the retirement age to 65.
Governor Cuomo's call for a 2 percent cap on property taxes will make a bad situation even worse. It would make it impossible for districts -- unless voters overrode the cap -- to raise more local school aid at the very time that the state is cutting its contribution. The Legislature should reject the idea.
PERSONNEL Mr. Cuomo's proposed salary freeze for many of the state's 236,000 workers could save at least $200 million next year. Unions are resisting. Freezes are a painful fact of life across the private sector these days. And, thanks to their powerful unions, state workers have gotten raises worth more than 13 percent since 2007.
New York will never get its fiscal house in order unless it deals with employees' extremely generous benefits. By 2013, the average total compensation -- salary, pension contribution and health insurance contribution -- for a state employee will be $102,000.
While private-sector workers pay about 20 percent of the cost of individual health insurance coverage on average, state employees contribute only 10 percent.
Pension benefits are even more out of line. Until 2009, most employees contributed 3 percent to their pensions, but only for the first decade of employment. In 2009 lawmakers required new employees to contribute 3 percent every year, but that contribution is still less than half of what most other states require. New York also has lower retirement ages and higher disability rates than most states and is one of only three in the country to count overtime in calculating pension benefits.
The state must insist on higher contributions by all its workers to pensions and health insurance, a lower ceiling on the amount of overtime counted in pension calculations and wage increases in line with those in the economy at large.
REVENUES In his State of the State address, Governor Cuomo said that New York has ''the worst business tax climate in the nation, period.'' That was a reference to New York's last-place position in a tally by one research group, the Tax Foundation. Other tallies yield different results. Even using that ranking, it's hard to prove that businesses in New York are at a huge competitive disadvantage, especially since neighboring New Jersey ranked 48 and Connecticut ranked 47, while South Dakota and Alaska were first and second.
More important, taxes generally rank behind education, infrastructure and other criteria when businesses decide where to locate. Trying to balance the budget solely with cuts -- in education and essential services -- will make New York even less attractive.
With the economy still struggling this is not the time to impose major new taxes. There are some that can bring in a good chunk of revenue, without doing damage.
As we said, New York would get an estimated $2 billion of additional revenue in the upcoming fiscal year if it extended the personal income tax surcharge that applies to couples making more than $300,000 and individuals making over $200,000. (A couple with two school-age children and taxable income of $350,000 would pay $3,500 more. A couple making $1 million, with two children and typical deductions, would pay about $20,500 more.)
Wealthy families got a generous break from Washington with the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts. Mr. Cuomo should extend New York's surcharge for two more years. Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature should also be looking for other sources of revenue. A penny-per-ounce tax on sugary sodas could raise an estimated $465 million in the first fiscal year. This is a no-brainer.
The governor also needs to order a systematic review of nearly $29 billion in state tax credits and other breaks. Some are necessary to encourage investment and development, but others stay on the books year after year without any analysis of their value. Why, for example, do sellers of precious metal bullion and coins get a tax break that cost the state $185 million in 2010? Doing away with about 5 percent of these deals would bring in nearly $1.5 billion.
None of these choices will be easy. Governor Cuomo has set up several commissions to recommend ways to cut costs and streamline government. We hope the process will promote an honest, transparent debate. New York can't go on this way any longer.
This is the first in a series of editorials about the fiscal crisis in New York State and in other states around the country.

HEADLINE: Inflation in China May Limit U.S. Trade Deficit

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Hilda Wang contributed reporting.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Inflation is starting to slow China's mighty export machine, as buyers from Western multinational companies balk at higher prices and have cut back their planned spring shipments across the Pacific.
Markups of 20 to 50 percent on products like leather shoes and polo shirts have sent Western buyers scrambling for alternate suppliers. But from Vietnam to India, few low-wage developing countries can match China's manufacturing might -- and no country offers refuge from high global commodity prices.
Already, the slowdown in American orders has forced some container shipping lines to cancel up to a quarter of their trips to the United States this spring from Hong Kong and other Chinese ports. 
The trend, if continued, could ease tensions by beginning to limit America's huge trade deficit with China. Those tensions were an undercurrent during Chinese President Hu Jintao's recent Washington talks with President Obama.
Manufacturers and distributors across a range of industries say the likely result of the export slowdown is higher prices for American shoppers in the coming months, and possibly brief shortages of some products if Western retailers delay purchases too long while haggling over prices.
China exports more than $4 of goods to the United States for each $1 it imports from America, creating a trade surplus of about $275 billion. The higher Chinese prices will tend to show up mainly in products like inexpensive clothing and other commodity goods in which labor and raw materials represent a bigger part of the final value -- rather than in sophisticated electronics like Apple iPads, in which Chinese assembly is only a small fraction of the cost.
Of course, the slowdown in the volume of imports could also prove temporary, if American consumers accept higher prices and Western corporate buyers end up renewing contracts at much higher cost. In the meantime, if the average price for each imported product rises faster than the volume of shipments falls, China's surplus with the United States could continue increasing temporarily.
But whatever the eventual impact on trade, Chinese inflation might also reduce Washington's pressure on Beijing over its currency, the renminbi. For more than a year, the Obama administration has been pushing China to let the renminbi rise in value against the dollar.
China's intervention in the currency market has kept its currency artificially low. But that flood of money has also driven inflation, giving Beijing an incentive to let the renminbi move higher. Indeed, the renminbi has increased 3.6 percent against the dollar since last June.
The Obama administration is starting to suggest that the currency problem could gradually solve itself if Chinese prices rise so fast that American goods become more competitive.
The first signs of a potential slowdown in Chinese exports have shown up in shipping. As factories closed on Friday across much of China in preparation for weeklong Chinese New Year celebrations, ports in Hong Kong and elsewhere along the coast were working long hours to meet last-minute shipments.
But the annual pre-New Year rush has been nothing like that of recent years, causing shipping lines to reverse rate increases and cancel sailings they introduced last summer as the American economy improved. This winter, the scurrying started only two weeks before the holidays, instead of the usual four weeks, according to shipping executives. That is because many Chinese factories simply cut back production this month as their Western customers began resisting steep price increases.
China's inflation is running 5 percent at the consumer level, according to official measures. But Chinese and Western economists describe these measures as based on flawed, outdated techniques and say the real figure may be up to twice as high.
In contrast, the annual inflation rate in the United States is low by historical standards -- about 1.5 percent currently.
China imposed price controls on food in mid-November to limit inflation. But Chinese state media began warning the public on Wednesday that those controls might be ineffective, as a drought in northern China has damaged the winter wheat crop and frost has spoiled part of the vegetable harvest in the south.
China's $6 trillion economy used to be heavily dependent on exports for growth. Exports still account for about one-fifth of the economy, after excluding goods that are merely imported to China for final assembly and then re-exported. But China's economy has grown powerfully for the last two years mainly on the strength of investment-led domestic demand. That demand, partly fed by low-interest lending by state-owned banks, is another factor in China's inflation.
Cities and provinces across China have tried to cushion inflation's effect on consumers by sharply raising minimum wages. Guangdong Province, the export heartland of light industry next to Hong Kong, announced two weeks ago that its cities were raising their minimum wages by an average of 18.6 percent, effective March 1.
That follows a similar increase that took effect in Guangdong around eight months ago. Many other provinces and cities have also sharply raised minimum wages recently.
The wage increases are also driven by a growing scarcity of factory workers. The number of Chinese in their 20s and early 30s, the traditional age bracket for factory labor, is slowly shrinking because of the introduction of the ''one child system'' a generation ago. And a rapidly expanding university system has produced waves of graduates with no interest in factory work.
Some companies have responded by moving factories deeper into China's interior, said Stanley Lau, the deputy chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, which represents exporters employing 10 million mainland Chinese workers. But inland wages are starting to catch up with coastal pay rates, Mr. Lau said, while higher transportation costs frequently offset the wage savings from moving to the interior.
Coach, the American company that is one of the largest marketers of luxury handbags and other accessories, announced on Tuesday that it planned to reduce its reliance on China to less than half of its products, from more than 80 percent now. It will shift output to Vietnam and India, particularly for smaller, more labor-intensive leather goods.
But Mike Devine, the company's executive vice president and chief financial officer, said that it would take four years to carry out the shift.
Trying to move production elsewhere, some retailers are finding many factories are already fully booked: Vietnam and Thailand each have populations smaller than some Chinese provinces, while Cambodia and Laos have smaller populations than some Chinese cities.
Many manufacturers foresee further labor shortages looming in China that will push wages even higher. They are responding with plans to upgrade their factory equipment and product designs, which could turn them into more direct competitors with high-end manufacturers in Europe and the United States.

HEADLINE: The Devil We Know

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
As the world ponders the fate of Egypt after Hosni Mubarak, Americans should ponder this: It's quite possible that if Mubarak had not ruled Egypt as a dictator for the last 30 years, the World Trade Center would still be standing.
This is true even though Mubarak's regime has been a steadfast U.S. ally, a partner in our counterterrorism efforts and a foe of Islamic radicalism. Or, more aptly, it's true because his regime has been all of these things. 
In ''The Looming Tower,'' his history of Al Qaeda, Lawrence Wright raises the possibility that ''America's tragedy on September 11 was born in the prisons of Egypt.'' By visiting imprisonment, torture and exile upon Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, Mubarak foreclosed any possibility of an Islamic revolution in his own country. But he also helped radicalize and internationalize his country's Islamists, pushing men like Ayman Al-Zawahiri -- Osama bin Laden's chief lieutenant, and arguably the real brains behind Al Qaeda -- out of Egyptian politics and into the global jihad.
At the same time, Mubarak's relationship with Washington has offered constant vindication for the jihadi worldview. Under his rule, Egypt received more American dollars than any country besides Israel. For many young Egyptians, restless amid political and economic stagnation, it's been a short leap from hating their dictator to hating his patrons in the United States. One of the men who made this leap was an architecture student named Mohamed Atta, who was at the cockpit when American Airlines Flight 11 hit the World Trade Center.
These sound like good reasons to welcome Mubarak's potential overthrow, and the end to America's decades-long entanglement with his drab, repressive regime. Unfortunately, Middle Eastern politics is never quite that easy. The United States supported Mubarak for so long because of two interrelated fears: the fear of another Khomeini and the fear of another Nasser. Both anxieties remain entirely legitimate today.
The first fear everyone understands, because we're still living with the religious tyranny that Ayatollah Khomeini established in Iran in 1979, in the wake of a spontaneous revolution not unlike the one currently sweeping Cairo and Alexandria.
The second fear is less immediately resonant, because Gamal Abdel Nasser is now 40 years in the grave. But the last time a popular revolution in the land of the pharaohs overthrew a corrupt regime, the year was 1952, Nasser was the beneficiary -- and Washington lived to rue the day he came to power.
Nasser was not an Islamist: he was a secular pan-Arabist socialist, which in the 1950s seemed to put him on history's cutting edge. But under his influence, Egypt became an aggressively destabilizing force in Middle Eastern politics. His dream of a unified Arab world helped inspire convulsions and coups from Lebanon to Iraq. He fought two wars with Israel, and intervened disastrously in Yemen. His army was accused of using poison gas in that conflict, a grim foreshadowing of Saddam Hussein's domestic tactics. And his pursuit of ballistic missiles was a kind of dress rehearsal for today's Iranian nuclear brinkmanship -- complete with a covert Israeli campaign to undermine his weapons programs.
The memory of Nasser is a reminder that even if post-Mubarak Egypt doesn't descend into religious dictatorship, it's still likely to lurch in a more anti-American direction. The long-term consequences of a more populist and nationalistic Egypt might be better for the United States than the stasis of the Mubarak era, and the terrorism that it helped inspire. But then again they might be worse. There are devils behind every door.
Americans don't like to admit this. We take refuge in foreign policy systems: liberal internationalism or realpolitik, neoconservatism or noninterventionism. We have theories, and expect the facts to fall into line behind them. Support democracy, and stability will take care of itself. Don't meddle, and nobody will meddle with you. International institutions will keep the peace. No, balance-of-power politics will do it.
But history makes fools of us all. We make deals with dictators, and reap the whirlwind of terrorism. We promote democracy, and watch Islamists gain power from Iraq to Palestine. We leap into humanitarian interventions, and get bloodied in Somalia. We stay out, and watch genocide engulf Rwanda. We intervene in Afghanistan and then depart, and watch the Taliban take over. We intervene in Afghanistan and stay, and end up trapped there, with no end in sight.
Sooner or later, the theories always fail. The world is too complicated for them, and too tragic. History has its upward arcs, but most crises require weighing unknowns against unknowns, and choosing between competing evils.
The only comfort, as we watch Egyptians struggle for their country's future, is that some choices aren't America's to make.

HEADLINE: A Mistake To Write Off Weinsteins

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com; twitter.com/carr2n

 BODY:
PARK CITY, Utah
Remember the benevolent Bruce Willis character in ''The Sixth Sense'' who wandered through the whole movie not knowing he was dead? That was Harvey Weinstein, except for the benevolent part.
Since forming the Weinstein Company with his brother, Bob, in 2005, Mr. Weinstein has struggled to regain the hot hand that made him one of the most successful and feared figures in the independent movie business. Mr. Weinstein, an opportunistic bottom feeder with a knack for resuscitating troubled projects, has become one himself. Here at Sundance and elsewhere, people whispered he was a ghost.
Turns out that he wasn't starring in ''The Sixth Sense.'' He was playing the role of Jason in ''Friday the 13th.'' Part 9: biding his time and then striking again. 
This year at Sundance, Mr. Weinstein cut a wide swath, buying two of the more expensive movies here -- ''The Details'' and ''My Idiot Brother'' -- for a total of about $14 million. And while Harvey and Bob were in the backrooms cutting big deals for films with A-list stars, news arrived that the Weinstein movie ''The King's Speech'' had come from the rear of the pack and picked up 12 nominations for Oscars, more than any other film.
Mr. Weinstein, who is always saying he's back, may actually be back. If ''The King's Speech'' wins big at the Oscars and at the box office, it will provide some much needed revenue, and the bragging rights that are almost as valuable in the world Mr. Weinstein inhabits.
None of this is to suggest that the Weinstein Company is now back in high cotton. The company has gone through more than $1 billion in financing, bled money year after year as it sold off many of its acquisitions at a loss and mortgaged its film library to stay afloat.
That's not how the Weinsteins thought it would turn out after they sold their earlier company, Miramax, to Disney and formed the Weinstein Company. In addition to being in the movie business, the company bought the fashion brand Halston, a social network for the wealthy called ASmallWorld and a share of a video distributor called Genius, and it bought into Ovation TV, an arts-focused cable channel. He was, by his own estimate, ''a bad C.E.O.''
And the efforts to grow beyond their historical franchise on movies not only didn't jell, but seemed to distract Mr. Weinstein from the movie business. There were some hits like ''Inglourious Basterds'' and Oscar love for ''The Reader'' but the vast majority of the company's output tanked. And the revenue picture was complicated by the fact that ''Project Runway,'' the TV show the company produced, became tied up in litigation when Mr. Weinstein tried to move it from the Bravo channel to Lifetime.
In 2009, the company hired a financial restructuring firm, reduced its slate and laid off dozens of people. By early 2010, the Weinstein Company had ''exhausted liquidity,'' according to court documents, having churned through $1.2 billion in financing from Goldman Sachs.
To remain a going concern, the brothers had to hand over, at least temporarily, custody of 250 films to investors to finance a restructuring -- the equivalent of burning furniture to stay warm.
But in a phone call, David Glasser, chief operating officer of the Weinstein Company, argues that the company hung onto 150 of its most lucrative titles and that if all goes as planned, profits from the 250 films will pay down debt, at which point, the films' rights will revert back to the company. He added that the company is not only buying at Sundance, but also producing its own films, like ''Apollo 18,'' ''My Week With Marilyn,'' ''Butter'' and an addition to the ''Spy Kids'' franchise.
But in the past few years here at Sundance, and everywhere else, financial duress followed Mr. Weinstein like a cloud, with whispers that his brother's genre horror franchises like ''Scary Movie'' and ''Scream'' could no long finance Harvey's growing taste for high budget, star-driven enterprises and for companies that had nothing to do with the movie business.
If he heard the whispers, you couldn't tell. You can be against Harvey -- many are -- but it's a little like being against the coming of winter. A big part of his durability, his relentlessness, is that he never believes a word that people say about him.
In the '80s, when he came out of nowhere with his brother to use cunning purchases, presales of international rights and wily Oscar campaigning to change the movie business forever, everybody said it was an unsustainable formula. When he sold out to Disney, everyone was convinced it would all come to tears, at least for Disney. And when he and Bob hustled over a billion dollars for their own enterprise, people said that absent distribution, the company was bound to fail. And they were all mostly correct, but Harvey never acknowledged as much, instead hustling his way to his next deal.
In a phone call late Sunday, Mr. Weinstein said that he had spent more than a week at Sundance and that he was very much focused on the movie and television business.
''Look, there are four, five businesses we never should have been in and we ended up humbled and learned from that experience,'' he said. ''We are concentrating on movies, pulling the band back together and I think the coming year could be as good or better than any we ever had at Miramax.''
His latest resurgence says as much about what the modern movie business has become as it does about him. Sundance once featured a murderers' row of indie buyers, including many owned by the major studios. But the combination of a decline in the DVD business, the recession and increased bottom line pressure at major media companies culled the herd.
Paramount Vantage, New Line, Warner Independent, Picturehouse and yes, Miramax are all mostly gone or a shadow of their former selves. Focus Features, Fox Searchlight and Sony Pictures Classics, among others, continue to play in the small pool of indie movies, but the list and the outlays are smaller.
As a result, if you have a risky movie and you're looking for a buccaneer to team up with, there are not a lot of pirates around.
As the Oscar nominations demonstrated, Mr. Weinstein is still capable of spotting value. Many people, including me, look at ''The King's Speech'' and see a by-the-numbers film that's a fine candidate for BBC TV. Mr. Weinstein saw a high-end buddy movie that humanized its royal subject and then he carefully husbanded the marketing resources of the film, enticing consumers to come out and see the film and reminding the academy voters that the carefully crafted dramedy of manners was worthy of consideration. The nominations surprise last Tuesday provided oxygen to the struggling company.
''There's no question that we have a long way to go, but Harvey is focused on movies, marketing and television,'' said Mr. Glasser. ''He is not in and out of Sundance in a day like he was three years ago. He is seeing movies, spending time, reading scripts, doing what he has always done.''
A few days before that Oscar announcement, Mr. Weinstein was in the lobby of the Eccles Theater here before the premiere of ''My Idiot Brother,'' the star-studded tangle of a movie he would later buy in partnership with Ron Burkle for a reported $6 million.
He surveyed the lobby with satisfaction, dispatching minions and acknowledging the greetings that came his way, but generally just declaring physical dominion over the place. He smiled when he called out my name to share a laugh and complain about something I'd written about a thousand years ago. Same old Harvey. Unbowed, undiminished, unstoppable.
Yes, his company is a shell of its former self and his partners are out a lot of money, but there is something to be said for relentlessness, a refusal to acknowledge that you are finished, and the will to just keep hacking away no matter what. No wonder Bob has had such good luck producing horror films: he grew up with Jason.

HEADLINE: The Real Risk For Muni Bonds

BYLINE: By AGNES T. CRANE

 BODY:
Huge state budget shortfalls make for easy headlines about the $3 trillion municipal bond market. But old woes like abysmal disclosure and more recent wounds like damage to the safety net should worry the sector's tax-wary investors more.
Muni bonds, which pay interest that is generally exempt from federal and state tax, have long been a safe, as well as tax-efficient, place for wealthy Americans to park their cash. But given the recent downturn in the economy, defaults are sure to rise above the minuscule historical average of less than 1 percent a year. 
And investors can no longer count on bond insurance to protect them from potential losses. Credit downgrades -- or worse -- during the recent financial crisis exposed the business of ''wrapping'' bonds as unsustainable for integral players like Ambac and MBIA, which provide financial guaranty insurance. As a result, less than a tenth of new municipal bonds carry insurance, compared with around half five years ago.
With this safety net much reduced, disclosure matters more. Last year's financial reform legislation made some improvements like regulating the financial advisers used by municipalities, but did little to shine light onto the sometimes murky debt that comes to market.
For instance, state and local governments, and individual projects they support, don't have to hand over any financial information to regulators before they raise funds in the muni market, even though they are often aimed at retail investors.
Unrated debt is the worst offender. There isn't even the comfort of a rating agency assessing it before it's sold. While this is a small part of the municipal bond market, accounting for 5 to 10 percent of total municipal debt sales in recent years, the total could still be significant -- perhaps as much as $300 billion. This has nothing to do with the borrowing of struggling big states; it is smaller cities and towns, nursing homes and other projects backed by municipalities that depend on such financing.
But it's the steady drumbeat of news about state shortfalls that may be causing investors to vote with their feet and withdraw cash from municipal bond funds. Despite the budget-balancing difficulties states may be having, they are not overburdened with debt. Over all, only 5 percent of state and local government expenditures are dedicated to interest payments, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The proportion is nearly unchanged since the late 1970s.
So it's more likely that smaller, murkier entities -- municipalities and projects that did borrow beyond their ability to repay, helped by the absence of disclosure rules -- that will default in the fragmented muni market.
But perception is critical in a market where individual investors run the show, holding roughly two-thirds of all munis. And some among the crowd that has flocked into the market over the last two years are now running scared. Investors in mutual funds have withdrawn $20 billion in the last 10 weeks, more than they poured into the market in 2010.
It shouldn't be an insoluble problem. Unlike the subprime mortgage debt that fed the recent crisis, municipal debt has not been repackaged into exotic securities that obfuscate what underlies them. And for most muni borrowers, debt loads are not crippling.
One answer is to put money where there is disclosure. That would mean investors and their fund managers avoid bonds that come with little or no information, especially those without even a rating firm's review, and look more favorably on general obligation bonds from states. These come with much more information and are arguably among the least likely issues to default because they are backed by the taxation power of states.
Other responses could involve Congress. Lawmakers might decide to repeal the so-called Tower Amendment. Sponsored by John Tower, the former Republican senator Texas, and enacted more than three decades ago, it exempts muni issuers from disclosure to federal regulators. They might also rethink the rationale for giving investors a federal tax break on muni debt in the first place. After all, subsidized debt invites inefficient spending.
Those moves would do more to bring sanity to municipal finance than the current effort to introduce legislation that would allow states to file for bankruptcy protection. AGNES T. CRANE

HEADLINE: MEDIA DECODER; From a Crisis, a Best Seller

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN and SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
It lacks the sex and intrigue of the Starr Report, and the bone-chilling narrative of the 9/11 Commission Report.
But the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report, the conclusion of a federal inquiry by a 10-member commission, went on sale Thursday as a 576-page book and has already begun a sprint up the online best-seller lists. The retailer Amazon.com ran out of copies by Sunday. 
''What we wanted to see was whether a significant public document like this, in the digital age, would still find demand in a book,'' said Peter Osnos, the founder and editor at large of PublicAffairs, the independent publisher that released an authorized version of the book. ''And the answer is yes.''
No one expects it to match the demand for previous government reports, which have sold hundreds of thousands of copies and flooded bookstores with impatient customers.
PublicAffairs - which, as a publisher of the book version of the Starr Report in 1998, has experience with this kind of thing - initially printed a modest 25,000 copies in paperback. A tome laden with charts, diagrams and condensed testimony, it has competition from a free online version, available on the commission's Web site, fcic.gov/report. The e-book is available for $8.45 on Amazon; the price of the paperback is $14.99.
Phil Angelides, the commission's chairman, was so determined to build excitement that he hired the communications firm of Anita Dunn, President Obama's former communications director, to orchestrate the arrival, irking some Republicans.
Producing the book required discretion and speed. The May 2009 law that created the commission directed it to complete work by Dec. 15, 2010. But in November, the Democratic majority in the 10-member commission voted to delay the report until January, partly to give PublicAffairs time to rush the book into print.
Commission members worked around the clock to complete it around Christmas, keeping it under wraps. PublicAffairs received the finished manuscript around Jan. 7, pushing it into production so that it could begin arriving in bookstores only 20 days later, a quick turnaround by any publishing standard.
PublicAffairs paid no advance for publishing rights but had to cover the cost of production. (The commission chipped in about $40,000 to help PublicAffairs expedite the shipping.) The commission had been offered a $250,000 advance from Little, Brown to publish the book, but the deal fell through when that publisher was unable to meet the panel's tight production schedule.
At Kramerbooks in Washington, perhaps one of the most likely stores in the country to attract people interested in the report, 11 books were sold in the first 24 hours, said Jayna Richardson, assistant book buyer. ''We've got it stacked up on the front table.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Health Care and Morality

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Reforming the Reform'' (column, Jan. 24), Ross Douthat raises the difficult conundrum that is the insurance mandate. He proposes an alternative approach, with limited enrollment periods. 
What seems to be lost in the discussion is that this is not fundamentally a question of economics, interstate commerce or freedom of choice. It is at its root a moral issue.
If there is no mandate to buy coverage, what do we do when people who make the choice to opt out of insurance coverage do get sick or have terrible accidents? Do we let them die because they took a calculated risk?
Fortunately, we have sensible laws that require hospitals to treat the sick and injured whether they are insured or not. That is the moral thing to do.
However, as long as we have such a mandate for treatment, we must have an accompanying mandate for coverage or we will never control costs.

HEADLINE: Civic Engagement Trumps 'Shhh!'

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
There may be no better example of the worrying state of American architecture than the career of Steven Holl.
At 63, this New York architect is widely considered one of the most original talents of his era. His work has influenced a generation of architects and students. And over the last decade or so he has become a star in faraway places like Scandinavia and China, where he is celebrated as someone able to imbue even the most colossal urban projects with lyricism.
Yet his career at home has been negligible. He has had only a handful of notable commissions in the United States, and his output in New York is embarrassingly slight: a modest addition to Pratt Institute's school of architecture, a cramped (if underrated) gallery at the edge of Little Italy and a handful of interior renovations. 
So when the Queens Library Board of Trustees approved the design of the new Hunters Point community library this month, it was a well-deserved and long overdue breakthrough. The project, done in collaboration with Mr. Holl's partner Chris McVoy and scheduled to begin construction early next year, will stand on a prominent waterfront site just across the East River from the United Nations. It is a striking expression of the continuing effort to shake the dust off of the city's aging libraries and recast them as lively communal hubs, and should go far in bolstering the civic image of Queens.
The building's beguiling appearance -- with giant free-form windows carved out of an 80-foot-tall rectangular facade of rough aluminum -- should make it an instantly recognizable landmark. Seen from Manhattan, it will have a haunting presence on the waterfront, flanked by the red neon Pepsi-Cola sign to the north and the remnants of an abandoned ferry terminal to the south. At dusk the library's odd-shaped windows will emit an eerie glow, looking a bit like ghosts trapped inside a machine. And late at night, when the building is dark, spotlights will illuminate its pockmarked facade and the windows will resemble caves dug into the wall of a cliff.
Only at the site itself, however, will the optimism driving Mr. Holl's design come into focus. The library will stand at the western edge of Queens West, a soulless mix of generic apartment towers and barren streets built up in the last decade or so that has neither the dilapidated charm of the old manufacturing neighborhoods to the east nor the density of a real urban neighborhood. (The development's one saving grace is a narrow park that snakes along the riverfront; its steel gantries, once used for loading boats, are an ode to the area's industrial past.)
Mr. Holl 's design is not about escaping this world but transforming it into something more poetic. Approaching from the towers across the street, visitors will enter a tranquil reading garden, a little paradise walled off from the gloomy scene that surrounds it. Ginkgo trees will shade the garden, partly blocking the view of the towers. As visitors move closer to the library, they will be able to see through the lobby windows and out over a reflecting pool and the riverfront park. Other odd-shaped windows will allow diagonal glimpses up through the building and out to the sky.
When I first saw a rendering of this facade it brought to mind Gordon Matta-Clark's 1975 ''Day's End,'' in which Matta-Clark used a power saw to carve big circular openings into the exterior of an abandoned industrial building on the Hudson River in Lower Manhattan. In both works the overscaled cut-out openings are powerfully metaphorical. They suggest the desire to expose private, interior worlds to public scrutiny, and -- by seeming to undermine the buildings' structural stability -- they evoke an unstable, ever-changing world.
But Mr. Holl's design is also a statement about the individual's place in a larger communal framework. The lobby is a towering space framed on both sides by several big, balconylike reading rooms. To get to them visitors climb a staircase that runs up the lobby's back wall and past one of the huge free-form windows that afford views of the East River and Manhattan. The stairs lead first to the main reading room, which overlooks the lobby, then cross back to a children's area or continue up to another reading room for teenagers. Eventually they emerge onto a rooftop terrace, where during nice weather people will be able to attend lectures and performances, or , when nothing is going on, lounge around and enjoy the spectacular view.
The strength of this layout is that it allows Mr. Holl to balance the reader's need for solitude with a strong sense of community. The main reading room, cantilevering out over the lobby, is the most open. The children's reading room, the noisiest, is enclosed behind a curved wall with a few small windows cut into it so that kids can look across to the adults or up to the teenagers.
But it is the constant reminders of the larger world provided by the giant cuts through the building's surface that give the design so much resonance. Mr. Holl is not interested in creating a monastic sanctuary; he wants to build a monument to civic engagement. The views aren't just pretty; they remind us that the intellectual exchange of a library is part of a bigger collective enterprise. It's a lovely idea, and touching in its old-fashioned optimism.

HEADLINE: Last Fall, Hurling Insults at Cuomo. Now, Backing His Fiscal Plan.

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Michael R. Caputo has devoted an inordinate amount of time to bashing Andrew M. Cuomo. As the campaign manager last year for Mr. Cuomo's Republican rival in the governor's race, Carl P. Paladino, Mr. Caputo delighted in coining names like Prince Andrew and comparing Mr. Cuomo to Pinocchio.
But in a change of heart that seems to startle even Mr. Caputo, the vitriol has vanished, at least for the moment, and Mr. Caputo has decided to come out in support of Mr. Cuomo's fiscal agenda. On Monday, he will e-mail some 10,000 activists, many of them aligned with the Tea Party, and urge them to do the same. 
''I can't stand the guy,'' Mr. Caputo said in an interview, ''but the state is going to hell in a handbasket, and it's time to come together.''
Mr. Caputo is not alone. Across the state, the governor, who will release his budget on Tuesday, is earning praise from unlikely sources: Republicans, Tea Party supporters and conservative Democrats.
They are rallying behind Mr. Cuomo's pledge to close a shortfall of more than $9 billion by reducing the state work force by up to 15,000 employees and drastically reducing spending in areas like Medicaid and education.
It is an uneasy alliance for many dyed-in-the-wool conservatives, who just a few months ago were warning that Mr. Cuomo would usher in an era of profligate spending and rising taxes. Many are still put off by his socially liberal views, like his advocacy for gay marriage.
But they are taking a so-be-it approach, holding their noses and throwing their support behind the new governor anyway. Some sense a political opportunity: a chance to pressure Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, into ignoring the wishes of the more liberal members of his party.
The Conservative Party of New York State recently made calls to 96,000 households to help drum up support for Mr. Cuomo's agenda and urge lawmakers to balance the budget without increasing taxes or borrowing.
''Politics makes strange bedfellows,'' said the chairman of the party, Michael R. Long. ''People are very surprised that he is holding the course at this stage in the game.''
Tea Party leaders from around the state met in Oneonta on Sunday, and part of the discussion centered on how to handle the thorny issue of Mr. Cuomo.
Mark L. Barie, a real estate business owner who leads an upstate Tea Party group, said his group would support Mr. Cuomo's call to cap the growth of the property tax levy at 2 percent a year, so long as it was accompanied by relief from unfunded mandates.
''We're being practical, not purist,'' Mr. Barie said. ''The fact is, the state of New York elected a Democratic governor, and he has made some positive proposals.''
But some Tea Party supporters are more skeptical. Sheryl Thomas, an organizer from Middletown, said she would reserve judgment.
''If he performs well, I think he'll get kudos,'' Ms. Thomas said. ''If his rhetoric continues to be hot air and he's doing nothing, then he won't.''
Dean Murray, a state assemblyman from Long Island who was one of the first Tea Party supporters elected to state office, said conservatives were finding much to like in Mr. Cuomo's economic agenda, like the creation of regional business councils to compete for state money. But he said a central concern was whether Mr. Cuomo would stand up to pressure from more liberal members of the Assembly.
''Right now, he's speaking Republicanese,'' Mr. Murray said. ''The devil's in the details.''
The dire economic situation facing many states has forced leaders of all political stripes to make drastic cuts and look for alternative sources of revenue.
As liberals embrace ideas typically associated with the conservative cause, Republicans and Tea Party supporters have found themselves in a prickly position.
Michael Kazin, a history professor at Georgetown University, said the Tea Party movement would probably find it hard to accept those who were not tried-and-true conservatives.
''They'll say, 'You can't trust these people, you know what their heritage is, they're tax-and-spend liberals at heart,' '' Dr. Kazin said.
''In this country, social movements always have to compromise, but when they compromise they're afraid of losing their identity.''
For all the bipartisan appeal of having conservatives flock to his side, Mr. Cuomo also risks losing support from backers of traditional Democratic causes.
Billy Easton, executive director of the Alliance for Quality Education, an education advocacy group, said Mr. Cuomo was falling short of his promise to restore New York's tradition of progressivism.
''There is nothing progressive or even moderate about disinvesting in our children's schools, coupled with multibillion tax cuts for the wealthiest New Yorkers,'' Mr. Easton said. ''The people who will loudly cheer it are the Tea Party and the Wall Streeters.''
Mr. Caputo, for his part, said his support for Mr. Cuomo came reluctantly after several weeks of reflection.
He consulted his former boss, Mr. Paladino, who offered his blessing but said he would have no part in it. In his e-mail message, Mr. Caputo calls Mr. Cuomo's plans ''conservative, responsible and absolutely necessary.''
He adds, ''It is starting to look like I may end up eating a few of my words. But I would happily sit for that meal if the governor delivers real fiscal reform.''

HEADLINE: Teacher, My Dad Lost His Job. Do We Have to Move?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
oneducation@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WORTHINGTON, Ohio -- Diane and Eric Kehler tried not to talk about it in front of the children, but as Jen Hegerty, the guidance counselor at Wilson Hill Elementary School, says, ''Children have eagle ears.''
Mr. Kehler lost his $90,000-a-year job as an information technology manager. And though he and his wife discussed their problems in whispers, eagle ears don't miss much. Their son Mathias, 12, a quiet, cerebral sixth grader at Wilson Hill, got quieter. ''Our house was sort of in a state of despair. We weren't as happy as usual,'' Mathias said. ''I stopped having good ideas to talk about with my friends.''
Mrs. Kehler has a college degree but had chosen to be a stay-at-home mother. That ended. She took a job at McDonald's to cover the cost of groceries. At school, Mathias and his sister, Leah, a fourth grader, qualified for reduced-price lunches.
Keeping all that worry bottled up hurt. While Leah would not tell anyone her worst fear, she told her speech teacher, Shelley Smith, the second worst: that her family would have to move away and Leah would lose her friends. ''I was worried and scared and very worried,'' recalled Leah, who's 10. 
She chose Mrs. Smith to tell because the two have the same, exact birthday and every year they celebrate by eating Mrs. Smith's homemade cupcakes. ''She was just the right person,'' Leah said. ''She's very calm.''
The Kehlers have lots of company. While Wall Street is pumping, Main Street bleeds. This middle- to upper-middle-class suburban town of 14,000 bordering Columbus has 22 percent of its students getting subsidized lunches. That's up from 6 percent in 2005, when the economy was booming.
Statewide, 43 percent of Ohio public school students are disadvantaged, as measured by free and reduced lunches, compared with 33 percent in 2005, according to a recent survey by KidsOhio, a nonprofit educational organization based in Columbus. A sign of how deep this recession has reached into the middle class: here in Franklin County, 44 percent of the disadvantaged attend suburban schools, compared with 32 percent five years ago.
There may be other factors involved, including an increase of poorer families moving out of Columbus to the suburbs. But many here -- the KidsOhio researchers; the superintendent of Worthington schools, Melissa Conrath; the principal of Wilson Hill, Jamie Lusher -- agree that the recession's impact has played a large part.
A few houses down from the Kehlers on Deer Creek Drive, Bill Cameron, who has three children in high school, has been out of work for two years since losing his $119,000-a-year job as a manager at American Electric Power.
Over on Eastland Court, Grace Koo and her now ex-husband, who have two children at Wilson Hill, were both laid off and went from making about $160,000 a year to zero. Ms. Koo, who had been a store design and construction director for Limited Brands, attributed the divorce to many things gone wrong, including their sinking economic status. ''For months, both of us were home together, unemployed,'' she said. ''We'd fight over money.''
On Buck Trail Lane, the Hymers went from $150,000 a year to zero. Their son, Zachary, a second grader, and their daughter, Kennedy, who's in fourth, qualified for reduced-priced lunches. The Hislopes on Friend Street also qualified for reduced-priced lunches, but as things worsened -- the father, Mike, a shop foreman, has been out of work two years -- they qualified for free lunches.
Recently Worthington got its first soup kitchen.
The emotional strain on children is plain from the names of the support groups the guidance counselor, Ms. Hegerty, has created: the Chicken Little group; the Volcano Management group; the Family Change group.
Even as the district's budget gets cut and class sizes in the school's fourth and fifth grades creep up to 30, the staff at Wilson Hill works to make a difference. While Washington measures a school's worth by test scores, here, on Northland Street, there's more to it.
A few weeks before Christmas, a girl in Mrs. Smith's class went to school with broken eyeglasses patched together with tape. Each time the girl looked down to read, the glasses fell off. This is a small town, and Mrs. Smith knew the girl's family was struggling. At 9 a.m., Mrs. Smith asked to borrow the glasses; during her lunch period she drove to her eye doctor; by 12:30 the girl had new pink and green frames.
Because the guidance counselor position is split between two schools, Ms. Hegerty gets overloaded and has found two unpaid interns from nearby universities to help with the caseload.
Most children this age can't verbalize what's wrong, and Ms. Hegerty watches their worries seep out in the guise of other problems. ''Separation anxiety, nightmares, bed wetting,'' she rattles them off, ''Obsessive behavior, won't stay in own bed, acting out at school, acting out at home.''
Ms. Koo's daughter, Trinity, a second grader, scratched her arms so much they bled. Trinity's brother, Eliot, was misbehaving in kindergarten.
Ms. Hegerty showed them how to make worry envelopes to store their fears. She gave them a buckeye to carry in their pockets. ''If you're feeling bad, you hold it,'' said Trinity, who's stopped scratching. ''You think about stuff, and then 'O.K., this is over now, I'm fine.' ''
Every day, Eliot's teacher, Regina Malley, starts off each kindergartner with five cubes. If you're bad, she takes away a cube. But if you hold on to all five cubes for the day, you get one prize ticket. After 10 tickets, you get to turn on the classroom computer and sit in the big chair (''It elevates them above everybody,'' Mrs. Malley said). Thirty tickets and you get the grand prize, lunch alone with Mrs. Malley.
For a few days, Eliot was stuck on nine tickets. ''Poor Eliot lost a cube today,'' Mrs. Malley reported. ''He banged a kid on the back of the head.''
And then Eliot made a comeback, earning two tickets in two days. As Mrs. Malley promised, he got to sit in the big chair and was loudly applauded.
Mrs. Malley has taught kindergarten in the same room for 31 years, and in that time she's learned a thing or two about little boys. She predicts good things for Eliot. ''Eliot's very bright,'' she said. ''Even if he listens 50 percent of the time, he's getting 75 percent more than other kids.''
While several parents interviewed for this column eventually got jobs, no one was making anything near their old salaries. The Hislopes, Hymers and Kehlers are making half. Ms. Koo is making a third. Mrs. Hislope's two daughters have been able to continue playing sports because their schools waived participation fees and the sports booster clubs helped. The Hislopes were one of 10 families that the middle school picked to give $300 toward Christmas.
It was only during a visit from a reporter that Mrs. Kehler heard Leah tell her worst fear. ''I instantly thought we'd be homeless,'' Leah said. Every fall the school takes part in the Penny Harvest, collecting for the homeless, and Leah feared that the next harvest would be for her family.
''Really?'' Mrs. Kehler said. Like mother like daughter. This was Mrs. Kehler's worst fear, too.
''I didn't know how we'd survive,'' she said. ''I was afraid we'd be homeless under an underpass in Columbus and the kids would go into foster care.''
When, after many months, Mr. Kehler could not find work, they bought a print cartridge recycling business. It's off to a promising start. The first year, the Kehlers outperformed the previous owner. ''We're up 18 percent,'' Mrs. Kehler said.
Eagle ears still hear almost everything, but thankfully, for the last several months, what they hear has not sounded so dire. ''When Dad and Mom talked, they were getting calmer,'' Mathias said. ''We're definitely higher than we were.''

HEADLINE: An Airport Whose Time May Not Come

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Stewart International Airport was supposed to be the long-sought fourth major airport to serve the New York metropolitan area. But four years after the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey took control of it, Stewart remains a mystery to most travelers.
More than 60 miles north of Midtown Manhattan just west of Newburgh, N.Y., Stewart is a sleepy outpost of the region's transportation system. Indeed, though the airport is big enough to handle jumbo jets that can make nonstop flights to Mexico and beyond, it attracts fewer passengers in a year than Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark Liberty International Airports draw in a holiday weekend. 
Last week, when transportation officials gathered in Manhattan to discuss the future of air travel in the region, Stewart was no more than a footnote. The authors of a study that concluded that Kennedy and Newark would need additional runways within 25 years said Stewart would provide scant relief to the clogged airspace.
Officials of the Port Authority, which paid $79 million for a 93-year lease on Stewart in 2007, have projected that it could serve as many as 7 million passengers a year, many of whom would otherwise use Kennedy, Newark or La Guardia. The Port Authority has already spent about $50 million on improvements at Stewart and, the study said, plans to spend as much as $450 million more redeveloping Stewart over the next 15 years.
But Jeffrey M. Zupan, an analyst with the Regional Plan Association who led the study, said he forecast that Stewart would draw only about half the traffic the Port Authority hoped for. By the time the four airports controlled by the Port Authority are drawing 150 million passengers a year, only about 3.5 million of them, or just over 2 percent, will be using Stewart, Mr. Zupan said.
Stewart appeared to be on a path to growth in late 2006 when JetBlue announced that it would begin flying there. But since then, other carriers have pulled out of Stewart and traffic has shrunk by more than half.
Through the first 11 months of 2010, Stewart was on pace to attract fewer than 400,000 passengers for the year. That was down from about 790,000 in 2008 and almost 915,000 in 2007.
Port Authority officials attribute the decline to the recession and the toll it took on the airline industry. A spokesman for the Port Authority said its managers still had ''high hopes'' for Stewart and had not considered abandoning their plans to expand it, despite the drop-off in activity.
AirTran, which had served Stewart before the Port Authority came in, stopped its service. Skybus, a discount airline, ceased operations in 2008, about half a year after first landing at Stewart.
Today, only JetBlue, Delta and US Airways serve Stewart, and only about a dozen flights depart from there each day. On Friday, when the three big airports were crowded with travelers whose itineraries were complicated by the snowstorm that had struck the city the previous day, all was calm and quiet at Stewart.
Customers trickled in to a Quiznos sandwich shop in the terminal while the Hudson News store nearby was empty. Kathleen MacDonald, a regular user of Stewart who lives about 22 miles away in Chester, N.Y., was there to pick up her brother, who had flown in from Tennessee.
''It's so quick to go in and out of,'' Ms. MacDonald, 48, said of Stewart. She said she was glad to have JetBlue there because she could board its planes there and be in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in two and a half hours.
At best, Mr. Zupan said, Stewart could ''fill a niche'' by attracting operators of charter flights from overseas and discount carriers catering to vacationers.
But for Stewart to succeed as a reliever for the Port Authority's other airports, its appeal would have to extend past local sun-chasers like Ms. MacDonald. The main obstacle to doing so is the lack of transit links from New York City, and that problem is unlikely to be solved for years to come, Mr. Zupan said
The best prospect for luring travelers from the city and close-in suburbs to Stewart is an express train, Mr. Zupan said. But elected officials, most notably New York's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer, had pinned hopes on running trains from Midtown Manhattan through a new tunnel under the Hudson River and up the west side of the Hudson.
Now that New Jersey's governor, Chris Christie, has scrapped the plan for that rail tunnel, the idea of direct trains to Stewart appears to be fading. Senator Schumer said, however, that a rail link to Stewart was still more feasible than some of the ideas for airport expansion laid out in the study last week, like filling in part of Jamaica Bay to add a runway at Kennedy.
''Stewart will still be a needed airport, but without the rail link, the chance of its really alleviating the overcrowding at the other airports is minimal,'' Mr. Schumer said in an interview. ''It will be a secondary airport -- important but secondary.''

HEADLINE: Cuomo Files Tax-Cap Bill, Surprising Assembly

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
In a surprise move, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has submitted his proposal to limit local property taxes to the State Senate for a vote on Monday, a tactic that seems designed to isolate Democratic lawmakers in the Assembly who have qualms about the measure.
The 74-page bill was sent to the Senate late Friday, the last possible time to allow for a Monday vote. Republicans, who narrowly control the chamber and overwhelmingly support a cap on property tax growth, welcomed the measure, saying they would seek action immediately. 
''New Yorkers need and deserve relief from high property taxes, and the Senate Republicans are working with the governor and others to put a cap in place as soon as possible,'' said Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans. ''We expect to take up and pass Governor Cuomo's property tax cap program bill tomorrow.''
The bill is expected to draw bipartisan support. Senate Democrats ''passed the property tax cap twice last year and are ready to pass the governor's bill now,'' said their spokesman, Austin Shafran.
But Assembly Democrats, who control that chamber and who said they had had only preliminary talks with Mr. Cuomo about the cap, were taken by surprise and did not see the bill until Saturday, a day on which the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, an Orthodox Jew, observes the Sabbath.
Mr. Cuomo did not warn Assembly leaders that the bill was coming, officials said, despite Mr. Silver's pledge to work with Mr. Cuomo to pass a cap, the new governor's top policy priority.
While Senate Republicans had signaled that they would hold a vote on a property tax cap this week, many lawmakers had expected Mr. Cuomo to include a version of a cap as part of his executive budget on Tuesday.
''The speaker stated at the State of the State that the Assembly is committed to passing a property tax cap bill,'' said Sisa Moyo, a spokeswoman for Mr. Silver. ''We look forward to working with the governor and our colleagues in the Senate on this issue in the upcoming budget.''
Teachers' union officials said the measure appeared to be somewhat stronger than Mr. Cuomo's campaign proposal, which would cap local tax increases at 2 percent or the rate of inflation, whichever was lower. As written, they said, the bill could lead to zero-growth tax rates for many school districts.
''All along, we've been saying that we would work with the governor's proposal to try to get to a place that was fair to education,'' said Richard C. Iannuzzi, the president of New York State United Teachers. ''This bill, as we're reading it, moves in the opposite direction and is going to make achieving something fair more difficult.''
''When you do a one-house bill,'' he added, ''it is flexing muscle in the old style of Albany, which is everything that Governor Cuomo opposes and we oppose as well.''
Under the proposal, school districts would hold a vote on their tax levy each year, instead of their overall budget. If a levy failed to pass twice, districts would be locked into assuming the same levy as the year before.
The bill did not include any proposal for reducing costs or liberating municipalities and school districts from state mandates, elements that even some supporters said were critical to ensuring that a cap did not bankrupt local governments.
The significance of the expected Senate vote on Monday may ultimately be more symbolic than practical. Assembly lawmakers are unlikely to approve the bill as written, and Mr. Cuomo is likely to accept at least some concessions to secure final passage.
Aides to Mr. Cuomo said the Senate and the Assembly have had a draft of the bill since the middle of December. They also suggested that the new legislation simply turned Mr. Cuomo's campaign proposal into a proper bill -- which the governor has been promising since the day he took office.
For his first program bill, Mr. Cuomo certainly managed to avoid attracting attention. Some lawmakers in the Assembly learned of the bill only when called by a reporter on Sunday night.
Upon learning of the bill's introduction, Assemblyman Rory I. Lancman, a Democrat of Queens, said, ''Every conversation has to start somewhere, and I guess the conversation is starting.''

HEADLINE: Rich, Poor And a Rift Exposed By Unrest

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK and MONA EL-NAGGAR

 BODY:
CAIRO -- As the government of Egypt shakes from a broad-based uprising, long-simmering resentments have burst into open class warfare.
Over the past several days, hundreds of thousands of Egyptians -- from indigent fruit peddlers and doormen to students and engineers, even wealthy landlords -- poured into the streets together to denounce President Hosni Mubarak and battle his omnipresent security police. Then, on Friday night, the police pulled out of Egypt's major cities abruptly, and tensions between rich and poor exploded.
Looters from Cairo's vast shantytowns attacked gleaming suburban shopping malls, wild rumors swirled of gunfights at the bridges and gates to the most expensive neighborhoods and some of their residents turned wistful about Mr. Mubarak and his authoritarian rule. 
''It is as if a domestic war is declared,'' said Sarah Elayashi, 33, from an apartment in the affluent neighborhood of Heliopolis, not far from Mr. Mubarak's palace. ''And we have nothing to defend ourselves but kitchen knives and mop sticks.''
''The protesters are against us,'' she added. ''We hope President Mubarak stays because at least we have national security. I wish we could be like the United States with a democracy, but we cannot. We have to have a ruler with an iron hand.''
Now some accuse the Mubarak government of deliberately fanning class tensions in order to create demands for the restoration of its brutal security state. But such resentments have built up here for nearly a decade outside of public view.
''These big guys are stealing all the money,'' said Mohamed Ibraham, a 24-year-old textile worker standing at his second job as a fruit peddler in a hard-pressed neighborhood called Dar-al-Salam. ''If they were giving us our rights, why would we protest? People are desperate.''
He had little sympathy for those frightened by the specter of looting. He complained that he could barely afford his rent and said the police routinely humiliated him by shaking him down for money, overturning his cart or stealing his fruit. ''And then we hear about how these big guys all have these new boats and the 100,000 pound villas. They are building housing, but not for us -- for those people up high.''
The widening chasm between rich and poor in Cairo has been one of the conspicuous aspects of city life over the last decade -- and especially the last five years. Though there were always extremes of wealth and poverty here, until recently the rich lived more or less among the poor -- in grander apartments or more spacious apartments but mixed together in the same city.
But as the Mubarak administration has taken steps toward privatizing more government businesses, kicking off an economic boom for some, rich Egyptians have fled the city. They have flocked to gated communities full of big American-style homes around country clubs, and the remoteness of their lives from those of average Egyptians has become starkly visible.
The new rich communities and older affluent enclaves closer to the city were seized with fear over the weekend after a rash of looting Friday night.
At the ravaged City Centre mall, looters had pulled bank A.T.M.'s from the walls, smashed in skylights and carted away televisions, and on Sunday a small crowd was inspecting the damage and debating the causes.
A group of men standing guard said they had watched the police abandon the mall as if on command Friday at 11 p.m., and the first looters arrived in cars shortly after. They argued that the government had tried to create the impression of chaos. Others blamed hordes who poured in from impoverished neighborhoods, or Bedouins who they said came in from the desert.
Ayman Adbel Al, 43, a civil engineer inspecting the damage with his two teenage sons, blamed Mr. Mubarak, arguing that he had allowed the growing class divisions in Egyptian society to build up for years until they exploded last week. ''I can say that I am well off, but I hate it, too. It is not humanitarian,'' he said, showing a picture of himself with his family at the protests Saturday. The only people who wanted Mr. Mubarak to stay in power, he argued, were rich people ''afraid for their money.''

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Tevatron'' (editorial, Jan. 22):
It is not only sad that such a productive atom smasher as the Tevatron in Illinois will be shut down but it may also not be wise. When, in 1993, Congress shut off funds for the superconducting supercollider being built underground in Texas, many of the newly unemployed physicists found jobs on Wall Street. Wouldn't you rather have the nation's physicists smashing protons than designing and smashing collateralized debt obligations?

HEADLINE: Clinton Calls for 'Orderly Transition' to Greater Freedom in Egypt

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Elisabeth Bumiller, Brian Knowlton and Thom Shanker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called on Sunday for ''an orderly transition'' to a more politically open Egypt, stopping short of telling its embattled president, Hosni Mubarak, to step down but clearly laying the groundwork for his departure.
Mrs. Clinton, making a round of Sunday talk shows, insisted that Mr. Mubarak's future was up to the Egyptian people. But she said on ''State of the Union'' on CNN that the United States stood ''ready to help with the kind of transition that will lead to greater political and economic freedom.'' And she emphasized that elections scheduled for this fall must be free and fair.
President Obama reinforced that message in phone calls on Saturday and Sunday to other leaders in the region, including King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, as the administration tried to contain the regional reverberations.
Mrs. Clinton confronted one such ripple effect when she said on the ABC News program ''This Week'' that the United States did not intend to cut military aid to Egypt, despite the White House announcement Friday that the nearly $1.5 billion in annual assistance was under review. 
The prospect of a cutoff of aid alarmed the Israeli government, an Israeli official said, because it is linked to the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel and could alienate the Egyptian military, which Israel views as a stabilizing force in an otherwise deteriorating situation.
Israel has conveyed its concerns to the United States about the risk of a sudden collapse of the Egyptian government, this official said. It worries about who would replace Mr. Mubarak, viewing the ascendant opposition leader, Mohamed ElBaradei, with some wariness.
In Mr. Obama's phone calls, which also included the leaders of Turkey and Britain, he ''reiterated his focus on opposing violence and calling for restraint,'' a White House statement said.
The administration has walked a fine line in recent days, balancing its alliance with Mr. Mubarak, a crucial partner in Middle East peace talks, with its desire not to be on the wrong side of history.
Still, Mrs. Clinton's comments suggested that the administration was running out of patience with the Egyptian leader.
Mr. Mubarak's appointment on Saturday of a vice president, she said, was only the ''bare beginning'' of a process that must include a national dialogue with the protesters and ''free, fair and credible'' elections, scheduled for September. She described the elections for a ''next president'' as an ''action-enforcing event that is already on the calendar.''
''We have been very clear that we want to see a transition to democracy,'' Mrs. Clinton said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''And we want to see the kind of steps taken to bring that about. We want to see an orderly transition.''
She noted that for nearly three decades the United States had been imploring Mr. Mubarak to appoint a vice president. She offered no endorsement of the man he named, Omar Suleiman, the chief of Egyptian intelligence, whom she has met several times in Cairo and Washington.
''There are some new people taking responsibility,'' Mrs. Clinton said on CBS's ''Face the Nation.'' ''We hope they can contribute to the kind of economic and democratic reforms that the people of Egypt deserve.''
The administration's caution is drawing criticism from some in Egypt, including Dr. ElBaradei. Speaking on ''Face the Nation,'' he said, ''The American government cannot ask the Egyptian people to believe that a dictator who has been in power for 30 years will be the one to implement democracy.''
The White House has refrained from calling publicly for Mr. Mubarak to step down, officials have said, because it worries about losing leverage and contributing to a political vacuum in Egypt, which could be filled by extremist, anti-American forces.
Indeed, Mrs. Clinton reaffirmed the ties between the United States and Egypt. She said the army appeared to be acting with restraint, differentiating between peaceful protesters and looters. But she warned Egypt not to make changes that resulted in a democracy for ''six months or a year, evolving into a military dictatorship.''
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, spoke on Sunday with the chief of staff of the Egyptian Army, Lt. Gen. Sami Hafez Enan. Admiral Mullen expressed his appreciation for the ''continued professionalism of the Egyptian military,'' said his spokesman, Capt. John Kirby.
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates spoke over the weekend about the crisis to two of his counterparts -- Mohammed Hussein Tantawi, the Egyptian defense minister, and Ehud Barak, the Israeli defense minister -- but no details were given.
Mrs. Clinton taped her interviews before leaving on a day trip to Haiti. There, she confronted another country in political upheaval, with recent presidential elections mired in charges of vote-rigging and fraud, as well as the surprise return of a former dictator, Jean-Claude Duvalier.
Yet for all its misery, Haiti poses much less of a problem to the administration than does Egypt, given Egypt's role as the fulcrum of one of the world's most volatile regions. With the revolt in Tunisia, and protests in Yemen and Jordan, the United States faces an arc of instability in the Arab world.
''This is the Obama administration's first foreign policy crisis in real time,'' said Aaron David Miller, a Middle East peace negotiator in the Clinton administration. ''Their response is marked by bad options, precarious outcomes and limited influence to shape -- let alone direct -- events.''
Its handling of the question of aid to Egypt illustrates the perils the administration faces in making any comments.
The announcement by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, that the United States was rethinking aid ''surely could have been interpreted as interrupting the continuity of the relationship,'' said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former American ambassador to Egypt and Israel.
''Washington understood immediately that it had to recalibrate,'' Mr. Kurtzer said, adding that, under the circumstances, it had performed well. ''One can't minimize how difficult this is,'' he said.
For all the dangers, Senator John McCain of Arizona, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, envisioned more promising events on ''State of the Union'' on CNN, provided certain conditions were met: Mr. Mubarak agrees not to seek re-election; turns over his government to a caretaker; and ensures ''a free, open, transparent election in September.''
''But this is a narrow window of opportunity,'' Mr. McCain said. ''The longer unrest exists, the more likely it is to become extreme.''

HEADLINE: A Phish Fan's Secret Smile

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS QUENQUA

 BODY:
CNBC may not have known it, but last week, the financial news network ran one of the greatest Phish shows in recent memory.
The band itself was nowhere to be seen. But Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Company and an occasional commentator on CNBC, gave fans of the jam band Phish a thrill when he appeared on ''The Kudlow Report'' on Jan. 24 to discuss the effect that global inflation might have on the American economy. 
Mr. Greenhaus has become a folk hero among fans of the band for slyly working in references to its music during his media appearances. And that one was a standout performance.
In seven minutes, Mr. Greenhaus ticked off references to Phish songs like ''Backwards Down the Number Line,'' ''Fast Enough for You'' and ''Free,'' each fitting enough to the conversation to glide right over the head of Mr. Kudlow. For example, Mr. Greenhaus characterized inflation as ''going backwards down the number line for the better part of two years now.''
Reached in his office on Thursday morning, Mr. Greenhaus, who has seen more than 80 Phish concerts since 1995, said the references were just his natural way of speaking. Since 2009, he has surreptitiously quoted Phish on Bloomberg Radio, Fox Business Network and CNBC. ''It's second nature to a large degree,'' he said. ''It's just part of my vernacular.''
But that does not mean it is not premeditated. Moments before appearing on CNBC, Mr. Greenhaus posted a thread on Phantasy Tour, an online forum for jam band fans where he is a regular, titled ''Put on CNBC Now.''
CNBC declined to comment.
Thinly veiled musical references among the financial set are hardly unheard-of. Just one day after Mr. Greenhaus's CNBC appearance, Bernie McSherry of Cuttone & Company wrote a 500-word note about recent stock market gains titled ''Is She Buying the Stairway to Heaven?''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Clinton Urges Egyptian Dialogue

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON; Joseph Berger contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday urged Egyptians to take up a national dialogue that would lead to free and fair elections this fall and, while not explicitly distancing the United States from the embattled President Hosni Mubarak, said that the United States stood ''ready to help with the kind of transition that will lead to greater political and economic freedom.''
She issued a strong endorsement of key groups working to exert their influence on the chaotic Egyptian protests the military, civil society groups and, perhaps most importantly, the nation's people but carefully avoided any specific commitment to Mr. Mubarak. 
Her phrasing seemed to imply an eventual end to Mr. Mubarak's 30 years in power. But when asked whether the United States was backing away from Mr. Mubarak and whether he could survive the protests, the secretary chose her words carefully. His political future, she said, ''is going to be up to the Egyptian people.''
Making the rounds of the Sunday television talk shows, Mrs. Clinton urged the government in Cairo to respond in a ''clear, unambiguous way'' to the people's demands and to do so ''immediately'' by initiating a national dialogue. At the same time, she was supportive of the Egyptian military, calling it ''a respected institution in Egyptian society, and we know they have delicate line to walk.''
Mrs. Clinton seemed to indicate that the Obama administration's best hope was for a dialogue to channel the enormous energy on the streets, clearing the way for national elections already scheduled for September, presumably by reaching agreement on a fair and open framework and a corps of international observers.
''We have a calendar that already has elections for the next president scheduled,'' she said. ''There is an action-enforcing event that is already on the calendar.''
She did not address the question of whether events might short-circuit such a process.
Mohamed ElBaradei, the Noble laureate and a leading critic of the government, laid out a scenario of his own in a television interview on ABC. He said that Mr. Mubarak must step down immediately; that a ''government of national salvation'' should be formed, representing both the people and the army; and that ''free and fair elections'' should then be held.
But he also suggested that the Obama administration had not gone nearly far enough. The administration's response, he said, had gone over ''like a lead'' balloon in Egypt. ''They need to let go of Mubarak,'' he said.
Separately, Senator John McCain of Arizona, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, laid out yet another scenario: He said that if Mr. Mubarak would agree to not seek re-election; turn over his government to a caretaker; and allow a process to assure ''a free, open, transparent election in September,'' then, ''I think you could do that, but this is a narrow window of opportunity. The longer unrest exists, the more likely it is to become extreme.''
Two former senior American diplomats, not bound by the discretion required of the secretary of state, predicted that Mr. Mubarak's political demise was only a matter of time.
''I believe it,'' Edward Walker, a former ambassador to Egypt , said on CNN about Mr. Mubarak's eventual departure. Referring to the protesters on Egyptian streets, he added, ''He's become a symbol for everything that they find objectionable.''
John Negroponte, the former ambassador to the United Nations, said he agreed that Mr. Mubarak's days in office were numbered.
Mr. Walker said he did not expect a rise to power of the Muslim Brotherhood, and he said that to suggest a parallel to the Iranian revolution of 1979 was ''a way overreach.''
Mr. Negroponte seemed a bit less sanguine. ''We have a lot of examples of disasters that have followed after the demise of an authoritarian leader,'' he said on CNN. ''If this goes wrong it could be very bad for our interests.''
He added: '' I don't think we should be in that big of a hurry for the regime to change.''
John A. Boehner, the new speaker of the United States House of Representatives, agreed on Sunday that what the American government does not want in Egypt is for ''radical ideologies to take control of a very large and important country in the Middle East.'' But he said the Obama administration ''has handled this tense situation pretty well.''
''Clearly, reforms need to occur in Egypt and, frankly, anyplace around the world where people are calling out for freedom and democracy,'' he said in an appearance on ''Fox News Sunday,'' adding later, ''There are legitimate grievances that the Egyptian people have and they need to be addressed.''
''Whether that is through free and fair elections, whether it's through more democratic reforms in the short-term, I think all of these again are moving in the right direction,'' he said.

HEADLINE: THE CAUCUS; A Plan to Cheer Up Deficit Pessimists

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
''The State of the Union surprised me,'' Representative Paul Ryan says. Instead of urgency, the Wisconsin Republican explained in an interview, President Obama offered boilerplate on deficit reduction.
Mr. Ryan's response to Mr. Obama's annual address was plenty urgent, warning that a Greece-style fiscal calamity was ''around the corner.'' Yet the earnest new chairman of the House Budget Committee did not lay out any clearer path to solvency than the president did.
Indeed, Congressional Republicans have only begun to grapple with the limited deficit-reduction steps that they promised in 2010. Like Mr. Obama's proposed freeze on domestic spending, their cuts would only scratch the surface of what is required to repair the nation's long-term fiscal imbalance. 
Which suggests that the quest for a durable budget fix is going nowhere fast.
''I'm pessimistic,'' said Steve Bell, a longtime Senate Republican aide now at the Bipartisan Policy Center. ''We're going to have two years of stagnation.''
His gloom reflects a growing consensus among fiscal experts in the capital. For politicians, inaction usually seems safer than action, especially when action means raising taxes or trimming benefits for voters.
But unlikely does not mean impossible. Divided government has produced improbable budget compromises before.
Lessons of 1990
In 1990, when Mr. Obama was a Harvard Law student, budget woes also seemed intractable. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit-reduction law was poised to force deep spending cuts.
A Republican president, George Bush, and a Democratic-controlled Congress both considered those cuts unacceptable; America was slipping into recession and, by midsummer, preparing for war against Iraq. But Mr. Bush's ''read my lips'' pledge against tax increases blocked negotiations on a compromise.
Mr. Bush cleared it by publicly declaring the need for ''tax revenue increases.'' That eventually led to a $500 billion deficit-reduction deal that included raising taxes, cutting domestic spending and curbing entitlement programs like Medicare.
Even with a projected 2011 deficit three times that large, no one expected Mr. Obama to lay out peremptory solutions in his State of the Union. ''That would be self-destructive,'' said Robert Reischauer, who led the Congressional Budget Office during the 1990 deal.
But Mr. Obama could have initiated negotiations with Republicans. He did not.
The reasons are not complicated. The president is safeguarding two fragile recoveries -- of the economy, and of his own popular standing. He promised in 2008 not to raise taxes on middle-class Americans; Mr. Bush's re-election defeat in 1992 underscores the risk of breaking such vows.
The House speaker, John A. Boehner, and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, have reason to be wary, too. Accepting tax increases would incite a Tea Party revolt. Embracing entitlement curbs that Mr. Ryan has proposed would provoke fierce Democratic attacks just after a Republican midterm triumph that was fueled by older voters.
Thus, Mr. Ryan said, ''a down payment on debt reduction'' may be the best achievable outcome before 2012 elections. With 87 first-term House Republicans, he noted, ''we've got a maturation process to go through'' in understanding budget trade-offs.
Flashpoint
That ''maturation process'' for ideologically charged new lawmakers is what worries Mr. Bell, the Republican aide. He doubts his party can muster majorities for even the $50 billion in domestic cuts that they are expected to seek for the remainder of this fiscal year. ''Who's going to sit down these new members and say, 'Ladies and gentlemen, you've said all these nice things, but they can't happen'?''
But Mr. Reischauer sees that very difficulty as crucial to the prospects for compromise.
In this possibility, the flashpoint is the Congressional vote on raising the government's debt ceiling, which the Treasury says could be reached by March 30. In return for their votes, Mr. Reischauer speculates, House Republicans insist on cuts too deep for the White House or Democratic-led Senate to accept.
Stalemate induces panic among investors, who until now have been content to finance the deficits at low interest rates. And then, he said, the president ''begins meeting privately with Boehner and McConnell,'' as well as with the House and Senate Democratic leaders.
The result: All sides commit to a 1990-style solution, including tax increases and curbs on Social Security and other entitlements. Negotiations begin.
Mr. Reischauer pegs prospects for that happening at 5 percent. But William Hoagland, a former Senate Republican budget expert, said, ''I give it a 50-50 chance.''
If Mr. Obama ''will come out and push on this, he can shame the Republicans into going along,'' Mr. Hoagland reasoned. ''It doesn't have to be a kamikaze mission.''
Mr. Ryan shied away from ''hypothetical speculation.'' The lack of momentum, he noted, ''just shows how difficult all this is.''

HEADLINE: Directors Give Top Prize To 'The Kings Speech'

BYLINE: By MELENA RYZIK

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES- Tom Hooper, the director of ''The King's Speech,'' picked up the top prize at the Directors Guild of America awards on Saturday night, a surprise victory that scrambled the prognostications of the Oscar experts. The win came at the expense of another front-runner, David Fincher, the director of ''The Social Network,'' and followed a similar upset at the Producers Guild of America awards when the British period drama took the top honor. (David O. Russell (''The Fighter''), Darren Aronofsky (''Black Swan'') and Christopher Nolan (''Inception'') were the other nominees last night.) 
''Thank you D.G.A., this is really, truly the hugest honor of my life,'' Mr. Hooper said at the Directors Guild ceremony, held in a Hollywood ballroom. Coupled with the Producers Guild honor, the win advances the chances for ''The King's Speech'' to fare well at the Oscars, where it was already heavily favored to win best actor for Colin Firth.
''It changed everything,'' David Seidler, the screenwriter of ''The King's Speech'' said of the P.G.A. But even he was surprised by the D.G.A. win.
''I can't believe it,'' he said. ''I'm just beside myself.''
''Inside Job,'' a tough-minded deconstruction of the 2008 financial crisis, won best the D.G.A. prize for documentary. ''It's a pretty ballsy, out-there movie,'' the director, Charles Ferguson, said in his acceptance speech. ''It didn't make me too many friends in the investment banking community.''
The Directors Guild ceremony, hosted for the 23rd year in a row by Carl Reiner, included presentations by Steven Spielberg, Kathryn Bigelow and Michael Apted to commemorate the group's 75th anniversary. The event ran for nearly six hours.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Key European Leaders Urge Restraint in Cairo

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY

 BODY:
BERLIN -- With the European Union yet to form a common response to the mass demonstrations in the Arab world, leaders of three of its diplomatic heavyweights appealed for free and fair elections in Egypt over the weekend. 
The three -- Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany -- fell short of calling for the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, despite the protests against him on the streets, and cited his modulated approach to the region.
''We are deeply concerned about the events that we are witnessing in Egypt,'' the three leaders wrote in a statement. ''We recognize the moderating role President Mubarak has played over many years in the Middle East. We now urge him to show the same moderation in addressing the current situation in Egypt.''
The statement also called on Mr. Mubarak to avoid ''at all costs the use of violence against unarmed civilians and on the demonstrators to exercise their rights peacefully.''
The three leaders said it was essential that Mr. Mubarak quickly introduce the reforms he promised during his nationwide television address Friday.
''The Egyptian people have legitimate grievances and a longing for a just and better future,'' their statement said. ''We urge President Mubarak to embark on a process of transformation which should be reflected in a broad-based government and in free and fair elections.''
The statement by Mrs. Merkel, Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Cameron exposes the lack of any coherent and united response by the European Union as a whole, even though under the Lisbon Treaty of 2009, its reaction to major events was intended to be swifter and united.
The leaders issued the statement in advance of a meeting Monday of E.U. foreign ministers to decide what policies or strategies they could adopt toward a Middle East that is rapidly undergoing change and where the outcome is unpredictable.
The E.U. admitted, as did the United States, that it was taken off guard when demonstrators forced Tunisia's longtime ruler, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, to resign and flee the country more than three weeks ago.
But the political upheaval now taking place in Egypt, which is the most populous country in the Middle East and a crucial ally of the United States and which three decades ago signed a peace agreement with Israel, has left the Europeans and Americans searching for a response. In Israel itself, commentators are questioning the security implications for the region and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
These are issues Mrs. Merkel is expected to raise Monday, when she is planning to travel to Israel. She is one of the first Western leaders to visit the region since the demonstrations in Egypt began Wednesday demanding the resignation of Mr. Mubarak.
The visit is part of German-Israeli consultations aimed at improving political, trade and scientific ties. Mrs. Merkel will be accompanied by several members of her cabinet, including Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere and Economy Minister Rainer Bruderle.
