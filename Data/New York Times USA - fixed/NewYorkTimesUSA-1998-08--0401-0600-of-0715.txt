HEADLINE: Illness, a New Baby, and Then a Struggle for Assistance

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Cynthia Salomon was 7 months' pregnant when her husband, Jose Lazo, was diagnosed with testicular cancer. It was Jan. 8, their daughter's second birthday. They had three jobs between them -- he cooked in two restaurants, she answered the telephone in a bank. But by Feb. 3, after his first operation, she was just another applicant for relief and Medicaid at the East End Income Support Center.
Ms. Salomon waited for hours at the Manhattan welfare center, only to be sent home to call for an appointment. She called 15 times a day to get through. She submitted hospital records, rent receipts, birth certificates and bank statements, dealing with caseworkers trained to push people to work. 
 But by late April, when their second daughter was born and Mr. Lazo underwent more surgery, they still had neither Medicaid nor rent money for their East Harlem apartment.
On paper, the family was eligible three times over for Medicaid, the Federal and state health benefits program created more than 30 years ago for the very poor and the very sick. Even if they had not been close to destitution, Ms. Salomon and the children were entitled to coverage under expanded Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women and young children.
The Patient Accounts department of Mount Sinai Medical Center, where the baby had been born April 25th with a broken clavicle, eventually referred Ms. Salomon to REAP, the Resource, Entitlement and Advocacy Program, founded eight years ago by the hospital's auxiliary. The program wages a kind of rear guard action to capture not just Medicaid payments for the hospital, but every government benefit available to those who come to its storefront office on Madison Avenue and 97th Street.
Over several weeks, Penny Schwartz, the director, and Ydelina Reyes, one of the program's eligibility specialists, spent up to three hours a day calling administrators at the welfare center and city Medicaid offices on behalf of Ms. Saloman and her family, they said. But the computers kept spitting out rejections.
Ms. Schwartz finds it hard to convey to outsiders the Catch-22s of the system. For example, unemployed parents can rarely prove poverty to the satisfaction of the Medicaid system until they get public assistance, she said, because Medicaid requires income documentation like a welfare check or pay stub to show how expenses are met. Welfare system computers do not allow more than one change to be made to a case each day, so that when Ms. Salomon gave birth, caseworkers deducted a $50-a-month pregnancy allowance from the welfare grant the family had never received, and did not add the new baby.
By June, Mr. Lazo's hospital, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, was losing patience. He was scheduled for re-admission June 16 for chemotherapy and an expensive bone marrow transplant. The hospital financial department ruled that unless his Medicaid enrollment was completed by then, providing him a number that could be used for billing, his admission would have to be delayed.
"June 13th we were at home crying, thinking, 'Oh my God,' " Ms. Salomon recalled. "If he doesn't get the chemotherapy, the doctor said the cancer would kill him."
The crucial Medicaid number was activated later that day. "It was nerve-rackingly close," said Ms. Schwartz.

All Walks of Celebrities Offer Their Predictions

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

 BODY:
From two guys in a New Jersey basement comes this weighty tome: "Predictions for the New Millennium."
By day, Todd Nickerson, 30, and David Kristof, 32, are telecommunications salesmen. By night, they are neophyte authors with worldwide headquarters in a Basking Ridge basement with a computer data base of more than 6,000 celebrities who have received their brief queries to write predictions or messages of hope for the new millennium on a simple postcard. 
 More than 600 messages came back -- enough material to fill a book that will be published by Andrews & McMeel in November with reproductions of the handwritten or typewritten musings. The various millennium musers range from Bill Cosby and Joan Rivers -- who predicted that "interest rates will be higher and my breasts will be lower" -- to Desmond Tutu and the Dalai Lama, who expressed confidence that mankind will "act with more maturity in the next century and thus create better prospects for peace, harmony and tolerance."
Mr. Nickerson said that he and his partner did not have a particularly rigorous selection system; they gleaned names of the famous and infamous from magazines and newspapers, drawing the line at murderers. They unsuccessfully approached headliners like Monica S. Lewinsky, Linda R. Tripp and Paula C. Jones, but were satisfied with responses from Gloria Steinem, Chuck Yeager and Newt Gingrich.
"We weren't quite honestly sure that it would be a success," Mr. Nickerson said. "We've just been blown away by all the responses."
However, he expressed some disappointment that he did not get a postcard from President Clinton, who preferred to remain silent about the post-millennium. On this issue, he apparently agreed with Kenneth W. Starr, the independent prosecutor, who didn't return his card, either. DOREEN CARVAJAL

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
Little in Common but Friendship

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES 

 BODY:
The saddest moment in "Any Day Now" comes right after little Renee Jackson and Mary Elizabeth O'Brien pay their bus fares. Mary Elizabeth, who is white, plops down in the nearest available seat. Renee, who is black, walks back out of the bus's front door, goes to the back door and boards. In Birmingham, Ala., in 1962, apparently, sitting in the back of the bus isn't enough. Black people can't even walk past the white passengers in the good seats.
It's hard to trust that depiction, though, since so much of "Any Day Now," a new Lifetime drama series that has its premiere tonight at 9, strains credibility, embraces stereotype and generally falls short of expectations. 
 The series, set in Birmingham in the present, opens by showing the two girls all grown up. Renee (Lorraine Toussaint) is a high-powered Washington lawyer who lives on her cell phone and has lunch dates with senators. Mary Elizabeth (Annie Potts) is still in Birmingham, smoking cigarettes, handing out Happy Meals to her troubled children rather than cooking, and getting fed up with her unemployed, beer-drinking husband. The two women haven't spoken to each other for 24 years, but when Renee's father dies suddenly and she decides to move home to take over his law practice, the former childhood pals are reunited.
This could be the beginning of an interesting portrait of a friendship that survived tumultuous times, but the two personable stars have a lot of earnest, obvious dialogue to deal with. Mary Elizabeth's reaction at first sight of Renee: "You look beautiful, like something out of a magazine." Renee to Mary Elizabeth: "I travel a lot, mostly in Europe and Asia." Mary Elizabeth to Renee, later, when threatened: "You might be some big-shot lawyer but you're alone. You've got no husband, no kids." And in one of the show's many flashbacks, Renee and her father (who is, of course, a lawyer working with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.) have this exchange.
Dad: "And fear and ignorance breed -- what?"
Renee: "Prejudice."
Dad: "That's my girl."
Naturally, when Mary Elizabeth and Renee have a serious argument at age 19, they end up trading racial epithets.
In 1962, I was growing up about 30 miles from Birmingham, and I have trouble believing that this friendship between school-age girls of different races could have existed in that time and place. If the series grows stronger, maybe we'll gladly suspend disbelief. But the first episode doesn't look promising, with its use of unlikely coincidences like Renee's return visit to a lingerie shop where she and her mother (who looked and dressed like a black Jacqueline Kennedy) were once treated badly. She finds the same saleswoman still working there and seems genuinely surprised that the woman doesn't remember her.
What happened in Birmingham and throughout the South in the early 60's could be the inspiration for thought-provoking, multilayered drama. The subject deserves much better than this.
 
'Maggie'
Lifetime, tonight at 10
It's easy to sympathize with Maggie Day, wife, mother and would-be veterinarian. Maggie (Ann Cusack) is ignored by her husband, who is too busy being thrilled with having been declared a "leading" cardiologist in a news magazine. For Maggie's 40th birthday, her teen-age daughter gives her a book called "You're Over the Hill When . . . " No wonder Maggie regularly fantasizes about being ravished in her kitchen by a hunky actor from "Melrose Place."
And no wonder she's drawn to Richard (John Slattery), her boss at the animal clinic. He's handsome, he takes her seriously, and he's funny. When a man brings in his pet rabbit, who has been bitten by a pet duck, Richard explains that this is clearly a case of Warner syndrome, the belief that ducks and rabbits hang out together.
Back home, the teen-age daughter's best male friend, an aspiring artist, has decided to become gay because so many great artists have been. This puzzles Maggie. "Are you attracted to men?" she asks. The young man answers hopefully, "Not yet."
"Maggie" has a lot going for it: an appealing heroine played by the fabulous Ms. Cusack, a great supporting cast and jokes that are actually funny. What a concept!

HEADLINE: Tailoring A Healthy Message To Blacks

BYLINE: By LINDA VILLAROSA 

 BODY:
COMPARED with whites, black Americans have higher death rates from all kinds of serious illnesses -- from heart disease, diabetes, stroke, some forms of cancer and asthma. Black babies are more likely to be born small and die in their first year, and black adults live fewer years than their white counterparts.
In the past, many of these problems could be attributed to the fact that blacks were more likely than whites to be poor, to have received less education and to have inadequate access to health care. In recent years, though, the economic gap between blacks and whites has narrowed, yet the health gap persists. 
 This problem is attracting the attention of researchers, health officials and the President, who has made it a priority. He is seeking $400 million over five years for the Initiative to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health, which would target six health categories that disproportionately affect minorities: infant mortality, diabetes, cancer screening and management, cardiovascular disease, H.I.V. and AIDS, and immunizations.
A large part of the problem, experts say, is the difficulty in communicating health information to the black community. Despite an increased public appetite for the latest news about medicine, nutrition and exercise, and increased coverage in the press, several studies and experts say health educators may not be communicating the message clearly or appropriately to blacks. Or, blacks may be ignoring it.
For example, three studies reported in a recent issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association found that black parents often missed hearing about a campaign to reduce the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS.
The Back to Sleep campaign was created in 1994 by the United States Public Health Service, the American Academy of Pediatrics and several other organizations after experts who attended a National Institutes of Health conference concluded that placing a newborn in a side or back sleep position helped reduce the risk of SIDS. The campaign seems to have had impressive results: In 1992, 70 percent of parents put their babies to sleep on their stomachs, which increased the risk of SIDS, and in 1996, only 24 percent did so. Since 1992, the rate of SIDS has declined by 56 percent.
But the research also showed that low-income black and Hispanic mothers are less likely to put their babies to sleep on their backs, and their rates of SIDS remain higher than those of their white counterparts.
"The Back to Sleep message is not being adequately transmitted to the black population," Dr. Michael H. Malloy, a pediatrician at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, wrote in an editorial accompanying the research reports.
Dr. Malloy, a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics task force that helped devise the campaign, noted that it had not been designed with any particular group in mind, though, at the time, it was widely known that the rate of SIDS was much higher for blacks than whites. Rather, he said, "we were more interested in a generic campaign," with brochures and posters mailed to health care providers to pass along Back to Sleep information to their patients.
In one of the medical journal studies, researchers found that the greatest influence on a mother's decision to put her baby to sleep on her back was advice from a health care professional. Yet, in a small study conducted in Louisville, Ky., researchers found that 72 percent of parents in a predominantly white private practice setting reported that their physicians had recommended putting their children to sleep on their backs compared with only 48 percent in a predominantly black inner-city clinic.
Dr. Reed V. Tuckson, the highest-ranking black in the hierarchy of the American Medical Association, said, "The public health information network in every major city is being dismantled, and the opportunity for a health care provider to spend quiet, deliberate time in conversation with patients is diminishing."
Dr. Tuckson, the A.M.A.'s senior vice president for professional standards, added: "There is a need to increase the cultural competence of doctors dedicated to service in poor communities. In the sleep studies, it wasn't that the mothers were stupid or irresponsible. They were concerned that the babies couldn't sleep on their backs or that they would choke. There is a need for their health care providers to go a little deeper."
Another study, by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the National Association of Black Journalists, involved surveys of 804 blacks and 664 whites to determine the effectiveness of the press in delivering health information. Compared with whites, blacks were much less likely to think the press provides enough health and health care coverage and more likely to think the press does a poor job of "telling people in this country what they need to know about health and health care."
Most blacks in the survey said they believed the press offered insufficient coverage of specific health concerns of black people, mainly because news organizations are not aware of or interested in the health problems of blacks.
Many policy makers say health messages must be targeted to and tailored for the communities they are designed to reach. "Too often the messages are not culturally or ethnically appropriate, because they are designed by policy makers who plan the programs rather than by the communities they are designed to serve," said Sharon K. Davis, Ph.D., director of the program in minority health policy research and disease prevention at the Harvard School of Public Health.
In an interview, Dr. David Satcher, the Surgeon General, offered an example from his experience. "Over 50 percent of black women are obese, and we have not made a major dent in reducing that risk in the black community, partly because obesity isn't viewed the same way as in the white community," he said. "I grew up in a culture where being overweight was considered healthy. 'You sure look healthy,' people would say. Given that, you can't communicate the idea that overweight is unhealthy with one generic message."
Dr. Satcher, who grew up in rural Alabama, said community groups and church organizations must be recruited to spread the message of good health. He noted that $50 million of the proposed spending for the health disparities initiative would be marked for public health education.
"Public health has to get as close to communities as we can," Dr. Satcher said. "We have to develop partnerships with community groups and churches and follow their leadership of how best to communicate health information."
One such program, Black Pearls, operates in Brooklyn under the auspices of the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health. Black Pearls distributes information about preventing heart disease, breast cancer, sexually transmitted diseases and other illnesses through 11 beauty shops.
On a recent Saturday afternoon at Merita's, a salon in Crown Heights, 15 customers sat under hair dryers to hear a talk about breast cancer, which kills black women more often and at younger ages than white.
The lecture was delivered by Renee Murray-Bachmann, a dietitian, nutritionist and registered nurse who lives near the shop. She kept the talk upbeat and showed the women how to examine their breasts.
On other days, Merita's owner, Mary Edith Aikens-Reed, runs a video about breast cancer produced by the American Cancer Society on her small television and encourages her customers to fill out questionnaires to measure their knowledge of breast care as they have their hair done. She receives 50 cents per questionnaire and $100 per month from the institute.
"We wanted to bring the information to where people are," said Ruth C. Browne, director of the Arthur Ashe Institute, who added that her organization plans to start a similar program in barbershops next month. "This is a natural place and a comfortable environment for people to receive the information."
Andrea Phillips-Merriman, another health educator, conducts workshops on food and nutrition for the Brooklyn Perinatal Network. "I have to be sensitive, observant and aware of these people's lives," she said of the pregnant women and new mothers who are her clients. "Step out into the neighborhood, and you'll see that it's easy to buy fried fast food, but harder to find fresh vegetables and fruit. I can't do 'textbook teaching' about something theoretical like the food pyramid. How receptive are the women going to be to that message?"
Ms. Phillips-Merriman offers her clients inexpensive, available, healthful alternatives. "I try to give them suggestions using foods familiar to them," she said. "How about a mango smoothie or sweet potatoes instead of french fries?"
Still, no matter how innovative and well-intentioned any of these programs are, the real test is whether the diseases they target decline. "At the end of the day, the main thing that counts is outcomes," Dr. Tuckson said. "We have to develop accountability measures. The bottom line is: are people surviving?"

HEADLINE: Labor Eyes a Prize: Hotels of New Orleans

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS

 BODY:
Jacqueline Smith, a 40-year-old hotel maid, knows all too well the hard reality that lies behind this alluring city's tourism boom.
While the city's hotels command premium rates, thousands of workers who carry the industry on their backs -- housekeepers, banquet waiters and laundry-room employees -- work for wages that keep them below the poverty line. Ms. Smith earns $5.98 an hour cleaning rooms at the Wyndham Hotel. The $700 a month she takes home is hardly enough to support her three children. 
 "I do it to survive," said Ms. Smith, a high school dropout who says she is too busy working and rearing children to return to school. "Who likes to clean up behind someone else?"
New Orleans is hardly alone in moving toward a tourism economy that creates mainly low-skill, low-wage jobs. But its size and prominence have made it the focus of a campaign by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to organize workers in one of the nation's fastest-growing sectors: tourism, hotels and casinos.
The effort represents an important new direction for labor, as three unions that have feuded in the past cooperate in what they term a "wall to wall" organizing drive that seeks to unionize all of the hotel industry's 16,000 workers here, rather than those in a few selected work places. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations hopes to increasingly employ such industrywide, citywide drives.
And just as the citywide campaign recalls the industrial unionism of the 1930's, the organizers are pursuing a strategy rarely used since the 1960's. They are asserting, as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. did when he marched with Memphis sanitation workers in 1968, that unionization converges with civil rights when it aims to bring economic justice to a mainly minority work force.
"You have these crushing ironies here that aren't acceptable in terms of basic social and economic justice," said the director of the organizing drive, Wade Rathke. "The industry is wildly profitable.
The Hilton here is one of the most profitable hotels in the chain, and room rates in New Orleans are rising about the fastest in the nation. Yet workers are caught in a minimum-wage service-sector situation where they don't make enough to live on."
With only 11 percent of the nation's hotel workers unionized, both business and labor are closely watching the organizing drive. New Orleans officials have long boasted that the tourism boom, aided by an immense convention center, has created a tide that is lifting all boats. But the unions are basing their organizing drive on a different premise: that the boom has been a bust for many hotel workers.
"We need a union because it will help get us benefits," said Ms. Smith, who says she earns too little to afford the health insurance offered by her employer.
But Bill Langkopp, executive vice president of the New Orleans Hotel and Motel Association, said: "I don't know that the employees are unhappy. I doubt very seriously that a lot of people are grossly underpaid, especially when the big problem I keep hearing about is hotels can't get enough help."
In searching the nation for places to mount major organizing drives, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. selected New Orleans because its hotel industry appeared to offer one of the best -- or worst -- examples of the chasm between haves and have-nots.
While the tourism explosion has created thousands of jobs, few pay well. Industry experts estimate that at a New Orleans hotel with 1,000 rooms and 700 employees, the manager might earn $120,000 to $150,000 a year, the five assistant managers $80,000 and the 50 or so supervisors $30,000 to $45,000. But the vast majority -- the housekeepers, waiters and kitchen prep workers -- earn less than $15,000 a year.
"It's an industry where 5 percent of the people are chiefs and 90-95 percent are Indians," said Stanley Turkel, a hotel industry consultant.
Union leaders argue that the city's hotels can afford to pay more because the average room rate -- $104.96 per night, according to the Smith Travel Service -- is by far the highest in the South and the fifth highest in the nation, higher than the rates in Chicago, Miami and Washington.
At the same time, housekeepers in New Orleans hotels are paid less than $6 an hour on average, which is less than in any major city, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The Rev. James Orange, a Baptist minister who marched in Memphis with Dr. King and is working in the New Orleans campaign, said the inequities were both economic and racial. The work force, he noted, is overwhelmingly black and Hispanic, while the managers are overwhelmingly white.
"The workers I saw in Memphis in 1968 were better off than the workers I see here in 1998," Mr. Orange said.
Several hotel managers criticized the unionization effort and defended their pay scales, saying they were high enough to attract housekeepers and other workers.
Paul Tomey, manager of the 1,100-room Sheraton, which has a reputation for above-average pay, said, "We certainly want to make sure that employees get everything they need in working conditions and competitive pay. But we'd prefer not to have a third party between us."
With backing from the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the three unions cooperating in the drive -- the service employees, the hotel and restaurant employees and the operating engineers -- have a $1 million annual budget and 25 full-time organizers. But the campaign by the Hospitality, Hotels and Restaurants Organizing Committee is progressing slowly as hotels fight back.
In April, for example, one Sheraton manager sent out a memorandum asserting that "the union pushers" were hungry for dues money and taking the workers for granted.
"This union will stop at nothing to try to get its hands on your money," the memorandum said. "They want you to believe that the whole city of New Orleans is knocking down their doors just to get in. Nothing could be further from the truth. This union is broke. They need your money."
So far, the drive has had one big victory and one defeat. In January, 648 waiters, cooks and other workers at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center voted by a ratio of 3 to 1 to unionize. But in February, the Superdome's food workers, who are employed by the Aramark Corporation, a Philadelphia-based contractor, voted, 273 to 128, against unionizing.
In June, Federal labor officials ordered a new election after finding that Aramark had improperly influenced the vote.
John Wattenberg, an Aramark spokesman, said, "Aramark doesn't believe that it is necessary to unionize our workers in New Orleans, as we prefer dealing directly with them, without third-party involvement."
Harold Toomer, a 60-year-old banquet waiter at the convention center, said he had voted to unionize because he earned less working a lunch or dinner than he did 30 years ago, after factoring in inflation.
Explaining why the workers voted to unionize, Mr. Toomer said: "It's like anything else. If you kick a dog long enough, it's going to bite you."
Like many outspoken union supporters, Mr. Toomer said his employer had cut back his hours to punish him.
"The hotels have put the fear of God in them," said Jacquelyn Clark, a union organizer. "When I visit people, they often tell me, 'I can't talk to you. I'll get fired.' "
Federal law prohibits employers from retaliating against any worker for supporting a union.
Valencia, a 27-year-old housekeeper who spoke on the condition that only her middle name be used, complained that she earned just $5.78 an hour after six years on the job. Only through Medicaid and food stamps can she support her three children, she said.
She also said that her hotel often gave her only three or four days of work a week in the summer lull.
"I do my best," she said, standing in front of a neatly kept house desperate for a paint job and roof repairs. "I try to make the money stretch out. It's nothing to live off of."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Analysts Ponder Banks' Woes, but Investors Jump Ship

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
How the mighty have fallen.
Bank stocks, among the sizzlers in the stock market's bull run of the last few years, have been battered in recent weeks. 
 The villains are varied -- financial turmoil abroad, concern about how easily some banks will deliver on the promises of their mega-mergers, escalating worries from regulators about bad loans both here and abroad. The extent of the drubbing is sobering.
Since mid-July, bank stocks have fallen twice as much as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. The S.& P. money-center banks index, representing the country's largest international banks, has plunged 15.3 percent since July 15. Its counterpart, the S.& P. index of major regional banks, has sunk 14.3 percent. The downturn has far outpaced the 7.8 percent drop in the broad stock market and exceeds the weakness among other financial services companies sensitive to market sentiment, namely investment banks and brokerage firms.
Analysts are of many minds about the outlook for banking stocks, with some sounding alarms and others remaining cautiously optimistic. But investors' opinions have been more unified. They have punted their bank holdings over the last month.
To wit, a brief stroll through the wreckage:
Suntrust Banks, down 23 percent; Banc One, down 22 percent; First Chicago, down 21 percent; BankBoston, down 21 percent; First Union, down 19 percent; Citicorp, down 17.5 percent; Bankers Trust, down 16.3 percent; American Express, down 16 percent; Nationsbank, down 15 percent; BankAmerica, down 15 percent; Norwest, down 15 percent; Wells Fargo, down 14.3 percent, and Chase Manhattan, down 11.5 percent.
Bank stocks posted a solid rebound yesterday. And the fact that the bottom has fallen out of some bank stocks with such unforgiving rapidity may be just another sign that investors are too quick to flee stocks in an uncertain market. Some stock analysts suggest that the selloff in bank stocks has been overdone because of inflated fears about a possible downturn in the American economy and further spillover from the Asian financial crisis.
"I think all of these companies have been oversold unless you believe the U.S. is going into a recession on the heels of problems in emerging markets," said Diane Glossman, a stock analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc.
Henry Dickson, a stock analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, sided with Ms. Glossman. He noted that the stock price of any bank he covers with a market capitalization of more than $2 billion has doubled since the end of 1994. That performance was due, he said, to a historic reversal in the way that banks do business.
Between 1967 and 1992, banks did not earn high enough returns to justify their borrowing costs, Mr. Dickson said, culminating in the commercial real estate debacle of the late 1980's. Since 1992, banks have been earning far more than their borrowing costs, leading to a run-up in stock prices -- a trend he said would continue.
"The recent decline in bank stocks appears due to the belief that the banking industry will destroy value," he observed in a research report issued last week. "However, we expect the group to continue to create value as the banks are well positioned to continue to perform at or above the strong operating levels witnessed in the first half of 1998."
Not all bank stock analysts are as sanguine.
"Maybe investors are starting to realize that these stocks are still cyclical," said Charles Peabody, an analyst with Mitchell Securities in New York.
Banks historically earned money off the spread between what they paid for money and the rate they charged customers for that money. But in recent years, they have concentrated on fees earned for various services.
"People tended to believe that as banks replaced spread income with fee income, a new era in bank earnings had arrived," Mr. Peabody said. "Now people are starting to see that there are some credit risks associated with fee income -- for example, from activities like trading."
Banks with exposure to the tattered economies of Southeast Asia and other emerging markets in Latin America and Eastern Europe were among the first to scare off investors this year. Their ranks include Chase, Citicorp, J. P. Morgan, BankAmerica, Bankers Trust and BankBoston. Now investors are focusing on economic woes overseas that may wash ashore here, and stocks of other American banks are being savaged.
"I think Asia could continue to put sustained deflationary pressures on industrial economies like the U.S. and that will have an impact on the credit quality at banks," said Judah Kraushaar, a Merrill Lynch stock analyst. "People are starting to ask what happens if market-sensitive earnings come under increasing pressure."
Another drag on bank stocks has been fears about how sound some of the multibillion-dollar mergers will prove to be. Analysts and bank advisers said that the financial merits of Nationsbank's merger with BankAmerica and Travelers Group's merger with Citicorp are not in question as much as in three other big deals: Banc One's acquisition of First Chicago, Norwest's acquisition of Wells Fargo and Suntrust's acquisition of Crestar Financial.
There are doubts that Banc One can achieve the cost savings described as an important part of its merger. Norwest's purchase is fraught with doubts about how compatible it is with Wells. And Suntrust is seen as possibly overpaying, offering stock valued at more than $9 billion at the time the deal was announced. If the unease about any of these deals proves to be well founded, profits will suffer.
In the meantime, many investors have already fled or are hovering around the exits. Stay tuned.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Endthe Day Mixed Amid Russia and Japan Fears

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices ended slightly lower yesterday, while shorter maturities edged higher, as investors grew more concerned about the economies of Russia and Japan.
Investors were also cautious in advance of today's meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers. 
 The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond slipped 2/32, to a price of 99 13/32, leaving the bond's yield at 5.54 percent, unchanged from Friday. The price of the two-year note rose 1/32, to 100 4/32, for a yield of 5.31 percent, also unchanged.
Russia's decision to float the ruble, effectively devaluing it by a third against the dollar, bolstered the Treasury market as investors moved from the riskier debt of emerging markets to the relative safety of United States and European securities.
Should such a so-called flight to quality continue, some Treasury market analysts said, bond yields could fall as low as 5 percent, while the yield on a two-year note might fall by a full percentage point.
Most market participants expect no change in interest rates to come from today's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's rate-setting panel. But some analysts and traders are looking for the central bank to change its bias toward raising interest rates.
Fed policy makers, said Scott F. Grannis, director and chief economist at Western Asset Management Company in Pasadena, Calif., "should first pat themselves on the back for a job well done, because inflation is truly dead."
"Next they should start to worry, because there are increasing signs that they have stepped on the monetary brakes too long and too hard," Mr. Grannis said. "If they don't step on the gas pretty soon, the U.S. economy may be in danger of following Asia into a recession."
Mr. Grannis said it was time the Fed began lowering short-term rates, to relieve the deflationary pressure felt by commodity producers, and reduce the dollar's strength against other currencies.
The Treasury sold $13 billion of new three-month and six-month bills yesterday in its regular weekly auction. Following are the results of the auction:
 

(000 omitted in dollar figures)	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.759	97.500	Discounted Rate	4.91%	4.94%	Coupon Yield	5.04%	5.14%	High Price	98.763	97.505	Discounted Rate	4.89%	4.93%	Coupon Yield	5.02%	5.13%	Low Price	98.758	97.498	Discounted Rate	4.91%	4.95%	Coupon Yield	5.04%	5.14%	Accepted at low price	25%	31%	Total applied for	$33,750,440	$32,590,619	Accepted	$9,525,978	$11,840,019	Noncompetitive	$1,262,512	$1,291,169	

Both issues are dated Aug. 20, 1998. The three-month bills mature on Nov. 19, 1998, and the six-month bills mature on Feb. 18, 1999.

HEADLINE: Economy Lifts Incomes of Single Black Women Who Head Households

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C.

 BODY:
Three years ago, Nancy Wright was struggling to hold body and soul and two children together on the $237 she received in her monthly welfare check, supplemented by $187 worth of food stamps.
These days, Ms. Wright, 35, is earning almost $1,400 a month as a supervisor at a fiberglass plant. Though hardly affluent, she can afford to take her children out for a night on the town. She has bought a car, and she just returned with her two sons from a week's vacation in Atlantic City and New York -- the first time she had left North Carolina. 
 "I'm able to buy them clothes and school supples," she said, rattling off the benefits of her new-found prosperity. "I can take them out to get something to eat or go to the movies. I've accomplished a whole lot since I started working."
Ms. Wright's brightening fortunes are part of a little-noticed phenomenon among single black female heads of households. Long at the bottom of the economic scale, these women have seen their income rise sharply in recent years, pushed by a strong economy, tight labor market, increases in the minimum wage, more stringent welfare eligibility requirements and Government training programs.
In 1996, the latest year for which complete data are available, the median income for this group was $15,530, a jump of more than 21 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars from the $12,765 the women brought home in 1993, according to Census Bureau data.
Labor Department figures for single black female heads of families, a slightly different category because it includes only women with children, show a similar increase in income, rising to $16,256 in 1996 from $13,489 in 1993.
Incomes for these women are rising faster than nearly any other demographic group in the country, in part because they are starting from such a low base. Median income for white households (including married, living alone, or single parent) is $47,023. And a median income of $15,000 still leaves single black female heads of households squarely in the ranks of the working poor. But the increases come after two decades when their income barely increased or even declined. From 1969 to 1993, their medium income fell by more than 4 percent.
The fact that their income is improving is a sign of how much the benefits of the economic recovery are cascading down to groups on lower rungs of the economic ladder.
"They're doing much better than they have in years," said Edward Montgomery, chief economist at the Labor Department.
One reason is the recent increases in the minimum wage, which rose to $4.75 from $4.25 in 1996 and rose again to $5.15 last September. Economists say the bulk of single black mothers are hourly workers, so an increase in the minimum wage helped lift their income.
But even without a federally mandated increase in the hourly minimum wage, these women would still be benefiting from the strong economy, which is especially robust here in Charlotte, where the unemployment is less than 3 percent.
With such a strong economy, Labor Department data show that incomes at the bottom of the wage scale have begun to rise even more sharply than those at the top, seemingly reversing decades of rising income inequality.
"It's too early to call it a trend in terms of reversing income inequality," said Secretary of Labor Alexis M. Herman. "But there is no question we are heading in a positive direction."
In addition to being pulled into the job market by rising wages, many of these women are being pushed there by efforts to overhaul the welfare system. In 1995 North Carolina received waivers from the Clinton Administration allowing it to require welfare beneficiaries to undergo job training. A year later, the state received permission to set a two-year time limit for a family to receive cash assistance and to decline to raise welfare payments if a recipient had another child 10 months after going on the rolls.
Since the changes, North Carolina's welfare rolls have dropped to 65,873 families this past June from 113,485 in June 1995. Because about 65 percent of the families on welfare in the state are black, in 1995 and this year, and because about 60,000 people who have left the rolls have gotten jobs, single black mothers have been major beneficiaries of the policy changes.
Ms. Herman also said that new Labor Department studies show that 1.7 million people nationally were working last year who were on welfare in 1996, though she did not say how many of these people were unmarried black females who are heads of households.
For some, like Sherry Thomas, Government training programs made a huge difference. Divorced in 1992, on welfare and living in public housing two years later, Ms. Thomas re-entered the work force through the Job Training Partnership Act. The program paid her tuition at a junior college, covered the day care costs for her three children and paid her rent.
"Definitely that was my bridge to standing on my own and not having to continually depend on the system," she said.
Today, two years after subsisting on $278 a month from A.F.D.C., Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and an additional $350 in food stamps, Ms. Thomas is a computer programmer, earning "in the $30,000 range." She has also started a business designing Web sites and has bought a four-bedroom split-level house.
Rather than worrying about addicts and gunfire outside her door, she now savors the crepe myrtles bursting with pink flowers in her front yard, and the two apple trees, their branches heavy with fruit, growing out back.
"I still have bills and everything, but I'm raising my kids in a better environment, which is something I always wanted to do," Ms. Thomas said.
Beyond the changes in welfare and a strong economy, the improving conditions for many of these women stem from their own grit and determination.
Eleven years ago Cheryl McKnight dropped out of high school in Sumter, S.C., about 120 miles southeast of here, to get married and start a family. But after her first child died of leukemia at the age 2, Ms. McKnight's marriage soured.
After getting a divorce in 1993, Ms. McKnight went on welfare, but soon got a job as a laboratory technician in a plant that made dyes for textiles. The position paid $6 an hour, but Ms. McKnight considered it a dead-end job.
In 1997 she moved to Charlotte, the first time she had left her hometown, got a job flipping hamburgers at a Hardee's and enrolled in a community college course to earn her high school diploma.
Ms. McKnight worked from 4 A.M. to 11 A.M. at the all-night restaurant while attending classes from 12:30 P.M. to 3:30 P.M. every day and from 6 P.M. to 8:45 P.M. on Tuesdays and Thursdays. "I was determined to get that diploma," Ms. McKnight said.
After receiving the diploma last December, Ms. McKnight got a job as a receptionist and clerk at a drivers training school.
She is still struggling. Her pay of $7.50 an hour isn't much greater than what she earned as a lab technician or at Hardees. But she is studying college algebra, biology, psychology and chemistry to pass the entrance exam to get into the nursing program at a local community college.
"I can see a future financially for my son and I now," she said. "Moving to Charlotte was a big move for me in a lot of ways. I'm just a better person now."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Hewlett Posts Profit Above Expectations

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 17

 BODY:
After disappointing Wall Street in five of the six previous quarters, the Hewlett-Packard Company reported financial results today that exceeded analysts' estimates.
But beyond the bottom line, there was little to celebrate in Hewlett-Packard's fiscal third quarter. New orders grew just 1 percent from the corresponding quarter a year earlier. In addition, company officials said further revamping efforts would probably result in a charge of about $100 million in the fourth quarter. 
 Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, Calif., said cost controls and strong financial management had helped strengthen earnings in a difficult business climate. The company also said that it remained cautious about future performance because of the continued financial turmoil in Asia, as well as concerns about economies in Eastern Europe, Latin America and the United States.
Still, shares of Hewlett-Packard rose sharply late today. The company reported its results after the regular close of the New York Stock Exchange, but its shares moved higher in late composite trading to close at $55.25, up $2.50.
"They had great expense control, but we're not out of the woods yet," said Steven Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, With year-to-year order growth of just 1 percent, "the risk is you have another weak fourth quarter," he said.
For its third quarter, which ended on July 31, Hewlett-Packard earned $621 million, or 58 cents a fully diluted share, compared with $617 million, or 58 cents a diluted share, in the quarter a year earlier. Per-share earnings reflect an increase in the number of shares outstanding, to 1.08 billion from 1.06 billion. Revenue grew 5 percent, to $11 billion.
While earnings were essentially flat, Wall Street analysts had expected Hewlett-Packard to earn 54 cents a share, according to First Call, an investment research company that tracks analysts' estimates.
Mr. Milunovich, the Merrill Lynch analyst, said the company's revenue actually came in a bit below his expectations, but that costs rose far less and the company had unusually high "other" income, including interest, which accounted for most of the 4-cent-a-share difference.
Hewlett-Packard officials said that Asia remained very weak, with no improvement in sight, and that pricing pressures in the United States market for personal computers and printers had eroded earnings as well. They said the company took a less aggressive stance on personal computer pricing than in the second quarter, with the result that it lost some potential sales, but the PC unit returned to profitability.
"This quarter's slight increase in net earnings, flat earnings per share and decline in profit margins are disappointing," Robert Wayman, Hewlett-Packard's chief financial officer, said in a conference call with securities analysts. "We were below our plan in these and other key dimensions of performance."
On a more positive note, Mr. Wayman said operating expenses grew just 4 percent in the quarter, compared with 18 percent in the second quarter, and 13 percent in the year-earlier period.
Currency effects, temporary plant closings, reduced hiring and the drop in the company's stock price, which reduces the cost of stock appreciation rights, all contributed to the improved operating-cost performance, he said. The company cut its temporary work force by 1,000 in the quarter, compared with an increase of 2,700 in the third quarter of fiscal 1997.
Hewlett-Packard said orders for the quarter were $10.5 billion, a 1 percent increase over last year's third quarter. Orders in the United States grew 4 percent, to $5 billion, while orders from outside the United States were down 1 percent, at $5.4 billion. In Europe, orders were $3.3 billion, up 6 percent in dollars and 10 percent in local currency. In the Asia-Pacific region, orders declined 19 percent in dollars and were down 6 percent in local currency.
Hewlett-Packard officials said their goal for revenue growth was in the mid- to high teens, but that this performance was not possible until world markets stabilized.

Colonial Buys Unit of Rival In Australia Pension Business

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Aug. 17

 BODY:
Colonial Ltd. said today that it would buy the Australian and New Zealand insurance and asset management businesses of the Prudential Corporation of Britain for $800 million (United States), becoming Australia's fourth-largest fund manager.
The deal comes at a time of strong growth and fierce competition in the Australian fund management market. Deregulation is feeding the growth as new employees, beginning in July, are allowed to choose their own pension funds. Existing employees will be given the option in 2000. 
 Prospects for a boom in the industry have led to several takeovers. In July, Colonial bought the Australian business of Legal and General P.L.C. of Britain for $892 million (Australian). In June, Salomon Smith Barney Inc., owned by Travelers Group, bought the local fund management arm of J. P. Morgan & Company of the United States for an undisclosed sum. Vanguard Group and Fidelity Investments have joint ventures with Australian companies.
The acquisitions have increased competition, with banks outpacing traditional insurers for fund customers. The competition has worsened Prudential of Britain's already weak position in the region, where its profit fell by 50 percent in the first half of 1998.
"The competitive environment and our relatively small market presence in Australia limited our prospects for achieving a long-term satisfactory return," Prudential, Britain's largest life insurer, said.
Prudential, which has no connection to the Prudential Insurance Company of America, will report a pretax profit of 200 million, or $323.7 million (United States) on the sale.
Colonial, which is based in Melbourne and does business in insurance, fund management and banking, will raise the money for its purchase with new debt and the sale of $144.6 million (United States) worth of shares.
Keith Bedell-Pearce, director of international development for Prudential, told AFX News that the company was selling its businesses in part because Australia's population of 20 million offered limited growth and its prospects were likely to remain depressed because of the Asian economic turmoil.
"We did not put these businesses up for sale," he told the news service. "Colonial approached us with an offer."
Once it takes over Prudential's $5.47 billion (United States) of funds, Colonial will have total funds under management and assets of $38.5 billion (United States). Colonial's managing director, Peter Smedley, predicted annual savings of $59.26 million (United States) in three years after the purchase.
Under Mr. Smedley, Colonial has expanded aggressively, though it was criticized for its Legal and General purchase, which some analysts saw as too costly.
Standard & Poor's warned today that it might lower Colonial's A+ rating because of the "operational and financial pressures" from the acquisitions.
Still, Colonial's shares have risen from $4 (Australian) in February to $5.24 (Australian) on Friday. Trading in them was suspended today.
On the London Stock Exchange, shares of Prudential fell 10 pence, or 1.32 percent, to 750 pence.

HEADLINE: Acupuncture for the Dog;
Alternative Medicine Catches On With Pet Owners

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

 BODY:
The stagger in his gait and pleading in his eyes said it all. Al had taken everything that a greyhound could be expected to, and then he had taken even more.
Once he had been a racer, sleek and fleet. Then came abandonment on the beaches of Brooklyn. Mercy arrived in the form of a new owner and a home in the New Jersey suburbs, but at age 8, Al's back gave out. Two painful surgeries and more than $6,000 later, he still wasn't the dog he used to be. 
 His journey into Manhattan on a recent Saturday morning was a pilgrimage of stubborn hope. There, in a backyard in Murray Hill, Al dipped into his own Lourdes, a circular pool of heated water that might do what the operations, acupuncture and Bach flower essences had not: heal him.
With Jodi Richard, a trained canine hydrotherapist, holding tight to his rump, Al paddled and paddled, going nowhere fast, his gimpy back legs freed from gravity so they could get the exercise they sorely needed.
His owner, Jackie Wright-Minogue, rushed to him as soon as he left the pool to rest under a pink towel on the cushion of a lawn chair.
"I want him to get well," she said, articulating the simple wish that had wrought such complicated ministrations. "I want him to have a good life."
That desire, seemingly boundless among many pet owners, has ushered in a whole new era in animal care. Ms. Richard's business, Bonnie's K 9 Swim Therapy Center, named for her German shepherd, is but one example.
Elsewhere around the New York region, veterinarians are hooking dogs and cats to electric acupuncture machines, dosing them with homeopathic remedies, placing putatively therapeutic magnets beneath their beds, even spraying the air around them with lavender, lemon or eucalyptus in the name of aromatherapy.
All of this is perhaps the inevitable outgrowth of a culture blissed out on St. John's wort and mesmerized by Andrew Weil. It is also the ultimate illustration of the degree to which many Americans insist on sharing their own habits and extravagances, from summer camp to spa treatments, with the four-legged members of their families.
Dr. Michael Garvey, director of the Bobst Hospital at the Animal Medical Center in Manhattan, described it as a kind of cross-species psychological transference. "We project our character flaws on our pets," he said. "We project our behavior on them. I've even had clients project their religion on them. This is very much in the same fashion."
Could your cat benefit from an adjustment? There are a growing number of veterinary chiropractors on hand. Is there knotting in your dog's muscles? You can take him to a canine massage therapist. If it has been tried on people, it is being tried on pets, and not just on the most common species.
Dr. Gerald M. Buchoff, a veterinarian in North Bergen, N.J., has performed acupuncture on iguanas with brittle bones. Dr. Marcie Fallek, who has offices in Greenwich Village and Fairfield, Conn., has administered homeopathic treatments -- solutions with minuscule traces of special plant or mineral ingredients -- to a pet raccoon that was seemingly depressed over a canine companion's death and had stopped using its litter box.
The raccoon's owner, fearful that law enforcement authorities would learn that she was keeping a wild animal, declined to be interviewed for this article, even anonymously, Dr. Fallek said. "Her psychic told her there might be trouble," Dr. Fallek explained. "Plus, Mercury's in retrograde and, well, you know."
Which raises the obvious question: How much of this is pure quackery? As it turns out, less than one might think.
Dr. Richard Swanson, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association, said that the legitimacy of acupuncture, at least on mammals with skeletal structures similar to people's, was beyond doubt, and that hydrotherapy and chiropractic were probably effective.
But Dr. Swanson cast a more skeptical eye on homeopathy, Bach flower essences and the like. "That's really getting on the fringe," he said, adding that a lack of rigorous scientific study into such treatments undercut the sunny testimonials of some veterinarians and their clients. "The world is made up of a lot of very vulnerable and gullible people," he cautioned.
It is also made up of increasingly generous people when it comes to the vim and vigor of their hirsute -- or, for that matter, feathered -- loved ones. According to the association, expenditures by Americans on all kinds of veterinary care for dogs, cats and birds rose to $11.1 billion in 1996, the most recent year studied, from $6.9 billion in 1991 (the figures were not adjusted for inflation). During that same period, the pet population grew only modestly.
The newfangled treatments that come under the rubric of alternative or holistic veterinary medicine certainly are not cheap. In New York City -- where, granted, prices for most things tend to be highest -- half an hour of acupuncture generally costs $50 to $75; an hour's worth of immersion in Ms. Richard's healing waters costs $75. Because treatments are usually repeated over the course of several weeks, the final bill can run into the high hundreds.
Alternative veterinary medicine began to emerge as more than just random experimentation more than two decades ago. Race horses were the guinea pigs, perhaps because the financial stakes surrounding the health of these animals were highest.
But in the last five years, the field has really taken off, drawing thousands of veterinarians around the country who either integrate alternative therapies into traditional veterinary practices or specialize in holistic approaches to healing.
The American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association, which was founded in 1982, reports a membership of 1,000 veterinarians. The International Veterinary Acupuncture Society, founded in 1974, reports 1,500 members, up from 500 five years ago, though that is still a small fraction of all veterinarians.
Donna Watkins, a spokeswoman for the society, said veterinary acupuncture has been around long enough that it is now being ventured on a wide variety of animals in addition to horses, cats, dogs and parrots.
"A friend of mine in California regularly does turtles -- well, not the shell," she said. "I know a guy in San Diego who is doing a dolphin."
There are dozens of newsletters and periodicals devoted to alternative veterinary medicine, along with a plethora of product catalogues, many with their own Internet sites.
The Internet site for the Botanical Animal catalogue provides a link to the Equilite line of herbal and floral elixirs for horses, including the "Broodmare Blend," the "Clear Thinking Blend," the "Ego Builder Blend" and the "Mellow Out Blend."
Although pets being given alternative treatments are often following their owners' leads, the inspiration sometimes works the other way.
"I started going to an acupuncturist for stress because I saw how well it worked for Lola," Liz Santander, an interior designer from Chappaqua, N.Y., said of her 150-pound Great Dane as the dog awaited her latest treatment the other morning in the offices of Dr. Phillip Raclyn on the Upper West Side.
It was a busy, busy day. While Lola, who was bouncing back from a stroke, cooled her paws in the lobby, Ike, a partially lame shepherd mix, received massage therapy in an examining room.
A condition known as degenerative myelopathy had essentially paralyzed Ike's hind legs, which his owner, Chris O'Sullivan, straps into a two-wheeled cart so Ike can still chase Frisbees. ("I have to throw the Frisbee right at him," Mr. O'Sullivan explained.)
But the cart was off now and Ike lay motionless as the massage therapist, Jean Marie Cooper, gave him what looked like a particularly intimate, thorough petting.
"Feel for the bony landmarks," Ms. Cooper instructed Mr. O'Sullivan, who planned to repeat the treatment for Ike at home in Chinatown. "Push away from the spine."
Meanwhile, in the examining room next door, Dr. Raclyn inserted an acupuncture needle into the forehead of Spike, a female cat with kidney problems. For a few seconds, Spike looked like a unicorn; then another dozen needles went in, and she looked like a pin cushion. Relaxed rather than bothered, she nearly fell asleep.
A few hours earlier and a few miles downtown, Ms. Richard's patients were decidedly more agitated, slaves to a sloshy, invisible treadmill. Al repeatedly swapped places in the water with Duncan, a three-legged Labrador retriever who needed to lose about 35 of his 106 pounds but, for obvious reasons, wasn't much for running.
Then they ceded the pool to Sydnee, a 12-year-old Shih Tzu recovering from surgery for a ruptured disk. The operation had left Sydnee without the use of his hind legs, which he may never fully regain.
This was Sydnee's first hydrotherapy session and he looked -- as best these things can be determined -- appalled and terrified about taking the plunge. "He's a good boy," Lauran Walk, his owner, called out as Sydnee's tiny, bearded face bobbed above the surface. "He's a good, good boy."
Ms. Walk, 27, who lives with her husband in Greenwich Village, said that she was definitely feeling the pinch of the $3,500 that Sydnee's various treatments had cost the couple.
But she said she abhorred the thought of putting him down, and would do whatever it took to avoid that, even though Sydnee was only a few years shy of the normal life expectancy for a dog.
"He represents 12 years of my life, so I've got to give him a chance," Ms. Walk said as Sydnee took a brief poolside rest, a shivering knot of fur with limited mobility. "I can't be selfish."

HEADLINE: Harold J. Ruttenberg, 84, Labor Leader Turned Executive

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Harold J. Ruttenberg, a research director for the United Steelworkers of America who changed sides, became a business executive and remained outspoken on labor-management issues, died on Saturday at his home in Pittsburgh. He was 84.
The cause was heart failure, said his son Edward F. Ruttenberg. 
 Mr. Ruttenberg's switch to management, in 1946, was at a fairly lofty level. As The New York Herald Tribune put it in 1958, he "was the brilliant research director and economic wizard for the United Steel Workers and the righthand man of Philip Murray," the president of the steelworkers' union from 1942, when it was founded, until 1952. Mr. Murray was also president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations from 1940 to 1952.
In his years with the union, Mr. Ruttenberg broadened a thorough working knowledge of steel company employment and wage statistics. When he quit the union in 1946, Mr. Murray said that he had been an invaluable associate.
Mr. Ruttenberg was hired by Cyrus Eaton, the financier, to be an executive of the Portsmouth Steel Company. After three years in management there, Mr. Ruttenberg (pronounced ROOT-en-berg) went on to be, successively, president, chairman -- or both -- of four other American companies. He was also chairman of the Rehovoth Instruments Company in Israel from 1968 to 1978.
At his death he was chairman and chief executive of the American Locker Group Inc. of Jamestown, N.Y., which makes and markets coin-operated metal lockers and plastic security mail boxes. He had held the posts since 1973, when the concern was called the AVM Corporation.
In his years in the labor world and in management, Mr. Ruttenberg was a perennial advocate of improving ties between the two sides. He believed that giving unions a greater role in management operations would enhance productivity and he favored a guaranteed yearly wage for union workers.
Mr. Ruttenberg was born in St. Paul and grew up in Greene County, in southwestern Pennsylvania, where his father owned a general store.
He received a bachelor's degree in 1935 from the University of Pittsburgh and went on to hold posts in the labor movement before the United Steelworkers union was formed. They included the job of regional research director, for the Pittsburgh area, of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee, which was then considered the spearhead of labor in the steel industry.
Mr. Ruttenberg was research director of the United Steelworkers of America from its formation and was on leave from the union from 1942 to 1944, during World War II, while he was assistant director of the steel division of the War Production Board. In that post he had an important role in the board's Steel for Victory drive in Pittsburgh, which began in the summer of 1943 with the goal of increasing supplies of steel to aid the war effort.
With the union, he could be highly confrontational toward management. Early in 1946, he was chairman of the wage research committee of the C.I.O., while still research director for the steelworkers, when the panel contended that some Bureau of Labor Statistics figures on labor productivity were misleading and demanded that they be withdrawn by the Labor Department. The committee said the figures, showing that output per worker in 24 civilian industries had increased very little between 1939 and 1944, were being used by industry to justify refusals to grant adequate wage increases.
In 1971 Mr. Ruttenberg reminisced about his switch to management in a letter to The New York Times. He said that the leadership of the steelworkers' union had let him and two others resign from the union rather than have the union agree to pursue a policy that the three "had advocated of assuming responsibility along with management for increasing productivity as employment benefits increased so that the union could restrain steel price increases." He recalled that both the union and the management sides had refused to do that in 1945 and 1946.
In a 1958 speech, he contended that steelworkers needed "steady jobs with 52 regular pay checks a year" more than they needed higher hourly wages. In that speech he also criticized David J. McDonald, the steelworkers' union president, for "sidetracking the dynamic concept of the annual wage" and for resisting the development of any meaningful tie between wage increases and heightened industrial efficiency. In that speech, Mr. Ruttenberg also criticized top steel industry executives as failing to display leadership in the same direction.
He was the co-author, with Clinton S. Golden, of the 1942 book "The Dynamics of Industrial Democracy."
In addition to his son Edward, of Pittsburgh, Mr. Ruttenberg is survived by his wife of 61 years, the former Katherine Monori; his son James E. of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a daughter, Ellen Rabin of Lemoyne, Pa.; a brother, Stanley, of Bethesda, Md., and 10 grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Pataki Seeks Plan for Land Near Airport

 BODY:
In another step toward preserving 6,200 acres of open space near Stewart International Airport near Newburgh, N.Y., Gov. George E. Pataki has directed the Department of Environmental Conservation to develop a management plan for the environmentally sensitive property.
The state transferred jurisdiction of the land from the Department of Transportation earlier this year. On Friday, the Governor asked John P. Cahill, Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation, to appoint a committee to determine how to use the Orange County property, known as the Stewart buffer lands. 
 The Governor suggested that the committee be made up of local officials, environmentalists and representatives from sportsmen's and recreation organizations.
Also, in an effort to placate those in this economically struggling region who wanted the property developed, the Governor said the state would pay the school and town taxes on the land from now on. Ninety percent of the land lies within the boundaries of New Windsor and has not generated revenues since the state took it off the tax rolls when it acquired the property in 1971.
The Department of Environmental Conservation, the current oversight agency, estimated that the payments to New Windsor and other towns and school districts could be as high as $900,000 a year.
"If this is some kind of compromise on the Governor's part, I say, 'O.K.,' " George J. Meyers, New Windsor's Town Supervisor, said. "Send me the money!"
As announced in January, the Pataki administration also plans to allow development of an additional 1,200 acres of the Stewart buffer lands adjacent to the airport to further balance the needs of the environment and the interests of the local economy. There are no immediate plans for development.
Klara B. Sauer, executive director of Scenic Hudson, a Poughkeepsie-based group, said the plans represented "a win-win" for all sides. Noting that the property is the only intact example of the kind of lowlands that were once characteristic of the Hudson Valley, she said, "Unfortunately, most of what was there is now covered up by developments and urban sprawl."
The rock ledges, ponds, wet meadows and marshes provide habitat for the red-shouldered hawk, cooper's hawk and the great blue heron, she noted. And studies have catalogued a wide array of declining wetland-dependent reptiles.
The state bought the vacant tract through condemnation proceedings in 1971, when then-Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller hoped to expand the deactivated Stewart Air Force Base onto the land to build another major airport serving the New York City area. The expansion never took place, but the air force base eventually became Stewart International Airport, which serves about 400,000 passengers a year.
In 1995, Governor Pataki proposed selling the airport and buffer lands, 7,400 acres in all, as part of a plan to privatize the airport, which is 60 miles north of New York City.
Stewart was the first commercial airport in the nation that was approved for privatization under the Federal Aviation Administration's airport privatization plan. But because the sale of the airport was slowed by stringent Federal regulations and oversight, the administration reached a leasing agreement with the National Express Group, of Winchester, England, in April to run the day-to-day operations of the airport.

HEADLINE: Denied Western Funds, Russia Makes Its Choices

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
The Russian Government was denied additional financial help from the United States and several other allies over the weekend, causing it to take steps the Clinton Administration had opposed: allowing the ruble greater fluctuation, imposing a moratorium on repaying foreign debt owed mostly by banks, and restructuring much of the Government's debt.
"These particular choices were Russian choices in an exceptionally difficult environment," a senior Administration official said today. "We certainly expressed concerns." 
 Clinton Administration officials acknowledged that the Russians, faced last week with a spreading banking crisis, had little choice. "Given the inability to restore confidence, some change was necessary," said another Administration official.
A package of loans and credits totaling $22.6 billion announced last month by the International Monetary Fund was supposed to buy Russia time to enact the reforms that might restore investor confidence. As the currency and security markets continued to weaken after the I.M.F. package was unveiled, the strategy announced today seeks to buy time another way, by lessening Russia's debt burden and restoring confidence in its ability to get its fiscal problems under control.
The Administration's view is that no further funds would be forthcoming and that the onus is on the Russian Government to carry out economic reform, acccording to both Administration and fund officials who say that foreign aid is no substitute for Russia's cleaning up its own financial house.
In a statement today, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said: "We believe it is critically important that the Russian authorities move quickly to take actions to restore confidence, including the adoption of a careful and cooperative approach in dealing with its creditors and the full implementation of the measures outlined in the Russian stabilization program agreed with the I.M.F."
Having little leverage over the direction of events in Russia, officials in Washington went to great lengths to reassure investors that the United States was not abandoning Russia. "We wanted to be frank about the pros and cons," said one Administration official. "But there were no easy choices. It was the Russians' choice, but now that Russia has made its choice, we're committed to working with them to advance reform."
The roots of the current crisis go back to the early 1990's when Russia was battling hyperinflation. The Russian Government switched from simply printing money to finance the budget deficit and began issuing bonds. The deficits kept growing, at one point reaching about 7 percent of the value of its economy. As the debt ballooned, nervous investors were only willing to buy short-term instruments. That meant that the bulk of domestic debt matured quickly and constantly had to be refinanced.
In the last year, Russia has suffered a series of blows, namely a collapse of oil and commodity prices as well as the economic contagion from Asia. As investors grew more nervous, interest rates of 100 percent to 200 percent were required to entice buyers. Russia found itself in a classic debt trap: The investor requires a high rate of return to invest in Government bonds, raising the cost of servicing the debt and the possibility of a default.
Last week, when the I.M.F. package clearly had failed to restore confidence, the Yeltsin Government opted for a combination of time-honored but risky escapes. First, the prospect of a devalued ruble could set off inflation, which shrinks existing debt values. Second, the Government announced that it would restructure the ruble-denominated debt, which involves involuntarily forcing the holder of short-term maturity debt to accept longer-term maturities.
The new maturities, interest rates and other details of the restructuring are expected to be announced on Wednesday, the Russian Government said.
Initial reactions indicate that Russia's dramatic gestures may work. It is certainly not a case, as it was with Japan, of too little too late. Financial markets reacted relatively well today and investors seem to be waiting to learn more details. Whether the Russian gamble works will be evident in the next few weeks. Investors are waiting to see whether the run on the banking system and the currency subsides. The political fallout in Russia will focus on how people view the Government's breaking its promise to prevent inflation's return.
"This is not the time to abandon Russia," said Robert Hormats, managing director at Goldman Sachs. "It's a time to help them deal with some of the critical issues that led them to take these measures."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Stocks IgnoreGlobal Fears, Rising Steeply

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Wall Street shrugged off Russia's currency devaluation, another decline in Japanese stocks and saturation news coverage of President Clinton's grand jury testimony yesterday, pushing major market indexes higher and helping the Dow Jones industrial average post its largest one-day gain in two months.
Many investors -- apparently deciding that they had absorbed all the bad news they could handle and that all those negatives were reflected in current share prices -- dived back into stocks, pushing the Dow up 149.85 points, or 1.78 percent. The blue-chip index, led by gains in Merck, Eastman Kodak and American Express, closed at 8,574.85. 
 The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 20.92 points, or nearly 2 percent, to 1,083.67, and the Nasdaq composite index, an important technology-stock barometer, rose 27.85 points, or 1.56 percent, to 1,818.04.
Despite the strong showing, the gain was not broad based, and some stock strategists called it only a short-term rebound. Overseas, shares were mostly lower as investors took a less sanguine view of the Russian economic crisis.
In Germany, where the economy is considered the most vulnerable to Russia's travails, stocks fell eight-tenths of 1 percent as 20 of the 30 stocks in the DAX index declined. In London, stocks rose two-tenths of 1 percent. The exposure of American financial institutions to Russia is relatively limited.
In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 2.18 percent, to its lowest level in two months, largely reflecting concerns about further weakness in that economy and the region. This morning, the Nikkei rose 297.15 points, or just over 2 percent, to 15,091.81 at the midday recess. Most other Asian markets fell yesterday.
In recent weeks, a litany of bad news has battered stocks in the United States, pulling major-market indexes down 10 percent and more from highs reached a month ago. Investors have been rattled by corporate earnings disappointments and by Asian economics, in particular Japan's deepening recession, which has raised fears of a currency devaluation by China.
The political scandal surrounding President Clinton has also weighed on the market, which fears uncertainty. But yesterday, as Moscow floated the ruble, an effective devaluation, and as the public awaited news of Mr. Clinton's grand jury testimony and Japan's benchmark index reached a two-month low, investors finally saw bargains and started buying shares.
"In this kind of economy, you need high interest rates to kick the equity market" down, said Mitchell Held, co-manager for United States economics at Salomon Smith Barney.
"We went down too far too fast," said Harvey Hirschhorn, chief economist and investment strategist at Stein Roe & Farnham Investment Management in Chicago.
"There were a lot of buying opportunities for people who continue to believe the economy is O.K.," Mr. Hirschhorn said. "Russia has been a risk out there. It's a smaller economy. The ruble has been declining in value for years, and another partial collapse isn't going to make or break the German banks."
The benchmark Russian trading system stock index fell 4.8 percent yesterday. Among funds trading in this country, the Templeton Russia Fund fell 1 5/16, to 161 1/16. The Lexington Troika Dialog Russia fund remains near a 52-week low.
Generally, the funds saw steeper declines in May when the Russian central bank raised overnight interest rates to defend the ruble and when oil prices slumped.
Despite yesterday's renewed appetite for stocks, several analysts said the market could soon fall further. "I think this is a rally to sell into," said Byron R. Wien, United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
"The market is becoming narrower and narrower; you could see this coming back in June," Mr. Wien said, noting that almost 75 percent of the issues on the New York Stock Exchange are down 20 percent from their highs this year.
Yesterday, only 31 Big Board stocks reached new highs, compared with 265 new lows. Advancing issues narrowly exceeded decliners on trading volume of 584.4 million shares.
The limited breadth of the advance leaves the market vulnerable to further declines, Mr. Wien and other economists said.
In addition, more corporate earnings disappointments are expected, and Mr. Wien said he believed that analysts had yet to reduce earnings forecasts enough to take account of that.
While the market seemed to shrug off Mr. Clinton's problems yesterday, the scandal is presenting difficulty, Mr. Wien said, adding:
"You don't want the American Presidency preoccupied with survival. You want it to take on world initiatives."
Russia's problems also illustrate that much of the rest of the world, outside the United States and Western Europe, is in a downturn, said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch.
"The downward trend we're in is not broken," said Mr. Steinberg, who forecasts that the stock market's slide will cause a profound slowdown in consumer spending in the second half of the year.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
It's Time

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
It is now clear that President Clinton looked the American people in the eye last January and lied. Yesterday he acknowledged the inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky that he earlier denied. He has betrayed his family, his party and his country. But we now have three stark choices: Impeach him, forgive him or limp along with him, berating him at every step and never allowing anyone to forget what he did. There is no stomach in the country for impeachment. There is too much at stake for the country to limp along for two more years. It's time to forgive -- not for his sake but for ours, not because his affairs are unimportant but because ours are more important.
It's time now for the first Democratic President since F.D.R. to be elected for a second term to actually begin his second term. That means Mr. Clinton has got to give up this crazy notion that his primary political role is to be Al Gore's campaign manager for the year 2000 election and instead to start fulfilling his own agenda, whether it's Social Security reform, education reform, child-care reform, campaign finance reform, tobacco legislation or expansion of free trade -- all of which will require his stepping on some traditional Democratic constituencies. The President talks a good game on many of these issues, but he has yet to really put his shoulder to the wheel behind most of them or to put them in concrete legislative form. 
 It's time for the President to make clear exactly what his Iraq policy is, which simply is not clear anymore. What is clear is that the Administration is playing games -- trying to shift responsibility for Iraq policy from the White House to the United Nations, which is to shift it to nowhere. What is clear is that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has signaled the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, that the Administration does not want to stir up Saddam Hussein with any surprise inspections right now. If the Clintonites walk away from their responsibilities on Iraq it is the end of their foreign policy.
It is time that the leaderless Republican Party developed a serious domestic agenda (beyond arguing that shrinking government and ending abortion will solve all our problems), as well as a foreign policy befitting a superpower. Since Bill Clinton came to office the Republicans have spent much of their time just living off his misbehavior. On foreign policy they have either offered drive-by criticism, in which they drive by the White House, shout some epithet and then drive on, or adopted utterly irresponsible positions. These range from base pandering on the Middle East to indulgence of fringe Congressional Republicans who want to hold up key foreign-policy funding for institutions like the I.M.F. unless the U.S. stops all support for family planning, to mindlessly slashing the State Department's budget -- an outrage at a time when America's global responsibilities, and economic opportunities, have never been greater.
Without a serious Republican foreign policy, it makes it so much easier for the Clintonites to be unserious too.
For a long time now we have defined this era as the post-cold-war era. That is, we have defined this era by what it is not. It is not the cold war. But it is time we define it by what it is. It is an era of stunningly rapid change in workplaces, jobs, communities, educational demands and government responsibilities. It is an era in which corporations have never been bigger and yet individuals have never been more empowered -- to do good or ill. It is an era in which America has no single big enemy, but many, many smaller ones. It is an age when the gap between rich and poor is widening faster and faster. It is an integrated era in which the biggest threats to U.S. stability come from a weak Japanese economy, which we can't control, and a computer chip problem called Y2K, which we can't see.
It is an era in which the U.S. and the world need a President who gets these issues. The good news about Bill Clinton is that he does get them. The bad news is that even before the Lewinsky affair, this President was having trouble developing, and passing, the legislation for this new era. But he may now be getting a second chance to begin his second term -- a chance he doesn't deserve but we do.
It may be hoping for too much that Bill Clinton will take this opportunity to be the President he has the potential to be. But Lord knows it's time.

Desperate to Ease Crisis, Russia Devalues the Ruble
The Russian Government moved hastily to avert financial collapse with measures that included a devaluation of the ruble. The step eased the pressure on Moscow to defend the ruble's value by spending billions in foreign currency, but it also means the ruble's purchasing power has been radically reduced, hurting Russian consumers.
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said the program, which also includes a 90-day moratorium on some debt payments, had been made necessary by the near-collapse of Russia's banking system last week. Page A1.
 
Clinton Administration officials said the Russians had little choice in taking such steps, even though $22.6 billion in aid from the International Monetary Fund announced last month had been intended to buy Russia some time to restore confidence. A8.
 
Japanese Stocks Near 1998 Lows
The stock market in Tokyo fell sharply and flirted with the year's lows, pressured by the wobbliness on Wall Street last week and an expanding economic upheaval that is now ravaging Russia. Further pressuring the market was the persistent fear that the Japanese Government will fail to overcome the country's banking crisis and a renewed concern about the impact of Asia's troubles on corporate profits. D2.
 
Bonds End Little Changed
Treasury bond prices ended slightly higher while short-term maturities ended slightly lower, reflecting investor concern about Russia and Japan as well as caution ahead of today's meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers. The 30-year bond yielded 5.54 percent, unchanged from Friday. D7.
 
Women TV Executives Move Up
CBS named Nancy Tellem president of the network's entertainment division, the position vacated in April by Leslie Moonves, now chief executive of CBS Television. Ms. Tellem becomes the second woman to head a network entertainment division. Jamie Tarses is president of ABC Entertainment. D4.
 
Anne Sweeney, president of the Disney Channel, was named president of Disney/ABC Cable Networks, making her the highest- ranking woman in the cable industry. D4.
 
Toy Seller's Earnings Drop
Toys "R" Us earnings fell 63 percent in the latest quarter, reflecting the No. 1 toy retailing company's failure to find a hit product that could help it offset a loss of sales to discount store chains. D5.
 
Waste Haulers in $1.3 Billion Deal
Waste Management said it would buy Eastern Environmental Services for $1.3 billion in stock, a deal that would expand the geographic reach of the largest United States waste disposal company by giving it six landfills on the East Coast. Eastern Environmental shares fell 4.3 percent on the news. D6.
 
GE Capital Buying Met Life Unit
GE Capital said it had agreed to buy Metropolitan Life Insurance's commercial finance division. Terms weren't disclosed, but the price was estimated at $1 billion. D6.
 
Livent May Face Bond Buyback
Livent, the theater production company that said last week that it had found accouting irregularities, may be legally required to buy back $125 million of bonds that it issued just months ago under a little-noticed provision in its bond agreement. D6.

WPP Group Reports A Good First Half

BYLINE: Bridge News 

 BODY:
WPP Group P.L.C., the British advertising company, said yesterday that its first-half pretax profit rose by 19.7 percent, in part because a strong United States economy has led to an increase in advertising spending by United States companies. WPP, the world's second-largest advertising group after Omnicom Group Inc., said its pretax profit rose to 93.8 million ($152 million) in the first half from 78.3 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 11.6 percent to 3.84 billion.
"Any impact of Asia Pacific economic difficulties has, so far, been more than compensated for by stronger-than-budgeted performance in North America and Europe," the company said.

Russia Takes Measures To Avert Fiscal Collapse
The Russian Government moved to avert financial collapse with a series of drastic measures that included a 90-day moratorium on privately held foreign debt, a restructuring of Government bonds and the decision to let the value of the ruble float according to market forces. A1 

Russia took its steps, which were opposed by the Clinton Administration, after the United States and several of its allies refused it additional assistance. A8
 
Bombing Suspect Interviewed
Law enforcement officials said a suspect in the bombing of the American Embassy in Nairobi had been interviewed at length by American investigators after his return from Pakistan, but had not admitted a role in the bombing and did not implicate Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born extremist thought to have inspired the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. A7
 
Embassy families in Pakistan have been ordered to leave the country, and the State Department urged all Americans "to seriously consider leaving Pakistan" because of a range of threats against Americans, and especially American officials. A7
 
Arrests in Northern Ireland
The British police arrested five men for questioning on the car-bomb attack in Omagh on Saturday that killed 28 people and injured 220 others. The blast is widely believed to have been the work of a a group whose members broke from the Irish Republican Army. A3
 
Congo Rebels Gain Ground
Rebels again cut electric power and the water supply to Kinshasa, Congo's capital of five million people, heightening fear that an attack was imminent. As the threat intensified, popular support for President Laurent Kabila grew. Several hours after the power failure began, the Government publicly acknowledged its loss of control over the Inga hydroelectric dam. A6
 
Chinese Protest Atrocities
Students and women's groups defied a ban by Government officials and held emotional demonstrations in Beijing to protest looting, killing and rape directed against ethnic Chinese during riots in Indonesia in May. A group of several dozen from Beijing University staged a short sit-in outside the Indonesian Ambassador's residence, offering a T-shirt signed by more than 100 students protesting the atrocities. A6
 
Report of No Progress in Iraq
The United Nations told the Security Council that its mediator in Iraq had failed to persuade Baghdad to resume cooperation with the two agencies trying to find and eliminate its weapons of mass destruction, diplomats and other officials said. A3
 
Negligence Cited in Serb Death
A Bosnian Serb who died this month in a cell while being tried by the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague bled to death because he did not get proper medical care, his lawyer said. A9

After Testimony, Clinton Tells Nation of Relationship
President Clinton testified for more than four hours at the White House in a closed-circuit television hookup with a Federal grand jury and later made an extraordinary address to the nation in which he admitted he had misled his wife and the public and had had an intimate relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky that was "wrong."

HEADLINE: TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Long a Defender of the Boss, Gore Praises Clinton Courage

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
In the early days of the Lewinsky investigation, Vice President Al Gore strongly defended President Clinton against all accusations of wrongdoing, saying Mr. Clinton was a strong and honest leader he was proud to work with.
But as the investigation dragged on, Mr. Gore adopted a somewhat modified approach to defending the President, saying that Mr. Clinton had denied any wrongdoing and that there appeared to be no reason to question that denial. 
 Tonight, after the President appeared on nationwide television and admitted that he had been less than forthcoming about his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, Mr. Gore, whose political hopes in the 2000 election could well depend on the outcome of this investigation, once again spoke out strongly in defense of Mr. Clinton.
"I am proud of him," Mr. Gore said in a statement issued by his office, "not only because he is a friend, but because he is a person who has had the courage to acknowledge mistakes. I am honored to work with this great President on his agenda for the nation, and I believe it is time to put this matter behind us once and for all and move forward with the business of the United States of America."
Mr. Gore is on vacation in Hawaii, about as far away from Washington, the President and the grand jury as he could get and still be in one of the 50 states. According to tonight's statement, he called the President after his television appearance and said that he and his wife, Tipper, had Mr. Clinton "in our hearts and in our prayers."
Jennifer Devlin, a press spokeswoman for Mrs. Gore, said the Mr. and Mrs. Gore and some of their children had gone to Hawaii for a break that had been "in planning" for at least three months.
"The Vice President and his family always take a two-week vacation at this time of year," Ms. Devlin said. "He's staying at a private home on one of the islands -- we're not saying which one -- and his schedule is private except that on Aug. 25 he'll do a Democratic fund-raiser in Honolulu and also will speak to a meeting of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees."
Did he spend the day on the beach or next to the television?
"Nothing on that," Ms. Devlin said.
The Gores arrived in Hawaii on Aug. 11 and will depart on Aug. 26 for San Francisco, where they will participate in several Democratic Party events before returning to Washington on Aug. 28. Ms. Devlin said the couple had a sentimental attachment to Hawaii, having spent their honeymoon there in 1970 and having returned several times.
On Wednesday, the Gores were spotted swimming with pet dolphins in a pool at the Hilton Waikoloa Village on the island of Hawaii, but not until security personnel had plunged in to check things out.
When Mr. Gore meets with Hawaii Democrats on Aug. 25, he is likely to face a warm and eager audience.
Hawaii has traditionally been dominated by Democrats. But because of cutbacks in military spending, a decline in the farm sector and a sharp falloff in tourism from Asia, the state is one of the few that face economic hard times. As a result, polls indicate, Democratic candidates throughout the islands will need all the help they can get in this year's elections.

HEADLINE: TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: NEWS ANALYSIS;
Testy Finale, Risky Gambit

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
With his grand jury testimony and his brief and defiant public admission of an inappropriate relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky tonight, President Clinton is hoping, as he has so many times in the past, that the public will respond with forgiveness and not disgust.
The President, relying on polls and his own sense of the public's weariness with a sordid story of Presidential sex, took a calculated gamble that he can escape indictment by prosecutors or impeachment by lawmakers over what he declared was a private matter. In his testimony and his testy four-minute speech to the nation, he offered partial admissions but refused to answer many of questions that have swamped his Presidency since January. 
 And almost before he finished his grudging televised confession, he turned on his inquisitors and demanded that the investigation of his private life come to an end.
He confessed, he expressed regret and he asked for instant redemption.
"Now it is time -- in fact it is past time -- to move on," the President said with anger, not anguish, in his eyes, laying the blame for seven months of national trauma on his political enemies and Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel.
He left no doubt that his strategy is the same as it has been for the past seven months: To give as little ground as possible.
The President sacrificed some of the dignity of his exalted office by admitting a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was "wrong." But he implied that the investigation that has cornered him was just as wrong.
"This has gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many innocent people," Mr. Clinton said.
He sought to justify his misleading testimony and his months of resistance to prosecutors as a fitting response to a politically inspired invasion of privacy.
Mr. Clinton is also counting on a continued strong economy and the forbearance of a public aware that he was a less than faithful husband even as they were twice electing him to the nation's highest office.
"Even Presidents have private lives," Mr. Clinton declared.
The President stopped short of explicitly acknowledging a sexual relationship, and while he admitted misleading his wife and others, he did not say he had been untruthful in his previous testimony. He offered only a curt denial of some of the more serious accusations -- conspiracy, obstruction of justice, witness tampering and suborning perjury -- saying only he had not asked anyone to lie or hide evidence.
The statement was a compromise between Mr. Clinton's lawyers, who wanted him to say as little as possible about his relationship, and his political advisers, who felt that only a full confession would allow him to put the matter behind him.
His words of apology and contrition were belied by a tone that was laced with anger and, in an important way, unrepentant. He said he has been subjected to an invasion of privacy by Mr. Starr that no American citizen should have to endure.
His questioning by Mr. Starr and three of Mr. Starr's deputies was hostile and only added to the anger the President and his top aides feel about Mr. Starr's inquiry, said lawyers at the session.
The President's lead private counsel, David E. Kendall, signaled the continuing hostility in a brief statement after the testimony.
"We're hopeful that the President's testimony will finally bring closure to the independent counsel's more than four-year and over $40 million investigation, which has culminated in an investigation of the President's private life," the ordinarily mild-mannered Mr. Kendall said with evident contempt.
Mr. Kendall said later that Mr. Clinton had refused to answer many of Mr. Starr's questions and, while candid, the President was less than complete in many of his responses.
Mr. Clinton's limited expression of contrition was only part of an emerging White House strategy to continue fighting Mr. Starr on broad legal and political fronts.
Mr. Clinton has privately raged at Mr. Starr, believing he is a Republican partisan and a blue-nosed moralist prying into the President's private behavior. He has dispatched a dozen aides and defenders to demonize Mr. Starr and question the legitimacy of his investigation. That explains his long refusal to answer Mr. Starr's questions about the Lewinsky matter and the scorched-earth legal strategy he has pursued to delay his date with the grand jury.
Erskine B. Bowles, the White House chief of staff, began calling leading Democrats within minutes of the end of Mr. Clinton's grand jury session, coordinating a political counteroffensive.
If anyone thought Bill Clinton would come away deeply humbled and considering resignation, they were wrong. He will fight.
President Clinton's most difficult day in office is now behind him. What now lies ahead?
Unlike President Ronald Reagan after the Iran-Contra debacle, Mr. Clinton cannot simply confess error, shoulder responsibility and dismiss a handful of top aides. In the Lewinsky matter, the fault was not in the President's policy, but in himself. It is vastly harder to repair a reputation than to repudiate a failed policy.
Still, the investigation by Mr. Starr is far from over. Whatever errors or evasions Mr. Clinton admitted today must be weighed in light of voluminous evidence collected over seven months that the prosecutor may believe add up to the "high crimes and misdemeanors" standard for impeachment set by the Constitution.
It is now up to Mr. Starr how to portray the President's actions and his words in a report expected to be delivered to Congress this fall. But however the President is judged by Congress, he must also confront the judgment of the citizenry, which has thus far been indulgent of its wayward President while also finding his personal standards of morality and honesty distasteful. But a growing proportion of the public has come to believe he was stingy with the truth, a fatal affliction for a politician with ambitions for a legacy among the top ranks of American Presidents.
The Lewinsky saga would be little more than a sordid soap opera if the stakes were not so great. Many observers believe that the Serbs in Kosovo, Saddam Hussein in Iraq and perhaps even the terrorists who attacked United States embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were emboldened by a perceived power vacuum at the White House. "It is no coincidence," said a top-ranking official of the State Department, "that the really bad guys of the world, like Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein, have picked this summer to cause the United States trouble."
And the American people, enjoying economic bounty, have sacrificed a measure of national pride because of the sex-stained spectacle.
"This scandal has prevented people from feeling better about the country because the principal complaint about the country is its moral climate," said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.
And despite recent polling that indicates Americans are willing to again forgive the President his trespasses, Mr. Kohut said the public verdict is not so certain.
"The public has the last and often a counter-intuitive word on issues like this," Mr. Kohut said. "The public is not so predictable and the impact on the President and the Presidency I think is yet to be determined.
"If he falls from grace, we will look for someone with grace to replace him in 2000," Mr. Kohut concluded. "It will be the equivalent of Jimmy Carter in 1976, a search for character."

HEADLINE: TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: THE PUBLIC;
Speech Deepens Split Over Clinton's Actions

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Aug. 17

 BODY:
Lisa Wessels describes herself as "pro-Clinton" and Scot Baker says he is "anti-Clinton," opposed points of view that have not prevented the Seattle couple from planning to marry. And when the two, both 30 years old, met after work this evening and watched President Clinton admit a "not appropriate" relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, both chose the same word to describe the televised address: "Embarrassing."
But their words, it turned out, did not mean the same thing. 
 Miss Wessels, a licensing specialist, felt bad for Mr. Clinton. "I can't believe that he had to do this, forced to stand up and talk about his private life like that," she said. "It was surreal. It's like I wasn't watching the President of the United States, I was watching Richard Dreyfus play the President of the United States in some bad movie. I feel sorry for him."
But for Mr. Baker, a recruiter for the Microsoft Corporation, the embarrassment was to America at large. "I always told my friends he has no integrity, that squinty little twinkle in his eye," he said. "Now we know for sure. But I'm not happy about it. It's embarrassing for the country. This is our President."
Around the nation, in their homes and crowded around television sets in public places, Americans in huge numbers stopped what they were doing for four minutes tonight to watch Mr. Clinton speak. But if such events often serve to bind people together in the face of a national tragedy or emergency, a series of conversations around the country afterward suggested that Mr. Clinton's speech had left people as divided about him as ever.
While many people still think that the matter is not enough to warrant impeachment of Mr. Clinton, polls over the last several months, and tonight, show a clear undercurrent of belief that now, more than ever, Bill Clinton needs to go.
"This man lied in front of the nation, and he basically admitted it," said Mike Bagdassarov of Baltimore, an intelligence analyst for the Maryland state police. "He shouldn't be President. It's that simple."
Jim Eichelberger, an Atlanta lawyer, said: "I think it was typical Clinton -- dishonest, blaming others, just what I anticipated. He owes it to the Democratic Party and the American people to resign."
And many of those who were inclined to forgive the President said they did not believe his speech would put the matter to rest, partly because, in their view, he did not really accept full responsibility for what happened.
"He's still trying to weasel out of it," said Janice Scallon, 27, an independent contractor for social-service programs in Chicago. "It wasn't even a full apology. Instead, he said it was inappropriate. If he just said, hey, he had sex with her, then it would be over."
Ms. Scallon also said she was deeply bothered that the very first motivation cited by the President for misleading people about the relationship was to save himself from embarrassment. "That just shows how selfish he is," she said.
While very few people seemed to watch the speech and find themselves liking the President any more than they had before, many said that they still felt strongly that the matter should be put to rest.
A New York Times/CBS News Poll taken immediately after the speech showed a continuation of the strong public desire to move beyond the scandal. Sixty-three percent of the respondents said the Lewinsky matter should be dropped, now that the President has testified to the grand jury and addressed the nation, compared with 18 percent who said he should resign and 12 percent who said Congress should begin impeachment proceedings.
And 65 percent said Mr. Clinton should have made a public statement about the relationship sooner, even as his job approval rating remained steady, in the high 60's.
The poll, based on a survey of 396 adults, has a sampling error of 5 percentage points. Such instant, one-night polls are considered less reliable than the typical New York Times/CBS News Polls, which are based on larger samples and conducted over several days. Moreover, initial reactions sometimes change.
There was little expectation among some before the speech that the President could say much to justify himself, and little feeling afterwards that he had succeeded.
"There was nothing he could say," said Jeff Lewelling, a project coordinator for a welfare-to-work program in Chicago, who watched the speech at a local pub. "His credibility was totally shot."
Mr. Lewelling said Mr. Clinton had made "a very vague admission" that had weakened the Presidency and also that he "totally hung his supporters out to dry."
In Austin, Tex., Shedric Jones, a 34-year-old shoeshine operator, said he was relieved, but not surprised, that the President had finally told the American people that he had been wrong.
"I'm glad that he admitted it, but he should have done the right thing earlier because people looked up to him," Mr. Jones said. "I assumed it was true all along, so this was no big deal. Maybe next time he'll be more careful."
But Larry Foster, a 57-year-old pilot for American Airlines in Dallas, also said he thought the President's remarks fell short. "He was hardly apologetic," Mr. Foster said. "I never saw any honest apology. He said, 'it's a personal matter.' It's not a personal matter. It affects every person in the United States. He swore to uphold the truth. It was a very poor apology. It wasn't sincere. He wasn't contrite."
To be sure, some people felt the opposite, that the President was too contrite.
"I wish he had said, 'Yes, I did it' -- everyone knew that, anyway -- but then was more forceful in saying, I did nothing illegal," said Andrea Wagner, an arts administrator in Seattle.
Ms. Scallon said the President looked like "an ashamed little boy -- he looked like a boy who had his hand caught in the cookie jar and said, 'Oopsie.' "
As much as people were willing to answer questions about Mr. Clinton, a number volunteered that they found themselves thinking about his wife and daughter as he gave the speech.
"I'm very curious to know what kind of personal life he and Hillary can have after this," said Marge Routon, 76, a retired insurance claims adjuster in Memphis. "I don't know how, as a woman, she can put this behind her again and again. Maybe all the work they have done together is just more important to her than sex.
Michael Doeckmann, 45, a customer service representative for a telephone supplies distributor in the Memphis area, said he felt deeply sorry for Chelsea Clinton, but not her mother. "I think she is so interested in his staying in office she will do whatever it takes to stay there," he said. "But I would like to know exactly what she really thinks about this. I don't think we ever will know, but I'd like to."
And in Houston, Natalie Wolk, 26, a psychological therapist, offered this thought: "It's Chelsea that I feel sorry for. I mean, here she is in her first year in college and she has to watch while her father talks about this to the whole world."
Mr. Clinton's appeal that the nation focus on other issues bothered many who watched the speech, who described at as a transparent attempt at diversion.
The speech, with its criticism of the investigation by the independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, "kind of reminded me of Nixon's first Watergate speeches, talking about how important detente was," said Joe Heinen, a Chicago bartender. "Pretty shifty, actually."
Mary Drucker, a nursing student from Bellingham, Wash., described herself as livid after the speech. "It really burned me up when he said we should turn to the nation's problems," she said. "As far as I'm concerned, what he did goes to the heart of the nation's problems."
But at the Boulevard Cafe in the Crenshaw District of Los Angeles, where about a dozen diners sat amid posters of Frederick Douglass, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcom X and Joe Louis, patrons said they agreed completely with the President that the nation had much more pressing problems than his sex life, and on issues like the economy, they gave Mr. Clinton high marks.
" I really feel this is a private matter," said Maurice Phillips, 52, a financial consultant. "Since the economy has improved, no one should be concerned with what he does behind closed doors."

Health Scares That Weren't So Scary

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody 

 BODY:
HOW often has your clock radio awakened you with the distressing news that something you eat, drink, breathe or do has just been shown in a new study to be a serious health hazard? And how often did it turn out to be a false alarm, unsupported by subsequent research?
The American Council on Science and Health, based in New York, recently updated and expanded its popular report, "Facts Versus Fears," reviewing what it considers the greatest unfounded health scares of the last five decades. Although controversy continues to rage about potential risks associated with some of these "scares," including Agent Orange and hormones in beef, most -- including those that resulted in serious economic damage and changes in public policy -- have been soundly discounted by subsequent studies. 
 The following review of some of the most prominent scares in recent decades serves as a cautionary tale that should help you realize why it is unwise to leap before you look more closely at what any new study actually means.
ALAR -- In 1989, the popular television show "60 Minutes," the Natural Resources Defense Council and the actress Meryl Streep denounced this chemical used to regulate the ripening of apples as "the most potent cancer-causing agent in our food supply" and said it was a cause of childhood cancer.
The accusation was based on a 1973 study in which a byproduct of Alar caused tumors in mice. The dosage used in the study was eight times greater than the so-called maximum tolerated dose, the amount above which tissue damage occurs even from innocent substances because of the high concentration.
Subsequent tests by the National Cancer Institute and the Environmental Protection Agency failed to show that Alar caused cancer. Only when mice were given extremely high doses, equivalent to 133,000 to 266,000 times the amount a preschool child might consume in a day in apples and apple juice, did any tumors result.
Still, millions of alarmed parents panicked and dumped untold gallons of apple juice and bushels of apples, the apple industry lost about $375 million, the Department of Agriculture lost another $15 million, countless children were given far less nutritious drinks in place of apple juice and Alar was taken off the market by its manufacturer.
COFFEE AND PANCREATIC CANCER -- In 1981 in The New England Journal of Medicine, Harvard researchers published an "unexpected" finding linking pancreatic cancer to coffee consumption. Just two cups of coffee a day doubled the risk and five cups tripled it, said the researchers, who estimated that coffee accounted for more than half the cases of this nearly universally fatal cancer.
But the study was designed to look not at coffee but at alcohol and smoking as factors in this cancer, and other researchers who had been studying huge numbers of people had found no such link to coffee. Nor did animal studies disclose any association between coffee and pancreatic cancer. Five years later, the Harvard group repeated its study and failed to confirm its own findings.
In "Facts Versus Fears," the council stated, "This brief scare illustrates the danger of putting too much credence in a single study without analyzing any possible biases or confounding factors."
ELECTRIC BLANKETS -- Everyone in modern societies is exposed to electromagnetic fields (EMF's) -- at home, at work and everywhere that electricity is in use. A 1979 report hinted at a possible relationship between childhood cancer and living near high-current residential power lines, and subsequently, electric blankets were singled out as possible risks, because of their nightlong proximity to the body.
In 1990, a study found a modest increase in cancers in children whose mothers had used electric blankets during pregnancy and a lesser increase in children who had used such blankets.
This prompted a warning label on all electric blankets and a redesign of the product that reduced EMF exposure to the background level produced by household wiring.
But subsequent studies have not borne out the 1990 finding, and this year a large National Cancer Institute study concluded that a causal relationship between childhood brain tumors and EMF's from appliances, including electric blankets, was unlikely. Other studies that examined several adult cancers also found no relationship to the use of electric blankets.
CELLULAR PHONES -- Like electric blankets, cell phones create EMF's. In 1990, a woman who had used a cell phone extensively for two years developed a brain tumor just behind her right ear, where she typically placed the phone's antenna.
Her husband filed suit against the manufacturer, saying that the phone's EMF's had caused his wife's cancer. In 1993 he appeared on the CNN program "Larry King Live" to proclaim his assertion, which prompted three lawsuits from other cell phone users making similar claims.
In response, the industry paid for independent safety studies, which have yet to clearly link cell phones to cancer. Although it is not possible to prove that EMF's are safe, there is still no convincing evidence of harm from the kind of EMF's that cell phones emit. While the incidence of brain tumors has risen slightly in recent years, there has been no disproportionate increase in tumors near the ears, despite a meteoric rise in cell phone use.
As the council points out in its report, by far the most serious hazard associated with these phones is their use while driving. Last year a study reported in The New England Journal of Medicine showed that drivers who use cell phones are four times as likely as nonusers to have an accident.
ASBESTOS IN SCHOOLS -- Asbestos that is contained in a solid substance is harmless. But when it becomes crumbly, airborne and inhaled, it can lodge in body tissues, where it can sometimes cause cancer. Asbestos insulation to protect against fire was required in schools until 1973, when the Environmental Protection Agency banned its use to reduce children's exposure. The 1980's produced two Congressional acts requiring schools to inspect for asbestos hazards and clean them up. Despite the fact that in most schools asbestos levels were extremely low (less than the amount that in 10 years of exposure might cause one additional death in 100,000 over a lifetime -- one-third the risk of being struck by lightning), by 1990 some $6 billion had been spent on asbestos abatement in schools.
Many experts believe that asbestos removal, which increased airborne asbestos, created a far greater hazard to the children, who might have benefited far more had this money been spent on enhancing their education.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 5, 1998, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
The Personal Health column on Aug. 18 about unfounded health scares referred incompletely to Government action on Alar, a chemical once used to make apples ripen uniformly. In May 1989, the Environmental Protection Agency announced steps to prohibit the use of Alar on apples and other foods, but allowed the chemical to stay on the market for at least 15 months. In the announcement, the agency said the chemical might pose an unacceptable risk of cancer in humans. Before the ban could take effect, the chemical's maker, Uniroyal, voluntarily removed it from the market. It is no longer used on food in the United States.
The article also omitted a description of the finances of the American Council on Science and Health, which has criticized the furor over Alar. It is a nonprofit organization that receives 60 percent of its financing from private foundations, individual contributions and sales. The rest of its support comes from corporations, including food manufacturers. This year Uniroyal contributed $10,000, which is slightly more than one-half of 1 percent of the council's $1.6 million budget.

HEADLINE: Seeking to Expand, Korn Ferry Files for Initial Public Offering

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
Korn Ferry International, the giant executive search firm, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering, the proceeds of which it plans to use to expand its business.
The company, which is based in Los Angeles, expects to raise about $230 million from the offering to repay debt, redeem preferred stock, expand to the Internet and make acquisitions, according to the filing. 
 The offering would be the latest recent public offering or planned stock sale by a professional services firm, including one by another large executive recruiter, LAI Ward Howell, which went public last year.
"You do, in general, tend to see companies from one industry file close together," said Ken Fleming, a research analyst with the Renaissance Capital Corporation. "One company sees that the environment may be favorable and the same factors are going to be affecting other companies in that area."
In the filing, Korn Ferry said its objective was "to expand its leadership position as a preferred global executive search firm by offering a broad range of solutions to address its clients' management recruitment needs."
The company has more than 380 consultants in 71 offices in 41 countries. It had revenue last year of $315 million, a 16 percent increase from a year earlier, but net income declined 41 percent, to $5.2 million, according to the filing.
Over all, the executive search business is booming because of a strong economy and corporations' emphasis on casting a wide net to fill top posts instead of simply filling them from within. Indeed, revenues for the top 10 firms grew by 23 percent last year, according to Hunt-Scanlon Advisers, publisher of Executive Search Review newsletter.
Still, the industry has become more competitive as clients demand more for their money. That has forced firms to look for ways to expand, which, of course, requires cash. And in an industry with a high turnover rate, firms that can offer stock and options may have an advantage to lure the best talent.
This is not the first time Korn Ferry has ventured into the equity markets. The company first went public in 1972, but it was a much smaller business with thinly traded and volatile shares. Its founders, Lester Korn and Richard Ferry, found the swing in the stock price distracting and later repurchased the shares and took the firm private.
Korn Ferry now wants to be traded as KFY on the New York Stock exchange.

HEADLINE: Fears Grow As Russia Postpones Debt Plan

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 18

 BODY:
The Russian Government tonight put off the announcement of its plan to change the repayment terms for its debt, after alarm had spread in the world financial community that Russia was prepared to discriminate against foreign creditors.
Deputy Prime Minister Boris G. Fyodorov, in charge of economic policy, said he would first review the plan with representatives of J. P. Morgan; Goldman, Sachs, and Deutsche Bank. Details of the expected swap of Treasury bills for longer-term securities, a crucial element in program to deal with the economic crisis, were to have been released on Wednesday. 
 The prospect of a discriminatory policy has "seriously damaged the credibility of the Russian Government and the Russian Central Bank," said Daniel McGovern, managing director for emerging-markets research at Merrill Lynch in London. "They have damaged the ability of Russian banks to deal in a normal way with their Western counterparts."
Foreign investors, lured by sky-high interest rates for several years, have bought more than $50 billion of Russian bonds payable in rubles.
Rumors that the Government was proposing a plan that would penalize foreign creditors in favor of Russia's own troubled banks swept through the foreign investment community here today, prompting warnings that such a plan would kill off any future foreign investment in Russia.
"Everyone was becoming more and more nervous, and bitter," said a Western investment banker who insisted on anonymity. "Had they gone ahead with the plan we were hearing it would have created enormous concerns in the investment community. Now we feel that fairness and market practices will come into play."
Investors said the Government was considering proposals that would differentiate between foreign and Russian creditors as way to shore up its banking system. The proposals, which reportedly include a two-tier redemption schedule, were the subject of heated debate today in the Government, one expert said.
The trading in Treasury bills was suspended on Monday, when the Government announced a crisis program that imposed a 90-day moratorium on privately held foreign debt and set the ruble free to float to as low as 9 1/2 rubles to the dollar, from 6.4 rubles recently.
Russian banks and their foreign creditors are to discuss the debt moratorium on Monday. That covers $4 billion in outstanding loans. The Government has said it will continue making payments on its publicly held foreign debt.
As the value of the ruble skittered downward at banks and exchange booths across the country, shoppers and bankers, both Russians and foreigners, waited to see who would be left holding the bag.
A countrywide survey broadcast on television news programs said not that many people rushed today to exchange their rubles for dollars, preferring to wait and see where the currency will land.
At the Moscow currency market the value was fixed at 6.8 rubles to the dollar, roughly the rate at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, after a day of heavy trading in ruble futures. The rate here on Monday was 6.4 and in Chicago 6.5.
The Central Bank said it would move against traders who posted more than a 15 percent spread between their buying and selling prices.
Some analysts interpreted ruble rates of 9, 10 or even 15 to the dollar posted by some banks and traders as the equivalent of hanging an "out of order" sign on the tellers' windows.
"Those are 'we don't want to trade' levels," one expert said. "Essentially people are waiting to see if things are going to calm down."
But for average Russians, lurking behind the devalued ruble is the fear of inflation, similar to the one that emptied their pocketbooks in the early 1990's, when Russia let go of Soviet-era price controls.
In scattered cases the ruble's drop showed up on shelves, despite threats by the tax police to ride herd on merchants who raise prices to take advantage of the confusion.
At a small grocery store in central Moscow, the store's administrator, Olga Larina, said she had raised prices on imported goods 10 percent after suppliers had announced that they would increase their prices.
"We realized," Ms. Larina said, "that this was the pattern when three of our suppliers told us the same thing."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Rally Overseas Helps Bolster U.S. Markets

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Led by a surge in technology shares and rallies overseas, United States stocks rose for a second day yesterday and helped the major indexes erase most of the declines suffered over the previous two weeks.
Although the market remains substantially below the highs reached a month ago, analysts said investors apparently were heeding reports pointing out how a wide array of stocks had fallen to relatively cheap levels. 
 The buying spree lifted the Dow Jones industrial average 139.80 points, a 1.6 percent gain, to 8,714.65, after a 1.8 percent gain Monday.
American Express, Sears, Roebuck, International Business Machines, Hewlett-Packard and the Aluminum Company of America each added more than 10 points to the blue-chip gauge, as 16 of its 30 stocks ended higher.
The Standard & Poor's 500-company index rose 17.53 points, to 1,101.20, also a 1.6 percent increase. Microsoft, General Electric and Pfizer led the advance.
Led by strong gains among such bellwether technology issues as Microsoft, Intel, Cisco Systems and Dell Computer, the Nasdaq composite index fared even better. The key technology barometer rose 37.08 points, a 2 percent gain, to 1,855.12.
Investors also felt more confident buying shares because political uncertainty surrounding President Clinton had eased considerably after he admitted during grand jury testimony on Monday to having an "inappropriate" relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
In addition, the market's nervousness was soothed by Russia's decision to devalue its currency on Monday, which ended speculation about what steps that country would be taking to avert an economic collapse.
Stock markets in Europe were strongly higher, reflecting investor optimism that Russia had taken decisive action, and the momentum from those gains was felt on Wall Street when trading began.
Germany's benchmark equity index rose 3.1 percent to its highest level in four months. Stocks gained more than 3 percent on London, Amsterdam and Paris exchanges.
In Japan, stocks rose nearly 2 percent, erasing most of Monday's loss.
"Prices have reached attractive levels and cash has built up and all of that conspired to get us to buy stocks," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation.
In addition, he said, "the stage of being very alarmed about Russia and Asia may be behind us."
Investors' renewed confidence in the market also helped smaller-company shares erase nearly all of last week's declines.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks rose 7.33 points, to 411.29 points, a 1.8 percent gain.
Shares of Skytel Communications, the Russell's leading gainer, rose 5, to 18 5/8, after the company announced that AT&T would sell its nationwide paging services.
The buying yesterday was more broad based than in the previous session, when the gains were largely confined to big stocks.
On Monday investors "stuck their toe in the water," said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Inc. in Baltimore. But yesterday, he said, "they were more willing to go into small and midcap names."
He pointed to shares of United Rentals, a small equipment-leasing company. This week, both Legg Mason and Salomon Smith Barney recommended the stock to investors, pointing out that it has fallen almost 40 percent from its high of $48 on July 20. Yesterday, United Rentals closed at 32 7/8, up 3 7/8. Before yesterday, individual investors showed little interest in the shares, he said.
Over all, technology shares, financial services companies, telecommunications companies and drug stocks were among the leading gainers.
On the New York Stock Exchange advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2-to-1.
Despite these gains, analysts remained cautious in their outlook and said that investors were primarily seeking shares of companies that appear to have a relatively clear picture of future earnings.
Another sign of investors' defensive stance was a strong flow of cash into large-company stock funds, particularly index funds, said AMG Data Services, a California research firm that tracks mutual fund trends.
Robert Adler, the president of AMG, said these funds accounted for the bulk of the $1.5 billion that flowed into equity mutual funds in the week ended Aug. 12.
That flow was more than three times the total of the previous week.
Mr. Johnson of First Albany said his recent buying was limited to shares of Pepsico as he continued to hold a large number of consumer staple stocks, which he believes will provide dependable earnings regardless of market conditions.
His holdings include drug stocks like Merck, consumer products companies like Procter & Gamble and food companies like Sara Lee. He also favors larger technology companies like Dell, I.B.M. and Compaq.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
From Art Society to Times Sq., Elbows Bare

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
IT was probably inevitable that the man who invented those lurid chartreuse stickers cemented to certain car windows around town -- "This vehicle violates N.Y.C. parking regulations!" -- would not last forever as president of the Municipal Art Society.
It's not that Brendan J. Sexton has no sense of esthetic decorum; in fact, most preservationists agree that he has helped improve the city's physical landscape in the three years that he has led the art society. But ultimately, Mr. Sexton is an operations man, as they say at City Hall, the kind of guy who likes to get his fingernails dirty planning sanitation routes and figuring out traffic patterns and engaging in the delivery of city services in a way not usually practiced in the more rarefied world of the urban-design association. 
 Which is why many of his friends believe his next job as president of the Times Square Business Improvement District will be such a snug fit. Running one of these districts means supplying basic services the city has neither the money nor the will to provide, along with cheerleading and long-term planning. As Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has recently come to realize, it's a bit like being mayor of one of the city's best-known, most prosperous neighborhoods, with $6 million in tax money to play with and no daily news conferences.
"It's a perfect match for Brendan," said Stanley Brezenoff, who as a Deputy Mayor in the Koch administration was Mr. Sexton's boss. "When he was running the city's Office of Operations, he reveled in figuring out how to make the agencies work better, coming up with milestones and benchmarks for sanitation and public safety and the general quality of life. He likes digging into problems up to his elbows."
At just under five-and-a-half feet tall, Mr. Sexton, 53, is a feisty and talkative man whose elbows are usually exposed by rolled-up sleeves. He is careful not to denigrate the job he is leaving, pointing out that the society played a major role in the design of the structure that is to replace the Coliseum at Columbus Circle, as well as the new Hudson River Park. But his role at the arts society was primarily that of a negotiator and lobbyist, testifying at hearings, writing beseeching letters to public officials, and speaking with newspaper reporters. When he talks about his next job, one can almost hear his heart pounding.
"What we've seen in Times Square in the last several years is what I think New York's next century will be very largely based on," he said, sitting in the society's crisp midtown offices in the Villard Houses, on Madison Avenue near East 50th Street. "Times Square is the place where New York is both encouraging and experimenting with the density of the future, the combination of residents and visitors that makes this the global capital of world. You get paid to be excited, to foster excitement, to make excitement friendly and safe."

MR. SEXTON said he wasn't looking for a new job but had expressed interest after a search firm called him, looking for a replacement for Gretchen Dykstra, who is leaving after six years to move to San Francisco. During Ms. Dykstra's tenure, the neighborhood scraped off its grime and ousted its shabby restaurants and movie theaters to become the city's new real estate playground, an overheated greenhouse for developers, publishers and entertainment companies thriving in the city's end-of-century exuberance.
But both Mr. Sexton and Ms. Dykstra insist that the hard work is far from over. The district's problems now involve managing its success: finding sidewalk space for boisterous crowds that often spill over the curb, planning for the day when economic growth begins pressuring Eighth Avenue and Hell's Kitchen, getting ready for the unimaginably large celebration of the new millennium that will occur exactly 500 days from today. Mr. Sexton says he wants the district to grow without losing the "little things that make you happy to be there," like the Colony Record store or the musical instrument dealers on 48th Street.
He will also have to accommodate the looming presence of Mr. Giuliani, who recently shut down another improvement district after its director was insufficiently deferential. But that should not be an enormous problem for Mr. Sexton, who long ago learned to deal with a mayor-sized ego when he worked in several posts for Mayor Edward I. Koch, including as sanitation commissioner.
Some officials at City Hall were hoping the job would go to Finance Commissioner Alfred C. Cerullo 3d, but despite a few disagreements with the Giuliani administration over the years, Mr. Sexton's ties to City Hall are fairly strong, and officials there did not seriously object to him. The district's board also didn't seem to mind that he has occasionally criticized some of the major developers in Times Square who will now be paying his salary.
Mr. Sexton, who grew up around Kew Gardens Hills in Queens, now lives in the St. George section of Staten Island, where his seven children (counting three from his wife's previous marriage) were reared. Despite the substantial salary that comes with the job, he's getting worried about convincing his children that he still works for a living.
"I don't know if the person in this job is more of a ringmaster or a maitre d' at a really super party," he said. "It's hard to justify yourself to your kids when you tell them your job is to make New York as much fun as possible."

HEADLINE: EDITORIAL OBSERVER;
In Bad Times, Blame Speculators

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Financial markets are again under stress in Asia and Russia, and local authorities know whom to blame. It's the speculators.
"Speculators have been deploying a whole host of improper measures," said Donald Tsang, Hong Kong's financial secretary, as he disclosed that the Hong Kong government had bought millions of dollars in stock. Among them were the "spreading of vicious rumors" that Hong Kong's currency might be devalued. 
 Hong Kong's stocks rallied, and the idea of government intervention is spreading. Malaysia's Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamed, said he might try the same tactic.
The S-word was also used in Russia, where a central bank official complained that Russian banks were speculating against the ruble by buying dollars. The central bank set out to squelch that speculation by barring such purchases by some banks.
It is not hard to sympathize with the officials involved. They think their economies and markets are going to get over a rough spot, and along comes somebody -- often identified as the dreaded hedge funds run mostly by American investors -- betting that things will fall apart. If those speculators can just be defeated, then all will be well.
In Hong Kong, the government says speculators were trying to drive the currency and the stock market down, and interest rates up, to make money in all three markets. To block such manipulation a little government intervention was necessary, authorities say. So they bought the local currency and shares in all major Hong Kong companies.
So far, it has worked. But a final verdict is not in. In the early summer of 1997, Thailand routed hedge funds that were borrowing the Thai baht and selling it, betting it would fall. Big purchases by the Thai Government temporarily raised the value of the baht. But then a funny thing happened. Ordinary Thai citizens and companies began to wonder whether a currency that needed such extraordinary intervention to protect its value was really fundamentally sound. Companies that owed dollars realized they would be in trouble if the baht were devalued, so they bought dollars. A few weeks later the baht plunged, beginning the Asian crisis.
Similarly, what the Russian central bank saw as speculation was in fact the reasonable response of Russian banks that were being pressed to repay loans they had taken out in dollars, and that were seeking to accumulate dollars as protection in case the ruble was devalued. When it became clear the Government was afraid of such protection, devaluation became inevitable.
In Hong Kong now, investors may be asking themselves whether share prices really are reasonable if they can be maintained only by government buying. Perhaps many will decide it would be safer to reduce their positions. If so, the government will have accomplished little, other than to lose a lot of public money.
All this is not to deny that speculators had a lot to do with the current problems. But when the real speculation was taking place, governments were looking on with glee. That was in 1996, when foreigners were pouring in money. They invested in Indonesian companies thinking that the fact the companies were tied to President Suharto's family was enough to assure profits. They poured money into Russia thinking it was the next emerging market, and lent money to Korean banks that were financing shaky conglomerates.
Now those who foolishly risked money in years past want to salvage what they can. Companies that owe dollars fear being bankrupted if the local currencies collapse. Both groups want to cut their losses. Is that speculation? Or prudence?

HEADLINE: Fed Leaves Rates Steady As New Data Pose Few Risks

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 18

 BODY:
Today's good news about the United States economy was the refreshing absence of bad news: the Federal Reserve did not raise interest rates at this morning's monetary policy meeting. Inflation did not rise much in July. And the trade deficit did not widen further in June, as economists had expected.
Despite the lowest unemployment rate in a generation, consumer prices edged up just two-tenths of 1 percent in July, the Commerce Department reported. Prices are up just 1.7 percent from a year ago, an extraordinary performance for the seventh year of an economic expansion. And despite the robust dollar and deepening recession in Asia, the United States trade deficit fell by more than $1 billion in June, to $14.2 billion. In dollars, that is still close to a record high, but as a share of the economy -- a more meaningful yardstick -- the trade deficit is still just two-thirds of its 1980's peak. Exports fell, but at a far slower rate than in recent months. Imports fell as well, as businesses bought less equipment from abroad and oil prices dropped another notch. 
 Against that backdrop, the Federal Reserve announced that it was leaving its target for the overnight lending rate, known as the Federal funds rate -- a benchmark for all interest rates -- at 5.5 percent, and the discount rate, the rate the Fed charges banks for emergency loans, at 5 percent.
As usual, the central bank offered no explanation of its decision, but hardly any economists were predicting a change in policy. With inflation tame, the economy slowing but not in immediate danger of slipping into recession, and turmoil in Russia and elsewhere, the Fed's best action was inaction.
"The Fed has been very successful, and blessed," said Robert Di Clemente, co-head of United States economic research at Salomon Smith Barney. "Most of us feel that they would have been compelled to tighten if it had not been for the shock from Asia."
Stocks rose sharply for the second consecutive day. But whatever the market was celebrating, it probably was not economic news, which came as no surprise to Wall Street.
Inflation may well be leveling out after declining for much of this expansion. Right now, however, the strong dollar and the growing share of imports are helping to hold down prices. Consumer prices for goods are up just four-tenths of 1 percent from a year ago. It is not just that imports, like gasoline, clothing and consumer electronics, are cheaper. It is also that inexpensive imports are helping to restrain domestic prices by intensifying competition.
The most encouraging news in today's consumer price report is that inflation in the service sector -- which accounts for two-thirds of spending and more than four-fifths of employment -- is a remarkably tame 3 percent. That is half the rate of inflation in services at the end of the 1980's boom.
"Services inflation is very benign," said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber. "It's higher than goods inflation, but it hasn't accelerated."
That is true across a wide range of services. From a year ago, for example, housing is up 3.3 percent; car repair, 2.4 percent; haircuts and other personal services, 2.2 percent, and airline and other transportation, 1.2 percent. Even the prices of medical services, a category in which economists expect heftier increases now that the shift to managed care has pretty much been completed, are up just 3.2 percent, faster than a year ago but moderate by past standards.
With labor markets tighter than they have been in decades, employment in services is growing by more than 230,000 workers a month, and wages are rising handily. So the absence of inflation in services is a puzzle.
Like the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, Mr. Harris said he suspected that the productivity of workers in services might be rising faster than the official measures were capturing. Also, competition in services is fierce, so businesses are having a tough time raising prices.
And finally, cheaper imports are having an indirect effect on wage-setting in the service industry by holding down the cost of living.
The trade deficit will almost certainly keep getting bigger as the troubles in Asia deepen. Exports to Asia have already fallen 21 percent from a year ago, and exports to the rest of the world are growing very slowly. Imports are apt to bounce back; those from Asia are beginning to head higher. Indeed, the trade deficit is likely to remain the biggest drag on economic growth, as it was during the year's first half.
The unexpected improvement in the trade deficit is a temporary respite. June's smaller trade deficit implies that economic growth in the second quarter, which slowed to 1.4 percent from 5.4 percent in the winter, might have been a bit stronger than first estimated. But one detail of today's trade report -- a sharp decline in imports of capital goods -- implies that business spending on new equipment may have been weakening at the end of last quarter. If that is so, the effects would cancel each other out.
So far this year, the widening trade deficit has knocked 2.5 percentage points off economic growth. The negative effect is likely to diminish over time, though economists expect it to persist well into next year.
"That's bad news for American manufacturers, but good news for inflation," said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Primark Decision Economics, a forecasting firm.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Prices Close DownSlightly For Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities ended slightly lower yesterday.
A smaller-than-expected trade deficit in June suggested to some investors that economic growth might be quickening, raising the prospect of a pickup in inflation. 
 In addition, market participants focused on the dollar, a Treasury bill auction of new one-year bills and a rally in United States stocks.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 6/32, to 99 7/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.55 percent from 5.54 percent on Monday.
Federal Reserve policy makers, as expected, left interest rates unchanged at their meeting yesterday.
"The Federal Reserve adhered to an unchanged monetary policy in light of the perceived counterbalance between a slackening economic advance, benign inflation environment, budget surplus and continued fragility in overseas financial markets on one hand," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, "and robust consumer spending and torrid housing activity on the other."
The dollar fell against the yen as Japanese officials said they were ready to act to bolster the currency. A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities less attractive to foreign investors. Stocks in the United States also gained for the second consecutive day, and that helped ease some of the flight to quality into the debt market.
Elsewhere in the Treasury market, traders said the sale of a new one-year bill yesterday went off without a hitch, with the average rate at 5 percent, the lowest since 4.965 percent on Jan. 29. Following are the results of the auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: THE PUBLIC;
Reactions in Milwaukee Include Disappointment And a Sense of Betrayal

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, Aug. 18

 BODY:
For her loyalty to the President, Mary Allen had endured the snickers and condescending smirks from friends, a sister, her husband.
A lifelong Democrat, Ms. Allen spent seven months believing and defending Bill Clinton's denials of a sexual relationship with a former White House intern. "Now I feel pretty foolish," she said today. 
 As the 41-year-old homemaker from suburban Greenfield watched President Clinton acknowledge on television on Monday that he had "misled people" about his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, she simply shook her head with disappointment.
Like a majority of Americans, Ms. Allen does not believe the President should lose his job, or that the investigation by the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, has been worth the time and money spent. She still believes Mr. Clinton has done a good job as a world leader and steward of the nation's economy.
But she said she would never trust him again. "He looked us right in the eye and lied to us," Ms. Allen said, recalling the President's impassioned, finger-wagging, "now listen to me" insistence last January that he had never had sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky.
In this Middle America city of smokestacks and church spires, a hard-working place famous for making Harley-Davidson motorcycles and Miller beer, people seemed intrigued with the steamy details of the President's predicament, even as they professed a weariness about the long-running national soap opera.
To most people, it amounts to a sorry mess that has no heroes and plenty of villains: a flawed President, an overzealous prosecutor, backstabbing co-workers, arrogant lawyers, spin artists and intrusive journalists.
Judging from more than two dozen interviews in this metropolis of about 1.4 million people -- at outdoor cafes on the trendy East Side, on the broom-swept sidewalks of immigrant neighborhoods, at the campus of Marquette University, inside the gleaming shopping malls on suburban Blue Mound Road -- many voters found Mr. Clinton's televised admission to be rather grudging and shallow. Most also expressed alarm at the President's apparent recklessness and said they were disappointed in his actions, his foot-dragging and what they saw as his half-hearted apology.
"He didn't help himself with this speech," said Terry Welch, 45, whose family owns a business that makes leather finishes in Milwaukee.
Characterizing the President's talk as more legalistic than candid, Mr. Welch said that Mr. Clinton is becoming something of a parody. "When you have to listen to his tenses of speech -- Subjunctive? Conditional? -- you've got some problems with credibility."
The host of a radio call-in show on WISN-AM, Jerry Bott, noted that Mr. Clinton's speech was conspicuously missing two words: "I'm sorry." A caller from Brookfield named Patrice said she was angry about the President's tone. "He was defiant," she said, "like he dared us to even question him."
Plenty of voters say the President's private life is nobody's business but his family's. Mr. Clinton's defenders, and even a few of his political foes, expressed concern about a 90's brand of McCarthyism -- inquisitors searching under every bed, not for Communists, but for paramours.
"We don't have a right to know who he's sleeping with," said Jeff England, a 35-year-old stock trader. "It makes government so frivolous."
Tom Van Hoof, a 45-year-old architect who lives in the leafy Shorewood community along Lake Michigan, said there was a simple explanation for Mr. Clinton's actions. "Guys cheat on their wives, that's just the way the world works," said Mr. Van Hoof, a married man, who excepted himself from the crowd.
But others accepted no such excuses. George Ziedonis, a 41-year-old warehouse worker who clutched a thermos as he waited for the 7 A.M. bus, said that Mr. Clinton's performance on Monday night was characteristically riddled with wiggle words.
"He was true to form," Mr. Ziedonis said. "He never tells the whole truth. He lives in a fantasy world where he thinks he can go by his own rules."
To most people who voiced anger about Mr. Clinton, it was the lying more than any sexual misdeed that caused the most harm.
A city with a tavern on almost every corner, Milwaukee is nonetheless known as a well-behaved, follow-the-rules kind of town, a place where immigrants from Germany and Eastern Europe brought up their children to respect the flag, the police and the church.
Despite its strong Democratic leanings, Milwaukee is a much more culturally conservative place than Madison, 60 miles to the west. And Milwaukeeans do not generally tolerate the sorts of political shenanigans that are commonplace in cities like Chicago.
On the day of Mr. Clinton's address to the nation, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, a newspaper that has generally been friendly to the President, published a searing editorial under the headline, "Mr. President, we've had enough." The next day, the newspaper's editorial was titled, "Clinton's speech falls woefully short."
If conservatives and liberals agree about anything on this case, it is a shared lamentation that children can no longer read newspapers or watch the television news without being confronted with the sort of sexual talk that used to make people blush.
"Can you imagine Walter Cronkite talking about oral sex and semen stains?" said Mr. Welch, the business owner.
But on the campus of Marquette University, a Roman Catholic institution run by the same Jesuit order of priests that educated Mr. Clinton at Georgetown University, young people say the Lewinsky case simply reflects a looser culture, and did not shape it.
Robyn Coleman, a 22-year-old physical therapy major at Marquette, said that most young people grew up watching risque television shows like Melrose Place and Beverly Hills 90210. She said that the Jerry Springer show, a wild, profane tabloid talk show that almost always focuses on sex, is the hottest show on campus.
"Sex is just part of life," Ms. Coleman said. "People aren't embarrassed to talk with each other about it. Unless maybe it's with your parents, you know."
In this sordid case, the deepest sympathies among voters, Democrats and Republicans, lie with the President's daughter, Chelsea, a student at Stanford University. Most people expressed support for Mrs. Clinton, but there was even a measure of disappointment with her.
To Ms. Allen, the suburban homemaker, Mrs. Clinton has disappointed those who cheered her as a symbol of strong womanhood.
"She's lost credibility on women's rights," said Ms. Allen, the mother of two young children. "How can you have any respect for a woman who puts up with a marriage like that."
The Rev. Ralph Gross, a Roman Catholic priest who is in the business of hearing confessions, said he was concerned by the holier-than-thou indignation that seems to prevail among many Americans.
"I'm troubled by this hunger for details," said Father Gross, the 54-year-old pastor of St. Margaret Mary church, saying that Mr. Clinton's acknowledgment of having done wrong should suffice, without a specific accounting of sexual misdeeds.
"We must be very careful about making judgments," he said. "People struggle with different parts of their lives. For some people, it's lust. For others, its racism or sexism. Let's be forgiving and leave the judging to God."
Father Gross said it should come as little surprise that Mr. Clinton was reluctant to confess his wrongdoing on national television.
"I've been to confession myself many times," he said, "and I sure wouldn't want to have my sins broadcast all over the place."

The polls were all conducted Aug. 17 after the President's statement. Three of the national telephone surveys were based on new random samples: ABC News with 587 adults, NBC/Wall Street Journal with 503 adults and Gallup for CNN and USA Today with 633 adults. The New York Times/CBS News poll is based on telephone callbacks with 403 adults first interviewed by CBS News Aug. 11 to 13, and then called back on Monday night.
 
The margin of sampling error for these polls is four to five percentage points. But polls completed in one night are subject to additional errors because of the limited time available to reach respondents. And polls taken immediately after an important event or address capture only the public's initial reactions, which may change.
 
Those with no answer are not shown.

HEADLINE: North Korea's Nuclear Ambitions

 BODY:
North Korea seems to have been caught preparing to betray its 1994 commitment to trade in its nuclear weapons ambitions for $6 billion in international assistance. American intelligence agencies have detected construction of an elaborate underground complex. If completed, the nuclear reactor and plutonium reprocessing plant expected to be built there could allow the North to produce as many as half a dozen nuclear bombs two to five years from now. Washington must insist that work on this project be halted immediately. If North Korea wants economic cooperation from the United States it must honor its promise to renounce all nuclear weapons activity.
North Korea has not yet violated the letter of its 1994 nuclear agreement with the United States. Reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel from the North's existing, above-ground reactors into bomb plutonium remains suspended. Construction work has not yet begun on either the new reactor or new reprocessing plant. That means the nuclear cooperation deal can be preserved, provided North Korea stops work on the new site. 
 The 1994 deal provided for North Korea to freeze all work on suspect nuclear programs. In exchange a group of countries, led by the United States and South Korea, agreed to provide fuel oil and to build two replacement power reactors whose spent fuel cannot easily be converted into bombs. Washington has fallen badly behind on fuel oil deliveries, with less than half the annual amount due by October so far delivered. The North has complained about this shortfall, and it is conceivable that its recent construction work is intended to pressure America into speedier oil deliveries. If so, it is a badly misconceived tactic sure to stiffen Congressional resistance to paying for more fuel.
Later this week, Washington's special envoy for Korean nuclear issues, Charles Kartman, will meet North Korean officials in New York. Halting the newly discovered construction work will rightly be high on his agenda. Beyond that, the Administration needs to proceed firmly but carefully, closely coordinating its diplomacy with South Korea, whose new Government remains committed to expanding economic cooperation with the North.
North Korea is a dangerous, unpredictable country. A breakdown of the nuclear cooperation agreement would heighten tensions on the peninsula, where 37,000 American troops still stand guard. Washington should make every reasonable effort to keep the nuclear deal alive. But the agreement clearly cannot survive if North Korea still imagines itself becoming a nuclear power.

HEADLINE: TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: THE EDITORIALS;
Excerpts From Newspaper Judgments on Clinton

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from newspaper editorials on President Clinton's statement Monday night about his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky:
 
New York Post
"I misled people," the President said. No, he didn't mislead people. He lied to them. By using the word "misled" instead of the word "lied," the President lied to the American people. Again. 
 "I was," he said, "very concerned about protecting my family." The man who allows his wife to go on the "Today" show to defend him against the charge that he had an extramarital affair he did have was not concerned about protecting her. He was concerned with protecting his presidency. By speaking those words, he lied to the American people. . . .
He never said he was sorry for anything he did -- because he isn't sorry. And that was the only honest thing about his truly reprehensible speech.
 
Houston Chronicle
We are left with the Presidential confession, the sad collection of details and leaks and the spin game that whirls on all sides.
To many of Clinton's political detractors, it's an I-told-you-so affirmation that the man is immoral and not fit to hold office.
To many of his supporters, it's an it-doesn't-really-matter confirmation that conspirators are desperate to discredit him and are imposing an unfair standard upon the President's personal life and foibles.
For the nation, it's a sort of Super Bowl of sordidness, complete with off-color analysis, play-by-play commentary and endless -- endless -- on-the-field mayhem.
 
Helena Independent Record
Helena, Mont.
O.K. So President Bill Clinton has changed his tune, admitting an improper sexual relationship with a White House intern less than half his age, but denying any obstruction of justice or other wrongdoing.
Big deal. In a sense, it doesn't really matter what, if anything, President Clinton has to say on the subject of Monica Lewinsky. When it comes to Clinton and women, most of us already have made up our minds, and by now the President's protestations are about the last thing to change it. . . .
Whatever happens in the end, Clinton will be remembered as a President lucky enough to have served during prosperous economic times, a President whose progressive policies were increasingly undermined as much by his move to the center and beyond as by his declining credibility and a President who shamed his wife and daughter and his party and the people of the United States.
 
The Charleston Daily Mail
Charleston, W. Va.
President Clinton has told the American people too little, too late. Months of lying, of stonewalling, of trying to shift the blame and of spinning the truth have damaged his credibility beyond repair.
In a ghastly four-minute session, the President told the nation no more than he had to. It was a calculated, carefully calibrated effort at damage control.
It was a hell of a comedown from a fireside chat with F.D.R.
 
The Wall Street Journal
Legal technicalities aside, the public needs to know how its Government has been conducting itself. What acts may be impeachable and what standards of evidence apply are questions the Congress must decide, not ones for Mr. Starr to predetermine. On the other hand, if Mr. Starr can exonerate Mr. Clinton on Filegate or Travelgate, Americans deserve to know that too -- not merely have it asserted by the same White House spinners who assured us Mr. Clinton never had sex with Monica Lewinsky.
 
Austin American-Statesman
True to form, Clinton offered a quick, weak apology for a critical lapse of judgment in having the affair and misleading the public, then attacked Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for going too far and hurting "too many innocent people." But Mr. President, who is to blame for that?
Unfortunately, Clinton fell back on a legal point to defend his lies and placed the blame for his predicament elsewhere. That won't endear him to anyone. The country Clinton leads deserves better than the superficial finger-pointing performance he delivered Monday night.
 
San Jose Mercury News
Clinton has dishonored the Presidency. He has diminished his stature as a leader. He has damaged the trust that unites the people who form his Administration. He has embarrassed the country he swore to protect and safeguard.
He should be profoundly ashamed, and the shame should haunt him for the rest of his life.
 
USA Today
The core of the President's argument is the tired White House refrain that independent counsel Ken Starr's investigation has "gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many innocent people." Yet if anything was obvious Monday night, it was that Clinton could have brought it all to a quick close in January simply by telling the truth then rather than having it dragged out of him now.
 
The Des Moines Register
It is almost beyond comprehension that Clinton is so lacking in self-discipline, so reckless, that he engaged in a sordid liaison with a youthful intern under the same roof with his own family, at a time he was under scrutiny for alleged sexual misconduct.
Yet the public was fully aware of Clinton's reputation and twice elected him President. It is not Clinton's character alone that brought about this sorry moment. Other factors are the President's tenacious enemies and an overreaching independent counsel.
It should never have some to this -- but it did.
 
Detroit Free Press
The legacy Clinton was pursuing in such important areas as education and race relations will be forever tarnished by a sex scandal. His mantra of taking "personal responsibility" rings hollow.
He has let the whole country down.
Whether or not Clinton got your vote in his two campaigns for President, whether or not he is of your party or your political ideology, if you are an American, he is your leader. You are entitled to demand a lot from the person in such a job. . . .
Clinton would like the country to move quickly beyond this tawdry episode, enjoy the booming economy, and prepare for the next century. The country probably will, but without its President in any meaningful role.

Pakistan Officials Arrest 2 More Bombing Suspects
The authorities in Pakistan arrested two additional suspects in the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, senior Pakistan officials said. One suspect was a pivotal participant, an official said, adding that the description was based on a statement by the previous suspect arrested in the case. A1 

The United States is urging the Taliban militia in Afghanistan to expel a Saudi-born multimillionaire in hopes that he can be captured as a suspect in the embassy bombings, senior Clinton Administration officials said. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, ending a two-day trip to Africa to tour the shattered embassies, condemned the suspect and said the Taliban militia should stop harboring terrorists. A6
 
Russia Delays Repayment Plan
Moscow put off the announcement of a plan to change repayment terms on Government debt after alarm spread in international financial circles that Russia was prepared to discriminate against foreign creditors. Rumors of a plan that would have penalized foreign creditors swept through Moscow's foreign investment community, prompting warnings that such a plan would kill off any future foreign investment in Russia. A11
 
Group Admits to Irish Bombing
A group that broke with the I.R.A. this year took responsibility for the bombing in Northern Ireland on Saturday that killed 28 people and wounded 220. The group, calling itself the Real I.R.A., said it had not intended to kill people but only to destroy property in the shopping district of Omagh. A3
 
Kidnapping Suspect Captured
A nine-month manhunt has ended with the capture one of Mexico's most violent kidnappers, a man who used scissors to cut off his victims' ears and who vowed he would not be taken alive, officials said. Daniel Arizmendi Lopez, was said to have carried out at least 18 kidnappings since 1996. The authorities said 16 other people were arrested, including 6 minors. A2
 
Israel Reacts to Car Thefts
A record number of car thefts has persuaded Israel's right-wing Government to abandon its longtime opposition to erecting new barriers between Israel and the West Bank. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Government had resisted the idea out of concern that such a line could be interpreted as a demarcation of Israel's future border. But that has changed in the face of public outcry over the missing cars. A13
 
Increasing Aid to Iraq
The United Nations said Iraq would have more money to spend on imported food, medicine and related supplies this year than at any time since sanctions were imposed in 1990. Member nations recognize that support for continuing sanctions against Saddam Hussein's Government will wane unless their harshest effects on ordinary Iraqis are mitigated by an oil-for-food program.

Democrats Are Uneasy About Disclosure's Effects
Democratic leaders around the country, including some of President Clinton's most loyal supporters, expressed disappointment about his disclosure of his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky. They are worried about the effects on his final two years in office and on the Congressional midterm elections this fall. A1
 
Prosecutors opened a new line of inquiry into President Clinton's actions, summoning Ms. Lewinsky to testify again to the Federal grand jury. And new details emerged of the President's session on Monday. A1
 
One exchange between Mr. Clinton and prosecutors involved a tie he wore on Aug. 6, the day Ms. Lewinsky testified before the grand jury. The tie was a gift from Ms. Lewinsky. A1
 
Legal experts generally agreed that if Mr. Clinton were to appear before the grand jury under subpoena, he would have no recognized legal basis to continue resisting to answer several questions on the ground that they invaded his privacy. A26
 
A spokeswoman for Hillary Rodham Clinton said Mrs. Clinton was steadfast in her commitment to her marriage, but was also angry. "She was misled," the spokeswoman said. A23
 
The Clintons and their daughter, Chelsea, arrived on Martha's Vineyard for a 12-day vacation. A23
 
Recalling a Race Killing
The widow of a man killed by a firebomb in 1966 in Mississippi testified in the retrial of a former Klan leader accused of ordering the attack. A16
 
8 Legal Suicides in Oregon
Eight people in Oregon have died after taking lethal medications prescribed under a law allowing doctor-assisted suicide for terminally ill people, officials said. A16
 
Hormones and Heart Disease
A study cast doubt on the widely held belief that women who already have heart disease can benefit from hormone supplements like estrogen after menopause. But the findings were not conclusive and a much larger study getting under way was expected to help settle the question. A20
 
Mineral May Fight a Cancer
Eating foods rich in the trace mineral selenium may help men ward off advanced prostate cancer, a study suggested. A21
 
Getting Out of Harm's Way
The head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency said people in tornado-prone areas should build modern versions of traditional storm cellars, or "safe rooms." He also urged people to buy radios that turn on automatically when a tornado warning is transmitted. A18
 
'Sybil' Reconsidered
"Sybil," the young woman whose story of having 16 identities helped publicize multiple-personality disorder, may have had just a single troubled personality, a psychologist says in a report that reviewed 25-year-old tape recordings. A20

2 Sluggers' Language Of Hitting

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
WHEN Sammy Sosa pays a visit to Mark McGwire on first base, do the two men -- the talk of the baseball world, and beyond -- discuss the gross national product, matters of the heart, or where they stand in relation to Roger Maris?
McGwire, the Cardinals' first baseman, was asked this yesterday before the first game of the two-game series between his team and Sosa's Cubs in Wrigley Field, a series in which, like the contests between Alydar and Affirmed, or Ali and Frazier, they are dead even going into the homestretch. McGwire and Sosa had hit 47 homers each, and, if you're counting, it's a bunch of fingers and toes away from Maris's single-season record of 61. 
 "We talk about things other than baseball," McGwire said. Then, with a wink, he added they had made a pact "to keep it to ourselves."
The sluggers meet for a brief encounter now -- and as they did two weekends ago in St. Louis -- and then go their separate and dramatic ways.
There was, however, a serious power shortage last night, as neither reached much of anything, including first base. McGwire was hitless in four at-bats with three strikeouts, and Sosa went 0 for 5 with three whiffs as the Cubs won, 4-1.
Nonetheless, a conversation of McGwire, the redhead from the California suburbs, and Sosa, the Cubs right fielder from the Dominican Republic, interests others beyond the growing horde of reporters covering this story.
"Sammy doesn't speak great English," said Mark Grace, the Cubs' first baseman, "and I don't think Mark speaks great Spanish, so I'm not sure of the extent of their conversation. It just might be: 'Hi, Mac.' 'Hi, Sammy.' "
Ron Gant, the Cardinals' outfielder, said, "They probably talk about anything but the record. I think they hear enough about that."
When Sosa was asked, he said, "We say that we're going to retire together." Then he laughed, sticking, obviously, to the pact.
Sosa likes to say that he is pulling for McGwire to break the record, and for the Cubs to reach post-season play. "I'm not thinking about chasing nothing," he said. "Just get in the playoffs." But he admits to taking great pleasure in all the attention surrounding this home run business.
"It's like a gift to me," he said. He has spoken often about the mean circumstances in which he grew up in the little town of San Pedro de Macoris, where he shined shoes and picked oranges to help his widowed mother put food on the table. "I'm happy to go do my job and everyone go crazy. I love it. Oh, what a country!"
And he does keep an eye on the competition -- watching sports shows on television to keep abreast, like most fans, of the McGwire doings. "Sometimes I see that he is trying too hard to hit a home run," Sosa said. "Sometimes I wish he would relax more at the plate."
For his part, McGwire seeks to ease the pressure by saying that so much goes into breaking the record -- from staying healthy, to getting pitchers not to walk you -- that it may be beyond the hitter himself. "A real accomplishment is hitting 50 homers in a season," he said. "Only 16 players have ever done that."
Yes, yes, of course, but, Mark, if you did hit a 62d homer this season? And so the questions go.
"What would you do with the ball?" he was asked.
"Give it to the Hall of Fame," he said.
"And what would you pay for it?"
"In dollars? Nothing, but I would give bats, balls, a cap, a jockstrap, some underwear -- the usual." And a smile appeared within his red mustache and goatee.
As for hitting home runs, he said that no one really tries to hit homers. "You see the ball, you try to center it on the bat -- and you run around the bases," he said.
Sounds easy. Why more batters don't do it, then, is a kind of mystery.
After Sosa took batting practice before last night's game, he looked to the Cardinal side of the field, and saw the team doing stretching exercises. He made a beeline for McGwire, who was twisting on the ground. A phalanx of reporters and cameramen followed Sosa.
"Get away! Get away!" McGwire shouted, laughing. Then he got up, and he and Sosa hugged. And then they parted. It seemed that neither had time to whisper any kind of sweet nothing in the other's ear.
Watching nearby was Dan Radison, the Cubs' first-base coach, who has had the best opportunity to eavesdrop on Sosa and McGwire.
"I couldn't quite catch what they were saying," he said. "It can get noisy in the ball park."

HEADLINE: India Taps Into Its Diaspora;
Expatriates Buy Bonds for Love of Country, and 7.75% Interest

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
They were plied with platters of hot kebabs and glasses of Johnnie Walker and served platitudes about the prosperity of Indian immigrants in the United States. Then, the doctors, diamond merchants and sundry other deep-pocketed Indian-Americans who filled a room at the midtown Manhattan restaurant Shaan the other night were delivered a remarkably simple pitch: Make money. Help the motherland.
For the last couple of weeks, in an effort to raise at least $2 billion through a Government-guaranteed bond offering, officials of the State Bank of India have been making similar offers all over Indian New York. 
 They have invited small clutches of Indian-American doctors to the bank's Park Avenue offices. They have blitzed the local Indian media with advertisements ("You don't need to be a financial wizard," says one such ad. "You need to be an Indian.") and set up booths at shopping strips and at last Sunday's India Day Parade. They have even assembled movers and shakers from among New York's Indian immigrants -- whose numbers are estimated at about 200,000 -- under the watchful eyes of the gods at one of the largest Hindu temples in Queens.
The Indian Government has been trying for several years to raise foreign investment from its expatriates -- Non-Resident Indians, they are called, or less flatteringly in India, Never-Returning Indians. The latest effort, however, is its most ambitious. As Western aid begins to shrink in the aftermath of New Delhi's recent nuclear escapades, the Resurgent India Bonds, as they have been dubbed, represent an effort by India's Hindu nationalist Government to compensate by turning to the expatriates among whom it has long enjoyed considerable support.
In doing so, the Government is hoping to cash in on the patriotic fervor among its departed native sons and daughters -- sentiments that, for many, have only been intensified by the underground nuclear tests in May. But the investment plan it has created does not count on patriotism alone. Offered only to overseas Indians, the Resurgent India Bonds carry handsome returns and are guaranteed by the Government of India. They illustrate perfectly how the ties between immigrants and their homeland are exploited for mutual economic gains -- and how easily immigrant dollars that could be invested in this country are whisked away.
At the recent dinner meeting at Shaan, N. K. Puri, a State Bank of India official who had flown in from Bombay, put it this way: "People who have prospered here," he declared from the podium. "We should try to help the country come up."
The audience responded with hearty applause. But in the back of the banquet room, a prominent New York City doctor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, smiled knowingly. No amount of patriotic fervor, he said, could compete with the profitability of these five-year bonds. Their tax benefits are attractive, as is their 7.75 percent interest rate, 2 percentage points higher than comparable United States Treasury bonds. The doctor said he had invested what he called a small amount even though he does not support the nuclear test blasts; he called the tests "the dumbest thing."
"I'm Indian, I have all good wishes for India," he confided. "But I'm only doing it because it makes sense to me. They knew nobody would do this if it didn't make economic sense."
In some ways, this transaction resembles the remittances that immigrants from all over the world send to their families back home, often just a few dollars a week saved from their pay. The Resurgent India Bond offering, however, is a shrewd effort by the Indian Government to tap into the wealthiest corners of its diaspora. Investors must buy a minimum of $2,000; the average purchase at the State Bank of India's New York City branch is about $20,000.
The bank did not exactly help its cause when it failed to make applications available at its New York City branches during the first few days of the offering, which opened on Aug. 5. Even so, it succeeded in persuading Indians worldwide to kick in $2 billion in less than two weeks. Now, the bank is hoping for $3 billion by the time the offering ends Monday.
The idea of the Resurgent India Bonds emerged shortly after the Government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, or the B.J.P., detonated five underground nuclear bombs in a northern desert of Pokhran in May. With the tests, India proclaimed itself a nuclear nation. It also drew a heap of condemnation and economic sanctions from the United States and several other Western countries.
By no means did the blasts enjoy universal support among Indians in this country. Opponents demonstrated against nuclear buildup on the subcontinent and published protest advertisements in the Indian-American press. Supporters lobbied members of the United States Congress and pledged to help the homeland.
Indeed, the blasts at Pokhran seemed to offer a peculiar sense of vindication to some. A few days after the explosions, Arish Sahani, a Queens insurance salesman and a member of a group called the Overseas Friends of the B.J.P., said the testing had "boosted the morale of some of the Indians, which has been very low."
"It makes us feel very good."
Officials in New Delhi rallied citizens at home with patriotic music videos and turned, with arms outstretched across the oceans, to its sons and daughters abroad. A month after the blasts, a senior Indian Government official attended a dinner meeting sponsored by the Overseas Friends of the B.J.P. The official, Jaswant Singh, urged Indian-Americans to "stand up for India at this critical hour." Even a small "symbolic" financial contribution, Mr. Singh, the deputy chairman of India's planning commission, told them, would go a long way.
Early this month, just one day before the world marked the anniversary of the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, the Resurgent India Bonds went on sale. At the end of their five-year terms, they can be recouped entirely in dollars; bonds are also available in British pounds and German marks. The bonds can be purchased at local branches of the State Bank of India as well as at Citibank branches that offer Non-Resident Indian services. Government officials say the proceeds are to be used for the construction of roads, telephone lines and other infrastructure projects in India.
The bank has not secured the Securities and Exchange Commission's approval for the sale. Bank officials say they are not required to, and they have not registered the offering with the agency in Washington. Paul Dudek, the chief of the agency's office of international corporate finance, declined to comment on whether the S.E.C. would crack down on the bank, but described an offering of this magnitude as "rare."
Shortly after the offering was announced, Mukund Patel, a Staten Island surgeon, met with bank officials in Manhattan. He brought with him a small cadre of doctors, part of an alumni group from a medical school in his home state of Gujarat. If the numbers made sense, Dr. Patel said, members of their alumni group would invest more than $30 million. A larger doctors' group, the American Association of Physicians from India, would be prepared to pitch in $150 million.
Few among them, however, would be drawn by patriotism alone, Dr. Patel said. "There is a patriotic feeling, and there is a financial feeling," he explained. "People who are staunch B.J.P. supporters, they will readily do it. People who are not will also do it, because of the economic incentives."
Dr. Patel described himself as a little of both. He has belonged to the Overseas Friends of the B.J.P. since its inception in the early 1980's. He is a firm backer of India's nuclear arsenal, and he reminds doubters -- among them, his son, a high school student -- of India's wars with Pakistan. Since the test bombs, he has appealed to his Congressman to ease up on sanctions, and he speaks of doing his part to cushion the blow.
But when he talks about investing in the Resurgent India Bonds, it is the 7.75 percent interest rate he points to. A father of three who has lived in this country for 31 years, Dr. Patel says he is considering an investment, but only if bank officials offer more detailed assurances that his funds will be returned in dollars, not in Indian rupees. So far, he said, the numbers look promising, especially after the recent downturn in the stock market. "This seems to be a reasonable alternative," he said.
A survey by a weekly Indian newsmagazine, India Today, echoed his sentiments. When asked why they would invest in India, 27 percent of the magazine's overseas Indians surveyed said they would do it out of patriotism; 17 percent said they would if it were "a good deal," and 55 percent said both.

HEADLINE: Can the President, and Country, Now Move On?;
Blinded by Prosperity

 BODY:

To the Editor:
What saddens me most about the Clinton mess and the public's reaction is what it reveals about the state of our national values (front page, Aug. 18). The American people have allowed themselves to be blinded by their infatuation with their own economic well-being. 
 To the comfort of economic prosperity (dubiously attributed to President Clinton) they have subjugated the higher moral values that form the bedrock upon which the country was founded. If the economic situation were any different, the American public would rightly be screaming for Mr. Clinton's head. They should set aside what may be "good for me" and instead consider what is simply good.

HEADLINE: A Different Breed Of Freight-Hoppers

BYLINE: By PAMELA LICALZI O'CONNELL 

 BODY:
REAL hobos don't use cellular phones.
Recreational hobos, however, are an increasingly wired breed. Once, Depression-era tramps scratched symbols on train trestles to pass information to others looking for an empty boxcar and a free ride. Now so-called yuppie hobos -- who sneak onto freight trains for adventure rather than out of economic necessity -- use scanners to monitor railroad frequencies and cellular phones to talk with other hobos. They also trade information via more than two dozen Web sites, as well as E-mail discussion lists and newsgroups. 
 "Those of us fortunate enough to have modems use our public and secret hobo communities on the Net to keep in touch, share rail information" and complain "that the railroads are getting too tough on us innocent rail riders," Todd Waters, 50, a recreational hopper, said by E-mail.
Mr. Waters, who once rode the rails full time in his youth, theorizes that the appeal of freight-hopping is due to what he calls "the drift: "For me, the drift occurs when I migrate from the linear world, neat with its processes and models, to the road, where everything happens at once. You've got a general direction, but it doesn't have much glue on it. The plan has equal weight to every new distraction that comes along."
Recreational hobos train-hop in part to pay homage to an ideal of hobo freedom and self-reliance that experts say belies historical reality. Yet, their stories of hopping can have a romantic appeal and an infectious enthusiasm, as evidenced by those found on the Train Hopping Space, at catalog. com/hop/, and other sites.
Hans-Christoph Steiner of Manhattan posts photos of his hops on his personal Web site (yagaland.razorfish.com/hoboFrame. html) and takes part in a recreational hobo mailing list. "The idea always intrigued me," he said of train-hopping. "I liked the image of a hobo: a self-sufficient wanderer who doesn't burden others."
Mr. Steiner said he was hooked after his first hop with some college friends from Portland, Ore., to Seattle: "Even though we spent 10 hours waiting for the train in two different yards, the trip was well worth it," he wrote in an E-mail. "We came upon the Puget Sound -- the tracks were right on the coast -- and we watched the sunset while sitting on top of a double-stacked container car traveling through the forest."
But the on-line activities of recreational freight-hoppers -- whose hobby is illegal and dangerous, as a disclaimer on Mr. Steiner's page states -- has also drawn the ire of rail-safety groups, known as "rail fans" who fear a crackdown on legal access by all train hobbyists, and the railroads themselves. Some Web sites now offer a contrary view of hopping. One such site, www.deadtrainbums.com, contains gruesome photographs of what are said to be hoppers caught beneath the rails, and links to news articles about injuries and deaths related to railroad trespassing.
In 1997 deaths caused by trespassing in railyards and on railcars (not including suicides) increased 15 percent over 1996, according to the Federal Railroad Administration. While the statistics don't reveal how many of those deaths involved hobos, some believe there is a link between the availability of on-line information about hopping and the rise in trespassing. In testimony before the House subcommittee on railroads in April, Gerri Hall, president of Operation Lifesaver, a rail-safety group, said: "Effective action needs to be taken to discourage the promotion of romanticized images of dangerous railroad trespassing activities. We need to find a way to put a damper on Web sites that encourage unsuspecting young people to engage in illegal and dangerous activities on railroad property."
Sarah George, a filmmaker completing a short documentary called "Hobo Jungles," said she had heard estimates from 10,000 to 100,000 regular freight-hoppers. "But my guess is there are probably a couple thousand really hard-core riders and maybe as many as 20,000 who ride the rails occasionally," she said.
Of those, she said, the largest general groups are true tramps (mostly men from 30 to 50 years old who are indigent) followed by "punks" (youths rebelling against society). She takes a dim view of purely recreational hobos.
Ms. George's own Web site drew an angry response from the freight railroads, she said, because they feared the film would glamorize hopping. Railyard personnel were told to be on the lookout for her cameras, she said, and she took down all but a brief description of the film from the site (www.worthyent.com/).
Mike Furtney, Union Pacific Railroad's director of public relations for the Western region, says that with just 250 special agents to police 35,000 miles of track, Union Pacific has started keeping at least a casual eye on hobo sites. This monitoring results in "a small, incremental amount of intelligence for our agents," he says. And railroad employees have been known to post personal messages on newsgroups to counter the hobos' information.
Perhaps the most well-known recreational hobo is a man known only as North Bank Fred , a middle-aged construction worker who is determined to preserve his anonymity and who collects photos of modern-day "monikers," hoppers' painted or scrawled symbols (www.snowcrest.net/bndlstif/ index.html). He recently removed an extensive collection of hopper anecdotes from his page, citing "the prying eyes of the railroads."
Via E-mail, North Bank Fred said "the Internet is the perfect way for me to get my 'information' out to people who can benefit from it," who he said were "Net-savvy would-be (or current) train riders or established riders."
"Attention from such a broad-based audience as newspaper readers can only do harm to freight-hopping -- it has in the past and I'm sure it will happen again."
Bill Mellman, another recreational hopper, has become even more ambivalent about his Net presence. Although a frequently-asked-questions document he wrote several years ago on hopping continues to be linked to widely (php.indiana.edu/ mellman/trfaq.txt), he now requires a password to view his main hobo page.
Mr. Mellman says he threw a roadblock in front of his site not because of surveillance but because "I just started to get worried that I could end up being responsible for some kid getting his legs cut off."

HEADLINE: HDTV: High Definition, High in Price

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY 

 BODY:
AFTER more than a decade of research and political debate, most of the world's consumer-electronics manufacturers have announced their plans and prices for the new high-definition television sets that go on sale in September. And talk about sticker shock: the least expensive ones will cost $8,000.
Early last year, when manufacturers were lobbying the Federal Communications Commission to pass the digital-television rules, several major companies, including Thomson and Zenith, said the first high-definition sets would cost $1,000 to $1,500 more than conventional high-end projection sets. That estimate would have placed even the most expensive high-definition models at $4,000 and $5,000. So what happened? 
 Manufacturers say some of the components used to build these sets cost more than they had anticipated. "The cost of the display has grown exponentially," said James Meyer, head of Thomson Multimedia's American operation. Thomson, a French company that makes RCA, GE and Proscan models, is the largest manufacturer of televisions in the United States.
While Mr. Meyer cited the display component, some people in the industry said that high-resolution video displays -- the optical components that produce a picture -- have been manufactured for years. "It's a mature technology, fairly well known and understood from a science and engineering standpoint," said Robert Perry, director of marketing for Mitsubishi Consumer Electronics.
But Ed Milbourn, a senior Thomson executive, said his company had not been fully aware of the premium it would have to pay for the high-definition optics used in mass-market televisions. Until now, this equipment was used only in high-end projection TV's that cost $20,000 or more.
"We'd never made a high-definition optical system before," Mr. Milbourn said.
"It was really difficult to get an accurate estimate early on," said John Taylor, a spokesman for Zenith, discussing the price.
The retail price of an HDTV set is also driven by other issues. For instance, Thomson and the other manufacturers all say they do not expect to make or sell large numbers of these extraordinarily pricey television sets. "I think we'll see a flurry of activity and interest this fall, but not much volume," Mr. Meyer said.
Despite the high price, and despite the fact that most of these televisions will be huge rear projectors that will dominate almost any room in which they are placed, retailers say they expect to sell as many as the industry can make.
This may not say a lot, since set makers don't intend to manufacture very many -- probably no more than 100,000 this year. But Americans already buy nearly one million conventional projection televisions a year, including tens of thousands that sell for $5,000 to $50,000.
And when the first high-definition monitor made by a mass-market manufacturer, Panasonic, went on sale Aug. 6 in two stores on the West Coast, one of the stores, Dow Stereo/Video in San Diego, reported that 15,000 people trooped through to see the set over the first weekend.
Dow quickly sold out its first order -- reported by industry journals to be 30 units. And on Tuesday, Thomas Campbell, an executive with Dow, reported that 18 more people had placed orders for the monitor, with full payment in advance. The list price for the monitor is $6,000, though Dow is selling it for $5,500.
But to receive high-definition programming when digital broadcasting begins in the fall, owners of these monitors will also have to buy a digital tuner box. Panasonic's goes on sale in October for $1,700, bringing the total list price to $7,700.
The television industry sells nearly 25 million sets a year, so the sale of a few HDTV's is barely consequential. In fact, the low volume contributes to the pricing problem.
Or, as Mark Knox, a senior manager for Samsung Electronics Company, put it, "the costs are extraordinarily high because the volume is so small."
Samsung's first HDTV, a 55-inch rear projection model, will go on sale in November with a $7,999 price tag.
Mr. Knox and others also pointed to another reason for the high price of a set. They said it was important for the industry to show the best products they could at the start, no matter the cost, so consumers who see HDTV for the first time would be impressed.
"Some of these sets are intentionally overbuilt because it is critical that we make the right impression with the consumer at this point," Mr. Knox said.
As a result, these first sets are loaded -- like a car that comes with a power sunroof, leather-wrapped steering wheel, heated seats and a global positioning system. The TV's have fancy multichannel audio systems, digital processors that upgrade the quality of conventional television images and every other bell and whistle normally built into high-end television sets. That's one reason Thomson's first set will cost $8,000 and Zenith's $10,000.
Still, all of the manufacturers swear that the prices will fall -- and fast. This isn't of concern just to them. Television stations that begin digital broadcasting, starting on Nov. 1, are spending millions to make the transition. The money is wasted, they say, as long as the TV sets required to receive digital signals are so expensive that almost nobody has one.
And the Federal Government is eager to speed the transition to digital broadcasting. Every one of the nation's 1,600 television stations has been lent a second channel for digital broadcasts. When the transition is complete, when most everyone has a digital television set, the old channels -- the ones on the air today -- are to be taken back and auctioned for other uses.
The proceeds from those future auctions, estimated now at $6 billion, are already being counted in Federal budget projections. But no one believes the bulk of the population will embrace digital television until prices for the sets fall by 90 percent or more.
Todd Thibodeaux, a senior economist with the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association, collects and analyzes sales data for all sorts of consumer electronics products, including televisions. And he said the industry's record showed that prices for new products generally fall by about 50 percent after a decade. VCR's, for example, cost an average of $1,955 in 1974, when they were first introduced, adjusting the numbers for inflation. It took until 1983 for the average price to fall to half of that.
By that calculation, the least expensive high-definition televisions will still cost nearly $4,000 in 2007 -- hardly encouraging to sellers and consumers alike. But manufacturers say such a comparison is flawed.
A year or two from now, many manufacturers, including Thomson, will begin offering several more models. Some will provide a full high-definition picture without all of the expensive extra features. By then, the integrated circuits needed to translate and display the digital signal, now a rarefied and expensive piece of circuitry, will almost certainly have dropped in price considerably.
Today the chips alone contribute $2,000 or more to the retail cost of an HDTV. But these chips should respond to Moore's Law, the computer-industry guideline that says a microprocessor's capability will double, and the price halve, every 18 months.
Given the universal appeal of televisions -- far greater than that of computers -- Mr. Perry, the Mitsubishi executive, said he believed the cost of the microprocessors will drop by 50 percent each year for the next three.
Mr. Knox said an HDTV will probably sell for $3,000 by 2002. Mr. Milbourn said he believed his company would sell an HDTV for half the current price by the time the second-generation models come out in a year or two. Mr. Perry said "they'll cost $3,500 a couple of years from now."
That's certainly better than $8,000, but still out of the reach of most television buyers, who now pay $500 or less on average for a new set. In fact, Mr. Thibodeaux's research shows that consumer electronics products reach true mass acceptance only after the price falls below $500.
And how long before the industry is able to sell a high-definition television set for $499.95? Within the industry, that question generally is greeted with heavy sighs and pessimistic shakes of the head. No one is willing to even guess.
 
What You Should Know
 
 The introduction of high-definition television will bring changes for TV viewers. Here are the answers to some questions about those changes:
 
Q. When will the first high-definition televisions go on sale?
 
A. Several manufacturers have pledged to put their first models on the market next month, and others will come through the fall and winter. By January or February 1999, almost all major consumer-electronics manufacturers should have sets for sale.
Several companies already sell high-definition monitors. They have been available for years from high-end manufacturers. Panasonic put a new one on the market early this month, the first from a mass-market manufacturer. These sets are capable of displaying a digital, high-definition picture but need a new, digital tuner to receive the signal. The first of these tuners will go on sale this fall.
 
Q. If I buy an HDTV set, how much high-definition programming will I see?
 
A. Residents of the nation's 10 largest cities will be able to watch a small sampling of high-definition programming on 24 network-owned television stations starting no later than Nov. 1.
Under an agreement with the Federal Government, the stations have promised to begin digital broadcasting by that date, but they are not required to broadcast in high-definition. Most have promised to show only a few hours of high-definition programming, principally movies.
By next spring, every network-affiliated television station in the 10 largest cities will be required to begin digital broadcasting. And by Nov. 1, 1999, all of the network-owned and -affiliated stations in the 30 largest cities must go on the air. The rest will begin over the following three years.
In addition, DirecTV, the nation's largest direct-broadcast satellite service, has promised to broadcast two channels of HDTV starting early next year. Unity Motion, a start-up, direct-broadcast satellite company, plans to begin airing two channels of HDTV by Sept. 30.
HBO and a couple of other cable channels plan to begin broadcasting some HDTV early next year. But in the early days, at least, there will be no way to receive any high-definition programming transmitted by cable. The technology for that has not been finalized.
 
Q. Do I have to buy a new TV? Will the conventional TV's I have now stop working?
 
A. Maybe one day, but not for a long time. Every one of the nation's 1,600 television stations has been lent a second channel for digital broadcasts. All of the TV stations that are on the air now will continue broadcasting in their regular places, and the new digital programming will appear on the second, digital channel. (Channel 4 in one city, as an example, might also broadcast on channel 54.)
But after a period of years, the Government wants to take one of these channels back, leaving only the digital channels on the air. The present rule says the old channels will go off the air in 2006 -- unless fewer than 85 percent of the viewers in each city have digital TV's by then. No one really believes that target date will be met.
Both the old and new channels will probably remain on the air for many years. In fact, given the politics of this transition, broadcasters are unlikely to give up their old channels until they are ready. Even then, anyone still using a conventional set will be able to buy an inexpensive converter box that will translate the digital signals for display on the old sets.
 
Q. When I get an HDTV set, will I still be able to watch all my old videotapes -- movies and the recordings I made with my video camera?
 
A. Yes. In the beginning and probably for a long time, digital-television sets will also include a conventional analog tuner. That means you will be able to watch digital programming on the digital channels, analog programming on the original channels -- and all of the videotapes, Laserdiscs, DVD's and everything else you have collected over the years.
 
Q. Is digital, high-definition television better than what we have today? Why?
A. HDTV offers more than twice the resolution of today's television. At its highest level, a high-definition signal holds 1,080 horizontal lines and 1,920 vertical lines, compared with 480 by 704 lines for today's television.
Properly displayed, these images are so sharp, so clear, that for many people the improvement changes the way they relate to television. Often, first-time viewers say they have the impression they are gazing through a window rather than looking at a picture.
But at least as important is the nature of the transmissions. The new system is digital, so televisions can become interactive and carry all kinds of information and data -- not just video and audio signals. JOEL BRINKLEY

Chart: "Clarity, at a Price"
Here's a closer look at the differences between the traditional TV format and the more advanced high-definition television, which can deliver a sharper picture with more and smaller picture elements (pixels).
 
HIGH-DEFINITION TELEVISION
Magnified view showing a small portion of a TV screen.
HDTV screen has a maximum of 2,073,600 pixels and 16:9 aspect ratio. (Ratio of width to height)
 
TRADITIONAL TELEVISION
Magnified view showing a small portion of a TV screen.
Traditional TV screen has a maximum of 337,920 pixels and 4:3 aspect ratio. (Ratio of width to height)
 
The first HDTV's -- to buy or not to buy?
 
PROS
Bright, crystal-clear pictures that make television images seem almost real.
Six-channel, digital surround-sound, for people with properly equipped audio systems.
A new wide television screen, shaped like a movie screen.
Digital transmission of the TV signal means the pictures will be totally free of interference.
Digital television signals can also be used to send E-mail, Web pages, computer software and interactive programming.
 
CONS
The first high-definition sets will sell for $8,000 or more. The price probably won't fall below $1,000 for another five or six years.
Most of the sets are huge rear projectors, nearly as large as a Volkswagen Beetle.
None will be able to receive high-definition programming carried by cable; the specifications for the special cable needed to carry the digital signal from the cable box to the television have not been completed.
All television programming filmed or taped in the last 50 years was shot for today's square-screen television sets. On the new wide-screen HDTV's, these programs will be shown in a vertical "letterbox," with broad gray bands on the left and right of the screen. (pg. G8)

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Endthe Day Unchanged

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices were unchanged yesterday, with the dollar continuing to slide against the yen. This was attributed to talk of possible intervention by the Japanese to aid the yen. Also, a report of stronger-than-expected housing starts gave investors little incentive to buy bonds with yields near record lows.
Traders also said that recent strength in the stock market had drawn capital away from the government securities market, with the shorter maturities outperforming the longer-term issues. 
 The price of the 30-year bond was unchanged at 99 7/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was also unchanged at 5.55 percent.
The Government's report on housing starts in July, said Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, suggests that construction starts are back to the levels recorded during the housing boom of the 1980's. Housing starts increased by 5.7 percent last month, to an annual rate of 1.72 million units, the highest level since March 1987.
The low interest rates that have produced strong housing construction may also help offset the economic slowdown caused by the Asian financial crisis.
Bonds did manage to ward off some of the day's weakness when the Federal Reserve bought $1.023 billion in notes and bonds.
Elsewhere, the Treasury announced it planned to sell $15 billion of two-year notes next Wednesday. In when-issued trading ahead of the auction, dealers were offering the notes at a price to yield 5.31 percent.

HEADLINE: 2 Chip Makers Warn of Profit Shortfalls

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Two computer chip makers said today that they expected sharply lower quarterly results because of Asia's economic crisis, and a third said its quarterly net earnings fell 81 percent.
The warnings from LSI Logic and National Semiconductor, coupled with the results from Analog Devices Inc., suggested that any talk of a recovery in the chip manufacturing industry might be premature. Chip companies are finding that they are much more vulnerable to Asia's problems than they had thought. 
 "When something like Asia happens, it doesn't really matter how good your products are or how well managed your company is, you're going to feel it," said Drew Peck, an analyst with SG Cowen & Company.
LSI, based in Milpitas, Calif., specializes in custom semiconductors and so-called system-on-a-chip devices used in products ranging from networking equipment to video game players. Analog Devices, of Norwood, Mass., makes chips that combine analog and digital signals, which are commonly used in cellular telephones, modems and small appliances. National Semiconductor, based in Santa Clara, Calif., straddles the two other companies' chip lines.
LSI and Analog both attributed their revenue and earnings situations largely to Asia. National Semiconductor cited weakness in overall semiconductor demand, but has singled out the Asian crisis before.
Shares of LSI Logic closed today at $15.8125, down $2.4375, or 13 percent, while shares in Analog Devices dropped $2.75, or 11 percent, to $21.50, both on the New York Stock Exchange. National made its announcement after the market closed; its shares finished down 56.25 cents, at $13.625, also on the Big Board.
LSI's announcement was its second in a month warning investors about financial results. While Analog Devices had warned of a weak quarter, its results came in below most analysts' revised estimates. National has disappointed analysts the last two quarters.
LSI's earlier guidance had been to expect flat revenue and earnings per share in the third quarter. But it said today that unexpectedly low orders in the first six weeks of the third quarter would result in a 5 percent to 10 percent decline in revenue and that earnings per share would be in the "low-to-mid teens." Analysts had expected 23 cents a share.
"The slowdown of the global semiconductor industry is now completing its third year, which is the longest slow period experienced in this industry," Wilfred J. Corrigan, LSI Logic's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement."We expect supply and demand to come together in the next 12 months."
Analog Devices said revenue from its analog integrated circuits had declined for the first time in recent memory.
For the quarter that ended on Aug. 1, Analog earned $8.8 million, or 6 cents a diluted share, compared with $46 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier. Third-quarter 1998 earnings include a $17 million restructuring charge and a $3.6 million equity loss, equivalent to 9 cents a share. Revenue dropped 7 percent, to $294.9 million from $318.1 million.
Analysts had expected Analog Devices to report earnings of 19 cents a share, excluding the charges.
"We are part of an industry that began 1998 with an expectation of 15 percent year-over-year revenue growth, only to see that expectation reduced every month since then," Jerald G. Fishman, Analog's president and chief executive, said in a statement. "Currently, the industry expects to finish 1998 down 10 percent from the previous year." He said the company still expected to grow 5 percent this year.
Because that expectation is far below original estimates of 20 percent growth, Analog has started cutting its work force by 5 percent, resulting in the restructuring charge. It is also planning a series of factory shutdowns during the fourth quarter.
National said sales and earnings for its fiscal first quarter, which will end on Aug. 30, and second quarter, ending on Nov. 29, might fall below the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, which ended in May. Excluding one-time charges, National had a loss of $69.3 million on sales of $510 million in that quarter. The company said it now expected sales for the first quarter to drop 8 to 10 percent, with a resulting larger loss.
"Outside of a very narrow area, semiconductor demand remains very depressed and at this time there are no data points to suggest that will change this year," Mr. Peck of Cowen said. "These companies are fairly good representatives of what is going on in the industry as a whole, and that's not anything good right now."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place -- Trimming Stock Options' Sails;
Accounting Proposal Would Lift the Cost of Repricing

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
It's happened recently at Netscape Communications, Apple Computer, Bay Networks, Oracle, Best Buy and Oxford Health Plans, among others. The company's stock plunges, and its board immediately acts to reduce the price at which employees can buy shares through the stock option program. A new, lower exercise price, the company argues, keeps workers from abandoning ship to a competitor. In a tight labor market, anything that keeps employees happy is crucial.
But as more companies choose to reprice their option plans, criticism of the practice grows increasingly vocal. Shareholder activist groups say option repricings are inherently unfair. Why should one set of shareholders be able to reduce the cost of getting into the stock while others cannot? 
 Now, a tentative decision reached by the Financial Accounting Standards Board last week may be the beginning of the end of repricings. "If the decision stands, it would more than likely end repricings as we know them," said Robert Willens, partner in tax and accounting at Lehman Brothers in New York.
In a unanimous decision on Aug. 12, the board took the first step toward forcing companies that reprice options to consider as an operating expense the difference between the new lower price and any subsequent increase in the share price. The board did not act to quash the repricing tactic. It simply moved to make the practice too expensive for many companies to stomach.
Even though stock options could easily be considered an employee expense like a salary or bonus, under current accounting rules, companies issuing option grants are not required to consider the cost of issuing them as a business expense. Instead, according to Statement 123, companies simply must flag, in footnotes to the financial statements, the effect that stock options would have had on their earnings had they been recognized as a compensation expense.
Last week's decision came as the accounting board set about to clear up a continuing cloud over how companies account for stock issued to employees. Given the increasing devotion to stock options by American companies, and the heavy toll that expensing repriced options could take on corporate earnings, the accounting decision is certain to be challenged.
"Compensation consultants are apoplectic," said Patrick McGurn, director of corporate programs at Institutional Shareholders Services in Bethesda, Md., a shareholder advocacy group. "They're going to try to gin up some opposition pretty quickly, especially in Silicon Valley. It's something they're likely to get pretty exercised about."
Indeed, the money at issue makes the accounting move plenty compelling. Consider what expensing the cost of its repriced options would mean to Netscape, which in January reduced the price on an 8.6-million-share option grant to workers, but not to top executives. The shares -- repriced at $16.8125 from a variety of undisclosed, but higher, prices -- fetched $30.875 at yesterday's close.
The difference between those prices multiplied by the 8.6 million shares comes to about $121 million. If this were a business expense, as the accounting board has tentatively concluded, it would be among Netscape's largest. Research and development at the company totaled $130 million last year. To put it in even greater perspective, $121 million is equal to almost 27 percent of the company's gross profit in 1997.
Why did Netscape reprice so many shares? "We did it because we'd like to attract and retain employees," said Chris Holton, a Netscape spokeswoman. "We had a lot of employees that were under water, and we felt it would be a big benefit for all employees to reprice the stock. Our employees are very happy with where the stock is today." Outsiders who paid more than $50 a share for Netscape last year are undoubtedly not so happy.
Of course, if the shares had fallen after the repricing, the company would receive a credit, instead of an expense, the accounting board has concluded. If the stock price were unchanged, there would be no financial consequences. The company would report the charge or the credit every quarter.
Because option repricing usually follows a precipitous decline in a company's share price, the practice will probably become even more prevalent after the market swoon this summer. Matt Ward, chief executive of WestWard Pay Strategies, a compensation consulting firm, said that he had counted 30 or so companies that had repriced their option grants so far this year. That is roughly equal to the total that repriced their option grants in all of 1997, by his count.
Mr. Ward's numbers are by no means comprehensive. Companies that choose to reprice option grants do not usually publicize the decision. Information about option repricings is typically buried in financial statements and found by only the most vigilant investors.
Shareholder advocacy groups like Mr. McGurn's are among the few who see the escalation in option repricing and deplore the trend. These groups find repricings inherently unfair since the practice allows some shareholders -- employees, in this case -- to get their stock at much diminished prices while outside shareholders do not. This is particularly troubling when a stock rebounds quickly after an option program has been repriced, rewarding management and employees, while other shareholders simply get back to even.
"Clearly, it is a major concern for investors, if not the No. 1 concern," Mr. McGurn said. "The real fear is that all participants in the plan do is profit from volatility in the stock." Mr. McGurn reports that he has had more phone calls regarding stock option repricings in the last two weeks than he had received in the last 12 months.
A second reason to object to option repricings is that they can carry a substantial but largely imperceptible cost to shareholders. That cost comes in the dilution that large option programs bring to existing shareholders' stakes. According to Pearl Meyer & Partners, a compensation consulting firm in New York, shares authorized for management and employee equity incentive plans at the 200 largest United States companies almost doubled in the last eight years. Last year, the options in these plans amounted to 13.2 percent of the weighted average of shares outstanding at these companies. As additional shares covered by options programs are added to the whole, existing shareholders' stakes are worth less.
Of course, any option plan dilutes existing shareholders' stakes. But option plans that are repriced add insult to injury by letting insiders take advantage of a plummeting stock to increase their potential profits.
Why did accounting rule makers single out repriced options as a cost to the income statement? The decision goes back to a 1972 accounting rule that distinguished between fixed option plans and so-called variable plans. Known as APB Opinion 25, it stated that while fixed option plans did not need to be considered a business expense, variable plans did. In the accounting board's opinion, applying a new price to an option grant program automatically makes it a variable plan.
"This is consistent with the basic logic of APB 25," said Tim Lucas, director of research and technical activities at the accounting board in Norwalk, Conn. "The measurement is the known number of shares and known price. Once you change it, there's some variability involved."
Mr. Lucas went on to explain that although the board's conclusion on this matter was unanimous, it was a first step. The board hopes to finish a so-called exposure draft on this and related matters by the end of the year, after which it will ask for public comment on the decision. "We'll receive letters, we'll review them. Perhaps we'll have a public hearing," he said. After deliberating again, the board would then issue a final statement. When would the proposal become effective? Mr. Lucas said, "If all goes according to plan, it is unlikely before Jan. 1, 2000."
Mr. Lucas does not expect a bruising battle over the proposal. "I expect some people would prefer another answer," he said. "We'll hear from them. That's what the comment period is all about."
Others expect corporate America to fight the proposal hard. "I think the reaction will be harsh," Mr. Willens said. "They will argue that repricing options is an important tool. To take away their ability to readjust their sights based on market performance undermines their ability to compete."
But any debate is unlikely to be as bloody as what the accounting board endured several years ago when it considered making companies expense all stock option programs. Then, companies blasted the proposal, claiming that having to expense stock option costs would be so detrimental to American business as to make it uncompetitive. The very existence of the accounting board was threatened.
For this reason, the board is careful to point out that it is simply interpreting what is already on the books about repriced options. Mr. Willens said: "F.A.S.B. will be able to make a principled argument: 'Look, you wanted us to adhere to original accounting in this. You urged us to retain that literature as a guide for option accounting. And that very document that you embrace requires us to treat repricing in this manner.' It's a reasonably hard argument to refute."
Still, Mr. Willens says the language in the existing rule is not ironclad. And even if the rule makers effectively shut down the repricing practice, corporate America is sure to work overtime to find other ways to compensate employees.
Shareholder groups like Mr. McGurn's are not waiting for the accounting board to act. They are making their own waves about the repricing practice. Mr. McGurn's company advises 500 large institutional shareholders on how to vote on issues like executive compensation and stock option plans. He said he was going to begin to add the cost of option repricings into a formula that he uses to decide whether a company operates in a shareholder-friendly manner.
Mr. McGurn also would like to see a cooling-off period between the time a share price declines and the company chooses to reprice its options. "All too often the board's reaction has become knee-jerk," he said. "As soon as its stock price drops, there's immediate discussion of repricing."
Matt Ward at WestWard Pay Strategies advises his clients considering an option repricing to follow several fairness guidelines, beginning with prior shareholder approval. "My view on repricing is it should never be afforded to top management and never on a one-for-one basis," Mr. Ward said. "There should always be an economic trade-off, so a repricing should always involve fewer shares." He thinks a repricing should also involve a change in the vesting rules. For example, if an employee were halfway vested in a four-year program, a fairer repricing might extend the vesting by another year.
"All those tweakings have been lessons learned from repricings gone bad," Mr. Ward said.

GRAPHIC: Photo/Chart: "A Fading Advantage?"
Outsiders -- buy stock at the market price and have no recourse if the stock price falls drastically.
Company insiders, -- both executives and regular workers, often receive options to buy shares at a discounted price, constituting a head start.
Accounting rule makers -- may force companies that lower the price of options after the stock plunges to account for them as an expense, dimming the appeal of repriced options.
 
Graph: "How It Would Work"
A change in corporate accounting for stock options may be required in future years. The change would not be retroactive. For an example of how it might affect corporate earnings, consider the experience of Netscape, which earlier this year lowered the price of a large block of stock options granted employees. If the change had been in place, the difference between the repriced options and the actual stock price at the end of the quarter would be an expense for the company.
 
YESTERDAY
If the stock ended the quarter at yesterday's price of $30.875 the company would have a $121 million operating expense, equivalent to 27 percent of last year's gross profits.

Kohlberg Kravis to Acquire Paint Company in Germany

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company said yesterday that it would buy Herberts, a German paint company, for $1.7 billion in a deal that represents the American buyout firm's growing ardor for buying, revamping and selling companies in Europe the way it has at home since the mid-1980's.
Kohlberg Kravis will join with Herberts managers to acquire all of the company from Hoechst A.G., the German conglomerate, which is seeking to shed some holdings that do not complement its core drug operations. Herberts ranks as Europe's largest supplier of paints, with annual sales of $1.5 billion and 7,500 workers. 
 European investors, especially in Britain, have long used private capital to buy companies. But the large-scale leveraged buyout is much rarer there than in the United States. In such transactions, private financiers use borrowed funds to take control of a company, including some that are publicly traded, with the idea of remaking its operations and selling it off again.
Kohlberg Kravis and other leading United States buyout firms, including Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, have all recently stepped up their presence in Europe. Industry specialists say they hope that Europe will prove to be fertile ground for American-style finance-driven reorganizations. Such opportunities in theory will arise more as companies there go through the painful adjustment to global competition that United States companies went through in the late 1980's and early 1990's.
"We have invested a lot of time and know-how in Europe," said Scott Stuart, a Kohlberg Kravis general partner. "We feel that the market is finally breaking the way we wish it had a long time ago."
Indeed, after more than a decade of sniffing around for deals in Europe, Kohlberg Kravis has announced several successful buyouts recently. Last month the New York-based firm announced that it would buy the British-based insurance broker Willis Corroon Group, a deal valued at $1.5 billion. Kohlberg Kravis officials said the Willis purchase is the first leveraged buyout of a publicly owned European company.
Kohlberg Kravis previously bought Newsquest, a British regional newspaper publisher, and Rhine Re, a Swiss reinsurance company.
European conglomerates that once branched out into many different areas are increasingly streamlining operations and selling parts that do not make strategic sense. That pries open the once-cloistered market, buyout specialists say.
"European economies are about where the U.S. was in the mid-70's," said Jack D. Furst, a partner in Dallas-based Hicks, Muse. "Conglomerates need to focus on core niches. That creates wonderful opportunities for new capital to enter the market."
Hicks, Muse made its first stand-alone acquisition in Europe just last week, agreeing to buy Glass's Group, a closely held British automobile information company, for $205 million.
The European deals come at a time when the United States market has become less friendly to buyout firms. Company stock market valuations are near record highs and easy revampings are past news.
Some buyout firms have become accustomed to earning returns of 30 percent for their investors annually, attracting record sums of investment capital. But now, more funds are chasing fewer deals. For big buyout deals -- those valued at $500 million or more -- firms on average paid seven times earnings in 1994. So far this year they are paying closer to 8.5 times earnings, according to Portfolio Management Data.
"It's hard to make straight buyout deals in the U.S. these days," said Josh Kosman, associate editor of Buyout Newsletter, an industry journal. "You pay too much for the company to make it work." He added that the average European buyout is done for a much lower price, relative to earnings, though figures for transactions there were not available.

HEADLINE: Air Alliance at Risk

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Is the grand alliance between United Airlines and Delta Air Lines dead? Delta's pilots union, which has the power to veto the most critical part of the link with United, said yesterday that Delta's decision not to give the union a voting seat on its board effectively ended the alliance.
"We told them that we are ceasing our consideration of the alliance and that is what we have done," said Karen McGuffey, a spokeswoman for the Air Line Pilots Association. "It's over." 
 But Delta apparently is not getting the message. "We hope that ALPA will go forward with its consideration of the alliance," Kay Horner, a Delta spokeswoman, said.
The contradictory statements go beyond the all-too-common miscommunication between labor and management to disclose the weak foundations of the three alliances that have swept up the six largest domestic airlines this year. The announcement by Northwest Airlines in January that it was buying a controlling stake in Continental Airlines set off a mad scramble among the other major airlines. Fearing that a Northwest-Continental combination would attract their passengers, United and Delta formed an alliance, while American Airlines, a unit of the AMR Corporation, joined with U S Airways Group.
Each pair of airlines agreed to combine frequent-flier programs, but Northwest and Continental and United and Delta also said they would code-share, or sell seats on each other's flights. United and Delta say that their alliance will bring them $600 million in additional revenue every year. But that assumes that the other airlines do not go ahead with their alliances. If all three deals are carried out, the competitive landscape remains unchanged. "It's a zero-sum game," said Kevin C. Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.
The Northwest-Continental deal is now in limbo, awaiting approval from the antitrust division of the Justice Department. A decision is not expected until next month at the earliest, analysts said. Until then, the pressure on United and Delta is off.
"If Northwest and Continental begin code-sharing, that will put pressure on Delta to find a new avenue to approach the pilots," said Samuel C. Buttrick, an analyst at Paine Webber in New York. "Right now there is no urgency."
Indeed, when Delta announced its decision on Monday, seemingly scuttling the alliance, shares of both Delta and United rose. Mr. Murphy said that investors have not even factored the alliances into their buying decisions. "People know that the announcement by Northwest and Continental is not a sure thing," he said.
The pilots at both Delta and United have clauses in their contracts giving them the right to veto code-share agreements. But United's pilots also have a full seat on the airline's board, while Delta's pilots have only a nonvoting representative.
The Delta pilots held up the announcement of the alliance in April when they insisted on full board representation. The deal only went ahead after the union agreed to give Delta management until Sept. 30 to persuade the company's board to give them a vote. But on Monday, Delta's chief executive, Leo F. Mullin, said that the board had rejected the idea because "an independent board best serves Delta and its constituents."
The airline said that it would go ahead with its plans to combine its frequent-flier program with United's beginning Sept. 1, a move that does not require pilot approval.
Some analysts believe that the pilots will have little choice but to bend if the other alliances are poised to siphon off Delta passengers, reducing their flying opportunities.
So is the alliance over? As Mr. Buttrick of Paine Webber, put it, "It's over until it begins again."

HEADLINE: A Black Cat in a Dark Room

BYLINE: By Nizar Hamdoon; Nizar Hamdoon is Iraq's permanent representative to the United Nations.

 BODY:
Much has been said and published about the current standoff between Iraq and the United Nations arms inspectors. But those criticizing Iraq for suspending its cooperation with the United Nations special commission on arms inspection, better known as Unscom, give no recognition whatsoever to the underlying reasons that led Iraq to adopt this position. It is time to set the record straight.
First, the whole world knows by now that Iraq has lost well over a million of its people as a direct result of the sanctions that have been in place for eight years. A former President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, was chillingly correct when he called sanctions "a peaceful, silent and deadly remedy." Secretary of State Madeleine Albright herself characterized them as "the toughest multilateral sanctions in history." Many critics seem to think the Government of Iraq is supposed to stand idle while watching a whole generation of its people melt away like snowflakes. 
 Second, Iraq has complied with all the fundamental requirements of disarmament in Security Council Resolution 687. Unscom itself admitted this reality in its April 11, 1997, report to the Security Council, when it said, "The accumulated effect of the work that has been accomplished over six years since the cease fire went into effect between Iraq and the coalition is such that not much is unknown about Iraq's retained proscribed weapons capabilities." But the United States and Britain refuse to recognize this fact. Their role in preventing the Security Council from closing the clearly done nuclear file a few weeks ago is a case in point.
The disagreement between Iraq and the inspectors is not on existing weapons. No weapons or sites have been discovered by the Unscom inspectors on their own since 1991; those that have been found have been produced by the Iraqi Government itself. Rather, the current dispute involves paper documentation that precedes the gulf war. Those issues can be pursued in the context of the already established ongoing monitoring regime.
There are two main questions that need to be asked when assessing Iraq's compliance with disarmament requirements: does Iraq still possess proscribed weapons or the means to produce them, and is the monitoring process working? The answer is no to the first, yes to the second. Unscom's allegations about documentation are nothing but excuses to manufacture a crisis whenever one is needed to prolong the sanctions.
Iraq has said all along that there must be a creative way to reconcile the two goals: the need for more documentation and the easing of the suffering of the Iraqi people. Unscom, unfortunately, is insisting on either everything or nothing.
Iraq will never be able to satisfy Unscom because it is being asked to prove the negative: that it does not have any more weapons. There is, of course, no way Iraq can prove that it has nothing if it has nothing. How many more Iraqis will have to die because Richard Butler's team has not yet found another document, which cannot be located because there is no such document in the first place? The inspectors are searching for a black cat in a dark room, where the cat does not exist.
Third, many American officials have stated that even if Iraq complies with the Security Council's resolutions, the United States will not approve the lifting of sanctions. The declared goal of Washington is to remove the current Government of Iraq. We wonder if this goal is in line with the letter and the spirit of international law and the United Nations resolutions. Iraq continues to believe that the resolutions are used by the United States as a cover for an illegal political agenda. The allocation of money to the Central Intelligence Agency for subversion in Iraq is just a unit in this series. One might wonder why Iraq should continue being part of this futile and endless game.
Fourth, Ms. Albright claims that every Iraqi receives a daily ration basket equivalent to the recommended caloric intake of the average American. Perhaps she needs to review the latest reports by the United Nations and other organizations, which state that millions of Iraqi children and women are still suffering and that the oil-for-food program is not adequate. For instance, the 1998 World Disaster Report by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies described Iraq as a country under siege and said 16 to 27 percent of the population is malnourished.
Finally, many high-ranking American officials keep speaking about Iraq as being a threat to American interests and to the region. We would like to assure these officials, and through them the American people, that Iraq is eager to live in peace with its neighbors and the world. But Iraq will not submit to intimidation, bullying and coercion. Peace will come only through dialogue based on mutual respect for the principles of independence, sovereignty and the observance of international law.

Two-Day RallyIs Ended As Dow Slides 21.37 Points

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks ended slightly lower yesterday, as cautious investors stepped back from a two-day rally.
Shares of companies seen to be affected by Asia's slump, like semiconductor makers and banks, fell, offsetting the gains in computer manufacturers, encouraged by Dell Computer's earnings. 
 After falling as much as 50 points late in the session, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 21.37 points, or three-tenths of 1 percent, to 8,693.28, led by J. P. Morgan. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.14 points, or three-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,098.06. The Nasdaq composite index, dominated by computer-related companies, fell 12.43 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,842.69.
Several rounds of computer-guided trading ended two attempts at rallies yesterday.
"It's part of the trading process; stock prices go up sharply and pull back" as pessimistic investors sell, said Joseph DeMarco, head of United States equity trading for HSBC Asset Management Americas Inc., which manages $5 billion.
The decline snapped two days of gains. Shares surged this week after a monthlong slump, which dragged major stock indexes down 10 percent on concern that the damage to American corporate profits from recessions in Asia would worsen.
"You have a tug-of-war right now" between investors who worry that profit growth is slowing and those who say low interest rates and steady economic growth will support profits, said Liz Ann Sonders, a money manager with Avatar Associates, which manages $3.3 billion. "Rates have taken a back seat to the earnings problem."
Three stocks fell for every two that rose on the New York Exchange yesterday. The Russell 2000 index of small stocks fell 5.45 points, to 405.84, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 1.98 points, to 550.05.
Dell soared 8 3/8, to 117 15/16, after the No. 1 direct seller of personal computers reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that beat expectations and said it would split its stock 2 for 1. The company announced on Tuesday, after the market closed, that profits rose 62 percent in the quarter, and analysts expect an even better second half, when back-to-school and holiday buying bolsters sales.
Gateway Inc., another direct seller of personal computers, rose 1 13/16, to 62 9/16.
"For Dell to have the quarter it did, it shows that world markets do allow for tech stocks to make money, and Dell's making a lot of it," said Dan Mathisson, head trader at D. E. Shaw Securities in New York.
Still, the impact of Asia's recession showed up in disappointing earnings news from two makers of computer chips, LSI Logic and Analog Devices.
LSI Logic, the largest manufacturer of chips for networking equipment, warned that third-quarter earnings would be below analyst forecasts because of lower-than-expected orders. LSI dropped 2 13/16, to 21 7/16. Analog Devices slumped 2 3/4, to 21 1/2. A third chip maker, Intel, fell 1 7/8, to 89 9/16.
Banks seen as having exposure to Asia also declined. J. P. Morgan fell 1 1/8, to 126 1/2; BankAmerica lost 2 7/16, to 81 13/16, and Citicorp lost 3 5/8, to 144.

HEADLINE: Record Sales Bolster Starts Of New Homes

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Housing starts unexpectedly surged last month to their highest level in more than 11 years as contractors worked harder to keep up with record home sales.
The Commerce Department said today that housing starts rose 5.7 percent in July, to 1.718 million units at an annual rate. Analysts had expected the report to show a decline, to a rate of 1.596 million units. 
 The department also revised the annual rate of June's housing starts to 1.626 million units from the 1.615 million units first reported.
A combination of low mortgage and unemployment rates and rising incomes and consumer optimism is increasing the demand for new homes.
The only concern, said Suzanne Rizzo, chief United States economist at the New York consulting firm Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc., is that there is "a shortage of workers and builders, not a shortage of people willing to buy homes."
The July pace of housing starts was well above the monthly average for the year's first half. Starts in the first six months averaged 1.576 million units a month at an annual rate, up 7.1 percent from the first six months of 1997. July starts on single-family homes rose 3 percent, and starts on multifamily buildings increased 15.1 percent.
Building permits for new-home construction, a gauge of future construction starts, rose 4 percent in July, to a rate of 1.578 million units. In June, permits fell an unrevised 1.7 percent, to 1.517 million units.
Regionally, housing starts last month rose 11.8 percent in the Northeast, to an annual rate of 152,000 units; 6.8 percent in the South, to 813,000 units; 4.3 percent in the West, to 436,000 units, and 1.9 percent in the Midwest, to 317,000 units.

HEADLINE: Survey Finds Layoffs Slowed in Last 3 Years

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The most comprehensive survey of permanent layoffs in America finds that in the last three years, a smaller percentage of workers were downsized than in any other period in this decade. But the layoff rate is still significantly higher than in the 1980's, and women now get pink slips almost as often as men.
These were among the findings in yesterday's release of the latest job displacement survey from the Labor Department, covering the years 1995 through 1997. Eight million people were pushed out of their jobs involuntarily, or one out of every 15 adult jobholders. That was down from 8.4 million in the prior three-year period, or one in 12 workers, the decade's worst performance. 
 "We are seeing the normal cyclical behavior of the labor force reflected in these numbers," said Henry Farber, a Princeton economist, referring to the strong economic growth in 1996 and 1997 and the falling unemployment rate. "The puzzle is why has it taken so long to get the layoff rate down this far and why is it not even lower."
Downsizing is still occurring at a greater rate than in the late 1980's, the last time an economic expansion lasted as long as the current one. Then the displacement rate was one out of every 18 jobholders.
The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics began its biennial job displacement surveys in 1984, when widespread permanent layoffs were just becoming an issue. Those surveys found that downsizing fell back quickly after the 1981-1982 recession. The 1990's were different. Permanent layoffs rose in the 1990-1991 recession and then failed to fall back. They even kept rising despite the recovery. The pattern remains the same when the Labor Department's figures are adjusted, through the use of a moving average, to reconcile overlapping annual numbers from different surveys.
Labor economists offer various explanations for the persistent downsizing. The phenomenon spread in the 1990's from blue-collar to white-collar workers, and from manufacturing to service industries. Growing competition has also played a role, and so have corporate mergers.
"American companies are much more concerned than in the past about labor fat in their organizations," said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. "Some of that has to do with a heightened emphasis on short-term profits, achieved in part through labor-cost cutting."
Still, the latest survey brought a bright side. While layoffs have risen among white-collar workers and women, job losers found themselves re-employed quickly. Seventy-six percent of the 2.4 million full-time workers laid off in the latest three-year period found themselves re-employed in full-time jobs by the time of the survey, which was conducted last February. The rest were still among the unemployed or had dropped out of the labor force.
But that 76 percent was up from 72 percent in the mid-1990's and 69.6 percent in the late 1980's. What is more, the median period between jobs fell to 4.1 weeks from 5.1 in the 1993-1995 period, and 6.1 weeks in the late 1980's.
When part-timers are added to the mix, then the rate of re-employment falls and the average wage for those who are re-employed also falls. The new wage averages 10 percent or more below the earnings in the old job, according to a recent study by Mr. Farber. The Bureau of Labor Statistics does not include such data in the published results of its surveys. But among the full-timers who were re-employed in full-time jobs, 55 percent earned as much or more in their new jobs as they had in their old ones, the bureau said. That was up from 48 percent in the previous survey, but down from 60 percent in the late 1980's, also boom years.
The Clinton Administration, seeking to highlight its assistance programs for dislocated workers, focused on the 24 percent of full-time workers who were re-employed in full-time jobs by the time of the survey, but in jobs with salaries that were 20 percent or more below their old wages.
They are "why the department's programs and grants to assist dislocated workers are so important," Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman said in a statement.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics also compiles job displacement numbers for people laid off after having held jobs for three or more years, a figure that most labor economists consider less important than the broader category. The trend for the longer-tenured jobholders was roughly the same, although the decline was sharper -- 3.6 million displaced workers in the 1995-1997 period, compared with 4.2 million in the 1993-1995 period.
The latest survey also documented trends in downsizing that have characterized the 1990's. The job-loss rate for women is now nearly as high as the one for men: 6.5 percent of all adult women employed versus 6.7 percent for men. Whites, blacks and Hispanic workers are also gradually converging, with the white displacement rate at 6.1 percent in the latest survey, blacks at 7.1 percent and the Hispanic rate at 8.8 percent. The spread was twice as great in the late 1980's.
And since the last survey, in 1996, the layoff rate among manufacturing workers has declined slightly, while that for service workers has edged up, continuing trends that go back to the 1980's, when they were much more pronounced. Still, blue-collar workers are more likely to be laid off, with one of every 20 blue-collar workers losing jobs in the latest three-year period, compared with one in every 22 white-collar workers.

HEADLINE: Details for New Center at Newark Airport

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Aug. 19

 BODY:
The developers of a proposed hotel and conference center complex on the fringes of Newark International Airport today detailed their plans for the project, which would tap into a growing need for hotel rooms and meeting space within easy reach of the airport.
The 55-acre site will include a 50,000-square-foot conference center, a 550-room deluxe hotel and a 250-room limited service hotel, said Emanuel Stern, the president and chief executive of Hartz Mountain Industries, the developer. He said work on the project would create 3,000 construction jobs and 2,500 permanent jobs once the work was completed. Construction of the $150 million project is to start early next year, company officials said, and is expected to be completed by 2000. 
 Plans for the site, stretching along the long-unused Waverly rail yards a little over a mile west of the airport, have for much of the last decade been little more than a gleam in the eye of developers and Newark officials. The expectations have risen and fallen with the changes in Newark's fortunes, the real estate market and air travel.
In the last two years, the chances of development on the site have increased tremendously as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey planned and began construction to extend the existing airport monorail to a new terminal for New Jersey Transit commuter trains and Amtrak trains adjacent to the Hartz Mountain property. Last spring, the developer won in its bid to build a pedestrian walkway connecting the hotel and conference center complex to the terminal.
Walter M. Smith Jr., executive vice president of operations with Hartz Mountain Industries, said the property the developer acquired from Newark in 1988 had gone from being a likely industrial site with little access to the airport to a vastly more valuable property with a direct line into the stream of 30 million people who use the airport annually.
"It's the current upturn in the economy which really makes this possible," he said. "And we have been hearing that there is an increasing business travel meeting space requirement for companies that might want to fly people into a single airport in the morning, get them to an all-day meeting near the airport and then fly them home that same night."
Mr. Smith said Hartz Mountain spent between $3 million and $5 million to rid the site of hazardous materials like heavy metals.
Details of the plans were revealed today as Hartz Mountain executives and other business people joined Newark Mayor Sharpe James and Senator Frank R. Lautenberg on a tour of a number of economic development sites in the city, which has been undergoing a resurgence and attracting the interest of developers after years of economic decline. As Mr. Stern described the company's plans, a steady stream of airplanes could be seen just over his shoulder, noisily sliding down the glide path to the airport's runways.
Mr. Lautenberg, who was instrumental in winning Federal financing for the monorail and the commuter and Amtrak rail terminal, said the transportation links and the need for meeting space would make the location "a premier site" in the region.
There are now about 3,700 hotel rooms within two miles of the airport, Newark economic development officials said, and the proposed Hartz Mountain complex will, by itself, increase that number by more than 20 percent. Newark was listed as the 16th busiest airport in the world in terms of takeoffs and landings in 1997, by the Airports Council International -- ahead of La Guardia, which was 33d, and Kennedy International, which was 34th. In total passengers, Kennedy was 15th, Newark 16th and La Guardia 37th.
In the last year, Newark has been the fastest growing airport in the New York area, Port Authority officials said.

HEADLINE: U.S. SEEKS MEANS TO BRING SUSPECT FROM AFGHANISTAN

BYLINE: By JAMES RISEN; This article was reported by Steven Erlanger, James Risen and Tim Weiner. It was written by Mr. Risen.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
As United States officials focus on a Saudi exile, Osama bin Laden, as a prime suspect in the embassy bombings in Africa, they are considering strategies for how they might negotiate his capture with the Taliban, the fundamentalist Muslims who control Afghanistan, officials said.
In Afghanistan, a high-ranking official of the Taliban opened the door today to such discussions.
Since 1996 the Taliban have sheltered Mr. bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi whom the United States calls one of the world's leading financiers of terrorism. 
 Wakil Ahmed Mutawakil, the spokesman for the Taliban and the second-highest ranking official of their Supreme Council, said in a telephone interview from Afghanistan that if the United States provided hard evidence of Mr. bin Laden's involvement in the bombings, the Taliban would be willing to meet with American officials to discuss what to do about him.
"Our understanding is that the U.S. is continuing to investigate this matter and there isn't any solid evidence of his involvement," Mr. Mutawakil said. "If you call someone a terrorist, you must have proof. If there is proof, we will certainly sit down and talk to the U.S."
But Mr. Mutawakil's comments served more to raise difficult questions for American policy makers than to open any immediate prospect of a resolution to the investigation of the bombings at the United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7, which killed more than 250 people and wounded 5,000.
While Mr. Mutawakil is a top figure in the Taliban, his statement comes in the midst of contradictory statements from the mullah who leads the movement. That raises American worries that there is a rift and that the Taliban might ultimately be unwilling to deliver Mr. bin Laden.
Any deal could be complicated -- or short-circuited -- by Washington's longstanding complaints with the Taliban. Those include their harsh treatment of women, other human-rights questions and their involvement in narcotics trafficking.
But this may be a good time to negotiate with the Taliban. Having nearly defeated their opposition at home, the Taliban are desperate for international recognition and economic support.
Any deal for Mr. bin Laden would almost certainly also have to involve Pakistan. Despite Pakistan's cooperation with the bombing investigation in recent days, American-Pakistani relations remain complicated since Pakistan's tests of nuclear weapons earlier this year.
Still, American officials are deliberating whether they can provide incentives to the Taliban to win their cooperation in helping to bring Mr. bin Laden to face any charges that may be filed against him in the bombings.
No such charges have yet been brought, but senior Clinton Administration officials say he is their leading suspect.
United States officials reacted cautiously to Mr. Mutawakil's statement, saying they were not yet ready to open talks with the Taliban concerning Mr. bin Laden.
"If we get to that point, then we'll deal with it," one official said. "We've had discussions with the Taliban in the past about bin Laden. And if we were to establish information that shows he did not live up to his obligations as a 'guest' in Afghanistan, then we would provide it to the Taliban, and certainly take up" the suggestion of direct talks.
There have been conflicting statements from the Taliban's leadership in recent days about their willingness to deal with the United States on Mr. bin Laden. Mr. Mutawakil's statements came on the heels of hard-line comments made earlier Wednesday by other senior Taliban officials, including the group's leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, vowing to protect Mr. bin Laden.
Insisting that Mr. bin Laden was not involved in the bombings, Mullah Omar vowed to the Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press that "even if all the countries of the world unite, we would defend Osama with our blood."
American officials have to contend with this split in the Taliban over the movement's relationship with Mr. bin Laden, a Saudi exile who helped finance Afghan rebels in their long war against the Soviet Union in the 1980's. Some United States officials say there is a faction among the Taliban that sees him as a liability that they inherited from the previous Afghan government.
As they deliberate how to approach the Taliban in the future, United States officials said they would not trade Mr. bin Laden's capture for American recognition of the Taliban's de facto government. But they said the Administration was weighing other ways to persuade the Afghans to cooperate.
Diplomacy may be the only answer, since several American officials said a military or covert operation to capture Mr. bin Laden was unlikely or impossible.
There are no evident signs that the United States is considering a military operation against his compound, despite rumors to that effect in Pakistan. The American Ambassador in Pakistan, Thomas Simons, has dismissed the possibility that the United States would use Pakistan as a staging ground for a military assault.
"You can't shoot a Tomahawk at Kandahar from some ship in the ocean," said one diplomat in the region, referring to a cruise missile used by the Navy. "It would take infantry."
Any land-based military operation would almost certainly have to be mounted from Pakistan, whose Interior Minister, Shujat Hussain, ruled out such a mission today. "We cannot be a party to that," he said.
A covert mission to flush Mr. bin Laden out of hiding is conceivable. Last year, the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. lured Mir Amal Kansi, the convicted killer of two C.I.A. employees, out of hiding in Afghanistan to a hotel in Pakistan, where he was arrested after a four-and-a-half-year manhunt. The Pakistanis cooperated in Mr. Kansi's capture.
But Mr. bin Laden has much greater financial and political resources than Mr. Kansi and is far less likely to succumb to trickery or fall into a trap laid by American intelligence operatives.
A senior diplomatic official familiar with the leadership of the Taliban, said: "If bin Laden is involved, they've got a big bargaining chip," one that they might use to negotiate for the international recognition they strongly desire.
Another senior American official added: "We may be on the verge of a new relationship of Taliban to the world, and if they insist on calling themselves a government, they may have to act more like a government, with international norms and responsibilities. That includes restraining terrorism, which touches on the issue of his residence in Afghanistan."
On Tuesday, visiting the bombed American embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright first raised the issue of the Taliban's turning over Mr. bin Laden when she said that the Afghans would improve their chances for international recognition if they stopped sheltering known or suspected terrorists like Mr. bin Laden.
Yet American officials have been frustrated in their previous attempts to win the support of the Taliban leadership in curbing terrorism.
In April, Bill Richardson, the United States chief delegate to the United Nations, met with Taliban leaders in Afghanistan to discuss Mr. bin Laden, but Taliban leaders rejected a request that they extradite him.
Before the Africa bombings, the United States suspected Mr. bin Laden of involvement in the bombings of American military installations in Saudi Arabia.
The Taliban have told State Department officials that Mr. bin Laden has guaranteed them, after Saudi Arabia demanded such a guarantee, that he will not conduct terrorist activities from inside Afghanistan. This is thought in Washington to be an empty promise.
In addition, Mr. bin Laden is thought to pay the Taliban for sanctuary, in part out of his profits from his legitimate businesses and, allegedly, narcotics dealing.
Any United States negotiations with the Taliban will have to involve Pakistan. While Pakistan has close military and intelligence ties to the United States -- ties that have proved crucial in the spreading investigation of the embassy bombings -- Pakistan's Government is furious over American sanctions imposed on the country after it tested nuclear weapons.
A bargain with Pakistan could bring Washington's goal of stopping the spread of nuclear weapons into conflict with its counterterrorism goals.
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and other American diplomats will meet with Pakistan's Foreign Minister, Shamshad Ahmad, on Tuesday in London. American efforts to obtain Pakistani and Indian cooperation to halt their nuclear weapons programs are high on the agenda. So are the Taliban and Mr. bin Laden.

U.S. Bomb Investigators May Seek Taliban's Help
United States officials focusing on a Saudi exile, Osama bin Laden, as a prime suspect in the embassy bombings in Africa were said to be discussing strategies for negotiating his capture with the Taliban, the fundamentalist Muslims who control Afghanistan, where Mr. bin Laden is thought to be, officials said. A1 

The United States Embassy in Pakistan urged all non-Muslim foreigners working in neighboring Afghanistan to leave because of general threats, officials said. A6
 
A low-cost hotel in a run-down neighborhood of Nairobi has become a focus of the F.B.I. investigation into the bombing. A6
 
A Plan for Colombian Coca
Colombia's new President, Andres Pastrana, is calling for a "Marshall Plan" to step up economic development in the coca-growing hinterlands of Colombia.

Kabila Seeks Aid for Congo
President Laurent Kabila scrambled to secure foreign military support to repel a final assault, as rebels closed in on Kinshasa, the capital. Zimbabwe said it would immediately send aircraft, weapons and other support for the embattled Government. A3
 
Burials in Northern Ireland
The grieving and angry people of Omagh, Northern Ireland, buried 16 of the 28 people who were killed by a car bomb on Saturday.

Opposition Rally In Berlin
European intellectuals gathered in Berlin for a campaign rally by political opponents of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

A3
 
Pakistan's Ex-Leader Accused
A Swiss investigating magistrate said he had gathered enough evidence to indict Pakistan's former Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto, on money-laundering charges tied to contracts with two Geneva-based companies.

Clinton DNA Sample Asked
The independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr has demanded a sample of President Clinton's genetic material to establish forensic proof that his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky was sexual, though it was unclear whether Mr. Starr made his request before or after the President testified on Monday. Ms. Lewinsky is to return to the grand jury today. A1
 
Representative Paul McHale, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said he had become the first and only member of Congress from his party to call for Mr. Clinton to resign or face impeachment because allowing a public official to remain in office after lying under oath would set an "awful precedent." A21
 
President Clinton had a quiet 52d birthday on Martha's Vineyard, spending the day with his family and having dinner with his friend and confidant Vernon E. Jordan Jr. A20
 
Globe Columnist Resigns
The Boston Globe again asked its columnist Mike Barnicle to resign, and this time he agreed.

HEADLINE: 3 Candidates For Governor Turn on Rival

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: BRENTWOOD, N.Y., Aug. 19

 BODY:
Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross came under attack tonight by her three rivals for the Democratic nomination for governor, who used a debate here to question her loyalty to Democratic values, her political experience and her competence.
In a debate that had been largely marked by comity and unity of purpose -- the candidates spent the bulk of the evening assailing Gov. George E. Pataki -- the three other Democrats made the same choice when offered a chance to select one candidate to question: They turned on Ms. McCaughey Ross, the former Republican who is now seeking the Democratic nomination to run against the man who brought her into politics. 
 "I wonder, in all earnestness," said one of the candidates, Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney, "what is it about your experience as Lieutenant Governor that prepares you to be the chief executive of a state with a $72 billion budget."
Another candidate, James L. Larocca, the former state transportation commissioner, asked why Ms. McCaughey Ross, who is also the Liberal Party candidate for governor, would not agree to support the winner of the Democratic primary if it was not her.
And the other gubernatorial candidate, Peter F. Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker, asked if Ms. McCaughey Ross was aware that he had introduced city legislation mandating the use of trigger locks on handguns, similar to a bill Ms. McCaughey Ross has called for statewide.
The exchange came in a race that has until now been remarkably placid. Indeed, until the questions about Ms. McCaughey Ross were posed at the debate at Suffolk County Community College here, the discussion had been free of wrangling. Until then, each candidate had taken turns, in their second debate, serving up a variety of criticisms of Mr. Pataki's effectiveness as governor and his political ethics.
The attacks on Ms. McCaughey Ross seemed to reflect continuing uncertainty among the various camps over the shape of the race and how best to position their candidate. From the start, she has been assumed to be a front-runner, if only because she is the only woman in the race and because her husband, Wilbur Ross, an industrialist, was said by her campaign to be prepared to finance a heavy television advertising campaign on her behalf. (With the election less than a month away, it remains unclear whether he will actually do so.)
Mr. Vallone's aides distributed a statement attacking Ms. McCaughey Ross's record even before the debate began.
Ms. McCaughey Ross appeared unfazed by the attacks, seeming to welcome the jostling.
When Mr. Larocca accused the Lieutenant Governor of using government funds to print a report on the state economy that has become a staple of her campaign appearances, she brushed aside his remark as "a distortion." (A notice on the report says it was not published at taxpayers' expense.)
And when Mr. Larocca pushed her about why she would not promise to support the Democratic candidate if she lost the nomination, Ms. McCaughey Ross dismissed the line of inquiry as irrelevant.
"When working families watch this on television," she responded, "they are less concerned with insider party politics than the fundamental issues facing the people of New York."
As a group, the Democrats differed on one major issue: the death penalty. Only Mr. Hynes opposes it. Mr. Vallone strongly endorsed capital punishment, referring to convicted killers who murder prison guards. "There are people who will kill again," Mr. Vallone said. "I have no problem whatsoever in sending them back to their maker."
Ms. McCaughey Ross said she was more concerned about domestic violence. But she said she has "come to accept the death penalty."
"A society has a right to express its moral outrage," she said.
But Mr. Hynes promised that his top priority, if elected, would be to revoke the law that was a centerpiece of Mr. Pataki's 1994 campaign.
"The death penalty is a phony," Mr. Hynes said. "It's a phony issue. It's not punishment at all to stick a needle in someone's arm after 15 years of appeals."
He said he favored "real life without parole, the kind of punishment the Federal Government gives to John Gotti, who spends 23 hours a day in a jail cell."
Mr. Larocca sought to distinguish himself from his opponents by urging them to sign a pledge promising not to take money from interests doing business with the state. "We cannot make the case against George Pataki, who runs his campaign on this self-interested big money, if we ourselves are part of this process," he said. "I am the only candidate who is not part of this system."
None took Mr. Larocca up on his offer.
And on an issue of particular concern here, the state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company, Ms. McCaughey Ross, Mr. Vallone and Mr. Hynes denounced the deal and said it should have been put up for a public referendum. Mr. Larocca, the only Long Island resident in the race, said the issue should be abandoned.
"I think it's for Long Island to put this issue behind us," Mr. Larocca said. "Most Long Islanders are happy to be getting rid of the company they didn't like, happy to get the rebates they're going to get. It's time for politicians to find the next issue to make their bones on."
For all that, though, the candidates were nearly in unison as they attacked Mr. Pataki on a variety of fronts, ranging from his administration of the state government to his fund-raising practices to his recent display of national ambition.
"Governor -- we have problems," Mr. Vallone said. "You're out of state. You're out of touch. You have to come back and address those problems."
The candidates assailed Mr. Pataki for pushing for increases in tuition for the State University of New York. "Pataki's huge tuition increase at SUNY, combined with the deep cuts in their operating budget, has deprived students of an education," Mr. Hynes said.
The four candidates also criticized Mr. Pataki for allowing the state debt to increase during his first four years in office. Mr. Larocca said he would push legislation that would mandate that 25 percent of any surplus go toward paying down the state's debt.
"George Pataki came to New York and said he was a fiscal conservative," Mr. Larocca said. "He is sinking New York into debt at a rate that would make Nelson Rockefeller and Abraham Beame blush. We are on our way to a debt situation exactly like 1975, when we were at the brink of bankruptcy in New York."

Aide to King Hussein To Be Next Premier

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Aug. 19

 BODY:
King Hussein of Jordan will appoint the chief of his royal court, Fayez al-Tarawnah, as Prime Minister, the official Petra news agency said today.
The agency said that Prime Minister Abdul-Salam al-Majali, 74, was expected to submit his resignation to King Hussein, who is undergoing treatment for cancer in the United States. A Government minister said he expected that a new Cabinet would be announced on Thursday. 
 Mr. Majali, who was appointed in March 1997, has been under fire for his Government's handling of a recent water-pollution crisis that has forced Jordan to import water from Saudi Arabia.
Mr. Tarawnah, 50, an economist educated in the United States, is from a prominent Jordanian political family and was one of Jordan's main negotiators in talks that led to its 1994 peace treaty with Israel.
He served as Jordan's Ambassador to the United States before being made Foreign Minister last year. He was later appointed chief of the royal court.

HEADLINE: Sometimes the Homeless Are the Working Poor

 BODY:

To the Editor:
San Francisco's homeless problem is actually more insidious than your Aug. 16 news article suggests. Poor people are being forced out of the city as it becomes unaffordable, not the other way around. 
 The lack of affordable housing in San Francisco makes it virtually impossible for the working poor, let alone the homeless, to live here. In fact, the working poor and the homeless are one and the same. A recent study by the Institute for Children and Poverty shows that in at least 41 percent of homeless families, one family member has a job or has been unemployed for less than a year.
Far from being a magnet, San Francisco's housing crisis is pushing people, mostly long-term residents, out of the city. There is a real fear that San Francisco is becoming a city only for the rich.

HEADLINE: Bullish on Times Square Neon;
Wall Street Muscles Into Mecca of Commercial Glitter

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Ever since Trimble's Whiskey erected the first neon sign there nearly a century ago, Times Square has been New York's glowing, pulsating marketplace for everything from steam irons to video cameras, Camels to Calvins. Now, though, it is beginning to hawk a very different kind of product: the stock market.
The biggest of those advertisers -- at least in terms of neon acreage -- will be the Nasdaq market, which is waging an upstart campaign to overtake the New York Stock Exchange. Nasdaq recently signed a deal to build the largest single sign in Times Square: a $15 million, multimedia kaleidoscope of stock tickers, video screens and colorful billboards that will festoon the cylindrical tower of the building now rising along Broadway between 42d and 43d Streets. 
 The sign will be big -- roughly the size of three basketball courts -- but it will hardly be alone. Times Square will soon be a visual metaphor for the way the stock market -- news about it, talk about it, anxiety about it -- seems to pervade life these days.
The Nasdaq sign, on the skyscraper known as the Conde Nast building, will stand directly across the street from Dow Jones's electronic zipper, which encircles the signpost tower at 1 Times Square. That, in turn, is directly across the street from where Reuters, the British media and financial information company, will hang a series of electronic signs on its new American headquarters, at Seventh Avenue and 42d Street.
And those three signs will be only five blocks south of three amber-colored, 157-foot-long stock and financial information zippers that strut across the face of the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter building, at 1585 Broadway.
"There's going to be a shootout in Times Square between Nasdaq, Reuters, Morgan Stanley and Dow Jones," said George N. Stonbely, president of Spectacolor Communications, the electronic sign company that designed the giant Kodak, Hertz and AT&T signs on the face of the Marriott Marquis hotel, at Broadway and 47th Street. "They're all talking about mega-hardware on the outside of their buildings. It's going to be funny to see so much financial information in Times Square, instead of a Coke bottle or a can of Planters peanuts. Someone who hasn't been here in many years is going to think they're in the wrong place."
Stocks and bonds are certainly a far cry from the products that were traditionally hawked on the district's billboards and neon signs, like Maytag washers, Wrigley's Spearmint Chewing Gum and Trimble's Whiskey, which was depicted on that first neon sign in 1904. The most famous billboard of all was the Camel cigarette sign, designed by the sign specialist Douglas Leigh, which blew rings of steam over Broadway between 1941 and 1966.
But with Times Square the symbol of New York's recent resurgence, it is fitting that the businesses fueling that boom -- finance, along with media and entertainment -- should be jostling for space there.
"Times Square has always been a little bit ahead of the game in displaying the rawest edge of commercialization of our society," said Thomas Bender, a history professor at New York University. "It makes sense that Wall Street should display itself on the biggest public stage available at a time when we have the most open celebration of the marketplace in history."
To some extent, the changing images on the square's signs reflect the changing nature of the business being done in the offices behind them.
As a longtime entertainment district, Times Square was a logical location for media giants like Reuters, Viacom or Bertelsmann A.G. But the financial services industry has become a large and growing presence, most notably Morgan Stanley, which signed a tentative deal last week to erect its third tower at the north end of the square.
Still, for the financial industry, Times Square's greatest charm is its advertising might, especially at a time when the number of Americans who own stock has soared to 43 percent of adults, from 10 percent only two decades ago.
"If you're going to compete in the global marketplace, what better place than the international crossroads of the world," said David Arena, who heads Morgan Stanley's corporate real estate department and is well aware of the estimated 20 million visitors who pass through the square annually, not to mention the 250 million television viewers around the world who watch the ball drop from the former Times Tower on New Year's Eve.
Of course, the unbridled proliferation of signs in Times Square has some people worried that the billboards will eventually all look like so much undifferentiated "wallpaper" to the thousands of office workers and visitors who course through Times Square every day.
"There was never this much clutter, this much clamor for attention," said Jason Perline, who has put up signs in Times Square for 32 years. "It's anybody's guess how long it'll be an attractive media buy. Time will only tell, but I do question it."
Reuters is going to great lengths to insure that its signs will be unique among that "clutter," by hiring the designer Edwin A. Schlossberg and by dropping plans for a zipper, at least for now.
In the meantime, Frank G. Zarb, chairman of the National Association of Stock Dealers, which owns the Nasdaq market, has made no secret of his plans to build a world financial market that would rival the New York Stock Exchange. He has already acquired the American Stock Exchange and may move it, together with the association's headquarters, to Times Square.
With its giant sign and other attractions in Times Square, Nasdaq hopes to sell itself to the public by creating a virtual trading floor that rivals the much-televised opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange, which is larger and better known. Unlike the telegenic trading floors of the New York exchange, Nasdaq is an electronic market composed mainly of telephone lines and computers.
Michael Jones, a senior vice president at the National Association of Stock Dealers in Washington, confirmed that Nasdaq was planning to move its marketing operation to Times Square, but he declined to provide details. Sign builders and real estate executives say, though, that the association's board approved a 65,000-square-foot leasing deal on Aug. 6 for the gigantic sign, a television studio and marketing center at 4 Times Square, at 43d Street and Broadway.
Real estate executives who have seen the plans said the Nasdaq marketing operation would move from an obscure berth on the ninth floor of 33 Whitehall in lower Manhattan to 4 Times Square. There would be a broadcast studio with a curving wall of television monitors looking out on Times Square from behind a semicircular, two-story glass wall, where daily briefings and public stock offerings would be announced. A public entrance would lead to the second floor, where there would be an auditorium and interactive displays for visitors wanting to track the progress of various stocks. The association is also taking some office space.
The huge sign itself would rise from the third story and ascend about 125 feet, the executives said, and is expected to cost $15 million, about three times the price of Morgan Stanley's giant electronic zippers, but only half of what Reuters may spend to build 15,169 square feet of sophisticated, high-resolution video signs on the side of its building.
Though ever popular, signs in Times Square have only in recent years generated big money. Last year, a German investment group bought 1 Times Square for $110 million, or nearly four times the price paid by Lehman Brothers two years earlier. The value of the deal was in the signs, not the building. The four large signs that climb up the front of 1 Times Square, home of the New Year's Eve ball drop, generate more than $7 million a year in rent from Budweiser, Nissin, ITT and Panasonic.
The current Times Square revival is in stark contrast to the 1970's, when many New Yorkers avoided the area and neon signs fell out of fashion. By the time Mr. Leigh sold his 14 billboards in Times Square to the Van Wagner sign company, 13 were blank. The sole renter was Sony. Mr. Perline, a founder of Van Wagner, said he could not sell space to American companies because of the image of Times Square as dowdy and dangerous. He recalled a salesman for Philip Morris saying, "We don't want a sign seen only by pimps and prostitutes."
"I said, 'Who smokes more than pimps and prostitutes?' " Mr. Perline said. "But it wasn't a good sales pitch."
Van Wagner turned its attention to Sony's contemporaries in Japan, emerging companies looking to make a name for themselves. Unlike many New Yorkers, the Japanese realized that millions of camera-laden tourists were still pouring through Times Square every year in a kind of civic pilgrimage akin to visiting Mecca or Lourdes. Soon Hitachi, Minolta, Konica and Fuji were pitching up billboards and neon spectaculars in Times Square, the first step toward becoming household words in America.
For the most part, American companies did not return for another decade, and not until the city imposed an ordinance in 1987 requiring new buildings in the Times Square district to display oversize, bright signs on new buildings along Broadway and Seventh Avenue. At the time, civic groups hailed the ordinance as a tool to save Times Square, but real estate developers who were trying to douse the bright lights and create a new office district hated it.
"Investment bankers and lawyers don't want to work in an environment surrounded by flashing lights," David S. Solomon, the developer who built the Morgan Stanley building and then lost it in the recession, said at the time. "They want museums and sidewalk cafes."
Even when Morgan Stanley moved into the tower in 1995, it was reluctant to dangle bright, garish signs off the side of its buildings. But Disney has moved onto 42d Street and a museum, albeit Madame Tussaud's, is on the way, making the area more respectable. And Morgan Stanley has since merged with Dean Witter, providing the investment bank with a vast retail clientele that can be reached through the signposts in Times Square.
"The signs of the 20's -- Presto steam irons and Royal typewriters -- were about liberation from drudgery," said Tama Starr, co-author of "Signs and Wonders: The Spectacular Marketing of America" and president of Artkraft Strauss, a family-owned sign maker. "Now the signs are about the world market and the information age."

Hard Bargain: Buying a Baby, Selling a Soul

BYLINE: By Anita Gates 

 BODY:
Stockard Channing does not look at home in a Louisiana trailer park. Which is a point "The Baby Dance" wants to make. There she is, as Rachel Luckman, a well-dressed Hollywood executive, making her way through the trash-strewn yards, fending off barking dogs, avoiding the stares of half-naked men who are working on a car. Finally she reaches the trailer of Al LeFauve (Richard Lineback), an unemployed pipe fitter, and his wife, Wanda (Laura Dern), who is very pregnant with their fifth child. Rachel is there to buy their baby.
"The Baby Dance," which has its premiere on Showtime on Sunday night, shows us just what an agonizing, invasive and ultimately soul-destroying process that kind of transaction can be. The film, written and directed by Jane Anderson, based on her 1989 play, is alternately funny and poignant. 
 As Hollywood white collar and Shreveport blue collar eye each other with polite words barely disguising mutual horror, the story teeters constantly on the brink of the ridiculous. But thanks to Ms. Anderson's restrained directing style and to strong, sure performances by this cast (including Peter Riegert as Rachel's husband, Richard), the film hangs onto its dignity. And the final scenes are as heart-wrenching as screen storytelling can be, made all the more powerful by the comic encounters that preceded them.
Rachel and Richard have come to Shreveport for a first meeting with Wanda and Al, who answered their "baby wanted" ad and have contracted to give up their child for adoption by the Luckmans. The two women start out politely. Rachel brings flowers to Wanda and says, "Isn't this lovely?" as she enters the cramped, hot trailer. Wanda brings out a cold-cut plate with white bread for lunch. But the trouble has already begun.
Rachel and Richard had sent the LeFauves $500 to buy an air-conditioner, but the money has been spent elsewhere. Wanda is smoking, drinking coffee and not taking the prenatal vitamins that Rachel had recommended. And Rachel's question about whether Wanda might have ever considered an abortion prompts a rather basic discussion of religion.
Wanda just wants to be sure that the Luckmans do "go to church." The next thing you know, Rachel, who is Jewish, is promising to celebrate Christmas with the child and in the spring to observe Easter as well as Passover. As Rachel is waxing poetic about the universality of the seder as a celebration of freedom, Wanda interrupts her with "Well, will you still have chocolate bunnies and jelly beans and all?"
If Laura Dern plays one more white-trash character this effectively ("Rambling Rose," "Citizen Ruth"), her fans are going to forget she grew up privileged in Hollywood. And although Ms. Channing is in "Six Degrees of Separation" mode as a sophisticate of good will who enjoys her own clever remarks, she is heartbreaking. The scene in which Rachel rests her head on Wanda's stomach to listen to her future daughter's heartbeat and whisper the name she has chosen could have been maudlin, but Ms. Channing turns it around.
The scene in which Ms. Channing spies Wanda's 12-year-old daughter in the backyard -- long, silky, golden hair flowing and catching the sunlight as she does cartwheels -- could easily have come across like Humbert Humbert's first glimpse of Lolita. But Ms. Channing makes it pure. And when Ms. Dern then remarks, "Now you know what the girls look like," her voice conveys all the bitterness and the loss of the pact she has made with the Devil.
The film is far from perfect. There are a few truly terrible lines like Mr. Riegert's to Mr. Lineback in the hospital just before the baby's birth: "You always have the advantage over me, my friend. You have the ability to make life." But the production designer, Brent Thomas, has a real eye for rural squalor. And if the joke is on the poor couple -- ridiculing their home, their language, their taste -- the Luckmans are eventually shown to have numerous flaws of their own. One very significant flaw, in fact, reveals itself at the end.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE

 BODY:

 Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York City museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Summer hours vary for galleries and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.
 
Museums
 
 * "a k a LEWIS CARROLL," Pierpont Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 (through Aug. 30). To the public he was Lewis Carroll, the author of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," but in private life he was Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832-1898), mathematician, Oxford don, cleric, poet, pamphleteer, deviser of games and puzzles, ardent theatergoer and gifted amateur photographer. This show, assembled largely from the library's own collection for the 100th anniversary of Dodgson's death, offers hefty slices of Dodgson and Carroll material, ranging from the adoring photos of little girls that were a Dodgson specialty to original illustrations for "Wonderland" by the Punch cartoonist John Tenniel. Associated memorabilia include Dodgson's White Rabbity big silver pocket watch and a ring belonging to Alice Liddell, the child who inspired "Wonderland." An enjoyable tribute to this Victorian who somehow found the freedom to let the child in him out. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10:30 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Saturdays, 10:30 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Sundays, noon to 6 P.M. Admission: $6; $4, students and the elderly (Grace Glueck). 

 JANINE ANTONI, "Swoon," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 74th Street, (212) 945-3600 (through Nov. 15). Best known for performances and sculptures that often involved symbolic but grueling labor -- like mopping the floor with her own hair -- Ms. Antoni has made a largely successful foray into video installation. The sad, seductive final pas de deux from "Swan Lake" forms its heart, expertly danced by a ballerina and her partner, seen on a double screen that is partly obscured by a curtain on one side. They dance without music, so the sounds of their movements, footfalls and labored breathing provide an audible account of the effort, discipline and suffering behind ballet's breathtaking illusion. When Tchaikovsky's beautiful music suddenly fills the gallery, swooning is a definite possibility. For a few exhilarating moments, the dancing looks effortless and weightless, but the music quickly fades, and reality sets in once more. Hours: Wednesdays, and Fridays through Sundays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Thursdays, 1 to 8 P.M. Admission: $9; $7 for students and the elderly (Roberta Smith).
 
 * "THE ART OF THE MOTORCYCLE," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Sept. 20). Yes, it is weird to see motorcycles in the Guggenheim, but American art museums have always shown objects of design, and if there's a certain peril in taking this curious show altogether seriously, on one level that's fitting because motorcycles are frivolous to begin with. The exhibition covers the ground between an 1868 French velocipede with a steam engine beneath the seat (ouch!) and a sleek 1998 MV Agusta. The show is way too big, but many of the bikes really are great to look at, and to like them you don't have to have a tattoo or know what a single-overhead-cam valve gear with enclosed rockers is. Frank O. Gehry's installation of shiny stainless-steel panels covering the rotunda side of Wright's ramp miraculously dematerialize the rotunda and makes the inside of the museum resemble a machine, an apt metaphor. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Fridays and Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 8 P.M. Admission: $12; $7 students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).
 
 * "BOCCIONI AND WOMEN," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Oct. 18). A key member of the Italian Futurist group at its height, from 1909 to 1916, Umberto Boccioni (1882-1916) worked toward an art that reflected the speed and dynamism of 20th-century civilization. This small show of drawings, prints and one sculpture relating to women conveys the important shifts in Boccioni's style from 1905 until his death while serving in World War I. Unlike, say, Picasso or de Kooning, Boccioni used the women in his life -- his mother, sisters, neighbors and mistress -- to explore artistic strategies rather than his own psyche. In this show, his mother appears to be his favorite model, and the most powerful work is a sculptured head of her that is remarkable for its melding of soft, fleshy contours with Cubistic angles and planes that create a surface as roughed up as a New York City street. This show only hints at Boccioni's real achievements, but it whets the appetite for another retrospective. Hours: Fridays and Saturdays, 9:30 A.M. to 8:45 P.M.; Sundays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 A.M. to 5:15 P.M. Suggested admission: $8 for adults; $4 for students and the elderly (Glueck).
 
 * "BONNARD," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Oct. 13). Don't miss this exhibition. Americans still don't appreciate Pierre Bonnard enough. He doesn't fit comfortably into the history of modernism, so he tends to be regarded as an anachronism, an Impressionist after Impressionism was dead. But his best art deserves to be ranked with Matisse's and Picasso's, and if you doubt this, spend time in the last rooms of the show. It ends with the paintings of Bonnard's wife, Marthe, in the bath -- mysterious elegies of love -- and with his self-portraits, which are unequaled, and that's not forgetting Rembrandt, van Gogh or anyone else. Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays, and Thursdays, 10:30 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Fridays, 10:30 A.M. to 8:30 P.M. Admission: $12.50; $9.50, students and the elderly (Kimmelman).
 
 "MATHEW BRADY'S PORTRAITS: IMAGES AS HISTORY, PHOTOGRAPHY AS ART," International Center of Photography Midtown, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43d Street, (212) 768-4682 (through Sept. 6). Brady's studio photographed most of the American men of achievement (and some of the women) of the mid-19th century. Brady was consciously trying to create a new kind of history to be read through the faces of the people who made the nation what it was. His enterprise also produced a major record of the Civil War. And then he went broke. This exhibition, the first in more than a century to show the full range of his work, is especially good at revealing how photography was disseminated through lithographed or engraved copies before the half-tone was invented. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Admission: $5.50; $4, students and the elderly (Vicki Goldberg).
 
 BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS, 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000. This is one the city's more animated and resilient cultural spaces, and this summer its exhibitions and permanent collection can be sampled both in the Bronx and in Manhattan. "Histories (Re)membered: Selections from the Permanent Collection of the Bronx Museum of the Arts" is in the lobby gallery of the PaineWebber building, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st Street, (212) 713-2885 (through Sept. 11). Hours: Mondays through Fridays, 8 A.M. to 6 P.M. Free. And four shows of contemporary art fill every inch of the museum. Two solo mid-career surveys, "Tomie Arai: Double Happiness" and "Rimer Cardillo: Araucaria," are on view through Sunday. An installation by Juan Sanchez, "1898: Rican/Struction, Multi-Layered Impressions" and the annual "Artists in the Marketplace Exhibition" are up through Sept. 27. The museum is a shaping player in New York art of the present and the future; it always repays a visit. Hours: Wednesdays, 3 P.M. to 9 P.M.; Thursdays and Fridays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Saturdays and Sundays, 1 P.M. to 6 P.M. Donation: $3; $2 for students over 12; $1 for the elderly (Holland Cotter).
 
 "ROBERT COLESCOTT: RECENT PAINTINGS," Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700 (through Oct. 4). Nineteen paintings by Mr. Colescott that represented the United States at the Venice Biennale last year. His raucous pictures swarm with cartoon characters who act out wildly scrambled blackface burlesques of race, sex, violence and death. Nothing if not contradictory, his paintings are also beautiful, smart and poetic. Though raw, they have a lush, painterly sensuality, and though bumptious, they speak to complex philosophical matters through metaphorically loaded images. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 P.M. Admission: $4; students and the elderly, $2 (Ken Johnson).
 
 * "DEEP STORAGE: COLLECTING, STORING AND ARCHIVING IN ART P.S. 1," P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through Aug. 30). This ambitious show documents the urge to document in recent art, a tendency broadened in the 1970's by Performance and Conceptual Art. With Duchamp's "Green Box," which documents his masterpiece "The Large Glass," among its jumping-off points, the show ranges through five decades of mostly American and German art that amasses and orders large quantities of things: be they objects, materials, images or bits of information. Joseph Cornell, On Kawara, Hanne Darboven and Bernd and Hilla Becher fill in the older generations. Representing the younger are Louise Lawler's deadpan photographs of museum storage rooms, an enormous installation piece (in a box) by Jason Rhoades and the portrait-lined pantheons of the painter David Deutsch. Of particular interest from Germany is Karsten Bott's "One of Each," a manically methodical accumulation of everyday objects, and "Detonation Deutschland," a video installation by Piero Steinle and Julian Rosenfeldt that orchestrates images and sounds of old German buildings being blown up, to mesmerizing, ineffably sad effect. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 P.M. Admission: $4; $2 for students and the elderly (Smith).
 
 "MARTIN LEWIS'S WORLD: CITYSCAPES ON PAPER," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Oct. 25). Few printmakers of the 1920's and 30's caught the spirit of New York in that era with quite the pizazz of Lewis (1881-1962), an Australian who came to the city at 19 and made it his own. Buildings, views, neighborhoods, street gangs, storefronts, rooftops, shoppers, workers, idlers, relationships, even the weather seemed especially staged for Lewis, who got it all down in black and white, capturing people and architecture in the etching and drypoint technique of which he was a master. At his best, he was a wonderful chronicler and illustrator whose vision of the city rings true. The show is accompanied by the period photographs of other intense urbanites like Berenice Abbott, Lewis Hine, Arthur Leipzig, Walter Rosenblum and Adolf Fassbender. You could cut the nostalgia here with a knife, but it's a pleasant wallow. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Saturdays, 11 A.M. to 9 P.M.; Sundays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Admission: $10; $6 for children under 12 (Glueck).
 
 * WILLIAM SIDNEY MOUNT, "Painter of American Life," New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, through Oct. 25. American 19th-century art is rarely as simple as it looks, and such is the case with the work of Mount (1807-1868). Mount more or less invented American genre painting, with its emblematic scenes of everyday life, and this carefully honed show of his smallish paintings captures the spirit of an enigmatic man and his complex time. His scenes of barn dances and cider making are, at their best, magisterial in structure and rich in observed detail. But many of them are also highly coded and opinionated political commentaries touching on the inflammatory issues of race, political morality and the double-edged power of popular culture. Mount's own take on his subjects is often ambiguous; and his willingness to let his art be inscrutable is provocative. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission: $5; $3, students and the elderly (Cotter)
 
 * FABRIZIO PLESSI, Guggenheim Museum SoHo, 575 Broadway at Prince Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Sept. 13). Well known in Europe for his large-scale video installations, Mr. Plessi weighs in for the first time in New York with four room-size works. The common theme is the clever theatrical play of video imagery with down-to-earth substances and situations: water, stone, metal, architectural elements and the like. In short, he mixes the virtual with the real, as in the show's most impressive piece, "Baroque Cathodic Movements" (1996), in which three ominious-looking wooden structures, painted black and echoing 17th-century architectural motifs, gyrate slowly from the ceiling. Each resembles a sort of furnace whose maw contains amazingly real-looking video flames that appear to be consuming the ancient architecture with a fierce roar. Ultra-theatrical, a ballet in themselves, they suggest coffins for the past while conveying a shivery sense of hellfire and brimstone. Hours: Sundays, and Wednesdays through Fridays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Saturdays, 11 A.M. to 8 P.M. Admission: $8; $5, students and the elderly (Glueck).
 
 CHARLES RAY, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Aug. 30). The sculptures by this Los Angeles artist in his mid career survey include a mannequin with real-looking genitals; a pseudo-Minimalist black cube filled with ink, but not so that you could tell it isn't solid -- a trick of the eye -- and, exceptionally, a painstaking, strangely melancholic reconstruction in all-gray Fiberglas of a wrecked Pontiac. There's also a 12-minute 16-millimeter film, a la 60's home movies, during which a mannish woman models 100 spectacularly awful outfits by Mr. Ray. The effect is a kind of slacker Surrealism, with nods to Kinetic Art, Body Art, Pop and so on. Mr. Ray's truest virtue is combining his strange wit with a certain hangdog humanity. His photographs of himself, for instance, look calculatedly, touchingly ridiculous. He's the nerd with the pocket protector, Harold Lloyd dangling from the clock, one of the guys in "The Full Monty." We sympathize. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).
 
 LIISA ROBERTS, "Blind Side," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 74th Street, (212) 945-3600 (through Oct. 4). Borrowing a little too much from "Wavelength," the 1967 avant-garde film classic by Michael Snow, this young American artist has created a well-thought-out film installation involving twin life-size images of a formal sitting room through whose windows day changes to night and back again in about six minutes. The viewer's reflection and shadow provide the figurative element as the room disappears and reappears, and the windows, looking out on a bustling city, suddenly resemble little film screens. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).
 
 * "TONY SMITH: ARCHITECT, PAINTER, SCULPTOR," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Sept. 22). Tony Smith's works work, when they do, by causing you to look carefully, as Smith did, at the way geometric forms can be combined into abstract shapes that seem to shift as you move around them. Change, the idea that the same forms can keep mutating in provocative ways, is Smith's constant. A virtue of the Modern's intelligent, not-too-large retrospective is that it brings together the three aspects of his career -- architecture, painting and sculpture -- so that we can see, for example, how Smith's approach to form had as much to do with Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe as with Barnett Newman and Clyfford Still, and more to do with Newman and Still than with Donald Judd. When it's not good, Smith's work suggests a certain anonymous and chilly indifference because he brought an architect's mentality to everything; he planned what he often let others complete. At the same time, he spent a lifetime trying to endow geometry with feeling, to distill emotion from indifferent forms; and there was a sense of wonderment in the way he kept discovering new shapes in these forms. Hours: See above. Admission: $9.50; $6.50, students and the elderly (Kimmelman).
 
 * "LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AT THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 31). This austere exhibition, drawn almost entirely from the Met's collection, outlines Tiffany's varied production in the exquisite detail for which he is justifiably known. The opulent sensuousness comes across in small doses, sometimes kitschy, sometimes innovative. Included are examples of furniture, jewelry, ceramics, enameled objects, paintings and design studies, stained-glass windows and lamps, and the Favrile glass vases that are his most lasting achievement. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).
 
 * "THE UNICORN TAPESTRIES," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sept. 6). The Unicorn Tapestries are among the most famous works housed at the Cloisters, the Metropolitan's upper Manhattan branch devoted to medieval art. But this year they're spending the summer downtown at the museum's main headquarters on Fifth Avenue. Who commissioned them, where they were made and what their images are all about are still matters for speculation. But they've had a fascinating history -- including a stint protecting potatoes against frost after the French Revolution -- and they are absolutely exquisite. Dense with flowers, animals and courtly hunters, with the unicorn himself at the center, playing the part of a captivated lover or perhaps the suffering Christ, they have a tumultuous vivacity and suggest the flavor of a medieval world in which every detail of life was exactingly recorded and everything was more than it seemed. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).
 
 "URBAN ENCOUNTERS," New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, (212) 219-1222 (through Sept. 20). This jam-packed exhibition documents the histories of six activist art collectives that have held their own in Manhattan over the last decade and more: ABC No Rio, Bullet Space, Godzilla, Guerrilla Girls, Repohistory and World War III Illustrated. The curator, Gregory Sholette, asked each group to design its own installation, and the results are full of visual incident and detailed historical information. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 P.M.; Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, noon to 8 P.M. Admission: $5; $3, students over 18, artists and the elderly (Cotter).
 
Galleries: Uptown
 
 "PORTRAITS OBSCURED," Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313 (through Sept. 12). This oppressively museumlike show presents one work each by seven famous male heavyweights, living and dead. The title is loosely relevant: there's a camouflaged self-portrait by Andy Warhol and a big collage of expressionistic ancestral portraits by Anselm Kiefer. A gloomy, gray, abstracted woman by Picasso could portray a lover. But works by Jean-Michel Basquiat (a nice one), David Smith, Willem de Kooning and Francesco Clemente don't look like portraits at all (Johnson).
 
 "SHIP/SHAPE," Keith de Lellis, 47 East 68th Street, (212) 327-1482 (through Aug. 28). The shapes of ships, from ocean liners to rowboats, from purely architectural studies to romantic visions, is the substance of this show. It includes some 70 prints by more than 30 photographers, from 1914 to the mid-60's. Celebrated talents like Edward Steichen, Weegee and Margaret Bourke-White share wall space with lesser-known photographers like the future Edward VIII when he was the Prince of Wales. Among the more striking images are Herbert Matter's 1938 close-up of a pair of worn, weathered sails in full rig, James Doolittle's 1930 study of a sturdy anchor chain dropped from the skyscraper prow of a huge ocean liner, and Gordon Coster's "Untitled (Sky)" (1929), a view of a big, cloudy sky with the cabin and masts of a ship just visible on the horizon line. The show is a beguiling way to spend an hour at sea (Glueck).
 
 * STEVE WHEELER, Richard York Gallery, 21 East 65th Street, (212) 772-9155 (through Aug. 28). Steve Wheeler was of the Abstract Expressionist generation but went his own way in small, intricate linear compositions. Here, 15 gouaches and their silk-screen counterparts, made in 1947 to illustrate the artist's own, self-promotional monograph "Hello Steve," offer implosive little worlds in which no centimeter is left unactivated. "Marine Garden," with its jazzy, calligraphic forms in white on blue-gray paper has the snappy elegance of a Cole Porter song (Johnson).
Galleries: 57th Street
 
 SHIRLEY GOLDFARB, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 752-1223 (through Sept. 4). Ms. Goldfarb's paintings from the 1960's and 70's look good enough to make you wonder why you've never heard of her. She was born in Altoona, Pa., in 1925, and lived in Paris from 1954 until her death in 1980. During the 60's she began using a palette knife to create all-over fields of little squares. Some are monochromatic, some multicolored; "Chartres" has the bejeweled luminosity of stained glass (Johnson).
 
 YASUHIKO TSUCHIDA, Yoshii Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 265-8876 (through Aug. 31). A dozen lovely cups by a young Japanese-born glassmaker who lives and works in Italy. Each handleless cup has a slightly wobbly, irregular form and appears to have been made by fusing separate facets, resulting in loose grid or checkerboard patterns. They're not great art, but the jewel-like colors and the humble, slightly comical forms are irresistible (Johnson).
 
Galleries: SoHo
 
 "ANONYMOUS," the Work Space, 96 Spring Street, (212) 219-2790, (through Sept. 12). More photography about photography and truth. This show focuses on the human figure, which appears anonymous because, in most cases, it's so blurry. Tanya Marcuse's small, fragmentary shots of bridal lingerie and skin are sexy; Jon Naiman's large picture of a corpulent fellow with feet and head cut off by a paper floor and ceiling is funny. But too much of the show is caught up in uninteresting technical manipulations (Johnson).
 
 PAUL DICKERSON, American Fine Arts, 22 Wooster Street, (212) 941-0401 (through Sept. 3). Most of the improvisational, trash-laden assemblages in this exhibition were made in the three years before Paul Dickerson (1961-1997), a New York sculptor, committed suicide, and have never been exhibited. Thus this is simultaneously a show of new work and last work, of promise and finality. The pieces exude a fierce, not always pleasant energy, suggesting a studio that looked more like a junkyard, and an artist who challenged himself to make a sculpture from the first 3 or 5 or 10 things that caught his eye. His drawings are peppered with pertinent remarks, as in the Frank Stella-esque aphorism: "Whatever you want to call it is whatever you want to call it" (Smith).
 
 "HEADSTAND," Elga Wimmer Gallery, 560 Broadway at Prince Street, (212) 274-0274 (through Aug. 31). Obliquely true to its title, this scruffy exhibition features five young artists whose work in sculpture, video and late Conceptual Art involves various inversions or displacements that twist reality one way or another. Subjects, objects or events include a demolition derby, traveling through the sewers of Los Angeles, grass-covered models of Manhattan, Marge Simpson's hair and substitute parents. The artists responsible are Tim Hutchings, Jennifer Cohen, Henry Steingieser, Jane Benson and Kristin Mojsiewicz. A good time is had by all (Smith).
 
 ANN LOVETT, Dorsky Gallery, 379 West Broadway, near Broome Street, (212) 966-6170 (through Aug. 28). In "Conundrum," a neatly composed installation combining photographs of antique medical books, pictures of her own naked body printed on loose, sheer fabric and a room-circulating line of text that reads, "Neglect me, absolve me, ignore me, want me, consume me" and so on, Ann Lovett evokes familiar connections between ideology and the body. The didactic tends to override the poetic (Johnson).
 
 "MAPS," Paul Kasmin Gallery, 74 Grand Street, (212) 219-3219 (through Aug. 28). Don't expect conventional cartography in this group of maps by six artists, each of whom has his own interpretation of the word. The broadest is James Turrell's grand-scale topographical drawing for his "Roden Crater" project, the reshaping of an extinct volcano rim north of Flagstaff, Ariz. The most "mappish" is Buckminster Fuller's "Dymaxion Air-Ocean World Map" of 1980, said to be the least distorted layout of the Earth's surface in cartographic history. Other views of the world, or particular pieces of it, are offered by Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, Donald Baechler and the Italian team of Alighiero e Boetti, whose flat, colorfully embroidered rendition of the globe delineates each country in terms of its national flag. Move over, Rand McNally (Glueck).
 
Galleries: Chelsea
 
 RINALDO HOPF, "Golden Queers," Wessel & O'Connor, 242 West 26th Street, (212) 242-8811 (through Aug. 28). A celebratory installation of 69 Warhol-style portraits of famous gay (or supposedly gay) people by this German artist. Each photo-based canvas is silk-screened in black on white, and the figure's skin is gold-leafed. Subjects include Allen Ginsberg, Sophocles and Eugene Delacroix. The whole-wall grid has a nice decorative impact, but the pictures are too mechanical. Warhol himself would have done it with more stylish sensuality (Johnson).
 
Other Galleries
 
 "SECTION 33," Dumbo Arts Center, 45 York Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 624-3772 (through Sept. 19). This exhibition inaugurates the Dumbo (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass) Arts Center. The mixed bag of works by 15 artists is less adventurous than you'd expect of such an upstart enterprise. Notable items include Richard Bottwin's compact, geometrically playful plywood constructions; white, ivory smooth surfaces bearing tiny incidents of organic abstraction by Sonita Singwi; and sensitively rendered industrial landscapes by Nicholas Evans-Cato (Johnson).
 
Last Chance
 
 "THE ACADEMY AND AMERICAN ART: HISTORY AND HIGHLIGHTS," National Academy Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through Sunday). A good, economical selection of works from the museum's collection, including a pair of over-inflated allegories by the Hudson River School painter Asher B. Durand, a couple of dark seascapes by Albert Pinkham Ryder, two lovely still lifes, by William Merritt Chase (a sparkling silver ewer and a Chinese teapot) and John La Farge (a lush magnolia blossom in a purple glass), and a sharp, faux-folk portrait carved in wood by Anne Arnold. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 P.M.; Fridays, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Admission: $5; $3.50, students and the elderly (Johnson).
 
 "MASTERS OF COLOR AND LIGHT: HOMER, SARGENT AND THE AMERICAN WATERCOLOR MOVEMENT," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Sunday). The 140 paintings are all from the museum's estimable watercolor collection, which hasn't been given an airing on this scale in more than a decade. The chronological span is broad and the selection eclectic, with a core group of about a dozen pieces each by Winslow Homer and John Singer Sargent. What's most engaging is the story the show tells of how an art form rose from humble origins to help define what "American" meant in American art. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).
 
 GORDON MATTA-CLARK, "Reorganizing Structure by Drawing Through It," P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through Sunday). An extensive exhibition of works on paper by the visionary architectural deconstructor, who died in 1978 at age 35. Felt-tip pen drawings of imaginary plants, clouds of little arrows, sketchy diagrams and geometric figures cut through stacks of paper all show graphic ingenuity. But nothing on paper conveys as effectively as several films in video form what a boldly original artist Matta-Clark was. Also on display are two reconstructions of vintage works: "Dumpster," a maze in a real Dumpster, and "Doors, Floors, Doors," a vertical shaft cut through four floors. Hours and admission: See above (Johnson).

Thanks to Overseas Sales, Honda Reports Big Profit Gain

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 20

 BODY:
The Honda Motor Company is benefiting more than ever from its global reach, a distinction once ridiculed by domestically focused competitors in Japan's automotive industry.
Even with the domestic market shrinking rapidly, Japan's No. 3 auto maker, behind Toyota and Nissan, reported a 26 percent profit gain today for the latest quarter, largely because of sales in Europe and in Honda's largest market, the United States. 
 Those overseas sales once earned Honda criticism, much the same way that Sony's vast international sales once led industry titans here to dismiss it as "not really a Japanese company."
These days, with almost every Japanese business executive praising the benefits of globalization, Honda's pioneering spirit is admired.
Its new president, Hiroyuki Yoshino, says he believes the reach that Honda has already established will protect it from the forces of consolidation sweeping the global automobile business.
With Daimler buying Chrysler, Volkswagen buying Rolls-Royce and BMW clearly looking to expand, the Japanese auto makers seem like attractive potential partners with their dominance of Japan's huge car market and deep penetration in Asia.
But Mr. Yoshino says he is convinced that the Japanese auto makers can hold their own. "The way I look at Daimler and Chrysler is: Chrysler is really only in North America, Benz has only a small presence there," he said in an interview earlier this month. "They didn't have a global strategy."
Honda makes more than 100 products in 40 countries. "Honda's global strategy has been established, and I think it is top rate," Mr. Yoshino said. "We build our cars in North America, Asia and Europe -- we're already there."
Mr. Yoshino also has a novel way of looking at Honda's spot in the global hierarchy of car manufacturers. Annually, Honda sells about 5 million motorcycles and 3 million pieces of power equipment, he points out, in addition to 2.3 million cars.
"Even G.M. sells only nine million units a year, and Toyota sells only five million," he said, only half in jest. "If you look at it on a unit basis, we're outselling them."
That may sound arrogant. But Honda has needed a strong sense of itself just to survive.
Honda is not a member of a kei retsu, the powerful business agglomerations built around banks that have until recently provided endless amounts of credit regardless of borrower quality.
Honda has been more reliant on shareholders and the capital markets for financing, and it has done a good job of making them happy. "It's one of the most transparent companies in Japan," said Noriaki Hirakata, an automotive analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo.
An example of the company's honest appraisal of its performance came earlier this month when Honda reported a small increase in June domestic sales. Rather than portraying the increase as a sign of strength, Mr. Yoshino explained that it was largely because of a change in the way that Accord station wagons were counted. Domestically sold Accord wagons produced elsewhere -- and thus not counted in the 1997 numbers -- were now produced in Japan and counted in 1998.
"I don't want to give too much of an impression of success," he said.
Mr. Hirakata at Morgan Stanley and others have some concerns about Honda. One is whether the company may run out of production capacity. Another is whether it can continue to make money pursuing the "small is smart" strategy it is pursuing in the domestic market.
Honda, like other auto manufacturers, has had more luck selling mini-cars in the Japanese market, where rising unemployment, a shaky financial system and a virtually nonexistent social safety net are among the worries keeping consumers from showrooms.
In October, the company will start selling newly designed mini-cars, and Mr. Yoshino said he was confident they would help Honda's second-half performance. He said Honda must rely on smaller cars to sustain its performance in Japan, since an economic turnaround was unlikely any time soon.
Smaller cars, however, typically provide smaller profit margins. Mr. Yoshino said he was not worried.
"We've made profit on the mini-cars that we've been selling so far, and profits from the ones we start selling in October should be higher," he said.
As for capacity constraints, Mr. Yoshino said he could understand the worries. But he was uneasy about the United States market, where Honda will introduce a redesigned Acura later this year, and said he was reluctant to commit more capital to production lines at this time.
"With that concern in the back of my head, what we'll do is stick to our current production capacity," he said, adding that the company could compensate for some capacity limitations by purchasing employees' paid vacation time so they could keep working.
Mr. Yoshino also noted that Honda had a second North American line opening in Canada, where it would produce mini-vans.
On the home front, Honda's nemesis, the Toyota Motor Corporation, has also thrown down a challenge. Toyota, Japan's largest auto maker, is worried about the unpopularity of its cars among younger people and has vowed to woo that demographic group, which is Honda's main customer base.
Mr. Yoshino acknowledged that Toyota was a threat, but said he was not intimidated. "One reason we attract younger people is the motorcycle business and our reputation in it," he said. "We also are back in Formula One racing, which helps, too."
His predecessor, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, took Honda out of that business in 1992 when profits were hard to come by, but put it back in this spring, announcing plans to return to Formula One racing in 2000.
Mr. Yoshino conceded that Toyota's stodgy image had been helped by its hybrid "clean" car, Prius, which uses an electric battery and gasoline engine and is far lower in emissions than a regular car.
"I am gritting my teeth a bit," Mr. Yoshino said of the flood of good press Toyota has enjoyed from Prius. "But I'd say their technical expertise with that car is not so great."
Whatever his opinion about Toyota's technical expertise, he is not repeating Mr. Kawamoto's bold suggestion that Honda, which produces fewer than half the cars Toyota does, could overtake Toyota as Japan's No. 1 car maker.
"Bigger is not always better," he said. "If everything else stays the same, then bigger is better. But things rarely stay the same."

HEADLINE: Fed Voted 10 to 1 in July to Keep Rates the Same

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers voted 10 to 1 at their meeting on July 1 to leave the overnight bank lending rate unchanged at 5.50 percent, minutes of the session released today showed.
Jerry Jordan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, dissented for the third time this year, citing growth in the money supply as a reason to raise the lending rate. "He believed that the unsustainably rapid growth of domestic demand -- fueled by the acceleration of money and credit growth in the past year -- was reflected in the recent sharp increase in imports," according to the minutes. 
 The Federal Open Market Committee also maintained a stance, or bias, at the meeting in favor of raising the interest rate target, if need be, to guard against an acceleration of inflation, the minutes showed. The committee shifted to a heightened state of alert at its meeting in March.
"Many of the members expressed concern that the expansion in demand might continue at a fast enough pace to raise pressures on wages and prices over time," the minutes showed. In addition, several members emphasized "that they continued to see a high probability that some tightening of monetary policy would be needed later to curb rising inflationary pressures."
William Poole, president of the Fed bank in St. Louis, who had dissented at the meeting on May 19, decided at the July meeting that an immediate interest rate increase was not needed. Mr. Jordan argued at the March 31 and May 19 meetings for higher interest rates.
The latest minutes show there was less division in July than in May. "It looks to be a little less hawkish," said John Ryding, senior economist at Bear, Stearns in New York. "It probably increases the chances they switched to a neutral directive" at this week's meeting, he said.
The committee voted on Tuesday to leave the overnight rate unchanged. Minutes of that meeting will be released in early October.
Fed members said that it was too early to determine what effects the turmoil in Asia would have on the United States economy. Still, "several suggested that the consequences were likely to be more severe and longer lasting than they had anticipated earlier," the minutes showed.

VenezuelanStocks Tumble On Fears of a Devaluation

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Aug. 20

 BODY:
Venezuelan stocks plunged 9.5 percent today, the biggest one-day drop in nearly four years, as the market here was rattled by worries that the Government might devalue its currency.
With investors concerned about possible currency devaluations in Latin America, the selloff was felt on markets from New York to Argentina. Mexico's chief market index fell 2.93 percent. In Brazil, the Sao Paulo stock exchange's Bovespa index fell 6.4 percent, to its lowest level in nine months. And in New York, Brady bonds and American depository receipts of Latin American companies fell sharply. 
 The Caracas Stock Exchange's general index fell 363.82 points, to 3,460.64, its lowest since April 1996. The drop was the largest since Nov. 21, 1994. Venezuelan bond prices also tumbled, with the yield on the latest 20-year global bond soaring to 23.37 percent, up from 13.98 percent on July 30, when Venezuela sold $500 million of the bonds.
"There's definitely nervousness in the market, and it's justified," said Francis Freisinger, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Company. "Russia's collapse has added psychological pressure."
The financial turmoil here has created long lines outside exchange houses as anxious Venezuelans line up to buy dollars and it appears to have bolstered the electoral chances of one presidential candidate, Hugo Chavez Frias, a leader of a failed coup in 1992 who has said he may stop repaying foreign debt if he wins the December election.
Reports here said the Government was planning to devalue the currency, the bolivar, by as much as 20 percent. But Planning Minister Teodoro Petkoff said at a hastily arranged news conference today that the Government had no plans to devalue the bolivar.
"The stronger the denials, the more the likelihood of a devaluation -- we saw that in Russia," said Vinod Sehgal, managing director of SG Cowen Securities in New York. "Markets are effectively closed to them."
A 33 percent plunge in oil prices this year narrowed petroleum-rich Venezuela's trade surplus and widened its budget deficit, putting pressure on the currency. The Government relies on taxes on oil exports for almost half its revenue and on Wednesday said that it might scrap a $1.4 billion bond sale because of surging interest rates, making it harder to plug the deficit.
Despite the turmoil on stock and bond markets, the bolivar steadied today. The currency ended at 574.50 bolivars to the dollar, compared with Wednesday's close of 573.25 bolivars.

HEADLINE: Mildred E.B. Smith, Specialist In Agriculture, Is Dead at 99

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Mildred Elizabeth Buller Smith, who cut a singular swath through the 20th century by, among other things, picking apples and digging potatoes for the Women's Land Army in World War I, riding herd on New England milk prices for the Office of Price Administration in World War II and becoming a Connecticut television celebrity as a consumer price specialist, died on Aug. 12 at a nursing home in Hartford. She was 99, and it seems almost beside the point to note that she had been an agricultural economist for the University of Connecticut.
To say that Miss Smith followed her own path would hardly do justice to someone who became a farm specialist after growing up on the streets of Chicago. 
 But Miss Smith, who spent several girlhood summers on a farm, was ever an original, one whose career included driving a hotel jitney in Florida, starting and running the country store for Henry and Clara Ford's Wayside Inn in Sudbury, Mass., and creating and starring in "Millie's Market Basket" on Connecticut television.
Never one to be hampered by convention, Miss Smith went to work for the agriculture department of the Connecticut Agricultural College before she received a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago; became an assistant professor at the University of Connecticut (as the agricultural college became in 1938) before she received a master's degree from Radcliffe College, and never did bother to get a doctorate, although she did complete postgraduate studies at the London School of Economics.
For someone born in the Victorian era, Miss Smith adapted well to 20th-century culture, much to the occasional dismay of her mother, a staid woman who had derived her Victorian outlook in situ, growing up in England, and who was properly shocked when her daughter, who had not come of age in the Roaring Twenties for nothing, would go off for weekends with her young man of the moment.
(Miss Smith, whose romantic life became a subject of intense speculation among her grandnieces and grandnephews, apparently found a satisfying solution to the problem of juggling job and family: attracting a steady supply of smitten suitors without actually succumbing to matrimony. She derived enormous delight a few years ago when she received a proposal from an admirer at her Hartford retirement community on the very day the Social Security Administration notified her that she had died -- as, it turned out, another Mildred Smith had done.)
Miss Smith's sense of personal mission began early. With three of her four older brothers serving in the military in World War I, she was so eager to do her part that, ignoring her mother's objections, she dropped out of the University of Chicago to enlist in the Women's Land Army, a paramilitary organization that sought to fill the vacuum left by mobilized farm workers.
Typically, Miss Smith, who had a lifelong fascination with statistics, not only picked apples and dug potatoes on a farm in East Corinth, Vt., but counted them, computing yields and other data for reports that she later deposited with the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe.
After the fall harvest one year, the farmer whose land she had worked tried to find her a winter job at a resort that his friend Henry Ford owned in Eustis, Fla., but wondered whether Miss Smith knew how to drive, a requirement for the job of shuttling guests to and from the train station.
In a reply that later delighted her grandnieces and grandnephews, Miss Smith reassured him: "I've been driving tractors since I was 12."
Indeed, Miss Smith did so well as a jitney driver that she apparently impressed Ford and his wife, Clara. In 1923, when they bought the inn made famous by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, they recruited Miss Smith to start and run the country store that became a part of the historic restoration and preservation project.
By 1931, Miss Smith had found her life's work in academia, but after a decade as a statistician and consumer price specialist at the University of Connecticut, she decided that it was time to complete her own college education.
So, again flouting convention, she returned to Chicago and received her degree at age 42.
Later, after becoming an assistant professor in 1943 and spending three years with the O.P.A.'s Boston office, she received a master's degree from Radcliffe.
She remained an assistant professor, but her work as a teacher and consumer marketing specialist -- among other things turning out pamphlets and conducting radio and television programs stressing thrift -- was so impressive that when she retired in 1961, she was named professor emeritus.
In retirement Miss Smith wrote historical pamphlets on New England agriculture and taught herself bookbinding, selling leather-bound notebooks and other items at craft fairs to finance her yen for travel, which included 18 trips to England and the Continent, where as a young woman, it should come as no surprise, she had climbed the Matterhorn.

Foreign Turmoil Drives Investors From Dow to Treasuries

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Turmoil in overseas economies sent investors fleeing stocks for the safety of bonds yesterday, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to another new low.
Rumors that Russian bank failures were imminent and that Venezuela might be forced to devalue its currency, the bolivar, to combat a growing budget deficit, and persistent concerns about a similar move by China, buoyed the Treasury market. All of these things added to investor conerns that the financial crises among emerging markets might be spreading. 
 In addition, an announcement by President Clinton that the United States had bombed suspected terrorist camps in Afghanistan and the Sudan in retaliation for the bombings at United States embassies in East Africa earlier this month contributed to a strong rally in Treasuries in the afternoon.
"We've got a lot of disturbing things going on around the world," said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Company International. "In that type of environment, the Treasury market is the best place to be."
The migration to the Treasury market hurt stock prices, which fell for a second day after a rally earlier in the week. Analysts cautioned that further declines were possible.
Meanwhile, the dollar fell for the fourth consecutive day against the yen, reflecting fears that the Japanese Government would sell dollars to defend the yen's value.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 81.87 points, to 8,611.41. Financial services companies like American Express and J. P. Morgan led the declines. The drop in those shares reflected investor concerns that Venezuela's plight might hurt other Latin American economies and jeopardize bank holdings of emerging-market debt as well as repayment of loans made to those countries.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 6.46 points, to 1,091.60. The Nasdaq, led by declines in the chip-related stocks Intel and Applied Materials, lost 10.24 points, to 1,832.45.
The 30-year Treasury bond's price rose 21/32 to 99 28/32, which means bond investors gained about $6.56 for each $1,000 of bonds they held.
The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 5.51 percent, from 5.55 percent. The yield is now at its lowest level since the Treasury Department began issuing the bonds on a regular basis in 1977.
The strength in the bond market may last a while. Analysts said one sign of its stamina is that long-term bond yields have been below 5.60 percent for six consecutive days.
In addition, many analysts say that bond yields can fall further, causing the Treasury yield curve to flatten even more as the spread between long-term yields and those on shorter-term Treasury securities narrows. A flattening yield curve can be an indication that interest rates will fall.
"I actually expect that to happen," said Kathleen Camilli, director of economic research at Tucker Anthony, a regional brokerage firm.
Ms. Camilli said the long bond's yield could fall to 5 percent this year. At that level, the yield would fall below the current Federal Funds target rate, a benchmark for short-term interest rates, now at 5.5 percent.
Such a move might prompt the Federal Reserve to lower short-term interest rates, she forecast.
At present, yields on shorter-term Treasury securities, like the 10-year and 2-year notes, are already below 5.5 percent. That indicates, Ms. Camilli and several other economists said, that investors believe that the next move by the Fed will be to lower interest rates.
If Treasury yields fall further, it might send investors rushing back to stocks, said Anthony Conroy, a managing director at Bankers Trust Global Investment Management. At lower yield levels, investors might decide that they can get a higher return by investing in stocks, he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. FURY ON 2 CONTINENTS: THE BACKGROUND;
Long Enmity Between U.S. And Sudan Boils Over

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Aug. 20

 BODY:
The air strike against a factory in the Sudan today marked the first act of open warfare in the long-simmering hostilities between the United States and the Islamic Government in Khartoum.
Washington has been at odds with the governing National Islamic Front in the Sudan almost from the moment it seized power in a 1989 coup and set up a conservative Islamic theocracy. 
 Over the last nine years, the United States has repeatedly accused the Khartoum Government not only of supporting Islamic revolutionaries in neighboring countries but also of harboring various anti-American and anti-Israeli Arab terrorists, among them leaders of the Palestinian group, Hamas, the Cairo-based Islamic Holy War and the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood.
One of the most important of these figures is Osama bin Laden, the Saudi businessman whom American investigators accuse of organizing the bombings of United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania two weeks ago.
Mr. bin Laden lived for several years in the Sudan and still owns several major businesses there.
In a speech justifying the air strikes today, President Clinton said the factory American missiles destroyed about 12 miles north of the Sudanese capital was "associated with the Bin Laden network." He said the plant was manufacturing chemicals used in nerve gas, while the Sudanese said it made drugs.
Today, angry Sudanese demonstrated outside the burning factory, while hundreds more stormed the American Embassy, throwing stones and chanting anti-American slogans, according to the Associated Press.
The United States removed its diplomats two years ago, but the compound was sometimes used when diplomats came in for meetings. It was closed after the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed.
Khartoum has long charged that Washington supports a protracted rebellion in the mostly Christian and animist southern part of the country. The revolt has cost more than 1 million lives in the last decade.
The southern rebels have been struggling against Khartoum for 15 years, but their movement has been crippled by factional divisions. They maintain they are fighting for more autonomy for the south, a secular government and religious freedom.
The Clinton Administration denies it supports the rebels directly, but it acknowledges giving military aid, not including weapons, to the neighboring countries of Uganda, Eritrea and Ethiopia, which have in turn funneled arms, radios and other equipment to the rebels.
American officials have also made it plain that the United States supports the rebellion's goals. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright even met with the main rebel leader, John Garang, last December during a visit to Uganda.
For their part, the leaders of the Sudanese Government, however, blame the United States for the continuing war, which has sapped the economy and demoralized northerners. Many in Khartoum see the rebellion as part of an American strategy to undermine the Sudan and eventually oust its Government.
The war serves other American goals in the Middle East. It weakens Khartoum's ability to support Islamic militants opposed to Egypt's Government.
Over the last year, members of the Sudan's political elite have taken pains to present a less threatening image internationally.
A new Constitution adopted this year guarantees the freedom of religion and association, opening the door to a return to party politics, they say.
Since 1996, they maintain they have tightened immigration rules to keep out terrorists and expelled many known Islamic militants. They also point out they have reached peace agreements with all the major rebel leaders except Mr. Garang and are in negotiations with him.
But American diplomats have dismissed many of these measures as cosmetic. American intelligence officials say the Sudan continues to provide a haven to terrorist organizations and that the National Islamic Front's leaders still have an iron grip on power.
As rescue workers struggled tonight to ferry wounded workers to hospitals and to put out the fire at Al Shifa pharmaceutical factory, Sudanese officials portrayed themselves as the victims of naked aggression.
Ghazi Salaheddin, the Information Minister, said the plant had been opened two years ago and produced nothing but medicines.
"This is a crime," he said. "There is no justification for this attack."
But Mr. Salaheddin said the attack was predictable, given the recent history of the two countries. In a sense, he suggested, the simmering conflict between the United States and the Khartoum government had finally come out into the open.
"We would like to remind people that this is a very old battle between right and wrong," he said.

HEADLINE: New Jersey May Cancel Staten Island Rail Link

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
A half-finished freight rail link between Staten Island and New Jersey was dealt a setback yesterday when an official in Union County, N.J., moved to pull out of the joint project, saying that changes in the plan meant that New York City now stood to reap nearly all the benefits.
The move outraged the Giuliani administration, which with the help of Federal money has rebuilt tracks and a bridge across the Arthur Kill that would give New York City freight direct access to the world west of the Hudson for the first time in nearly a decade. The New Jersey section of the project, a five-mile link to Conrail's main north-south tracks, is still being designed. One New York official said the project was now a "bridge to nowhere." 
 The Union County Manager, Michael J. Lapolla, recommended yesterday that the county's Board of Freeholders withdraw from the project at the next board meeting. He said that the project originally called for the operator to provide local freight rail service for businesses in New Jersey towns. Now, he said, Norfolk Southern/CSX, the freight giant recently appointed to operate the rail link, planned to use the New Jersey part of the track solely as a means to take freight from Howland Hook Marine Terminal on Staten Island to Conrail's Lehigh Valley line, on larger trains than were originally contemplated.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is coordinating the project, and environmental groups that have supported it criticized Mr. Lapolla, saying he was overlooking an important benefit of the project: It would get thousands of trucks off Union County's congested roads.
"Based on the tremendous regional benefits for both New York and New Jersey, it would be shortsighted if this project did not move forward," said Christopher O. Ward, the Port Authority's chief of planning and external affairs.
Although the State of New Jersey owns the track on the New Jersey side and could complete the link without Union County's approval, state transportation officials said they would not interfere.
New York City, New Jersey, the Federal Government and the Port Authority have provided $30 million for the link.
Charles Millard, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, the agency in charge of New York's part of the project, said he hoped the Board of Freeholders would defy Mr. Lapolla at its meeting on Aug. 27. But the nine freeholders tend to go along with the county government, and Mr. Lapolla said he consulted them before making his recommendation.
The disputed project began in 1994. On the Staten Island side, New York City has bought and rebuilt 15 miles of track on the north shore of Staten Island and refurbished the 39-year-old Arthur Kill Lift Bridge, which has a 500-foot-long span that can be raised 100 feet to let ships pass through. The bridge has not been used since 1991.
Rail access, Mr. Ward said, is crucial to the future of the Howland Hook Terminal, near the base of the bridge, which was reopened in 1996. Howland Hook handles about 65,000 freight containers a year, less than 5 percent of the total volume of the Port of New York and New Jersey.
The New Jersey section of the project runs west though Elizabeth, Linden, Roselle and Cranford before linking up with the Conrail's Lehigh Valley line, one of the main freight lines in the Northeast.
As originally conceived, Mr. Lapolla said -- and state and Port Authority officials agree -- the operator of the line would have been a small freight carrier that would offer freight service to industries along the line and along another stretch of track west of the Lehigh Valley line. This, Mr. Lapolla said, would have allowed the county to market and redevelop several vacant industrial parcels and "brownfields."
"The whole point of us being involved in this was to redevelop abandoned, underutilized properties," he said.
But after Norfolk Southern and CSX reached an agreement to take over Conrail's operations earlier this year, the conglomerate, which is the largest freight carrier east of the Mississippi, expressed an interest in operating the line itself.
In May, the agencies involved in the project -- including Union County -- appointed Norfolk Southern/ CSX to run the line. But at a meeting last month, Mr. Lapolla said, Norfolk Southern/CSX officials told him they did not intend to offer local service immediately and instead planned to upgrade the track to run bigger, heavier trains from Howland Hook on Staten Island. Norfolk Southern/ CSX officials would not comment yesterday.
Mr. Lapolla criticized the Port Authority, saying it failed to insure that the county got the rail access it was offered. He called the situation "another example of the county getting the short end of the stick" from the authority, which owns more than 2,000 acres there, mostly at Port Elizabeth and Newark International Airport. For years, Union County and Elizabeth have been trying to get the Port Authority to increase the $1.7 million a year it pays in lieu of property taxes.
There are other possibilities for moving freight off Staten Island by rail. The Port Authority has proposed a connection from the New Jersey side of the Arthur Kill Bridge to existing freight tracks on the Chemical Coast line, which refineries on Union County's waterfront. But the Mayor of Elizabeth, J. Christian Bollwage, opposes that link, saying he fears it may be used to transport New York City's garbage after the Fresh Kills landfill closes, a concern also cited by Mr. Lapolla in his letter to the freeholders.

But the New Jersey section of the project, a five-mile link to Conrail's main north-south tracks, may never be built. (Richard L. Harbus for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Ferraro Turns Testy With TV Interviewer Over Repeated Requests to Debate

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
A routine television interview with Geraldine A. Ferraro turned into an on- and off-air scrap yesterday as her host repeatedly pressed Ms. Ferraro about why she was declining invitations to debate in the Senate Democratic primary race.
Ms. Ferraro, flustered and angry, attacked her questioner, Marcia Kramer of WCBS-TV, as unprofessional and sarcastically suggested that she was on the payroll of one of Ms. Ferraro's rivals. 
 With a control room full of technicians, producers and reporters watching, Ms. Ferraro turned increasingly tense as Ms. Kramer pressed the candidate on why she had declined several invitations to debate her two major Democratic rivals, Mark Green and Charles E. Schumer. The candidates have appeared in two public forums and are not scheduled to do so again until the Sunday before the Sept. 15 primary.
"We've debated the other two people," Ms. Ferraro said as the taping of "Sunday Edition" began with Ms. Kramer explaining to viewers that Ms. Ferraro had declined to appear unless it was apart from Mr. Green and Mr. Schumer.
The two women continued to talk over one another, with Ms. Kramer challenging Ms. Ferraro to agree to a debate right on the spot. The candidate finally turned to her host and said, "Do you think you're doing a disservice to your viewers by focusing on the politics of debates, rather than where I stand on issues?"
When the segment ended for an advertisement, Ms. Ferraro turned up the tenor of her complaints to Ms. Kramer. "What attack issue are you taking next?" she inquired archly, her off-air remarks blaring over the speakers in the control room. "I was curious which campaign you are working for."
As Ms. Kramer defended her question as legitimate, Ms. Ferraro shook her head in disagreement. "Unprofessional," she said. "Unprofessional. Let's move on."
After the appearance, Ms. Ferraro's aides said she had been ambushed because she had been brought in on the pretense that it would be a regular interview. Ms. Ferraro said that Ms. Kramer had done the "Green spin on this," adding, "Marcia's annoyed because we didn't agree to do a debate with them."
Ms. Ferraro considers herself the front-runner in the race and, as such, she is following a standard course in trying to minimize debates. The candidates have appeared together twice, and neither debate was televised.
Ms. Ferraro has said that debates are time-consuming for her campaign and more likely to produce damaging attacks among the candidates than insights on what they stand for. Ms. Ferraro was largely ignored by the other candidates in their last debate.
Yesterday's encounter was unusual in that Ms. Ferraro, who has tried to avoid making the kind of attacks on Mr. Green and Mr. Schumer that might bring attention to their campaigns, exhibited no such restraint when it came to WCBS-TV.
"Fortunately, said Ms. Ferraro's spokesman, Stephen Gaskill, "the voters see through tabloid journalism and are drawn to candidates who talk about the issues that appeal to them: education, health care, the economy and the environment."

HEADLINE: Youth March Organizers Sue the City

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
The organizers of a planned Million Youth March sued the city in Federal court yesterday, saying that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's refusal to grant them a permit to hold the event in Harlem next month was both unconstitutional and reflective of the Mayor's discriminatory treatment of the city's black residents.
The court action came as Harlem's most prominent black minister, the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, threw his support behind the march, saying it was a perfect opportunity for young blacks to call attention to issues that affect them, like unemployment and the high cost of health care. Other civic leaders in Harlem have also stepped up their support for the march in recent days, saying the Mayor's resistance is an affront to their community. 
 City officials have said they denied the permit because the neighborhood cannot safely accommodate the one million participants the organizers had said they expected.
But the organizers, appearing before Judge Lewis A. Kaplan in Federal District Court, said the city had refused to grant a permit to hold the rally along Malcolm X Boulevard on Sept. 5 only because of Mr. Giuliani's "dislike for one of the conveners of the rally," Khalid Abdul Muhammad.
They said it made no sense for the city to reject their permit application, since the city regularly grants permits for even larger rallies and parades. "The only issue is whether or not the Constitution applies to the people of Harlem," said Roger Wareham, a lawyer for the march organizers. "The city's policy is totally arbitrary about who they grant permits to and when."
Mr. Muhammad and other organizers have billed the event as a show of unity among young blacks from across the country, much like the Million Man March that was held in Washington in 1995.
But Mr. Giuliani has denounced it as a "hate march," citing anti-Semitic and anti-white remarks by Mr. Muhammad, a former top official in the Nation of Islam. The Mayor has repeatedly condemned Mr. Muhammad and criticized the organizers' plan to invite gang members to the rally.
In court yesterday, lawyers for the city questioned why the march organizers had waited so long -- their permit application was rejected in February -- to take their case before a judge. They said Mr. Giuliani's opinion of Mr. Muhammad had nothing to do with the denial of the permit.
"The Mayor did not decide whether the permit should be granted or denied," said Michael D. Hess, the city's Corporation Counsel. "This did not turn on the words of Mayor Giuliani one way or the other."
For his part, Mr. Giuliani continued to denounce the march organizers yesterday. "There's no question that this is a march that is about hatred," he said at a news conference. "It's about a group that has talked about hatred all throughout the country."
Judge Kaplan said the organizers' late filing date might be a factor in his eventual ruling, but it was not sufficient reason to dismiss the case. He scheduled a hearing for Wednesday, ordering the city to reveal how many permits it had granted for parades and rallies since 1993 and how many participants had been expected at each.
Judge Kaplan also agreed to read an amicus brief filed by the New York Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the march organizers. Norman Siegel, the group's executive director, said that "we as an organization have no other option than to protect the First Amendment."
The city has offered Randalls Island and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx as alternative locations for the march. It has also recommended Sept. 19 as a more suitable date to avoid conflicts with parades and other community events already scheduled for the Labor Day weekend.
But Mr. Wareham said yesterday that the march had to take place over Labor Day weekend because high school and college students might not be able to attend once the school year began. He said it would be inappropriate to hold the march anywhere but Harlem, which he called "a mecca of black life."
Although the organizers said earlier this year that they expected as many as one million people to attend the march, they told Judge Kaplan that only about 170,000 would attend. Many people from other parts of the country have backed out because of the controversy with the city, they said. Malik Zulu Shabazz, the national coordinator for the march, said only about 25 percent of the participants would come from outside New York City.
Mr. Butts, the pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem and a frequent critic of Mr. Giuliani, said he thought the march should take place even if the court does not grant a permit. He emphasized that he was not supporting Mr. Muhammad, but the young people who were helping to organize the march.
"Nothing these young people are talking about includes violence or hatred toward any people," said Mr. Butts, who earlier this year called Mr. Giuliani a racist. "In that spirit, I'm for the march."
State Senator David A. Paterson, a Harlem Democrat who has held several meetings with the march organizers, said yesterday that support for the march was growing in Harlem. Mr. Paterson and several other elected officials from Harlem have expressed disgust toward Mr. Muhammad and warned that the march should not take place without a permit, but Mr. Paterson said that most people in Harlem disagree.

INTERNATIONAL A3-13
 
U.S. Launches Missiles In Afghanistan and Sudan
Dozens of American cruise missiles struck targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, in what President Clinton described as an act of self-defense against imminent terrorist plots and of retribution for the bombings of American embassies in Africa. A1 

The strikes came after United States intelligence and law enforcement agencies had gathered what officials described as the strongest evidence ever obtained in a major terrorist case, evidence that President Clinton said showed that Osama bin Laden was behind the bombings. A1
 
Most of President Clinton's political opponents supported the action, but some lawmakers questioned its timing. A1
 
The United States issued a new worldwide warning to Americans and diplomatic personnel "to exercise much greater caution than usual" following the strikes. A13
 
Israel was quick to congratulate the United States for the attacks, but most other governments in the Middle East were notably silent. A12
 
American agents teamed up with the Albanian secret police for a series of raids and they appear to have thwarted a bomb plot against the American Embassy in Albania's capital. They also seem to have broken up a ring of Egyptian Islamic terrorists using the anarchy in Albania to set up a base. A13
 
Canada Rejects Vote To Secede
Canada's Supreme Court said a simple vote in Quebec was not enough to allow the French-speaking province to separate legally from the rest of the country. The landmark opinion is widely seen as fortifying the Federal Government's efforts to keep Canada from breaking up. A3
 
Congo Rebel Is Open To Talks
A rebel leader in Congo said he was willing to negotiate a cease-fire in the 18-day war that is increasingly becoming a political battleground for rival African nations. But aides to Congo's President, Laurent Kabila, said they would hold no talks with the rebels, who now control eastern Congo and are advancing toward the capital from the southwest. A3
 
Sanctions Renewed on Iraq
The Security Council voted unanimously to renew economic sanctions against Iraq. The vote came after Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister strongly rejected the invitation of the chief United Nations arms inspector, Richard Butler, above, to resume cooperation with his inspectors. A8
Hope in Northern Ireland
A guilty hope began to emerge among officials, analysts and ordinary people that some good might come of the latest bombing. A8
 
A Secret Buried in the Ice
Scientists today will begin digging up the communal grave in Norway of seven of young men who died in the Spanish flu pandemic 80 years ago. The scientists hope the frozen corpses will help unlock the secret of one of the most lethal viruses the world has ever known. A6

Lewinsky Testifies Again As Starr Studies Accounts
Monica S. Lewinsky was said to have offered more specifics about her sexual relationship with President Clinton and the gifts he gave her, as prosecutors sought to draw distinctions between her testimony and that of the President's on Monday. A1
 
Big Tax Bill? Just Charge It.
The I.R.S. said many Americans would be able to use credit cards to pay their Federal tax bills next year, in an effort to get more people to file tax returns electronically. But there is a catch: taxpayers will be charged a variable "convenience fee" to use the credit cards. A18
 
'Count Me In,' Gore Said
The notes of a senior aide say that at a November 1995 White House meeting at which the distinction between hard and soft money was apparently discussed, Vice President Al Gore said "count me in" on making fund-raising telephone calls that are now the subject of a Justice Department review on whether to seek an independent counsel. A21
 
Brother Gets Unabom Reward
David Kaczynski, left, and his wife have received a $1 million reward from the Justice Department for turning in David Kaczynski's older brother, Theodore, as the Unabomber. David Kaczynski has said the money will be given to the victims' families. A1
 
Race-Killing Trial Nears End
The prosecution and the defense were set to give closing arguments today in the retrial of a former Klan leader accused of ordering the firebomb killing of a civil rights leader in Mississippi in 1966. A16
 
F.D.A. Viagra Review Is Urged
The F.D.A. is reviewing a request by Public Citizen, a consumer group, to review Viagra's side effects and strengthen its warning label. Public Citizen said some evidence indicates that the impotence pill might be dangerous to more people than previously reported, and noted that two cardiology groups had urged doctors to exercise caution when prescribing the drug.

Treasury Bond Yields Fall As Investors Flee Stocks
Turmoil in overseas economies sent investors fleeing stocks for the safety of bonds, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 5.51 percent, another new low. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 81.87 points, to 8,611.41.
Rumors that Russian bank failures were imminent and that Venezuela might be forced to devalue its currency, the bolivar, to combat a growing budget deficit, and persistent concerns about a similar move by China, buoyed the Treasury market. All of these things added to investor concerns that the financial crises among emerging markets may be spreading. Page D5. 

Venezuelan stocks plunged 9.5 percent, the biggest one-day drop in nearly four years, as the market was rattled by worries that the Government might devalue its currency. Other Latin American markets also declined. Mexico's chief market index fell 2.93 percent. In Brazil, the Sao Paulo stock exchange's Bovespa index fell 6.4 percent. D2.
 
Barnes & Noble Unit to Go Public
Shares of Barnes & Noble rose 7.5 percent, or $2.8125, to $40.0625, after the bookseller said it planned to sell 20 percent of its on-line venture to the public. Barnes & Noble also announced that its loss for the second quarter tripled, primarily because of a $23 million loss by the on-line venture. D3.
 
Microsoft Trial Is Delayed 2 Weeks
A Federal judge has pushed back the starting date of the antitrust trial against Microsoft until Sept. 23. Lawyers for the company and Justice Department were also bickering over where and how pretrial questioning of William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, would take place. D3.
 
Fed Group Voted 10 to 1 on Rates
Federal Reserve policy makers voted 10 to 1 at their meeting on July 1 to leave the overnight bank lending rate unchanged at 5.50 percent. The lone dissenting vote was from Jerry Jordan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. D4.
 
Japanese Stocks Lower Early Today
Japanese stocks were down about 100 points at the midday recess after Okura & Company, a trading company that sells steel products and machinery, said it would seek protection from creditors. D2.
 
Foreign Sales Bolster Honda Profit
Honda Motor reported a 26 percent profit gain in the latest quarter, largely because of sales in Europe and the United States. Those overseas sales once earned Honda criticism, but now many Japanese business executives are praising the benefits of globalization. Hiroyuki Yoshino, the new president of the auto maker, predicted that the overseas expansion would protect Honda from the consolidation sweeping the automobile business. D2.
 
Novell Beats Earnings Estimates
Third-quarter profit at Novell beat analysts' expectations by one cent as the maker of networking software cut costs and improved sales by selling new Internet-based products. Net income was $26.6 million, or 7 cents a diluted share. The company had been expected to earn 6 cents a share. D4.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL BRIEFING;
Surprise Showdown Looms in Wyoming

BYLINE: By B. Drummond Ayres Jr. 

 BODY:
Wyoming is one of the nation's most Republican states, with the Grand Old Party enjoying a 2 to 1 registration edge over Democrats. So the odds are that the state's Republican Governor, Jim Geringer, will handily win a second term this fall.
Still, in the aftermath of Tuesday's primaries in the Cowboy State, the race now merits watching. 
 Mr. Geringer easily won renomination. But in doing so, some weaknesses were exposed, and as a result the Democratic nominee, state Senator John P. Vinich, who also easily won nomination, probably has a better shot at the Governor's job than he originally had reason to expect.
Ever since he took office three years ago, the Governor has struggled to get the Wyoming economy moving, but with little success. With its small population, limited job base and vast remoteness, the state is the rare economic exception in this era of boom, and throughout the primary season the Governor's critics were quick to put the blame on him.
His main challenger in the primary, Bill Taliaferro, a sheep rancher, hammered him relentlessly on the matter. But the Governor also had to contend with the issue and its political fallout when one of the state's highest-ranking Republicans, Secretary of State Diana J. Ohman, announced she too was unhappy with his leadership and approved a last minute write-in campaign for the nomination on her behalf.
Ms. Ohman did not cut very deeply into the Governor's support. But her campaign underscored the divisions within the Republican Party.
Worst of all for the Governor, when the primary was over, Mr. Taliaferro, who pulled about a third of the Republican vote, announced that he would not automatically throw his support to the Governor in the fall but instead might consider supporting Senator Vinich.
He said he would try to make his supporters "players" in the contest by urging them to go with the candidate who offered them the most. Then he called on the Governor to institute economic reforms to solidify the Republican vote.
"There are 29,000 votes out there," he went on. "Who wants them? Vinich or Geringer?"

HEADLINE: U.S. FURY ON 2 CONTINENTS: THE PROTAGONIST;
Man With Mission Takes On the U.S. At Far-Flung Sites

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
From his Afghan redoubt, Osama bin Laden has declared war on American interests everywhere, fueled by rage against American power in the Middle East, and backed, United States officials say, by an international network of terrorists and companies.
Mr. bin Laden is the self-appointed president of a "terrorist university" in Afghanistan, a senior American intelligence official said today. 
 "Terrorists of various nationalities have trained there," a senior intelligence official said. "This is the largest Sunni terrorist training facility in the world."
From 1991 to 1996, Mr. bin Laden established similar sites in the Sudan, which then, under pressure from Washington, told him to leave. In that time he formed a close alliance, officials say, with the Sudan's most powerful man, Hassan al-Turabi. Leader of the ruling party, the National Islamic Front, Mr. Turabi saw himself as the world's leading voice for Islamic fundamentalism.
Until recently Mr. bin Laden had saved his strongest anger for American forces and American allies in his homeland, Saudi Arabia. This year he publicly warned that American civilians were his targets as well. Today the United States made war on him and his Sudanese allies. His followers in Afghanistan reported that he survived, making it likely that his violent dialogue with the United States would continue.
"We don't know where bin Laden is," a senior official said, adding, "The prospect of retaliation against Americans is very, very high."
A decade ago the United States saw Mr. bin Laden as an ally in a noble cause.
He was involved with the American-backed Afghan rebels who fought off Soviet invaders in 1980's. "We knew him as one of the Saudi benefactors,"said a retired American official who helped fight that battle, describing a man who aided its widows and orphans.
Mr. bin Laden spent millions supporting the Afghan guerrillas, financing thousands of volunteer foreign soldiers who came to Afghanistan from places throughout the Islamic world, and creating a network of guesthouses and charities to support them and their families.
"He had a common cause with the United States," said Zalmay Khalilzad, a former State Department and Pentagon official of Afghan descent who monitored the war. "But with the end of the Soviet occupation in 1989, his struggle became the struggle against the United States, the dominant power in the world and in the Middle East."
Mr. bin Laden returned to his native Saudi Arabia in 1989, and officials say he began to support militant Islamic groups opposing moderate Islamic governments.
His rage against the United States reportedly ignited during the 1991 Persian Gulf war. The presence of American troops in his native Saudi Arabia struck him as an invasion by infidels. "He regarded that as an occupation of the Islamic holy places by the United States," Mr. Khalilzad said. Mr. bin Laden swore vengeance against what he called "the crusaders" of Christianity and the Saudi rulers who invited them into the land of Islam's two most venerated sites, Mecca and Medina.
As Kenneth Katzman, a former Central Intelligance Agency analyst, put it: "What this man thinks about every day is: How do I get the U.S. out of my home in Saudi Arabia, and how do I get those corrupt pharaohs out of power?" Mr. Katzman is the Congressional Research Service's expert on Middle Eastern terrorism.
Mr. bin Laden's view is shared by Mr. Turabi, and the bond between the two men helped place the Sudan on the United States' short list of state sponsors of international terrorism, officials said.
"Bin Laden is inspired by Turabi's expansive vision," Mr. Katzman said. "He sees eye to eye with him. They are allies. They are close associates. They are business partners. Bin Laden is Turabi's alter ego, his field commander, his operations chief."
Several intelligence analysts noted today that the American Embassy in the Sudan was all but evacuated in 1996, after a terrorist threat, and relocated at the embassy in Kenya, which was bombed on Aug. 7, along with the embassy in Tanzania.
Businesses established by Mr. bin Laden in the Sudan in the early 1990's continue to flourish. The National Islamic Front is a partner in his various businesses in and around the capital, Khartoum, experts say.
"Bin Laden has made financial contributions to the Sudanese military-industrial complex," a senior American intelligence official said today, "of which, we believe, the Shifa pharmaceutical facility is part." That plant was attacked by the United States today.
In 1991 and 1992, experts say, Mr. bin Laden gave jobs in the Sudan to hundreds of his proteges, veterans of the Afghan war who had come from North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia. These veterans started looking for new worlds to conquer.
According to Abdul Haq, a politically moderate Afghan veteran commander, they told one another: "We have a British grave in Afghanistan. We have a Soviet grave. And then we will have an American grave."
Mr. bin Laden began working to build that grave.
He went to work trying to form "a multinational organization for jihad, to purge the world of Western corrupters and their Arab friends," an American intelligence official said. Jihad is the Arabic for holy war.
His goal, said the official, is "a stateless, global jihad without borders," and with his millions, he aimed to build "a huge alliance of likeminded groups."
He became the world's leading individual sponsor of terrorism against Americans, spending a large part of the $250 million fortune he inherited from his father, who built palaces, mosques and public works for the Saudi royal family. The inheritance, hidden in a maze of Islamic financial institutions throughout Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, went to help create a global network of armed fundamentalists, backed by businesses and banks that functioned as front organizations.
"He has a very intricate financial infrastructure," said a senior United States intelligence official. "He has networks on every continent almost. He has an infrastructure that's very, very replete with capability, people, money."
Over the years, United States intelligence agencies trying to track Mr. bin Laden and have compiled a chronology of his career, including these highlights:
In December 1992 his operatives tried to bomb a hotel in Aden, Yemen, where 100 American soldiers were billeted en route to support United Nations peacekeeping operations in Somalia. The job was botched; two Australian tourists were killed.
In February 1993 the World Trade Center was bombed in New York. There is no concrete evidence tying Mr. bin Laden's followers to that attack, but Pakistani intelligence officials say Ramzi Ahmed Youssef, the convicted mastermind of the bombing, spent most of the three years until his arrest at a guest house owned by Mr. bin Laden.
Beginning in 1993, experts say, Mr. bin Laden channeled tens of millions of dollars a year through Islamic banks and charities to terrorist organizations and militant groups based in Egypt, Algeria, Yemen, the Sudan, Lebanon and the Philippines. He also provided support for the group known as Islamic Jihad, United States officials say. In addition, he has said he supported Islamic movements in Bosnia, Kashmir, Tajikistan, Chechnya and Somalia.
By January 1994 Mr. bin Laden had established at least three terrorist camps in the Sudan, where rebels from a half-dozen nations received training, according to American intelligence analysts. And by 1995, his camps in the Sudan had provided safe haven to followers who then fanned out across the Islamic world.
In May 1996, under intense pressure from the United States, the Sudan expelled Mr. bin Laden, hoping to receive American economic assistance. It never came. He returned to Afghanistan, where he received protection from the Taliban, the fundamentalist group that now controls much of Afghanistan.
He has been living there, first outside Jalalabad, then outside Kandahar, ever since. He established at least two terrorist training installations. The bigger, near the provincial capital of Khost, was attacked by the United States today.
Egyptian Islamic Jihad members were in the Khost camp, including their leader, Ayman el-Zawahri, who is wanted for terrorism in Egypt; so were members of the Islamic Group, which killed Egypt's President, Anwar el-Sadat, in 1981, American officials said today.
Mr. bin Laden is thought to have played at least a supporting role in the bombing of two American military installations in Saudi Arabia in 1995 and 1996.
He hardly disavowed it. In a February 1997 interview with an Arabic-language newspaper in London, he said: "We had thought that the Riyadh and Al Khobar blasts were a sufficient signal to sensible U.S. decision-makers to avert a real battle between the Islamic nation and U.S. forces, but it seems they did not understand the signal."
On Aug. 6, the day before the bombings of the American Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the Egyptian Jihad group sent the United States a warning: they would soon deliver a message to Americans "which we hope they read with care, because we will write it, with God's help, in a language they will understand."
Today the United States replied in kind.
"This is a war," Mr. Khalilzad said. "They did two bombings, we did two, in two different countries, two different targets. If the targets associated with bin Laden were destroyed, there will be some effect on his ability to do things. Whatever plans he may have had in place, whether those will be affected by the attacks, we can't tell. Whether his organization will be deterred, who knows? But this is a strong message to those people who thought they could remain beyond the reach of civilized law in the anarchy of Afghanistan."

Gifts to United Way In New York Rise 8%

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
United Way of New York City said yesterday that it had raised $33.8 million in pledges in the year ended June 30, up $2.6 million, or 8.3 percent, from the previous year. The campaign was the third in a row in which donations grew significantly faster than the rate of inflation.
The city United Way also revised its report of the previous year's campaign. It had reported last year that its 1996-97 campaign raised $31.6 million, but yesterday it lowered that figure to $31.2 million. Without the change the increase in donations for 1997-98 would have been just under 7 percent. 
 Nancy Hite, a United Way spokeswoman, said the previous year's results were revised because of an accounting change involving United Way of Tristate, which raises money at 137 companies in the metropolitan area for 30 local United Ways.
Money collected during the tristate campaign will add $42.7 million to United Way of New York City's figures. Those funds, together with foundation grants and money from the city school board and other government agencies, will bring total revenue in the current fiscal year to $109 million, said Ralph Dickerson Jr., the organization's president.
John Biggs, chairman of United Way of New York City, said that gifts of more than $1,000 grew faster than donations over all, in line with a trend in which United Ways across the country are increasingly relying on such major gifts. Major gifts now account for one-fifth of United Way giving nationwide.
United Way of New York City, which allocates money to more than 800 social-service charities in the city, was the last large United Way in the country to announce its results.

HEADLINE: AMP Rejects Allied Signal's Takeover Bid Of $10 Billion

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
AMP Inc., a leading maker of electronics equipment, rejected a $10 billion bid yesterday from Allied Signal Inc., igniting a rare hostile takeover battle in a market that has grown accustomed to friendly mergers.
AMP, which dismissed Allied Signal's all-cash offer as too low, overhauled its top management yesterday and appointed Robert Ripp, formerly executive vice president, as chairman and chief executive. The company, based in Harrisburg, Pa., has enacted "poison pill" defenses against hostile bids and vowed to shed divisions, close plants and lay off workers to make itself more profitable. 
 "There are no synergies between our companies, and we are not interested in a combination," Mr. Ripp said in an interview on his first day as AMP's chief. "We absolutely believe that we have far greater value than the offer they put on the table."
Allied Signal, based in Morristown, N.J., makes aerospace and automotive products. It said it would seek to take control of AMP by appealing to shareholders and fighting the company in court. Lawrence Bossidy, Allied's chief executive, denounced the rejection of the offer. He described Mr. Ripp, a former I.B.M. executive and chief financial officer of AMP, as having "neither the experience or track record" to improve AMP's business.
"It is puzzling that a company in dire operating straits would appoint as C.E.O. someone who had no operating experience prior to this year," Mr. Bossidy said in a statement that observed few of the usual corporate courtesies. "AMP's manufacturing and administrative structures are antiquated, its margins are lower than its competitors' and its market share is eroding, resulting in plummeting profits and a bleak future."
In contrast to the 1980's, when companies routinely tried to resist corporate takeovers, most mergers and acquisitions are now amiable. Purchasers most often use stock, which has been driven up by the long bull market, as the currency. Allied Signal is a good example. It has used stock to make a string of acquisitions of smaller companies in recent years, deals intended to keep its earnings growth strong. All its purchases have been friendly, a company spokesman said.
But Allied Signal decided to make a hostile bid for ailing AMP, which declined to negotiate a sale despite overtures from Allied Signal that began a year ago. AMP officials say that Allied Signal has sought to buy its shares at a steep discount to their proven value.
"They are just trying to buy us on the cheap," Mr. Ripp said.
AMP's results have suffered this year as sales growth has dwindled and profit margins have contracted. Mr. Ripp blamed Asia's economic crisis -- the company sells 20 percent of its interconnection devices there -- for most of its sales slump.
The company's share price has plunged by half in 10 months. It hit a low of $28 on Aug. 3, the day before Allied Signal made its offer of $44.50 a share. Allied Signal argues that the offer is a 55 percent premium to its share price on the date the offer was made. AMP says the offer is a 20 percent discount to its peak price and called the bid "opportunistic."
AMP's board chose Mr. Ripp, 57, to replace James E. Marley as chairman and William J. Hudson as chief executive. Mr. Marley will retire and Mr. Hudson will become vice chairman. Mr. Ripp told analysts yesterday that he would speed up a reorganization plan first announced in July. That includes closing several production plants and dismissing 3,500 workers, about 7.5 percent of the company's work force.
Allied Signal has sued to test the legality of AMP's measures to thwart a takeover. Pennsylvania law has strong anti-takeover provisions that tend to favor the board of a target company. The laws recently helped Mellon Bank of Philadelphia to defend itself against an unsolicited bid from Bank of New York.
Allied Signal has also appealed to AMP shareholders to tender their shares despite the board's rejection. Shareholders will have an opportunity to accept Allied Signal's offer, beginning Oct. 15.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Despite Brief Comeback, Bank Shares Continue to Slide

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
The week started out with a bang and ended in a whimper for bank stocks.
The stocks, which have been battered for a month, rebounded earlier this week before economic turmoil in Russia and concerns about financial instability in Latin America sent the group reeling. 
 For the week, the stocks of big money center banks were down 4.52 percent as a group, while large regional banks plunged 3.14 percent as a group.
While Russia alone hardly poses an earnings threat to banks, and a rumored currency devaluation in Venezuela is not disastrous in itself, investors are backing away from banks because several hazards are starting to add up.
Several of Southeast Asia's once robust economies are already severely wounded. Link those woes to the possibility that the travails in Venezuela and Russia could spill over into the rest of Latin America and Eastern Europe and the scale of global economic problems looms much larger -- and may portend economic troubles in the United States.
"The market capitalization of the banking industry has declined by $200 billion in the last month," said Michael Mayo, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. "The risks in emerging markets, year 2000 problems and other factors are getting better reflected in stock prices."
Large American banks that do business overseas -- the money center banks -- have only $3.5 billion of lending and investment exposure to Venezuela, spare change by big bank standards. But they have $25.7 billion in exposure to Brazil, $17.3 billion to Mexico and $16.2 billion to Argentina, according to Brown Brothers Harriman & Company. The exposure is $98.9 billion to Latin America and the Caribbean as a whole.
The stocks of banks that do a lot of business in Latin America were punished yesterday. Citicorp fell $4.75, or 3.4 percent, to $134.3125; Chase Manhattan fell $1.6875, or 2.6 percent, to $63.6875; J. P. Morgan dropped $3.4375, or 2.8 percent, to $119.375; Bankers Trust fell $4.9375, or 4.9 percent, to $96.3125, a 52-week low, and BankBoston sank $2.4375, or 5.5 percent, to $41.9375.
"This group has led the market in both directions, and that behavior is likely to continue," said Raphael Soifer, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman. "But we do feel that the banks are oversold based on the fundamentals."
For big United States regional banks, subject to a potential drop-off in loan growth and heightened credit concerns, yesterday also ended on a sour note. Nationsbank slipped $1.0625, or 1.5 percent, to $70.3125, and Norwest dropped $1.0625, or 3.2 percent, to $32.0625. First Union, on the other hand, rose 56.25 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $51.625.
"I think 50 percent of the selloff is emotional and 50 percent is fundamental," said Edward Furash, a banking consultant with Furash & Company in Washington. "But it's clear that the banks that don't have the capacity to cover earnings shortfalls with other sources of income are going to get hurt."

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Decline

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 21

 BODY:
The number of newly out-of-work Americans seeking unemployment benefits slipped by 2,000 in the latest week, according to the Labor Department. Initial jobless claims, which give an early reading on the resilience of the labor market, fell to 301,000 in the week that ended last Saturday, down from a revised 303,000 in the prior week and well below the 310,000 that private economists had forecast. In the last four weeks, initial jobless claims have averaged 303,000, down from 307,000 in the previous four-week period, the department said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Overseas Markets Send Wall Street Reeling

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON and JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Investors hoping for a languid summer day of stock trading were treated instead to a wild ride yesterday.
After the markets in Asia and Europe recorded sharp drops, the Dow Jones industrial average acted like a bungee-jumper. The Dow plunged 280 points just before noon, then bounced back to end the day at 8,533.65, a loss of only 77.76 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent. The Nasdaq composite index fell 34.84, or 1.9 percent, to 1,797.61. 
 American stocks were again caught in a global downdraft, as there was no bad domestic news yesterday. The United States economy remains robust by almost all measures and consumer confidence is still high. The housing market is strong, auto sales are expected to do well as General Motors recovers from two plant strikes and personal income is rising.
"A confluence of events overseas is overwhelming what I believe to be very good fundamentals for the U.S. economy," said Timothy J. Morris, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust in New York.
It is clear, for example, that Asia has not yet righted itself. Adding to fears that Japan's economy is worsening, Okura & Company, a Tokyo trading concern, sought protection from creditors yesterday, the nation's third-largest corporate bankruptcy this year. Investors were also disappointed by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's reluctance to reduce the 5 percent consumption tax. The yen lost ground again to the dollar, falling 1.2 percent.
And Russia's financial crisis shows no signs of abating, and its stock market dropped 5.6 percent yesterday.
A newer worry on the international scene is Latin America. Inflation rates are rising in the emerging-market nations of Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina, and their currencies are sinking. As a result, there is increased concern that their troubles will have an impact on American exports. Roughly 20 percent of United States exports go to Latin American nations.
Indeed, some analysts think the selloff in emerging markets signaled the realization among investors that the backstops of the International Monetary Fund and the Group of Seven leading industrial nations may no longer be there.
John Lipsky, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, said that even if the I.M.F. did try another bailout, such a move would no longer reassure investors because it has not proved to be effective. "The awareness that the crisis management is in crisis adds to investor uncertainty and market volatility," he said.
As a result, some investors are beginning to question whether American stocks can be a port in a worldwide economic storm.
"The risks to the U.S. are rising," said Bill Dudley, economist at Goldman, Sachs. "The International Monetary Fund is out of money and out of credibility. The pressures on emerging market countries are real. And the U.S. economy is more fragile because of its dependence on the stock market."
Investors seem to be bracing themselves for the second wave of Asian troubles. The first stage in the crisis was an expected decline in exports, evidenced in the June trade figures. Of the $10 billion slide in the last six months, $8 billion of it was a collapse in exports. The second stage is a flood of cheap imports into this country, which has not yet happened. If it does, American corporations will find their margins squeezed as they are forced to compete with these lower-priced goods.
Another worry among economists is that the capital spending boom that has kept the United States economy perking is about to end. "You do have tantalizing signs that the capital spending boom is finally over," said M. Cary Leahey, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. "The classic economic problem now is firms are preparing for a party in 1999, and maybe nobody's going to show up."
Mr. Leahey argues that American corporations have prepared for an economy growing at 5 percent annually -- built plants, added capacity, hired employees -- and they are going to end up with an economy growing at maybe half that rate.
Charles Clough, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, said that a slowdown in capital investment would put a drag on economic growth. "Investment is just running too fast," he said.
If investment was to slow, so would the economy.
Compared with markets around the world, American stocks held up well. European markets were down yesterday: Germany's DAX index lost 5.4 percent of its value, and Spain's IBEX fell 5.81 percent. Mexico's chief index fell almost 2.5 percent. The Brazilian stock market lost 2.85 percent.
Seeking some calm in the worldwide storm, investors fled to Treasury securities. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.43 percent, its lowest level in decades At midday, when stocks were at their lows, long-term Treasury yields, which move in the opposite direction from their prices, touched 5.38 percent.
In yesterday's trading, shares of banks, semiconductor makers and computer manufacturers were particularly hard hit. J. P. Morgan lost 14 percent of its value, Hewlett-Packard fell 4.6 percent. Bucking the trend were drug stocks and consumer packaged goods makers. Johnson & Johnson gained 4.38 percent, and Procter & Gamble rose 2.57 percent.
The market started to rebound shortly after noon. One trader speculated that investors thought that declining Treasury yields would make stocks more attractive.
Even after this summer's downdrafts, stocks are still trading at high prices historically, which makes them very vulnerable to external shocks. "The market is faced with a manifold set of issues that cannot be resolved quickly," said Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.

Turning Crises Into Comedy In the Bronx

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
JONATHAN ROSARIO answered his door dressed as if he were ready to go on stage and do his comedy routine: black vest over a loose white shirt, burgundy jeans and impeccably shined shoes. He excused himself and lingered in the foyer, where he keeps a pantheon of saints and celebrities.
"If you don't mind, let me light my candles," he said. "People come by and leave their names so I can pray for them. I don't think I'm anything special, but people think my prayers do something for them." 
 He touched a match to candles near a statue of an Indian, one of the Virgin Mary and a black cloth doll that clutched a pile of business cards. He glanced at autographed photos of Whoopi Goldberg and Melba Moore. They were divine in another way, having survived tough times in their pursuit of the big time.
"Melba Moore," he said reverently. "One day, I'm going to open for her."
Along Bainbridge Avenue in the Bronx, Mr. Rosario is hailed as a stand-up guy, and not just for his shtick. Although cutbacks cost him his day job as a crisis counselor at a housing center, he still tackles cases for no pay. Old ladies and single mothers short on money or luck stop him on the street and ask for advice.
Few of them know that the counselor-comic faces his own quiet crisis. He expects an eviction notice to be slapped on his door because he owes $4,100 in rent on his tiny apartment. Reluctant to burden anyone with problems that also include a close friend's death and a recent break-in, he mines his life for laughs.
"I'm so broke that when I go to the A.T.M., I get food stamps," he said. "Then there's my paranoia. Every time I open my door and see a restaurant menu, I think it's an eviction notice."
He certainly knows the difference. He has been working -- either for pay or for nothing -- as a housing advocate since he was a teen-ager. He got into it seriously soon after he had testified in a court case involving someone who he knew was not guilty of a drug hit.
"If someone can walk in here with a really nice suit and say something against somebody who doesn't look so hot, that means that the one with the suit will win," said Mr. Rosario, 25. "That means that sometimes innocent people have to pay for something they didn't bring upon themselves."
That remains enough of a hook for him that he continues his freelance counseling even though his unemployment benefits have run out, his phone is about to be cut off and his part-time job at a video store isn't cutting it. When he hits the streets of Norwood, he becomes the answer man.
"The only way I am able to forget about my problems is to help people with worse problems," he said. "I'm a lonely guy. I really have nothing to do with my time except see who else is lonely and who needs help."
HE exaggerates, since he also sends out dozens of letters to clubs, producers and anyone else who might discover him. He also writes new jokes, sometimes drawing on the absurdity of the social services maze. He dreams of being on "The Rosie O'Donnell Show," since he shares her love of wonderfully cheesy sitcoms. Like her, he said, those old shows helped ease a rough childhood. "She's like one of my biggest inspirations," he said. "I loved her even before she had her own show. I remember her from 'Gimme a Break.' I can even sing the theme song."
Until he gets his own break, Mr. Rosario has enough fans in Norwood looking out for him. When they learned that he was not being paid for all the problems he was solving, they took care of him. His hair stylist never charges him. The thrift shop gives him a discount on clothing. And every day, Efrain Cruz feeds him pasteles and flan at his restaurant, A Touch of Latin.
"He puts everybody else prior to him," Mr. Cruz said. "I tell him to pay when he can. With certain people I do that. Not everybody. You got to take care of those who have heart. If somebody has heart, you got to have heart."
Mr. Rosario does not forget the favors. "If I ever make it, I'm going to make him the next Jimmy's Bronx Cafe," he vowed. After a while, and a brief hello to Esther, his "hair savior" down the street, Mr. Rosario returned to his apartment. Some of his friends think he's wasting his time writing jokes. He slogs on, even though on some days it's enough of a chore to get out of bed.
"This time is not wasted," he insisted. "One day, all the things I'm writing about I'll be able to express little by little."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE ATTACKS: THE SCENE;
In Sudan, Furor And a Warning Amid the Ruins

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, the Sudan, Aug. 21

 BODY:
Not quite 24 hours after American cruise missiles hit a factory in a decrepit industrial area of this capital, clouds of white smoke and acrid smells still hovered over the site tonight. Deep puddles of water on muddy ground attested to the firefighting efforts after the strike.
The factory, which is about a half-mile square, was destroyed in the attack, though surrounding areas went unscathed. There were no known deaths at the plant, which was hit at night, when it was closed, but local reports said 10 people were hospitalized, 4 of them in critical condition. 
 The nation's Islamic Government invited foreign diplomats to tour the ruins today. Afterward, many remained puzzled, saying it was not clear whether the plant, as Washington asserts, made precursors for nerve gas or whether it was purely a medical manufacturing site, as the Sudan contends.
After Friday prayers in the city's mosques, worshipers were urged to attend frenzied rallies, where leading figures of the Government accused the United States of being a terrorist state, and where the American flag was torn, burned and trampled into the ground.
At one rally, pictures of President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky were on prominent display -- a juxtaposition that is interpreted as the ultimate mockery in this very conservative society.
The Foreign Minister, Mustafa Osman Ismail, said the Sudan would remain a "tomb for its enemies, whatever this costs us in human lives."
But the most important Sudanese leader, Hassan al-Turabi, who is the Speaker of Parliament and the ideological power behind the governing National Islamic Front, remained silent today.
American intelligence officials have called Mr. Turabi a close comrade of Osama bin Laden, whom the Administration has accused of being the mastermind of the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa that left hundreds dead.
The Clinton Administration accuses the Sudanese Government of assisting Mr. bin Laden in terrorist activities. The Sudan rejects the charge and has asked for an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the missile strike.
Mr. Turabi has always been considered a Rasputin by Westerners, a mysterious figure of the fundamentalist Government that took power in a military coup in 1989.
The army general who is the Sudanese President, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, made up for Mr. Turabi's silence today by furiously waving a long stick as he addressed a raucous crowd.
President Bashir said he would prove that the pharmaceutical plant hit by the American missiles was not a cover for making the precursors of nerve gas as Washington charged. "We have undeniable proof" that the plant was only used for pharmaceutical products like children's and anti-malarial medicines, he said.
He said international companies that had provided equipment for the plant, which opened two years ago, would back him up. He did not name them.
In describing the reasons for destroying the plant, President Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said today that Mr. bin Laden had given key financial help for the plant, which was part of the "Sudanese military-industrial complex." Mr. bin Laden lived in the Sudan from 1994 to 1996, a period when Washington says he invited international terrorists to train at camps here.
He was forced to leave in 1996, when the Government decided that he was too much of an embarrassment and his presence too costly. After telling Mr. bin Laden to leave, the Government hoped to win some concessions from the Clinton Administration, including economic aid, but failed to do so.
As part of their case that the plant was a benign operation, Government officials said today that it was owned by a Sudanese businessman, Salah Idrisse, who is also a citizen of Saudi Arabia.
The heart of the factory, where most of the smoke was still billowing, was off-limits to reporters today, and it was impossible to tell what was made there. In the rubble at the front of the compound, there were wrappers from a veterinary solution made at the plant and leaflets on how to take Profenil, a trade name for ibuprofen, a widely used pain reliever. Trays of small empty brown bottles, apparently used for medicine, were scattered about on the ground.
Mohammed Hussein, 23, a builder who lives about a mile from the plant, said he had seen bright lights and then heard the swoosh of missiles during the attack. At first, he said, he thought the nearby power station had been struck. Then he thought a plane had crashed. Then, he said, it occurred to him that John Garang, the leader of a southern rebel group that has been waging a civil war for more than a decade, had finally struck the capital.
The plant's managing director, Sayed Hamed, said the factory employed 360 workers. He said the enterprise made 30 kinds of drugs for humans and 23 kinds of veterinary medicines.
A hospital spokesman said today that 10 people wounded from the strike were admitted to the wards. Four of them were in critical condition, he said. The plant does not operate at night, and there were apparently few workers around during the attack.
A spokesman for Sudanese opposition political parties based in Cairo, Faruq Ahmed Adam, said today that he agreed with Washington that the plant was a cover for the manufacture of chemical weapons. He said another factory, in the suburb of Kafouri, also made chemical weapons. He added that Sudanese security forces were investors in the plant.
Relations between Washington and the Sudanese Government have gone from bad to worse in the nine years of fundamentalist rule. But even so, ordinary people seemed to be bewildered why American should aim cruise missiles here.

HEADLINE: Philadelphia Shaken by Collapse of a Health Care Giant

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 15

 BODY:
This venerable city with some of the nation's oldest hospitals and medical schools is reeling from the collapse of an institution that swooped into town a decade ago and shook up every aspect of health care here.
That institution, the Allegheny Health, Education and Research Foundation, is the largest health care provider in Pennsylvania and one of the largest nonprofit providers in the country, owning 13 hospitals -- 4 in Pittsburgh and 9 in and around Philadelphia -- and nearly 600 physicians' practices in the two cities. Its goal was to build an integrated health care network that would treat patients from diagnosis to discharge, and from cradle to grave. 
 But a month ago, with debts of $1.3 billion and losses recently of $1 million a day, Allegheny filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy law. Moody's Investors Service says the nation's last big hospital system failure, in California six years ago, was a third the size of Allegheny's.
The foundation has dismissed its chief executive, whose bold ideas about managing health care drove its wave of acquisitions and consolidations. Allegheny's strategy of rapid expansion is now widely seen as having been risky from the start, the foundation moving too far too fast.
"It's a very high-flying warning flag to others who are trying to do these things," said Richard Wade, spokesman for the American Hospital Association. "It was created too quickly to manage. Allegheny is a model you don't want to replicate."
The damage from Allegheny's failure is leaching through the local economy.
Thousands of creditors, from big health maintenance organizations and drug companies to plumbers and office suppliers, stand to lose most of the $497 million that they are owed.
The bankruptcy could also bring the closing of more Allegheny hospitals here -- the foundation shut one last year -- since by all accounts Philadelphia has far more hospital capacity than it needs.
Even if all the hospitals survive, jobs are in doubt. Allegheny laid off 1,200 workers last fall -- aides, technicians, billing clerks -- but many of the 16,000 who remain in its Philadelphia operation have reason to worry.
Few tears are shed here over the 25 percent pay cuts that Allegheny imposed in May on a handful of superstar physician-professors who had been lured aboard with $1 million salaries to bring in patients. But the contracts and Allegheny-owned practices of $150,000-a-year neighborhood doctors are in limbo, too.
Nor are those the only issues.
No one, for instance, appears to know what has become of much of the more than $100 million in endowments and restricted gifts that benefactors left to Philadelphia hospitals or affiliated medical schools acquired by Allegheny. The foundation has not challenged reports in The Philadelphia Inquirer that some of that money was used to keep the hospitals afloat instead of going to the purpose for which a given endowment was created, like research or teaching. The State Attorney General, D. Michael Fisher, has stepped in to investigate.
Allegheny blames government policy changes in part for its problems. For one thing, the Balanced Budget Act adopted last year has reduced Medicare payments to hospitals. At the same time, the Federal Government is encouraging elderly Medicare recipients to join managed care plans, which seek to save money in large part by reducing hospital stays, while states including Pennsylvania are ordering indigent Medicaid recipients into such plans. All in all, the spread of managed care is leaving the typical hospital with just 60 percent to 65 percent of its beds filled on any given day.
"For managed care to work, you have to underutilize hospitals, so it's a Catch-22," Dr. Clarence Martin said of the prospects that had faced both the foundation and the physicians it employed. (Until several months ago, he was one of them.)
Yet Allegheny clearly contributed to its own demise, rapidly assuming the enormous debt of troubled hospitals that it acquired and then failing to generate enough revenue to bring that debt under control.
The foundation was brought down by "a combination of factors," including, "quite candidly, what pundits have labeled a very aggressive expansion strategy" in the Philadelphia area, said its spokesman, Thomas G. Chakurda.
Allegheny's leading strategist was its chief executive, Sharif S. Abdelhak, who, until the board deposed him in June, earned $1.2 million a year. Little has been seen of Mr. Abdelhak since his departure, and repeated efforts to reach him for comment were unavailing.
Mr. Abdelhak, now 52, left his native Egypt at the age of 25, earned a business degree at the University of Pittsburgh and worked his way up from food service management to chief executive at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh, which became the flagship for his expansion.
In 1988, he came up with an idea that was novel at the time but has since been widely adopted: capture patients by building a tightly integrated network of hospitals, medical schools and physicians' practices. He acquired the century-and-a-half-old Medical College of Pennsylvania here in Philadelphia, later added the equally venerable Hahnemann University and merged the two to create the nation's largest private medical school, Allegheny University of the Health Sciences.
Mr. Abdelhak's goal of providing managed care was achieved primarily by contracting with H.M.O.'s. He expected to manage their members' care for less than the H.M.O.'s could, and to pocket the difference. But the costs were more than he had anticipated. Instead of getting payments from this region's two big H.M.O.'s -- Independence Blue Cross and Aetna U.S. Healthcare -- Allegheny now owes them tens of millions of dollars.
The strategy of buying family physician practices also failed. Most of them wound up losing money, Allegheny says. One reason was that doctors employed by the foundation often routed those in their care to hospitals other than Allegheny's when they felt it best suited the patients.
Being prodded not to send his patients to non-network hospitals was hardly Clarence Martin's only problem with Allegheny.
Dr. Martin, 47, had a successful solo practice in the Chestnut Hill-Mount Airy section of town, with 2,500 middle-class patients. In early 1996, he says, Allegheny offered him a deal: Sell us your practice and become an employee. We'll pay you $150,000 a year, about what you have been earning, and provide for a bonus equal to 40 percent of office revenue that exceeds expenses. Dr. Martin will not say what he sold for, but typically doctors received around $200,000.
Then odd things happened. Allegheny dismissed his office manager, who was vital to the rhythms of his practice, and assigned her work to a regional, circuit-riding manager. The message on his answering machine purged his name. "Stenton Avenue Medical Practice," it said.
In July 1997, after the end of the fiscal year, "I looked at my books and thought I should get a nice little bonus." His revenue exceeded expenses by $24,000, so he calculated that he would get $9,600.
When the bonus did not arrive, he began calling. "I got an answer in early October," he said. "They told me, 'We looked at everything, and you're not getting a bonus.' "
He went back to his books and realized that Allegheny had been charging him for visits of various consultants -- one to survey the flow of patient traffic, others to survey his office exit signs and his handicapped-parking spaces. He swears he was charged $180 by one to change a light bulb.
Dr. Martin negotiated a termination of his contract and by January was on his own again.
Under its bankruptcy plan, Allegheny would keep the hospitals in Pittsburgh and put the entire Philadelphia operation up for sale. Since the filing, two for-profit hospital management companies -- the Tenet Healthcare Corporation of Santa Barbara, Calif., and Vanguard Health Systems of Nashville -- have begun bidding on the spoils. But both are offering less than $500 million, well below Allegheny's debt.
A little more than a year ago, with Allegheny's losses mounting, Mr. Abdelhak visited Mayor Edward G. Rendell and stunned him with a proposal to buy the city-owned six-square-block site of an abandoned naval hospital.
"He wanted to build a brand-new medical campus for multiple hundreds of millions of dollars," Mr. Rendell said. "They had picked out a developer. They were going to tear it down and build on it."
Although the deal never went through, "it's an example," the Mayor said, "of how Alice in Wonderland this all was."

HEADLINE: Taking On the Terrorists

 BODY:
Bill Clinton has launched a battle against terrorism that promises to take the United States into unfamiliar intelligence, military and diplomatic terrain. It is important at the outset that the White House and the American people understand the risks involved and set limits on the actions that may be taken. The opportunity to combat terrorism must be pursued aggressively, but the difficulties and dangers should not be underestimated.
It has been hard enough to combat state-sponsored terrorism by countries like Iraq, Iran and Libya. At least in such cases Washington could deal with governing authorities that might respond to diplomatic and economic pressure. Foreign military and intelligence services also provide fixed, non-civilian targets for military attack, if the use of force is warranted. 
 But in recent years terrorism has mutated, and the greater threat to America today may come from shadowy, independent groups that operate across national boundaries and melt into the chaotic societies where they find recruits and sanctuary. It is exceedingly difficult to track and to attack freelance organizations like the one Washington considers responsible for the embassy bombings in Africa.
Spy satellites and other electronic intelligence systems can provide information about the location and activities of these groups, but machines cannot replace the use of skilled field operatives able to develop informers inside terrorist cells. The Central Intelligence Agency needs to expand its network of agents, but to do so under guidelines designed to avoid past abuses.
As the American missile strikes in the Sudan and Afghanistan demonstrated, moving against terrorist groups may require potentially provocative military actions that violate the sovereignty of other countries, threaten civilian populations and intensify anti-American sentiment. The doctrine of self-defense invoked by the Clinton Administration is valid when American citizens and embassies have been attacked or face assault. But the use of force should be commensurate with the threat and designed to limit civilian casualties. That appears to have been the case in the Sudan and Afghanistan, but the Pentagon still owes the public a more detailed account of the missile attacks and their consequences.
The temptation to authorize the assassination of terrorists will grow over time. It must be resisted, not only because it is inconsistent with American values but because it would invite a parallel effort against American leaders.
Military action alone can punish and temporarily disrupt terrorist groups, but not destroy them. The terrorist organization of Osama bin Laden, the target of the American missile attacks, is dispersed throughout the Middle East. It is financed by Mr. bin Laden, a Saudi multimillionaire who seems dedicated to killing Americans. To weaken the network, Washington has rightly begun to go after Mr. bin Laden's money by tracing his accounts and seeking the help of foreign governments and banks to freeze them. Saudi Arabia could be particularly helpful.
Ultimately, there is no substitute for improved physical security at embassies, airports and other potential targets. The White House and Congress ought to look at security in terms of a protracted struggle against terrorism, not a quick fix thrown together after the latest truck bombing. A significant increase in spending is necessary. The United States is engaged in a long, nasty alley fight with opponents who see no distinction between combatants and civilians. Washington will have to be resourceful and resolute, but it has the power to prevail without abandoning its principles.

HEADLINE: HIGH MARKS GIVEN TO THE PRESIDENT BUT NOT THE MAN

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY with MICHAEL R. KAGAY 

 BODY:
President Clinton continues to draw high ratings from the American public for his job performance, but his acknowledgment of a relationship with a White House intern has produced signs of a darkening public view of both the President's moral character and his overall personal image, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
Hillary Rodham Clinton is now viewed more approvingly by the American public than her husband, according to the survey, which was conducted on Wednesday and Thursday. Overwhelmingly, respondents said they admired how Mrs. Clinton had stood by her husband since he admitted his relationship with the intern, Monica S. Lewinsky, even as most people said they did not believe the First Lady's assertion that she first learned of her husband's infidelity last weekend. 
 The poll was conducted in what has surely been the most tumultuous week of Mr. Clinton's political career and suggested once again the nation's profound ambivalence about this President.
By varying measures, respondents said they were bothered that Mr. Clinton had had an affair and lied about it and were narrowly inclined to believe that he had encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to lie about it under oath. They also were inclined to believe he had sexually harassed Paula Corbin Jones, his denials notwithstanding. And the number of Americans who said Mr. Clinton did not share their moral values was as high as it had ever been.
Yet rising concerns about Mr. Clinton's conduct and character do not seem to have tarnished the public view of his performance as President. The percentage of Americans who applauded Mr. Clinton's handling of foreign policy, 68 percent, and of the economy, 70 percent, was as high as it has been at any point in his Presidency. His overall job approval rating is at 65 percent.
In addition, Mr. Clinton does not appear to have been particularly hurt among the Americans who have been among his strongest supporters: women. The poll found that men and women generally viewed Mr. Clinton and the scandal similarly, and what differences there were tended to be small, with women slightly more supportive of him.
The Times/CBS News survey began before and ended after Mr. Clinton's announcement that he had ordered military strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan, allowing at least a preliminary measure of how events overseas might affect Mr. Clinton's political standing at a difficult time. Americans overwhelmingly approved of the military action, although they were less certain on the question of whether it would discourage terrorism.
The military action did not appear to produce any immediate changes in the nation's measure of Mr. Clinton, with perhaps one exception: 57 percent of respondents polled after the bombing said that Mr. Clinton could be "trusted to keep his word as President," compared with only 49 percent of those polled before the bombing. Over all, the respondents said by a 2-to-1 margin that they believed Mr. Clinton had acted out of genuine military concerns, rather than executing a so-called "Wag the Dog" strategy to shift public attention away from his troubles.
The telephone poll of 944 adults nationwide has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Although the poll included a number of findings that should cheer Mr. Clinton and his supporters as they assess his prospects of emerging from his immediate difficulties, it nonetheless was sprinkled with evidence of the immensity of the political task Mr. Clinton faces in trying to salvage the final 28 months of his Presidency.
Nearly 2 out of 3 respondents said they agreed that the scandal "will have a serious impact on President Clinton's Administration" for the next two years. And 1 in 2 said Mr. Clinton, rather than his enemies, was to blame for the President's predicament, a definite shift in the public's view of who was at fault here. Nearly 60 percent said Mr. Clinton did not share the moral values of most Americans.
And 40 percent of those questioned said they had an unfavorable opinion of Mr. Clinton, which is close to the President's worst score on that question. By contrast, 48 percent of those questioned said they had a favorable rating. (A 20-point drop in Mr. Clinton's favorability rating reported by a Gallup Poll on Tuesday was later discovered to have been caused largely by a change in the wording of the question.)
With the exception of a brief period earlier this year, Mr. Clinton has never in his public life broken the 50 percent favorability rating in a Times/CBS News Poll, even when Americans were giving him strong ratings on his performance in office. The only time Mr. Clinton's favorable rating rose above 50 percent was in February, when at the height of the disclosures about Ms. Lewinsky it hit 57.
"I approve of what he has done up to this point, but I don't find him trustworthy," said one respondent, Lisa Wolynski, 35, owner of a day-care business from Highland Ranch, Colo., who was re-interviewed after the poll, in a remark that neatly captured the conflict many Americans are feeling about this President.
"He's like the guy I don't want my daughter to go out with," Ms. Wolynski said. "At first I felt that who he sleeps with is his business. But then as I began explaining this to my kids, it's begun to bother me."
She said she likened the President to "a little boy who got his hand caught in the cookie jar, and I don't think he was all that sorry for it."
Some of the most intriguing findings in the poll concerned Mrs. Clinton. Nearly three-quarters of respondents said they thought well of Mrs. Clinton for voicing support for her husband in this crisis. Of those, 63 percent said they admired her for standing by her husband, for being a good wife and for keeping her marriage together.
Mrs. Clinton was viewed favorably by 50 percent of respondents, compared with 25 percent who viewed her unfavorably. The figure matched her previous record-high standing of February, when she was at the forefront of defending Mr. Clinton in the Lewinsky matter. "It's her stamina, really," said Edward Sullivan, 52, an engineer from Norwood, Mass. "She's quite smart and durable. I suppose I admire her for putting up with all this stuff."
Ms. Wolynski said that Mrs. Clinton was in "a very difficult situation and she's handling it very well."
"If I was her," Ms. Wolynski said, "I would have given him the boot many years ago."
The depth of support for Mrs. Clinton these days suggests that she might be helping her husband yet again -- that her own popularity might be providing him with something of a lift.
Even as they rallied behind Mrs. Clinton, Americans seemed not to believe all she said: 2 in 3 said they believed she had known the exact nature of her husband's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky before last weekend, a statement by her office notwithstanding.
For the most part, Mr. Clinton seemed to fare as well among women as among men. For example, 73 percent of women, compared with 64 percent of men, said they wanted Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, to drop the investigation. There was, though, one subject on which women took a sterner view of Mr. Clinton: 30 percent said they were bothered a lot by the very fact of Mr. Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, compared with 22 percent of men.
There was some good news in the poll for Mr. Clinton, if only relatively, relating specifically to the scandal. About half the respondents said they were satisfied with the speech Mr. Clinton gave to the nation on Monday night, though the approval of Mr. Clinton's performance has been slipping throughout the week amid a wave of negative commentary.
About half of those questioned said it was understandable that Mr. Clinton had lied to the public about the nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky when asked about the allegations in January. And about 2 out of 3 respondents said they believed that the inquiry should be dropped. Nearly 40 percent of the respondents said the issue was of "very little importance" to the nation.
Mr. Starr continued to suffer from his public exposure: only 19 percent viewed him favorably, compared with 43 percent who did not. Mr. Starr might find some solace in Ms. Lewinsky's position: only 5 percent of Americans viewed her favorably this week, compared with 54 percent who viewed her unfavorably.
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Wednesday and Thursday with 944 adults throughout the United States.
These include 530 interviewed before the American military strikes on terrorist sites in Afghanistan and Sudan were announced, and 414 interviewed after the announcement.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age, and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, for those respondents interviewed after the American military strikes were announced, it is plus or minus five percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 23, 1998, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about The New York Times/CBS News poll on public attitudes toward President Clinton misstated the source of an assertion that Hillary Rodham Clinton first learned of her husband's infidelity last weekend. Mrs. Clinton has made no public comment on the subject; friends of hers, speaking on condition of anonymity, have made such statements, and Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said on Tuesday that the First Lady "learned the nature of his testimony" to the grand jury over the weekend.

Discovering a Bit of Heart in the Sitcom Cupboard

BYLINE: By RON WERTHEIMER 

 BODY:
The trappings of "That 70's Show" are specific. The decade is invoked through leisure suits and bell bottoms; lava lamps, smiley faces and the Hustle, and references to Todd Rundgren and the gasoline shortage. But the appeal of this new sitcom, which Fox is unveiling tomorrow night, is its universal heart. Peering out from beneath the laugh track is the coming-of-age story of a 17-year-old boy and the girl next door, his lifelong pal who has unsettlingly become the object of his hormone-soaked reverie.
If neither the decade nor the adolescent yearnings were ever this sweet, the nostalgia is appealingly packaged by a bunch of seasoned pros. The executive producers include Marcy Carsey, Tom Werner and Caryn Mandabach ("The Cosby Show," "Roseanne" et al.), as well as Bonnie and Terry Turner, creators of "Third Rock From the Sun," who wrote tomorrow's episode. 
 No one is blazing bold trails. Here is a white suburban family, the Foremans, living in Point Place, Wis., in 1976. Mom (Debra Jo Rupp) is a nurse; Dad (Kurtwood Smith) has some kind of job at which his hours have been cut back. The economy, you know. They have just taken a big step and bought a Toyota. "The last time I was that close to a Japanese machine, it was shootin' at me," says Dad. (Wait a minute. He's in his late 40's in 1976? How old was he in, say, '43? Oh, never mind.) Under their polyester clothes, they are stock parents from television's eternity, a little dim but basically good folks.
When first glimpsed, their son, Eric (Topher Grace), is sitting in the basement rec room with his goofy guy friends, also out of the sitcom cupboard, and that neighbor, the red-haired Donna (Laura Prepon). There is immediate chemistry between these adorable young people. Something is happening that they clearly don't understand. The look in Eric's eye, a mixture of fear, excitement and resignation, is both more eloquent and more funny than the words he speaks. (This show wins higher marks for sit than for com.) As for Donna -- well, if more guys had girls like her next door, a lot of them would never leave home.
Eric and his friends are a bit more rebellious than Richie Cunningham's gang on "Happy Days," a decade-clinging show this series inevitably calls to mind. The 70's teen-agers swipe some beer and smoke some pot. But Eric's guilty pleasure comes from taking the family car all the way to Milwaukee against Dad's orders. The sweetness here is never saccharine, but it might seem rather mild to viewers just coming off a half-hour of "The Simpsons."
The second episode, to be shown next week (written by the Turners and Mark Brazil), has more laughs. When Eric and his friends are having an unsupervised (though tame) party at home, his mother imagines the worst: they're recklessly endangering her furniture by -- gasp! -- not using coasters.
Despite the joke count, this show will rise or fall on the quiet adventures of Eric and Donna. Clunky heels or not, you've been in their shoes. And you know that some day she's going to break his heart.

ECOLOGY OF FEAR
 Los Angeles and the
 Imagination of Disaster.
 By Mike Davis.
 Illustrated. 484 pp. New York:
 Metropolitan Books/
 Henry Holt & Company. $27.50. 
 In "City of Quartz" (1990), Mike Davis wrote, "Los Angeles -- far more than New York, Paris or Tokyo -- polarizes debate: it is the terrain and subject of fierce ideological struggle." While the first phrase that springs to mind in connection with Los Angeles might not be, for most people, "fierce ideological struggle," Davis was right. There is a long-running, highly charged debate about the history and character of L.A. It is an argument between, basically, the city's boosters, who for more than a century have been luring new residents, tourists and investment with tales of endless sunshine and opportunity, and its critics, from labor historians to urban geographers to the authors of noir fiction and film.
This heterogeneous clamor gained a commanding new voice with the publication of "City of Quartz." Davis mixed scholarship with street reporting, flinty analysis with gorgeous writing, to produce a riveting tour of Southern California's politics and culture, past and present. A self-described working-class "native son," solidly in the camp of the radical critics, Davis seemed to know the city's every odd corner and guilty secret. Few of its idols or self-delusions escaped his elegant hammer. He even trashed Frank Gehry.
With "Ecology of Fear," Davis is back with more bad news, delivered with his usual brio and a new emphasis on natural history. The whole Los Angeles megalopolis has been built, it seems, under a set of terrible delusions about the region's habitability. Everyone knows that the city must import water to live, that it is prone to earthquakes, fires, mudslides, droughts and the occasional flood. But who knew about the two "megadroughts" that, according to recent research, parched California during the Middle Ages -- one lasting 220 years, the other 140? The most severe modern drought has lasted six. Try to picture what a couple of centuries of nothing but blue skies would do to Southern California today.
Then there is a newly discovered geological form, the "blind thrust fault," buried deep in the earth and apparently posing a major, previously unsuspected earthquake threat to Los Angeles. According to Davis, moreover, the city has accumulated an enormous "quake debt" during the 210 years since the last truly catastrophic earthquake shook the area, and may now be emerging from the "stress-relaxation shadows" that such huge quakes provide. "The urbanization of the Los Angeles area has, it seems, taken place during one of the most unusual episodes of climatic and seismic benignity since the inception of the Holocene."
What the city's builders and planners have always assumed is "that the present is the key to the past, and therefore to the future" -- a philosophical error that becomes magnified in a place like Southern California, which is, in Davis's view, "a revolutionary, not a reformist landscape." It is, he says, better understood with a "neocatastrophic" model, emphasizing extreme events and abrupt changes rather than slow, gradual evolution. Of course, ordinary greed and arrogance have also been big contributors to land-use policies that have covered steep, unstable hillsides with what Davis calls "firebelt" suburbs, paved over critical flood plains and coastal wetlands, largely eliminated public open space and permitted the construction, in Los Angeles County alone, of nearly 3,000 precast concrete buildings, never mind their homicidal tendency to collapse in earthquakes.
Quake relief itself has become, for that matter, a political instrument, used by the Clinton Administration, for example, after the 1994 Northridge earthquake both to gain favor with local voters and to pump up the local economy ("seismic Keynesianism"). In the country as a whole, Federal disaster aid disbursed under new no-deficit rules has been forcing cutbacks in social spending -- "recycling natural disaster as class struggle," in Davis's trenchant phrase.
Davis is astute on the social psychology produced by disasters. "Anglo-Californians," he observes, "have always criminalized the problem of mountain wildfire," refusing to accept the natural "chaparral fire cycle" and reflexively looking instead for arsonists, usually among the outsiders and subversives of their era -- Indians and drifters at the turn of the century, later Wobblies, Okies, "Axis saboteurs," sexual deviants (in the 1950's) and, most recently, environmentalists. "Conversely, there has been a persistent tendency to naturalize the strictly human causality of tenement fire," thus directing resources away from safety inspections that demonstrably save the lives of the poor.
Another vivid example of "the occlusion of natural history by landscape ideology" is the well-kept secret that Los Angeles gets hit regularly by tornadoes. Not wanting to scare off customers, The Los Angeles Times effectively banned the "T word" from its pages for many years, preferring "freak winds" to explain the wreckage left behind by violent twisters. This reticence can still be seen today. Earlier this year, after a twister with winds up to 110 miles per hour tore the roof off a supermarket and damaged several schools, The Los Angeles Times merely noted reports of an "apparent tornado."
The enthusiasm with which Davis describes some of the disasters that litter his narrative can be unsettling. He appears to revel in what he calls "the conflagrationist potential of Los Angeles" -- emphatically including ghetto uprisings in that potential -- and repeatedly dismisses the idea that other cities might have problems as big or as bad or as exciting as L.A.'s. This fervor sometimes pushes his muscular prose over the line into bombast. It may also be responsible for the odd lapse into parochial indirection -- moments when readers unfamiliar with local history, say, will find some place they never heard of referred to as "the legendary White City."
But Davis's passionate solicitude for the abused natural world of Southern California also inspires some of his most memorable turns of phrase. A recent series of mystifying attacks on humans by mountain lions, for instance, he all but celebrates as "the emergence of nonlinear lions with a lusty appetite for slow, soft animals in spandex." In a chapter titled "The Literary Destruction of Los Angeles," the question of whom to root for when Armageddon comes is actually brought to the surface. Davis surveys a wide field of urban-apocalyptic literature, then concentrates on the great proliferation in this century of "Los Angeles disaster fiction," even breaking down the books and films of the genre into "nine major story types . . . and their principal periods of popularity." With close readings of everything from the Buck Rogers saga to "The Turner Diaries," Davis persuasively concludes that "racial anxiety" is the "abiding hysteria" of most disaster fiction.
The begged question here, however, is which subgenre Davis's own work belongs in, since his fascination with the idea of his hometown's destruction is clearly as powerful as anyone's. A clue to the source of this fascination may be found, perhaps, in his wry observation that while the literary destruction of London, which used to be a popular theme, was widely understood as the destruction of Western civilization itself, "the obliteration of Los Angeles . . . is often depicted as, or at least secretly experienced as, a victory for civilization."
At the end of "Ecology of Fear," Davis returns to the nonfictional L.A., to the "spatial apartheid," "militarization" and other evil political portents previously explored in "City of Quartz." He provides a scary "remapping" of the city, emphasizing what he calls "social control districts," with a "homeless containment zone" at the center and a "gulag rim" of prisons on the periphery. It's an evocative scheme, grimly resonating with real trends, and yet it feels out of place in this book. A final effort to tie everything together with an orbiting satellite's infrared view of the 1992 Rodney King riots as "an exceptionally large thermal anomaly" also feels like a stretch. Davis's great intellectual breadth and agility shade here into sibylline grandiloquence.
For a fine, down-to-earth account of the decline of California's public services and political institutions, readers may want to look into Peter Schrag's "Paradise Lost," published earlier this year. What Mike Davis offers in "Ecology of Fear" -- graced with a bold political and environmental vision, much splendid phrasemaking and a multitude of facts, large and small, that I bet you never knew about Los Angeles -- is a truly eccentric contribution to the ideological fray in the Golden State.

 By T. M. McNally.
 Scribner, $22. 
 Paradise Valley, a community on the periphery of Phoenix, is the far from heavenly setting of T. M. McNally's story of first love. It's the late 1970's in this listless desert suburb; Patrick McConnell and Elizabeth Pinski are in high school; and sex, drugs and rock-and-roll are less outlets for rebellion than temporary buffers against boredom. Patrick and Elizabeth are more grounded than most of their peers. Both have musical talent, and both have had to assume adult roles in dysfunctional families they're eager to abandon yet bound to by guilt. Together, they find that leaving town is not the only way to transform their lives and that it's possible to invent an entirely new meaning for the word "home." In addition to a previous novel, "Until Your Heart Stops," McNally is the author of a collection of short fiction, "Low Flying Aircraft." That work's economy and concision are also evident in this novel's edgy prose. And although the narrative is anchored in the familiar difficulties and discoveries of an adolescent's passage into adulthood, it remains remarkably free of coming-of-age cliches. McNally doesn't believe in easy solutions to complicated problems, and his plotting is consistently sharp. Edie Jarolim

HEADLINE: The Capitalist;
Viagra and the Wealth of Nations

BYLINE: By Paul Krugman 

 BODY:
What popped into your mind when you first read the headlines about Viagra? Well, I thought about that, too. But as a typical, fun-loving economist I also found myself wondering how the Commerce Department would account for the wonder drug in its estimates of the gross domestic product -- and from there wandered into a reverie about the meaning of economic progress.
Government statisticians will, of course, have no difficulty slotting Viagra into their estimates of "nominal" G.D.P., the sum total of all the money spent in the economy. Viagra's contribution will simply be the total amount that people spend on the pills, or, equivalently, the profits earned and wages paid in the drug's manufacture and distribution. What's more, we can be pretty sure that Viagra's numbers, while music to the stockholders' ears, will make very little difference to the national totals. The new drug's spectacular sales are small change in an $8 trillion economy. And besides, most of the spending on this new product will come at the expense of spending on other things -- say, romantic vacations and candlelight dinners. 
 But nominal G.D.P. doesn't tell us much. Most of the time, the economic number we care about is "real," or inflation-adjusted, G.D.P., which is supposed to measure the purchasing power as opposed to the dollar income of the economy. Basically, nominal G.D.P. is converted into real G.D.P. by dividing it by a price index -- a "deflator" -- that is supposed to measure the average cost of goods and services sold in the economy.
So far, so good. But what happens with the introduction of Viagra, or Propecia, or whatever the next big thing may be? Statisticians can't compare the prices of these drugs with what they were last year because they weren't around last year. So inevitably, estimates of the deflator take account only of the goods that have been around for at least a little while.
So what? Well, this year some men can buy something they wanted pretty badly -- or baldly, in the case of Propecia -- and they can get it at a reasonable price. Last year they couldn't buy what the pills provide at any price, and probably would have gladly spent far more at clinics or in therapy to get lesser results. So surely, in some sense, the nation's purchasing power has increased because of the availability of those pills.
Yet the numbers you see on real G.D.P. don't reflect that increase -- and they never will. Eventually Viagra will be in the index, and as its price falls in the face of competition, the deflator will fall and measured real income will rise. But at no point will the statistics ever capture the big payoff, the one that happened when Viagra became available for $10 a, um, pop.
How could the statisticians get this right? It would have to involve a subjective evaluation: each person would have to be asked, and would have to answer truthfully, the question "How much money would you have spent last year (with your ever-growing bald spot and that other problem) to be as satisfied as you are now?" Averaging over the population, we would come up with a true measure of the change in the cost of living, and we would deflate G.D.P. by that.
In fact, where they can, the statisticians do try to do something more or less along these lines, adjusting the price of automobiles and many other products by imputations for improved quality. But nearly everyone admits that the imputations fall well short of capturing the real improvement in living standards. Officially, the median family in 1996 had only slightly higher real income than it did in 1973; in reality, that median family would be extremely upset if forced to go back to a 1973 standard of living (no VCR, no microwave, no A.T.M.'s).
So what's the moral? Should we smugly assume that the official statistics understate economic progress, that the New Economy is speeding us to a new age of economic bliss? Not so fast. For one thing, it is by no means clear that our age of technological marvels is any more marvelous than the age our parents, grandparents or great-grandparents lived in.
Viagra is only the latest in a long line of medical miracles -- antibiotics, smallpox vaccine, anesthesia -- just as the Internet is only the latest in a line that goes back to the fax machine, the telephone and the telegraph. While the statistics do understate today's true rate of economic progress, they always have.
 But there is a deeper point. The value of Viagra is not a dollar-and-cents issue. Rather, it is a psychological question -- what we are really asking is how much better off the drug makes people feel. But isn't that true of economic progress in general? And once you put it that way, you have to wonder whether we are really making that much progress after all.
Consider: According to the official statistics, the median family in 1947 had almost exactly the same purchasing power as the 20th-percentile family -- just a little ways above the poverty line -- of 1996. And the statistics surely understate the true increase in purchasing power. Does that mean that most people in 1947 were poor? Well, they didn't feel poor. Conversely, the 60th percentile in 1996 officially had about the same real income as the 95th percentile in 1947, and again this surely understates the real progress.
Does this mean that most Americans are now upper middle class? They don't feel that way.
In other words, as soon as you try to think seriously about how to measure Viagra's effect on the nation's wealth, you realize what a dubious enterprise such comparisons are. I have nothing against calculating real G.D.P. as accurately as possible; we need that number for all kinds of purposes. But the rather vulgar case of Viagra reminds us that, in the end, economics is not about wealth -- it's about the pursuit of happiness.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
Towering Savings in Kuala Lumpur

BYLINE: By DAISANN McLANE; DAISANN McLANE writes about music and culture.

 BODY:
"KUALA LUMPUR," said the saleswoman on the other end of the phone line at the airline ticket consolidators. "Hmmmm," I answered. It was a city that hardly figured in my imagination, except for one thing. Well, actually, two very big things: the Petronas Twin Towers, completed in 1996, the tallest skyscrapers in the world. I'd seen a photograph of these two curvy, tapered 1,483-foot spires (33 feet taller than the Sears Tower) on the cover of Scientific American last year, and my New Yorker's pride bristled. As a teen-ager I had eagerly tracked the World Trade Center as it slowly rose to resculpt the Manhattan skyline. Now my hometown twin towers had been overtaken by this pair of sassy (but, I had to admit, beautiful) upstarts.
I was curious to check out the competition, although not enough to go halfway round the world to Malaysia's capital. But for a flight to Bali in June, one of the best deals was on Malaysia Airlines: $1,150 from Newark to Denpasar, via Dubai and Kuala Lumpur. 
 Kuala Lumpur -- Could I stop over there for an extra charge? The sales agent responded with a frugal traveler's favorite words: "It's free." I shuffled my itinerary to include a stop of four days in early July on my way back from Bali. I did some research, and found that Kuala Lumpur translates into "muddy confluence," not exactly something that makes you want to pack your bags. But reading further, I became more intrigued. Only 130 years ago, K.L., as it's known locally, was a rough and steamy riverside trading post run by Malay royalty and Chinese merchants. The city's leaders have included Chinese gang barons, British colonials and heroes of Malaysian independence. Unlike Singapore, K.L. still has whole streets of colonial buildings -- and a fascinating ethnic landscape of Malays, Chinese and Indians, living in relative harmony.
The presence of new skyscrapers often signals that a city is changing the way it thinks of itself. Right now, Kuala Lumpur is having one of its biggest years ever. It is about to become the first Asian city to be host to the Commonwealth Games (in mid-September). The Malaysian Government, riding the booming Asian economy earlier in the 1990's, had seized the occasion to promote the multi-ethnic, officially Islamic country and its capital on the international stage. The Petronas Twin Towers were only part of a construction frenzy that included stadiums, highways, hotels, mass transit -- and a huge international airport, which, I ruefully discovered, was scheduled to open only six days before my arrival. In conjunction with the Games, the Government had also organized a year of cultural activities, the Commonwealth Cultural Festival 98. The long list ran the gamut from a "Surge to the Next Millennium" exhibit in the National Library and a Malaysian Fruit Expo to -- my favorite -- The Second Asia Pacific Harmonica Festival and Competition.
 The Asian monetary crisis has since sucked some of the air out of Kuala Lumpur's Commonwealth balloon, with the Malaysian ringgit dropping about 40 percent relative to the dollar within the last nine months. Hotel bookings were slow -- bad news for K.L., good news for me. When I arrived in Bali, I read the Singapore edition of the International Herald Tribune and saw advertisments for discounts of 40 to 50 percent at some of Kuala Lumpur's luxury international hotels. I saved them, along with articles reporting confusion, delays, baggage mix-ups and ground-transportation chaos in the new airport, which had opened almost simultaneously with Hong Kong's.
 As I checked in for the two-hour flight from Bali, I decided to live dangerously and checked my single bag. I spent a nail-biting half hour at a baggage carousel (which was, it seemed, miles from the gate by train and people mover) but eventually my bag emerged intact. The wait gave me a chance to admire the vast, empty and hushed space of the airport, where Bach murmured soothingly.
 Figuring out how to get into town -- about 50 miles away -- was a challenge. At the transportation desk, a harried dispatcher told me that, no, the rail link to Kuala Lumpur was not finished, and that I could take an express bus that cost $5 and would let me off in a suburb, where I would have to look for a private taxi to my hotel. The suburb appeared nowhere on my map, so I was reluctant to jump on the bus. The only other choice, she said, was to buy a voucher for a private taxi for $25. Ouch.
It was getting dark, and I was eager to be on my way, so I caved in and bought the voucher, figuring I'd compensate by staying in a low-priced hotel. I called the Swiss Inn, a businessman's hotel in Chinatown, and reserved a deluxe single for $33.
 Only about 250 square feet, but modern and clean, my no-frill room with two single beds looked out over the city's busiest nighttime happening -- the Chinatown night market. I rushed downstairs and followed the crowds down narrow Petaling Street, made even narrower by the stands of street vendors selling everything from a scary-looking plastic box of stringy material labeled "meat floss" to row upon row of suspicious-looking displays of "Calvin Klein" sportswear. Directly across the street from the hotel, I ducked into a storefront that contained the Petaling Plaza Gourmet Food Center. It was a sort of food court, with four concessionaires offering Chinese and Malaysian food, beer and ice cream. I ordered a tasty Chinese vegetarian plate heaped with rice plus several different richly seasoned stir-fry mixtures of seitan, textured tofu and bok choy. With a Malaysian Tiger beer to wash it down, dinner came to $5.50.
 I was so delighted by the food, the bazaar and the people watching -- the shoppers ranged from Malay women in chiffon head scarves to tattooed Chinese teen-agers -- that I let my guard slip when I saw a vendor selling a T-shirt emblazoned with the Petronas Twin Towers. I had to have it. "Fifteen ringgit," said the T-shirt vendor -- about $3.80. Without thinking I started to pull the bills from my bag, and he laughed at me. "I give you for 12 ringgit." My face fell in embarrassment. Tired and overeager, I had forgotten the cardinal rule of frugal traveling: In the market, you bargain. I decided to call it a night and went back up to my room, which soon proved to be less of a bargain than it seemed. The walls and ceilings in the Swiss Inn were so thin that I could hear, if not understand, every word of the Malaysian couple arguing in the room above. Whenever they stopped, the electronic burble of a computer game filled in the gaps. Since I always pack earplugs, I managed to sleep. But in the morning, I decided to move.
 Regent, Hilton, Marriott -- just about every major luxury chain had a hotel in Kuala Lumpur, and just about all offered special summer rates that, combined with the strong dollar, put high-end luxury within my budget. The super-luxurious Regent, my first choice, offered a special of $130 a night, including a free limousine to that faraway airport. Not bad, but I wanted to stay under $100 a night, so I kept phoning around. The Hilton quoted a rate of $92.
 Then I hit the jackpot at the Kuala Lumpur Shangri-La, part of the Asian-based luxury chain. Rooms there were $90.60 a night, with tax and breakfast buffet -- and a 30 percent discount on food and beverages in the hotel's four restaurants. Could I check out at 6 P.M. on my final day? (I had a late flight to New York.) No problem, said the reservations clerk, who added the clincher: "We have rooms with a great view of the Petronas Twin Towers."
 The Shangri-La lived up to its name. From the instant I was greeted by the concierge in the elegant marbled lobby, my trip was charmed. Though part of me had felt guilty about trading up from the Swiss Inn, I soon realized that in K.L. right now, the high end actually gives the better value per dollar. Whenever I set out on my morning rounds, the Shangri-La staff snapped into action, getting me a taxi (most rides cost less than $1.50), translating my wishes into Bahasa Malaysia (also called Malay) if the driver didn't understand English, answering my questions. I basked in my huge, tastefully understated room with its king-sized bed, marble bath with separate tub and shower and wall of windows in which the towers loomed, always there for leisurely contemplation.
 "Twin corncobs," said one of my guidebooks -- and I could see the resemblance. But as I stared out my window I grew fonder and fonder of these sparkly behemoths, whose kernel-nubbed exteriors had been inspired, according to their architect, Cesar Pelli, by Islamic geometry. Like my favorite skyscrapers, the Empire State and the Chrysler buildings, the Petronas Towers had personality. You could imagine them in a glass snowball, or dangling from a key chain. Earrings and salt-and-pepper shakers also seemed promising commercial possibilities -- but alas, the Kuala Lumpur tourism industry hadn't yet caught on to the building's souvenir potential. Nor had Petronas, the state oil and gas company that is the building's major owner, grasped the main tourist appeal of skyscrapers: the ride to the top. On my pilgrimage there, I found they had no observation deck (and according to a company spokeswoman, none is planned.)
 I had to content myself with gazing at them from my window, and later from the top of the Kuala Lumpur Tower ($4), a big communications needle that's not quite as tall as Petronas (the observation deck is just over 900 feet up). But it offers the only bird's-eye view of the city -- at least it does in the absence of the city's infamous white haze, a mixture of local smog with smoke from Indonesian forest fires. In the four days I was in town, I never saw blue sky -- but the sunsets, as you'd expect, were otherworldly.
Down at ground level, K.L. was growing on me. It wasn't great for culture, at least by European or American standards, but made up for it with fascinating architecture, world-class food and terrific shopping. I lost myself for hours in Chinatown and Little India, popping in and out of narrow Art Deco and Colonial shop buildings, and stopping for a moment of meditation in the 125-year-old Sri Mahamariaman Hindu temple.
Ducking into an Indian pharmacy that smelled of incense and jasmine, I contemplated bottles of brown, viscuous herbal tonic. On Jalan Leboh Ampang, a street lined with gold merchants, I bargained hard with two Chinese saleswomen for a 22-karat bracelet, and bought when the price fell to $8.75 a gram, less than half the going rate in New York. We sealed the deal with an icy glass of chrysanthemum tea.
I couldn't stop eating. So many flavors, so little time. For breakfast, I would hit the groaning-board complimentary buffet at the Shangri-La, with everything from Malaysian coconut rice and anchovy-paste curry to Chinese rice porridge with pickled eggs. At lunch, I'd pop into the Rumah Makan Sri Bintang cafeteria to savor a Malaysian roti canai ($1.50), flaky bread served with curry.
 Or, moving upscale, I splurged on an immense buffet lunch at the auditorium-sized Seri Melayu restaurant, where, for $10, I feasted on dozens of dishes I'd never eaten -- or seen -- before, like the piquant, yummy jelatah, a salad of cucumber, pineapples, onion, pickles and chili in a fish-tamarind sauce. My mouth kept watering, my stomach kept protesting that it was full. Three days may be enough time to see Kuala Lumpur, but not enough time to taste it.
 The concierge reconfirmed my flight, found a cheaper airport limo ($15) and arranged an in-room oil massage ($32). I was sad to leave. Twenty-four hours later, bleary-eyed from jet lag, I was deposited by the Olympia Airport Shuttle from Newark ($10) in lower Manhattan at the foot of a pair of huge towers that suddenly seemed too boxy, too . . . square. Some corncobs, I thought, would look nice right here.
 
The bottom line: bagains in a booming city
 
 On Aug. 11, the State Department said that the Government had learned that there may be a threat to United States interests in Malaysia -- as well as Egypt and Yemen -- which could include attacks on buildings. It advised all Americans in these countries to use caution and review their security practices.
 
Budget
During my three and a half days in Kuala Lumpur, I spent an average of $79 a day, including hotel, meals, taxes and service charges, local transportation and activities. My credit cards converted prices at 4.15 ringgit to the dollar.
 
Accommodations
The Swiss Inn, 62 Jalan Sultan, telephone (60-3) 232-3333, fax (60-3) 201-6699, is a popular budget hotel for Malaysians traveling on business. Clean and well-situated in the heart of Chinatown, it has a bare-bones feel (beware the thin walls). I chose a deluxe room because the standards didn't have windows, and paid $33.70, with a rather skimpy Continental breakfast.
The Shangri-La, 11 Jalan Sultan Ismail, (60-3) 232-2388, fax (60-3) 230 1514, is a luxury hotel with all the trimmings: pool, fitness center, four restaurants, concierge and business center. My standard single room was discounted at a summer rate of $78.70; with taxes, the total was $90.60. The package included a sumptuous breakfast buffet and 30 percent off all meals and room service.
I found the just-opened Hotel Noble, on the fourth floor at 165 Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, (60-3) 925-7111, fax (60-3) 925-7222, on a stroll through Little India. It's on a par with the Swiss Inn: tiny rooms but in better condition, and quieter surroundings. A deluxe room costs $32.77, with breakfast.
 
 Restaurants
Across the street from the Petaling Street entrance of the Swiss Inn, the Petaling Plaza Gourmet Food Center serves delicious cafeteria-style Chinese and Malaysian meals, at around $4 a plate.
Rumah Makan Sri Bintang, 11-13 Jalan Melayu in Little India, looks unprepossessing, but the food is wonderful: three or four different cooks serve a variety of Malaysian and Indian specials daily, cafeteria style. At lunch, Indian curry chicken and nan bread is $1.60.
The amazing lunch buffet at the Seri Melayu, 1 Jalan Conlay, may be worth a trip to Malaysia all by itself. The basic buffet costs around $6; a drink and taxes will bring it to $10.
With so many immigrants from Tamil Nadu, you would expect to find a great south Indian restaurant in Kuala Lumpur. Annalakshmi, 44-46 Jalan Maarof in the Bangsar Baru district, telephone (60-3) 282-3799, serves an Indian vegetarian thali, or set meal, that is the equal of anything in Madras. Lunch is $6.
 
Getting There
For reasons that no one could explain, the official airport limousine from Kuala Lumpur's new international airport costs $22 into the city, but $16.50 to the airport. This is for the premier service; in early July when I traveled, the lower-priced budget service was unavailable. A city bus that leaves the terminals every 15 minutes ($6) deposits you in the suburb of Jalan Duta, where you must find a taxi into Kuala Lumpur.

HEADLINE: SUNDAY, AUGUST 23, 1998: FUTURISM;
Japan's Many Possibilities

 BODY:
Japan's financial woes are keeping global economists up at night, having bad dreams. Tadashi Nakamae, president of Nakamae International Economic Research, a Tokyo-based financial advisory firm, is dreaming in grander fashion. Nakamae and the Global Business Network -- a think tank in Emeryville, Calif., that specializes in corporate "scenario planning" -- recently teamed up and interviewed more than 100 experts on Japan about their "visions, worries and expectations" for the next 20 years. The goal? To find answers to Japan's troubles using informed speculation. The team cranked out three possible futures for the place, delivered as if written by "a historian writing in 2020." Here's a look.
 
Scenario: "Crash and Rebirth"
This optimistic outcome is called "Japan 2020 -- The Rebirth of a Nation, BBC Television Special." Here, Nakamae and fellow scripters imagine a prime-time broadcast looking back on the turnaround that occurred after Japan's financial markets tanked on a June day in 1999.
At that fateful, terrible moment, Japanese banks shut down for a week, inciting violence and suicides. After the initial crisis, radical economic reforms took root, all industries were deregulated and Japan's auto makers sparked a new environmentalist craze. From their utopian vantage point, the BBC hosts look back on the late 90's as a wacky, primitive time.
"I'll tell you, Christine," says one, "the first thing that came to mind was astonishment at the styles that . . .you and I wore back in the 1990's. And the haircuts. That was really a different century!"
 
Scenario: "Hercules Departs"
This one is set near "Otsu, Biwa-Ko, Shiga Prefecture, July 2010, the Night Before the General Elections." Things are a little iffy for Japan in this storyline, which points a finger at the United States for its rapid troop withdrawals from the country in 2003.
The story begins with Yoshikazu Takeda, an 80-something ex-Foreign Minister, sitting for an interview with a tweedy, balding American magazine journalist named Thompson. Sipping sake, Takeda gloomily recalls the American election in 2000, which brought Quentin Jackson (a Republican war hero) to the White House. The troop withdrawals sparked a rancorous, decade-long debate about Japan's defense. To rearm or not to rearm -- that's the question, and Takeda must vote in a pivotal national election the next day. And? That's it -- The End. Takeda leaves us hanging.
 
Scenario: "The Long Hollowing"
Set at a dinner party in Tiburon, Calif., in March 2020, this scenario is gloom-and-doomy. In "a denial of reality" about its money woes, Japan is on a fast track to has-beendom. In this script, Jason Croyer -- "host of the Web's most popular interview show" -- chats up a Japanese expatriate entrepreneur named Michiko Sanjo at her California home for some historical insight. Sanjo explains how she became a "diminutive billionaire" after bolting Japan in 2002 when a bank bailout left the economy reeling. Safely abroad, Michiko cleared her "first $100 million" by 2005, but back home things got bleak. Japan endured a post-millennial "brain drain" of talent to other countries and was sidelined in global politics.
"Japan is a broken country," Michiko confides to Jason as the room is wrapped in eerie silence. "It has become irrelevant," she laments.

As Asia Regroups, Art Has a New Urgency

BYLINE: By ANDREW SOLOMON; Andrew Solomon writes frequently about Asian, Russian and South African art.

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan

 BODY:
THE Taiwan Domestic Airport was closed down temporarily in June when missiles were fired in the air by a citizen of mainland China. The man in question had arrived in Taipei just days earlier. Estimates range, but the official figure for the number of missiles involved in the incident stands at 200. Residents of northern Taipei were surprised but "not unduly alarmed," according to one local report, by the flashes of intense light and the terrific noise. No injuries were reported.
The closing of the airport had actually been negotiated in advance by the Taipei Fine Arts Museum, and the missiles had in fact been fired by Cai Guoqiang, a New York-based artist, in a performance at the opening of the Taiwan Biennial. His project, "Golden Missile," was one of many radical works in a show that is without question the most important exhibition of contemporary art ever mounted on this island. 
 Democracy and biennials arrived in Taiwan about the same time, in the early 1980's. For more than a decade afterward, a sculpture biennial alternated with a painting biennial, so that there was in fact a biennial every year. Then the directors of the Taipei Fine Arts Museum decided that these categories were inadequate to contemporary art, and so they established, in 1996, a new Taiwanese biennial modeled loosely on the Whitney Museum's, which represents the major trends and tendencies of the moment in American art. Now internationalism has arrived. The current exhibition, the first North Asian Biennial, includes work by artists from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and mainland China. The show, which runs through Sept. 6, was curated by Nanjo Fumio, a well-known Japanese critic, who commissioned site-specific installations for it. The work ranges from the formal to the didactic to the comical to the acutely political; such profound variety and the ostentatious display of total artistic freedom seem almost incredible in a country that held its first fully open elections little more than two years ago.
The Taiwan Biennial reflects the liberal policies of the Taipei city government, which is led by the leftish Democratic Progressive Party (the national government remains in the hands of the rightish Kuomintang). Though the Taipei government is building several new museums in town, the biennial is the most concrete evidence to date of the authorities' commitment to culture. It is a tough, provocative, politically eclectic show.
While neighboring sections of the globe have in recent decades assumed clear regional identities -- there is, to some degree, a culture of Southeast Asia -- the four countries of the north have remained culturally insulated. Each in its way has achieved a level of success and sophistication that has allowed it relative self-sufficiency, and all four are historically isolationist in any case. This biennial takes on the big questions: How do these four countries define an idea of Asia or of the Far East for Western viewers? How does each country combine its own artistic traditions with the modernist idea of internationalism? What constitutes originality in these cultures, and what is the status of originality in each one? How much is it possible or desirable for these societies to escape from their long histories? These questions, which underlie so much modern art from Asia, have never before been negotiated so thoroughly or so publicly.
Mr. Fumio writes in the exhibit's brochure: "Asia's cities are seeking a new post-colonial identity as they sculpt modernity. Its economies have grown, heated up and contracted. Its politics are in turmoil, and its democracies are beginning to take on unique shapes. Tradition is being re-examined, reborn and creatively transmitted. Western modernity is learned from, studied, copied, denied."
This exhibit will doubtless affect our understanding of Asian art for the long term. Looking around the show, one can see how a new canon is being etched into the collective conscious. Further evidence of it will be visible in the Asia Society's "Inside Out" exhibition opening next month in New York.
Mun-Lee Lin, the director of the Tapei museum, and Yulin Lee, the head of its international programs, wanted to insert Taiwan into the Asian-identity dialogue, and to make the island a center for cultural innovation. "In this time of globalization, the idea of 'Western' and 'Asian' problems is no longer meaningful," Mr. Lin said. "But as we approach technological par with the West, variations between Western and Eastern Zeitgeist become more potent, more significant and harder to define. We hope this exhibit will forward that debate, to the benefit of both West and East. We have studied the work of other countries as we have grappled with the question of who we are, looking at our local past, at the traditions brought over from the mainland in 1949, at the effect of American support and of the withdrawal of American support. We are a younger and less clearly defined society than are Japan, China and Korea; but it is now time for us to be the hosts, and to establish the place of our own artists."
The Taipei Fine Arts Museum is one of the worst conceived museum spaces in the world. The cavernous lobby always feels vacant; the glass atrium in the middle of the museum looks like an air shaft in an apartment block; and the galleries are either oppressively low ceilinged or vacantly high ceilinged and all poorly proportioned. Mr. Fumio commissioned artists for specific spaces, and he managed to bring every corner of the museum to life. Six works transform the lobby, including Choi Jeonghwa's 40-foot gold column topped by a motorized goddess whose wings beat just below the ceiling.
The dingy atrium has been filled with gigantic asymmetrical black-dotted fuschia balloons by Yayoi Kusama, one of the great names of Japanese modern art. Tied loosely to the atrium walls, these pink dirigibles shift very slightly and very slowly in the wind. They look benign as giant manatees, and the light that reflects off and through them gives the whole museum a welcoming, rosy glow.
The show mixes big names with relative unknowns. In addition to the work of Ms. Kusama, Mr. Choi and Mr. Cai, there are major pieces by such fixtures on the international exhibition scene as Nobuyoshi Araki, Tatsuo Miyajima, Chen Zhen, Ho Chungming and Xu Bing. Mr. Araki spent a month in Taipei photographing the mopeds that are the city's main form of transportation and then mounted these photographs in the form of a giant mural showing the dynamic motion of the new Taiwan. Mr. Miyajima has installed LED (light emitting diode) displays of unexplained changing numbers in a large room, leaving it dark except for the red and green glow of the shifting digits, evoking calculators, production figures, economics and the passage of time.
Ho Chungming's woodblocks, mounted like posted bills outside the museum, announce to visitors, "God Hates You: You Are Too Busy" and "God Hates You: You Are Too Lazy" and "God Hates You: You Are Too Fearful." Xu Bing, in the most sophisticated installation of all, has created a system of English-language characters, made exercise books, set up a classroom with desks, pots of ink, brushes and ink stones and produced a videotape of a teacher lecturing on brush-stroke technique in a voice that is at once deeply respectful and utterly patronizing of Chinese culture.
Much of the work by less-known artists is also effective. Wu Tien Chang has repainted a well-known 1950's Taiwanese painting of a Shanghai woman walking through a Taiwan market. While the locals are a grimy lot, the woman walks in a soft glow of supernal elegance, a manifestation of the racist views of the mainlanders who arrived in 1949 with Chiang Kai-shek. By projecting a film onto a mirrored reflection of the painting, Mr. Wu creates an illusion that the woman dances toward the viewer while the rest of the painting disappears. Sentimental music plays. As she comes closer, she becomes confusing: is she a woman or the artist in drag? Is she beautiful or grotesque? Welcoming or salacious? Superior or utterly lost?
The Korean artist Kim Beom's "Art of Transforming" plays on the ideas of the natural and the unnatural that have plagued Asians as they try to reconcile industry and tradition. In the installation,"How to Become Grass," there is a text from Mr. Kim that says, in part, : "Let your hair grow long and paste hay on your body. Dye your hair green in summer and ocher in winter. Lie still always, but in spring and fall, after dying your fingertips, point them to the sky and make a wish that your offspring will prosper. Gradually learn how to obtain the hair coloring from nature."
Some artists, including the Korean Bahc Mo and the Chinese Lin Yilin, built huge projects just outside the museum. Mr. Bahc has created a wonderfully typical, chaotic Asian construction site, while Mr. Lin has made a wall of bricks precariously balanced on one another, with paper money fluttering where there might have been cement.
Another artist, Cai Guoqiang, has caused the entire exterior of the Taipei Museum to disappear under a skin of commerce. Ringing the building is a bamboo advertising scaffold like the ones that enclose so many buildings across Asia, and covering it are actual advertisements, the sale of which helped pay for this hugely expensive project.
As might be expected, underlying any vanguard art show in Taiwan is an implied criticism of the cultural repression that still exists on the mainland. The artists in the biennial who reside in mainland China did not come to Taiwan. Unable to get the necessary exit papers from their own Government, they made their site-specific installations without direct experience of the sites, responding to photographs with drawings and instructions. They will never see the work completed or in place.
None of the strong work of these artists was included in the Guggenheim's exhibition of 20th-century Chinese art last winter in New York. The curators of that show have said in a letter to Artforum magazine: "We were able to present a history of 20th-century Chinese art that has not been manipulated for political purposes. Chinese institutions are now willing to have the recent past openly re-examined." The ambivalent position of contemporary Chinese arts in the Taiwan Bienniel contravenes such naivite.

HEADLINE: Big Plans for a Big Old Screen in Canaan

BYLINE: By FRANCES CHAMBERLAIN 

 BODY:
THE Colonial Theater in Canaan was the center of the town's social life when it opened in 1923. There were silent movies, vaudeville, dances in the upstairs ballroom and civic events on stage, including local high school graduations. The plush decorations and silk damask wall coverings led to it being called "Little Radio City." Only traces of that grandeur are still in evidence.
When the owner and operator of the theater, Shirley Boscardin, died in January of 1997, movies were shown for two more nights, then the Colonial closed. Since then the structure has been on the market, out of reach for most investors, not because of the price, but because of the expense of renovating and bringing the building up to code. 
 That's when a group of local people got involved. Nick Stuller, a businessman, had read about the plight of the theater in the newspapers. He held a preliminary meeting with Jason Sheckley, former projectionist at the Colonial. A group of 75 citizens, calling themselves the Colonial Community Theater Group Inc., placed a binder on the property on April 25, 1998. Since then the numbers have grown to 140, the group has gotten nonprofit status, and their plans have begun to take shape.
"The Berkshire Taconic Community Foundation is the parent nonprofit," explained Mr. Stuller, who is director of national sales with National Regulatory Services in Lakeville. "They'll be a guiding light and give us fund-raising ideas. The long-term plan is to bring back the theater and the ballroom and make use of the two adjacent retail locations."
The group's binder is on the theater only, and not on the adjacent parking lot. The total price for both is $249,000. "We need $156,000 total, $140,000 for the theater and $16,000 to cover operating expenses during the first year," Mr. Stuller said. "Six to 12 months later we'll buy the parking lot. But first we probably need about $1 million to totally renovate the theater."
The group intends to restore both theater and ballroom to their original grandeur. Once they have purchased the parking lot they will build a new theater with two screens. "The Colonial's architectural integrity won't be touched," Mr. Stuller said. The two storefronts that sit on either side of the grand entrance might be used for a food concession and/or retail purposes.
The Colonial was built as "The Casino" in 1923, a birthday present from Seth Mosely for his young wife. Movies had become increasingly popular in larger cities and the Casino was an immediate success. Double-wide doors lead into the foyer. A carpeted stairway lured visitors up to the ballroom with its rows of windows looking out over the marquee and the street.
The theater itself, filled today with 400 tattered seats, still has what is probably the biggest curved screen in northwest Connecticut. And the projection room, equipped with carbon arc projectors, delivers the quality that more modern theaters do, only on manual equipment purchased decades ago.
According to a brief history written by Mr. Sheckley, the Casino featured vaudeville shows and silent movies, with musical accompaniment by Miss Kegler, the local piano teacher.
One Canaan resident, Vivian Strekas, recounted going to see the 1924 version of "Peter Pan," starring Betty Bronson, Ernest Torrence and Anna May Wong, with 15 pennies to buy her ticket.
Although the Colonial, as it has been known since 1932, continued in business until 1997, business gradually declined. A flood damaged the basement in 1955. In the mid 1970's, the theater was forced to switch from first-run movies to second-run films. More repairs were deferred.
Still. the Colonial retains the spacious auditorium so unusual in movie theaters today, the 32-foot screen compares with a more usual 15 to 20 feet, and the equipment, state-of-the-art in its time, delivers high-quality sound and picture, without automation. Mr. Sheckley, who works as a photographer/writer at the Wassaic Development Center, in Wassaic, N.Y., has spent his spare time as a projectionist in various theaters since the early 1970's. His history of the Colonial, photographs of the building, and interviews in local papers were largely responsible for gathering support for the project.
Although the 140 participants in the Colonial Theater plan don't actually expect to make money, they do hope to provide area residents with interesting leisure-time activities.
"Our business plan will help us know what the communities will bear, just like any other business. We will hire consultants for market surveys," Mr. Stuller explained. "There's not a lot to do around here, and to be able to sit in a big screen theater with a plush environment that used to be known as 'Little Radio City,' is great."
"This becomes more of an experience," explained Mr. Sheckley. "It's not just like going to a movie." Canaan, he added, has 2,500 residents, but within a 15-mile radius there are 45,000 people, probably just enough to support three screens.
"With first-run movies you have to commit to six weeks," Mr. Sheckley added. "With three screens you have the potential to have first runs, plus a couple other films."
Both men see the project as revitalizing Canaan, a town that economic development passed by. "If we do this it'll build up the rest of the town," said Mr. Stuller.
"Canaan is a blighted downtown," added Mr. Sheckley. "I'd like to see the theater open lots of hours to get people used to being here."
Right now, Mr. Stuller and Mr. Sheckley are busying themselves with raising funds and gathering information about necessary renovations. "We've already hired a structural engineer, and the building is in good shape," Mr. Stuller said. "But it needs a $50,000 repair job for footings."
Once the building is purchased they will use one of the storefronts for a business office as they embark on renovations and additional fund raising. A model of the renovated theater has been built for a display. Other than structural repairs, initial efforts will focus on the marquee and Greek Revival facade. "In three to four months we should identify the numbers, get the studies done and start the work," Mr. Stuller said.
"Our biggest concern is to come up to code and get it open right away," Mr. Sheckley said. "There is no zoning in Canaan, and this building could become anything, but it means more to people as a theater. So many old buildings have been lost to development; it was important to save this."
The Colonial Community Theater Group Inc. is owned by the 140 community members who have volunteered funds or sweat equity.
"We benchmarked this off about a dozen other projects around the country," Mr. Stuller said. The revitalization of the Warner Theater in Torrington has been the result of a similar community effort, but features live performances rather than movies.
In Canaan, members of the Colonial group include weekend residents, tradespeople, even people who used to work at the Colonial in the 1940's, Mr. Sheckley explained.
"None of us are in it for the money, but for the community," added Mr. Stuller. "It needs to be done. People don't have enough to do around here. This project will benefit the people doing it, plus so many others."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Bernard Goldberg, Hotel Innovator;
5 Lodgings Sold, He Seeks a Bigger Challenge

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
BERNARD GOLDBERG thinks that minibars in hotel rooms are appalling. He contends that free chamber music performances will pay for themselves in guest satisfaction. And if orange juice is to be billed as fresh squeezed, he said, those oranges should stay intact until just minutes before the juice is delivered.
Mr. Goldberg's views on hotel operations command a certain amount of attention. Over the last 10 years he has taken five rundown but well-located small hotels in Manhattan and converted them to attractive properties catering to the city's booming tourist trade. 
 Now he wants to try something different. Last month he sold his entire portfolio, consisting of the five hotels plus an office building at 39 West 55th Street, to Credit Suisse First Boston, reportedly for close to $150 million. The hotels are the Shoreham, the Wales, the Franklin, the Mansfield and the Roger Williams. The office building is being converted into an addition to the Shoreham.
"It's time to do something different in size and concept," said Mr. Goldberg, who is chairman of Gotham Hospitality Group. He said he hoped to acquire control of one of the city's older, larger hotels and restore it to an elegance and style that he said they once had, but have lost.
"There are these old dowagers in this city that are tired and in need of an infusion of light and air," he said. Mr. Goldberg said he was looking for a hotel in the 800 to 1,200 room range. He declined to identify them, but hotel industry analysts said the group that he is considering probably includes the Pennsylvania and Roosevelt hotels, both of which are older properties that have undergone renovations.
Some hospitality specialists caution that running a big hotel is different from managing boutiques. Smaller hotels can afford to cater to business travelers and tourists, but large hotels must market themselves to larger groups to fill the rooms.
"A large hotel is a different animal in many ways from a boutique property," said Sean Hennessey, New York director of PricewaterhouseCoopers' gaming and hospitality practice. "Small hotels shun the group market, but big hotels have to concentrate on the group market to succeed."
He said that, as far as he knew, there had been no examples of an operator buying a big hotel and grafting boutique hotel concepts to it. But he did note that large hotels had the advantage of economies of scale, with management costs being spread over a larger number of rooms.
"If anyone can do it, Bernard can," said John A. Fox, a senior vice president of PKF Consulting, which specializes in hotels. He said Mr. Goldberg's success in taking buildings that were little short of single-room-occupancy residences and turning them into upscale hotels demonstrated his ability to add value to properties.
MR. GOLDBERG'S plans for a big hotel, provided he succeeds in gaining control of one, consist of style, customer satisfaction and variable pricing. All three, he said, are important to creating an experience that will induce travelers to come back to the hotel when they visit New York.
"When you stay at a hotel in Paris, you know that it is Paris," he said. "You need the same thing in New York. The hotel has to be thematic. It has to have the feeling of New York."
Although he said he had looked at hotel properties in Chicago and Aspen, Colo., he said he was not likely to acquire anything outside of New York. "New York is what I know," he said.
For his smaller hotels, Mr. Goldberg chose every piece of art and made sure that what was on the wall of the corridors was coordinated with furnishings in the guest rooms. He said that integrating the public spaces of a hotel with the guest rooms was important to creating a pleasant experience for guests.
"I looked at an 800-room hotel in the Broadway district where the owners had spent a lot of money on refurbishing rooms," he said. He said to reposition the hotel, as the owners wanted, would require throwing out all the newly purchased furniture because it clashed with the mass-produced hunting scenes decorating the walls. "They were from different countries and different periods," he said.
Small things count, Mr. Goldberg maintains. Like fresh flowers in public areas and guest rooms. "I was at one of the most expensive hotels in the city and they had an array of silk flowers in the lobby," he said. "Why not spend $100 to $200 a week to have fresh flowers in the rooms? That's called thinking about the guest."
Mr. Goldberg is a real estate lawyer who redeveloped distressed housing before buying his first hotel, the Wales, on Madison Avenue between 92d and 93d Streets, in 1988. He contends that a short-sighted focus on immediate earnings leads some hotel managers to do things that degrade the guest experience. Many hotels lease out ground floor space to retailers, because of the high rents these businesses are willing to pay.
But if the result is a tiny lobby, guests are cheated, he said. "If you have a 200-room hotel and a lobby that only fits 40 people, the guests notice it," he said. At the Roger Williams and the Mansfield, he took out stores to increase space in the lobby.
He said free amenities, such as chamber music concerts, breakfast and after-theater snacks, add to the guest experience because the hotel does not appear to be trying to squeeze nickels and dimes out of them. And he said the cost of these amenities is more than made up by higher room rates.
"You can change the character of a hotel with these amenities," he said. "You should serve scones and strawberries at tea time along with chamber music." He said he had installed machines that made cappuccino from freshly ground beans in his smaller hotels so that guests could serve themselves at any time.
Which is why he hates minibars. Forcing guests to pay high prices for a meager bag of chips or a soft drink leaves a bad taste, he said, Similarly, charging extra to watch a taped movie adds to the feeling of exploitation, he argues.
"Would you charge somebody to watch a movie at your home?" he asks. "That's what the guest experience should be, like a visit to your home."
With a big hotel, Mr. Goldberg said he would likely divide it into separate areas, with distinctive decors. His plan includes having a concierge on each floor, to help guests with their business or holiday in New York.
HE said he was planning to price rooms at an average of $225 a night. That would put prices between the current rates for first class and luxury hotels. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, first-class hotels in the city had an average rate of $193 a night in the first quarter of this year, while luxury hotels averaged $251 a night.
But the $225 number is only an average. Mr. Goldberg said he planned to use a form of marginal pricing to try to fill his hotel every night.
"People are saying that it is great that we have 90 percent occupancy," he said. "But in a 1,000-room hotel, that means that 100 rooms are vacant. That is the equivalent of a small hotel that is unoccupied."
He said he would follow a pricing model similar to the one used by airlines, which charge the highest prices to business travelers with inflexible schedules. The bargain seats are sold at far lower prices to people with more time than money, to insure that the airplanes fly as full as possible.
"We will have suites at $350 a night, but we will also have rooms for $99 a night," he said, to keep vacancies at a minimum. He said that food, music and other amenities would be available to all guests, regardless of what they are paying for their room.
"Anybody can make money running a hotel in New York today," he said. "But what happens when the downturn comes? If you are the hotel of choice for a lot of people, the business will take care of itself."

HEADLINE: Help Wanted Isn't Getting The Help Needed

BYLINE: By BILL SLOCUM 

 BODY:
FOR four long years now, the Help Wanted sign has sat on the counter of the Photo Shop in Greenwich, alongside the cash register and the boxes of Kodak film. The owner, Chris Holdt, occasionally dusts it, but that's about the only kind of activity the sign generates. There hasn't been a worthy applicant at his store in two years.
It's not as though Mr. Holdt is necessarily looking for help in the darkroom, or duplicating video footage. "We really just need someone who has basic sales skills, McDonald's even, who knows how to work a cash register, has a high-school diploma and can speak English," he said with a shake of his head. 
 Mr. Holdt's predicament is one familiar to business owners throughout Connecticut. Large or small, they have struggled to find what has become perhaps the state's most elusive species: the resident looking for work. The situation is particularly acute when it comes to workers with college educations.
In a survey of employers conducted by the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, more than 90 percent of 359 respondents reported that they either were having difficulty filling job openings or anticipated difficulty in the months ahead. Released last month, the survey may indicate that a years-long resurgence of the state economy has reached a plateau, association officials say.
"Right now you've got the mirror test: if you can breathe, you can work," said Peter Gioia, a C.B.I.A. economist. "When you realize how much Connecticut is dependent on skilled labor, in fields like insurance, computers, high-tech manufacturing and pharmaceuticals, then you see problems."
The theory is simple: Businesses need to add employees in order to grow. With a scarcity of new workers, they must improvise not only to find workers, but also to retain them in the face of a more competitive employment environment.
This is obviously a nice problem to have if you are searching for work, or if you are an incumbent politician dealing with an unemployment rate around 5 percent. But it troubles those who hope the state can regain the robust private-sector presence it enjoyed through the 1980's.
One person who has been tracking the issue since the beginning of this year is William A. McEachern, editor-in-chief of The Connecticut Economy Quarterly. More than 100,000 jobs have been recovered in state since late 1992, when the period he calls "The Great Recession" came to an end. What troubles him is the fact that Connecticut's labor force has been dipping, by 2,000 workers between early 1997 and early 1998 alone.
"If you're looking out there, saying what are the potential problems, and exclude things like the Asian crisis outside state borders, this is the chief concern," said Mr. McEachern, who is also a professor of economics at the University of Connecticut.
Mr. McEachern likens the situation to the riddle of the bumblebee, which is able to fly despite wings that are aerodynamically too short. While workers are in demand in other states, too, Connecticut's declining work force makes it unique.
"Through the 80's, we had very high labor participation, among the highest nationwide," Mr. McEachern said. "Now we are lower than the national average. How could that happen so quickly? I'm still wary of the numbers."
For many of the state's employers, the dilemma of the incredible shrinking work force is all too real. Asked if he's having difficulty finding workers, Dave DeMeo, vice president of administration for Fire-Lite Alarms, asks: "Do you know anybody?"
Mr. DeMeo was laughing, but added the situation is "not good." Fire-Lite, which produces complex fire detection systems nationwide and employs 525 people at its North Branford headquarters, is looking for help, especially engineers and computer programmers. There are typically 10 or 15 openings at Fire-Lite at any one time.
"I don't want to say it stifles growth to the point of reaching targets, because we're still enjoying revenue growth, but I could bring products on-line faster and add more projects," he said. "If I had an unlimited supply of workers, I think our growth could be faster."
One reason for Fire-Lite's growth is an engineering group in Louisville, Ky. "It's much easier to find qualified people there," he said. "We can actually place an ad and find people that way. Whereas here, there are certain people you just can't find."
What concerns observers isn't just that companies like Fire-Lite might relocate in search of a more easily tapped work force, but that other businesses outside Connecticut will be less encouraged to come into the state.
At the Pitney Bowes Credit Corporation in Shelton, it's becoming increasingly difficult to find people who can spend several hours a day on a telephone answering customer questions or chasing after unpaid bills. Peggy Anson, vice president of human resources, is looking to fill a total of 60 openings at this growing financial-services spin-off of the Stamford-based adding-machine giant.
"The cost associated with not filling a job in time becomes increasingly expensive," she said. "Then I have the incremental cost of having an existing employee cover. There I am running the risk of having that existing employee run out on me, which can cost money, too."
Such costs can include classified advertisements, plump benefits packages and even "finder's fees" to existing employees. Pitney Bowes Credit has even put together a videotape that highlights work-environment features like a coffee-break lounge designed to look like a 1950's diner.
People's Bank offers an unusual scholarship program that pays the total cost of higher education programs for participating employees. There are even stock incentives for those who earn associate's, bachelor's or graduate degrees.
"So there's a double hit here," said Barbara Phillips, People Bank's head of human resources. "We are willing to pay for your education, and we value what it brings to the bank. So we'll keep you around a while."
But the bank, based in Bridgeport and the largest lending institution based in the state, is still dealing with a higher turnover rate than it did two years ago, and averages 30 to 35 job openings a week.
The information-technology field is a particularly difficult place to find workers, Ms. Phillips said, because so many of them are being soaked up by Year 2000 projects. But tellers and customer service people are also in high demand.
One might expect the problem to be most acute in Stamford, which remained a magnet for new business throughout Connecticut's lean years and up to the present.
Mr. McEachern says Stamford has indeed seen a rise in job growth, but so has every other region of the state, even long-troubled areas like Danielson.
The Hartford metropolitan area seems to have more jobs than it can handle. According to the Connecticut Capitol Region Growth Council, a recent survey found more than 4,500 job openings at 32 companies based in Hartford and surrounding towns.
"Work-force development is the crucial issue," said Robert Santy, manager of the Growth Council's Millennium Project. "It's not that companies are saying they will move, but if we don't address this, that could become a problem."
The Millennium Project has sought to address the issue by retraining people for understaffed fields like precision machining, as well as trumpeting the region to young professionals.
"The biggest difficulty is competition," Mr. Santy said. "Young professionals have a lot of choices on where to go, and we haven't done a good-enough job recruiting them. It's not the package being offered by the company, it's the place itself."
Jim Nolan, president of the Branford-based Institute for Pharmaceutical Discovery, details several small but annoying problems in recruiting top-notch people to the New Haven area.
He recalled a recent visit to his company by a scientist and Nobel laureate whom Mr. Nolan wanted to impress. There were no hotels in the area, so they had to put the scientist up in a motel. There was no room service at the motel, so the scientist had to go outside and head for a diner a mile and a half away. There were no taxicabs, so the scientist had to walk to the diner.
"Connecticut needs a lot of work in the ways in which companies are attracted to an area," Mr. Nolan said. "I think the desire is there, but it has a ways to go."
The state's Department of Labor has stepped up its once-dormant job fair program, holding five of them in June alone. The department administrator, John Tirinzonie, noted that employers completely booked all but one of those fairs, with 82 at the Danbury fair alone.
Mr. Tirinzonie said the labor-dearth issue, while not severe, needs addressing. But he predicted the economy would continue to grow in Connecticut, especially in computer-related fields.
Mr. McEachern remains concerned. "As you dig deeper and deeper into the labor force, you get diminishing returns," he said.
"It's a good problem to have, particularly in the short run," he added. "You can see wages go up. But in the long run, if Connecticut becomes a more expensive place to do business, than it isn't so good."

Norwalk Bustles With Projects and Prospects

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
WHEN construction projects now under way are completed, and if the many proposals in negotiation between the city and several developers become realities, Norwalk could one day have some four million square feet of new retail, office, hotel and residential space. About two million square feet of the total would be added to an existing four million square feet of offices.
"In five years you won't recognize Norwalk," says its Mayor, Frank Esposito. 
 "We do have a lot of proposals," said Edward Musante, executive director of the Norwalk Redevelopment Agency, which has oversight on most of them.
Noting that many projects could not begin construction for two years or more, he said that "in five years we expect a lot to be done -- as long as the real estate market holds up."
Interest in the city is at a peak. "Norwalk is getting the play because there is no dirt left in Fairfield County and Stamford is filled up," said Brian Dornan, a broker with Pyramid Realty of Stamford. He has been handling commercial rentals in Norwalk for 10 years.
The city's plan focuses on extending development from the historic district of South Norwalk to the heart of the city's downtown, on Wall Street a mile away. In between, along West Avenue, there is a wasteland of vacant or marginal stores, troublesome nightclubs and a stretch of state-owned land at Exit 15 of Interstate 95 that cannot be developed beyond its current status as a grassy strip relieved by some outdoor sculpture.
It has been Mayor Esposito's long held vision "to tie South Norwalk to downtown," he said, "making us one city again."
Downtown and South Norwalk have been helped in recent years by city grants for facade improvements and by new businesses moving in. But they remain two disparate communities.
The traditional business district has always been downtown, but South Norwalk was reborn 20 years ago when Arthur Collins, a Stamford developer, restored Washington Street's abandoned, crime-infested 19th-century brick factories as boutiques and condominiums, creating a historic district with the help of Federal tax credits.
It got further help when the Maritime Aquarium around the corner on North Water Street opened 10 years ago, attracting tourists and day-trippers. Today it is the second of the state's major tourist attractions after Mystic Seaport, and it is expanding into an adjoining building.
But most of the original shops on Washington Street are gone, unable to meet rent increases or find a customer base, and the replacements are not always of good quality. Renting space to nightclubs in an effort to keep the street populated after dark backfired when tenants living above the clubs complained about loud music and rude behavior of patrons. One of them sucessfully sued the Rattlesnake Bar & Grill, according to the Mayor. "They had better start monitoring the noise or there will be more lawsuits," he said.
Empty stores, vandalism, dirty sidewalks and crime spilling over from the surrounding depressed neighborhoods have not discouraged new businesses and retailers from coming in. But, said Mr. Dornan, the real estate broker, "as much as you like to put in cutesy retail, you have to pay the rent."
"Greenwich Avenue and Westport have Banana Republic and the Gap to do deals with," he said. "This is Norwalk."
The city hopes to improve crime control by building a $10 million, 45,000-square-foot police station, designed by Valus & Carpenter, Westport architects, on Monroe Street, across from the South Norwalk Metro-North station and two blocks from Washington Street. "It will take two and a half years," said Harry Rilling, Norwalk's Chief of Police. "That area is full of weeds, abandoned buildings and graffiti. Cleaning it up and having a police presence there would encourage investors to come into the neighborhood."
The Mayor's plans focus on the Maritime Aquarium as a fulcrum from which new development will radiate. Across the street from the aquarium the Lock Building, an enormous old foreclosed factory, is to be developed by Clay Fowler, head of the Spinnaker Companies in Stamford, as a 600-car garage, with shops at street level and possibly offices above.
DIAGONALLY across from the aquarium one of its parking lots, with 126 spaces, will be replaced with a 150-unit apartment house developed by Mr. Fowler. A second 294-space lot north of the aquarium would be redeveloped by Simon Konover of Hartford as a 250-room hotel and an 85-unit apartment house overlooking the Norwalk River with onsite parking.
Behind the aquarium and running along the riverfront the linear Heritage Park is being installed by the city. When it is completed next year pedestrians and bicylists will be able to use it to travel from the aquarium over two new footbridges, past a new fishing pier and under an I-95 overpass to Mathews Park on West Avenue, home of the historic Lockwood-Mathews Mansion Museum. The Connecticut GraphicArts Museum is also in Mathews Park. An 18,000-square-foot Stepping Stones Children's Museum is also proposed for the park.
While utilities are being placed underground, a half mile of West Avenue from Mathews Park to Wall Street is being torn up in anticipation of a $150-million mixed use redevelopment by Stanley M. Seligson of Norwalk, designated developer for the project.
He is working with Landauer Associates in Manhattan to secure financing, and Arrowstreet of Somerville, Mass., on the architectural design. "A 40-acre combination of restaurants, apartments and shops with offices upstairs," said Mr. Seligson, "will make it look like Newbury Street in Boston."
Under construction by Mr. Seligson on Route 1 are new big-box stores for Sports Authority and Circuit City, fronted by an 18,000 square foot of small shops. Meanwhile, the West Norwalk Association is appealing in Superior Court in Stamford the Norwalk Zoning Board's approval of Mr. Seligson's proposal to build a Costco discount store nearby, objecting to increased traffic and concern over cleaning up existing soil contamination.
Opposite the Sports Authority and Circuit City sites a Super Stop & Shop is under construction, filling a dwindling number of parcels available on Route 1. The area is already lined with several major stores built within the last several years, including a Home Depot, Linens 'n' Things, Shoprite, two Staples stores, Nobody Beats the Wiz, Bob's Stores, Toys 'R' Us, TJ Maxx, Barnes & Noble and Comp USA.
Proposals by Fred F. French of Stamford carry the largest square footage of all. As the developer of two sites at West Avenue and Reed Street, the company could build 900,000-square-feet of offices in two or three nine- to 15-story buildings under current zoning regulations.
A third parcel behind Exit 15 of I-95, site of the Connecticut Limousine depot, is targeted by the company for a 15-story, 350,000-square-foot office building that would also accommodate the airport transportation service. Part of the property was purchased by the Norwalk-based Field Brothers, who would eventually have to work out a rental or sale to the French company, or face possible condemnation by the city, according to Mr. Musante.
"As the city's preferred developers, French, Konover and Fowler have until next June to come with an agreement with the city on their plans," said Mr. Musante. "During that time, while they are spending large sums on planning, architectural, engineering and legal fees, we will not talk to other developers regarding those sites. We already have an agreement with Mr. Seligson. He has three years in which to redevelop the West Avenue property. We expect a preliminary plan in about nine months."
Other projects yet to break ground are a 168,000-square-foot building to be erected for Purdue Frederick, a pharmaceutical company on Route 1, next to its existing 185,000 square foot headquarters; a 400,000-square-foot building for Norden Systems, radar systems producers, on their 84-acre property at the Westport border; a 250,000-square-foot building at the Merritt 7 office park on Route 7 for Hewitt Associates, employee benefits consultants in Lincolnshire, Ill., and another 250,000-square-foot building approved by the city for construction at Merritt 7 by the office park's owner, John Crosby.
If all this comes to fruition, will Norwalk's high taxes of $42 to $46 per $1,000 of assessment be reduced? "There will be some beneficial effect," said Kenneth Whitman, the tax assessor, "but most new construction will replace old buildings that are already taxed."
Whether the decline of Washington Street can be reversed is another question. "It will evolve the way it evolves," said Mr. Dornan. "South Norwalk clubs are the hottest in Fairfield County," he said, citing Symmetry, Velvet, Shenanigans, and the Loft, on South Main and Washington Streets.
"If a resident has a gift shop under him, O.K., but if it's a noisy nightclub -- it's a Catch 22," he said. "The city wants it but it's not working."

Loan Programs to Keep, and Draw, High-Tech Firms

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
NEW JERSEY'S three-year effort to retain and attract emerging high-technology companies took a step forward recently with the start of two financing programs by the state's Economic Development Authority.
They are the $100 million Technology Funding Program, meant for growing companies to expand, and the $3 million Seed Capital Program, intended to help businesses bring new products to the market. Under both programs, which became available in June, technology companies can get below-market-rate loans to construct new buildings, renovate existing buildings or to buy equipment. 
 Meanwhile, construction has started on the fifth building at the Technology Center of New Jersey, the state-sponsored research park taking shape on 50 acres along Route 1 in North Brunswick. The 60,000-square-foot structure has been designed for multiple tenants who get the space for a reasonable price and can expand in place as they grow. The new building, called Tech II, will join four others, together totaling 130,000 square feet, now at the park, which ultimately will comprise up to 800,000 square feet of office, research and production space.
The state has devised "a special program that takes a three-pronged approach" to nurture the growth of high-technology business, said Caren S. Franzini, executive director of the autonomous development authority. The approach, she said, involves promoting New Jersey as a high-technology state, making real estate available to companies and now providing financing to them. The authority is administering the financing programs and, using public and private funds, is developing the technology center in North Brunswick.
"We recognize that these companies can become the Microsofts of tomorrow," said Gualberto Medina, commissioner of the state's Department of Commerce and Economic Development. "Creating a favorable environment is good for these businesses and good business for the state because it will create jobs." Providing financing is another step in that direction, he added.
Science and technology-related companies are considered a growth engine for the state, which ranks seventh in the nation in the number of high-technology jobs. In 1997, about 168,000 people were employed in technology-related business, ranging from telecommunications and electronics to biotechnology and pharmaceutical concerns, with a total payroll of $9.9 billion, according to the latest figures available from the Federal Department of Commerce. There were also 145,000 research and development employees working in 700 laboratories.
New Jersey's appeal to emerging firms in those industries is not surprising. It is home to such communication giants as AT&T and its spinoff Lucent Technology, as well as to the David Sarnoff Research Center, which conducts electronics research. They provide a strong resource for the over 5,000 electronics, software and information technology concerns already in the state.
And its large concentration of drug companies -- including Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck, which produce at least 43 percent of the pharmaceuticals sold in the nation -- serve as a magnet for the 601 biotechnology, biomedical and health-care related firms that have sprung up here, says the New Jersey Technology Council, a Princeton-based nonprofit trade group.
The two recently initiated financing programs are expected to bridge "the gaps in the lending market" faced by these companies, which private lenders have viewed as risky because they lack the traditional "bricks and mortar collateral," said Ms. Franzini of the development authority. The programs are the result of discussions over the last year among state, industry, banking and academic leaders, she said.
To that end the authority, using its owns funds, which are derived from loan origination fees or interest income, will either provide loans itself, participate in or guarantee a portion of the loans secured from banks or do both. The programs are expected to assist 75 to 100 companies over the next few years, Ms. Franzini said.
The first company to take advantage of the Technology Funding Program is Price Systems, a software development and licensing business in Mount Laurel. Last year, the Lockheed Martin Company, its parent, wanted to sell the company and entertained bidders from other states that would have moved it out of New Jersey, said Anthony A. DeMarco, president of Price.
Instead, he and three other managers, using a $1.6 million state loan, purchased the assets of the business in July from Lockheed Martin. Mr. DeMarco said he would increase his New Jersey workforce, now at 26, by five to 10 employees a year for the next five years.
T HE goal of the management team was to retain as much equity and control of the company as possible," said Mr. DeMarco. Without the state loan, he said, that would have been difficult to do because while the company had "intellectual products, it had few of the tangible assets" banks traditionally look for when providing loans.
The Technology Funding Program, a joint effort of the authority and six commercial banks, is providing $100,000 to $3 million loans for up to 10 years to growing companies. To be eligible, companies must have, among other characteristics, a detailed business plan, a reasonable forecast of profit and licensing arrangements with or that it is selling to established companies.
Under the program the bank provides 70 to 75 percent of the loan at a market rate, and the authority gives the rest at a below-market fixed rate of 5 to 7 percent. If needed, the authority will also guarantee up to 50 percent of the bank's loan.
The blended interest rate lowers borrowing costs, Ms. Franzini said, while the shared financing reduces a bank's risk and leverages the authority's funds.
Bank executives agree.
"This gives banks the backing we need to get over the collateral issue," and makes the lending process "more palatable," said Christopher C. Giamo, a vice president at Commerce Bank, a lender based in Cherry Hill that was involved in the loan to Price Systems. He said the program will help stimulate more such loans.
Under the Seed Capital Program the authority, using $3 million of its own funds, provides loans of $25,000 to $200,000 to "first-stage companies." They are companies that, among other things, can demonstrate an ability to raise capital through investors, have a strong management team and have a product that exhibits a strong likelihood of commercialization. The loans are for five years and are at a fixed interest rate of 5 to 7 percent. Repayment terms will be flexible and varied and include royalties and warrants, Mr. Franzini said.
Last January Gov. Christine Todd Whitman also signed a package of bills into law, effective next Jan. 1, that will offer tax credits and tax incentives to technology-based businesses to help offset the costs of research and development. Prime among them is the technology business tax certificate transfer program, considered to be the first of its kind in the nation.
Under the program, to be administered by the Economic Development Authority, companies will be able to sell their unused net operating loss carryover and unused research and development tax credits to other businesses for at least 75 percent of their value. The selling company uses the proceeds of the sale of the tax benefits to help finance their growth within New Jersey, while the buying company uses the value of the benefits to reduce state taxes.
B Y freeing up more capital these companies, which live day-to-day, can breathe a sigh of relief," said Debbie Hart, executive director of the Biotechnology Council of New Jersey, a Trenton-based nonprofit trade group, referring to the financing programs. No one incentive is the panacea, she said, but added: "One-by-one the state is adding more tools to the arsenal to make it easier for companies to do business."
Providing affordable office and laboratory space at the Technology Center of New Jersey in North Brunswick is another way the state hopes to assure the future growth of high-technology companies. Construction began two and a half years ago at the center, which is designed to meet the needs of small and large research and development companies involved in biosciences, micro-electronics communications technologies and other pursuits. The 130,000 square feet of space in its four existing buildings has been fully leased to six companies employing more than 250 people.
Base rents at the center are $25 a square foot, which is 12 to 16 percent lower than the rent for comparable space in the area, said Thomas P. Sullivan, first vice president of the Iselin office of CB Richard Ellis, the national commercial brokerage, which is marketing the project. In addition, the Economic Development Authority offers financial assistance to help companies design and build their spaces, including tenant improvement allowances of up to $100 per square foot.
The 60,000-square-foot, one-story building now under construction, to be completed by next spring, could be divided into areas as small as 6,000 square feet, said Mr. Sullivan. Construction of the rest of the space will be driven by the market and include build-to-suit deals for specific tenants.

Calling Cadence for a Million

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
I want you to listen to me," the voice boomed out across a Harlem street Tuesday afternoon. "I did not have sex with that woman, Miss Lewinsky."
Craig Muhammad paused and smiled to himself. Then he lifted the bullhorn back to his lips and said: "Don't listen to the lying Mayors and Presidents! Come hear a black man tell the truth. Saturday, Sept. 5, head for the hills. The youth are coming, right here to Malcolm X Boulevard." 
 Mr. Muhammad is a warm, friendly 33-year-old with a big brother's smile and a few gray hairs in his close-cut fade. A lifelong resident of northern New Jersey, he is the son of a lawyer and a nurse, the brother of an accountant. Since he was 19, he has been immersed in the Nation of Islam, the black self-determination movement often associated more with incendiary rhetoric than with the frustrations and concerns that motivate Mr. Muhammad.
Mr. Muhammad is also the head of New Jersey's Million Youth March committee. No small job: after months of leafletting, phoning and driving in car caravans papered with march posters in Newark, Paterson, Jersey City, East Orange, Orange, Plainfield, Elizabeth, Trenton and Camden -- as well as supportive visits to Harlem, like Tuesday's -- he says he optimistically expects somewhere between a quarter of a million and half a million marchers from New Jersey.
And, he thinks, not a minute too soon.
"We've been told, just get an education, go to school, and everything will be all right," he said. "Well, it's not turning out like that."
Mr. Muhammad started working on the march last year, sandwiching it between the classes he's taking to get a bachelor's degree in engineering. The march was born after the Million Man March, in Washington D.C. in 1995, and the Million Woman March, in Philadelphia last fall, each of which drew hundreds of thousands of people.
Despite the similar titles, the three events have separate organizers and goals. The Million Man March was the creation of Rev. Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, and was billed as a call for black men to reclaim their place in the family. The women's march was the work of local Philadelphia activists, most of whom were not associated with the Nation, and focused on solidifying families and experiencing their own strength in numbers.
The youth march is largely the work of Khalid Muhammad, a former lieutenant of Mr. Farrakhan who was dismissed after a 1993 speech that included anti-Semitic and other controversial remarks and who is still considered "distanced" from the Nation. So are Craig Muhammad and others who spent long years devoted to the Nation but who chose to work on the march.
The seriousness of the rift is a question: some black Muslims say Mr. Farrakhan, who has also been known to make anti-Semitic remarks, is just testing Khalid Muhammad, and will eventually hand over the leadership of the Nation to him. Craig Muhammad, who admires both men, dismisses the charges of anti-Semitism as beside the point. "We're not out there because we're concerned with Jews," he said. "We're out there because we're concerned about black and Latino youth."
The march plans were opposed by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and the resulting tug-of-war has split Harlem, with some residents and much of the area's political establishment, like Representative Charles Rangel, denouncing the event as a "hate march." The organizers have been forced into court to fight for a march permit.
In any case, the march's mission is not only to bring together black and Latino youth (defined loosely, organizers say, as anywhere from 13 to 35 years old) for a lesson that "there's more to life than drinking and smoking and partying," according to Malik Zulu Shabazz, the march's national coordinator. The event, Mr. Shabazz said, is also meant as an exercise in organization that will leave in place a civil rights network -- the Black Power Organizing Committee.
Another goal, said the march's Washington organizer, Daniel Alec Runnels, is "to bring the next generation of leadership to the center stage."
For Craig Muhammad, the point of the march is to pick up where he believes the Civil Rights movement stopped: just short of addressing real economic and social disparities.
His awareness came early, back when he still went by the last name Smith. After the 1968 riots, his family moved from East Orange to Plainfield, and then in '79, when he was in his mid-teens, to an all-white neighborhood there, where the social world revolved around things he knew nothing about, like country clubs, social clubs, even, he said, the library.
"I saw just how really far apart the worlds were," Mr. Muhammad said. "We were not their social equals. It was like this: We were at the point where the whites could say, you can work with me, and you can live next to me. But we're still worlds apart."
While the neighbors went to prep schools, he attended Plainfield High, a public school. He got into fights, got expelled, did some drugs. And he kept wondering why black people were suffering. His grandfather had worked to desegregate schools along the Jersey Shore, which were some of the last in the northeast to hang onto racial enrollment. The struggle against apartheid in South Africa was becoming bloodier. Everywhere he looked, it seemed, he saw trouble. "There was a reason for it," he recalled thinking. "There had to be."
He sought answers, and began finding them in an unusual place. His barber was Keith Muhammad, an early follower of Louis Farrakhan.
Craig Muhammad said he remembered listening to his first Farrakhan speech, on tape. "I heard Minister Farrakhan break down the scriptures and relate it to black people's struggle in America," he said. "When I studied more, it all made perfect sense. I was like, wow. This is it! My search is over."
Keith Muhammad, the leader of a Nation of Islam mosque in Plainfield, said his new student flourished. "Because of his intelligence, he rose quickly through the ranks," he said, "and ultimately became a minister himself." In the process, Craig Smith became Craig X, losing what he calls his "slave name" and entering a new chapter of his life, eventually accepting from the Nation of Islam the last name Muhammad.
The teachings he has embraced include the beliefs that black people are divine by nature but behave badly because of circumstances and that white people are lesser descendants of black people, a reversed appropriation of the 19th century tenet that justified European colonialism. For Mr. Muhammad, the ideas are a way out of a cruelly limiting white-defined notion of what it means to be black. And the teachings stress that black people can uplift themselves only through their own efforts.
"It's time we get true freedom, justice and equality," he said. "I want to be able to drive down the turnpike and not be looking in my rearview mirror. I want to walk in a store and browse without people looking at me like I'm trying to steal something.
"There's a lot of factors about growing up black in America," he said, with a small, bitter laugh. "If I want to go buy a car, it takes 20 minutes for the salesperson to wait on me. A white person comes in, and they're all up in their face. With me, first thing, they run a credit check."
Mr. Muhammad never lost his historical understanding of World War II, and the Holocaust. "I'm not an idiot," he said. "I know it happened. And I realize Jews have suffered."
But he does see the events of World War II against a broader historical canvas: the deaths, which he numbers in the hundreds of millions, of enslaved Africans. "I really see there being a double standard," he said.
Between the organizing activities and doing enough construction work to pay his bills, Mr. Muhammad seems to have a life rich in purpose and in comrades, but one that has little time left for simple friendship.
DeLacy Davis, the founder of Black Cops Against Police Brutality, a New Jersey group that often works with the Nation of Islam, said he considered Mr. Muhammad a friend, but added: "In the black liberation world, or in the abolitionist world, as I prefer to call it, almost none of us socialize. It's a community based on principles, virtues and values. I have no desire to socialize. And it's safer for all of us if we keep ourselves diverse."
Mr. Muhammad chats easily with Cleve X, his captain, who serves as both assistant and bodyguard. But when Mr. Muhammad asks whether certain tasks were taken care of, Cleve X drops his conversational tone and makes sure the word "sir" peppers his answers.
Romantic relationships, too, are missing -- though Mr. Muhammad points out that his brother, Carl, the accountant, is also single. "I don't know what his problem is," he laughs. "I have a halfway flimsy excuse: I'm too busy."
At 8:30 P.M. on Tuesday, Craig Muhammad was wrapping up his day in Harlem at a march meeting, listening to Malik Shabazz address the audience of several hundred.
He had been more than 38 hours without sleep, and kept wiping his hand across his tired eyes. But when Mr. Shabazz lifted his fist at the end of his address and began chanting "Black Power" Mr. Muhammad's fist shot up too, and his voice lifted firmly in answer: "Black Power! Black Power! Black Power!"
 
Catching a Bus to the March
THE Million Youth March is scheduled for Saturday, Sept. 5. Craig Muhammad, the march organizer for New Jersey, says he expects the state to deliver the single largest parade contingent. (New York organizers agree.) He's hoping to put together a delegation of 250,000 to 500,000 people.
Buses will leaves from many college campuses and from Newark, Elizabeth, Jersey City, Camden, Trenton, East Orange, Plainfield and Asbury Park.
 People who need information about bus locations and fares should leave messages at (888) 832-8976 or (973) 510-5648, or call the march's New York office at (718) 398-1766.

HEADLINE: Leather for the Car: A Rising Tide of Hides

BYLINE: By DAN NEIL 

 BODY:
AMERICAN drivers have had their flings with vinyl, their dalliances with synthetics and crushed velour. Now, they seem to have developed a fetish for leather.
Auto makers tripled their use of leather from 1982 to 1992, according to a trade group, Leather Industries of America. Demand doubled again in the next five years, and the trend is accelerating. American tanneries serving the auto industry buy 20 percent of the 36 million hides produced domestically. At roughly 45 square feet per cow, that's 58 square miles -- enough to upholster Manhattan two and a half times, with enough skin left over for headrests. 
 Once the schmaltzy offering of a few luxury import brands like Rolls-Royce and Jaguar, leather is now tres ordinaire on midpriced sedans like the Toyota Camry and even economy cars like the Chevrolet Cavalier, and practically de rigueur on high-end sport utilities and top-line pickup trucks.
"People in the 60's might have been in love with synthetics," said Philip D. Kaltenbacher, 60, chairman and chief executive of the Seaton Company, a big supplier of leather seats to car makers. "The buyers' generation of today has this profound love of natural materials, like cotton, wood, stone and particularly leather."
 Five years ago, fewer than 2 percent of Honda Accords were sold with leather trim; about 35 percent now have it. Roughly half of the Ford Explorers and Jeep Grand Cherokees sold have leather interiors, along with nearly all the Lincoln Navigators and Mercury Mountaineers, the Lexus LX 470's and RX 300's, the Mitsubishi Monteros and GMC Denalis.
In sheer acreage, sport utilities account for much of the increased demand. "S.U.V.'s use two to three times more leather than the average car," said Drew Winter, an analyst with Ward's Automotive Reports.
 Even proletarian pickup trucks are filled with the heady scent of leather. About 10 percent of pickups have leather interiors, which may not sound like much until you consider that full-size pickups "are the highest-volume vehicles in the market," Mr. Winter said, with annual sales of almost two million. "That's a lot of leather."
 It is also a lot of money. Big trucks and sport utilities -- the industry's cash cows, if you will -- have taken a drubbing over environmental issues, and leather executives are eager to seem green. "The last thing we want is people thinking we're burning down rain forests for cattle just to put leather in big sport-utes," said Jeffery Bonello, a spokesman for the Eagle Ottawa Leather Company of Grand Haven, Mich., the largest supplier of leather to auto makers. In fact, most of the world's $2 billion supply of auto leather comes from North America.
 Tanneries have their own bad press to live down. Anders Segerdahl, president and chief executive of Eagle Ottawa, remembers when the chromium-laced effluent from one of his plants turned the hulls of white fishing boats shades of red. But his company, with annual sales of about $500 million, is now recognized as a pioneer in environmentally friendly tanning.
 "Nobody has done as much to clean up the leather-making process," said Charlie Myers, president of Leather Industries of America. In 1991, Eagle Ottawa's Grand Haven tannery was the first to convert from solvent-based to water-based finishing processes. In 1993, the company completed an on-site waste-water treatment plant. For his efforts, Mr. Segerdahl received the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Award in 1992 from President George Bush.
 These days, Eagle Ottawa is promoting its recyclable Phoenix leather, the first American automotive leather made without chromium. It is tanned with a vegetable extract made of Peruvian berries. (The exact kind is a closely held trade secret).
 Phoenix leather made its debut on the 1998 Volkswagen Passat, and though it is more expensive and trickier to process -- vegetable-tanned leathers tend to crack and discolor when subjected to intense sun, heat and cold -- it already exceeds vehicle recycling regulations anticipated in Europe.
Mr. Segerdahl, 74, learned his trade in the Old World, sorting hides in a 300-year-old tannery in Sweden, where his family's products included leather for buggy whips and Ford Model T's. He is also a footnote in the realm of kitsch culture, having coined "rich Corinthian leather," the catch phrase Ricardo Montalban trilled in the 1970's in commercials for the Chrysler Cordoba. "It was just a name we picked," Mr. Segerdahl said with a chuckle. "We thought it was funny when Montalban made it so famous."
 Mr. Montalban's seductive salesmanship lent an exotic touch to what was, in fact, a rather mundane type of embossed leather. Indeed, the Cordoba's interior wouldn't make the grade in today's marketplace of high-grade skins.
And while consumer expectations have soared, prices have remained relatively stable because of slackening demand in the domestic leather goods industry. In 20 years, for example, shoe production has fallen from 400 million pairs a year to 139 million.
Plenty of hides are available. While consumption of red meat -- the prime factor in the hide supply -- has declined in the United States and Europe, it has increased in Asia and the Pacific Rim. As a result, a slew of moderately priced cars can be had with newly affordable leather options. A leather package adds $895 to the sticker of a 1999 Mercury Cougar V6, or $795 to the Mercury Tracer LS Sport.
 Manufacturers can offer leather at the low end by making their cowhides go further. "If you look at the fine print on the sticker," said Mr. Myers of the leather industry group, "it may be a leather seating surface, but the entire interior of the car is not leather. Often the seat surrounds and backs are vinyl."
 The leasing boom has also raised demand. "When the salesman says, 'You know, for 10 bucks more a month you can have leather,' people go for it," Mr. Winter said.
And when the lease is up, leather often holds more of its original value than other add-ons. "When you consider usage and convenience it virtually pays for itself," said Tim Hippo, sales manager of Sir Walter Chevrolet in Raleigh, N.C.
 Such a statement might astound anyone who has tried to salvage the leather-lined insides of an old British sports car. Older leathers did not have much protective coating, and while they were softer, more aromatic and developed a lustrous patina through long use, they didn't look new for long. "In America, people want leather to wear like vinyl," said Don Brown, national product planning manager for Toyota.
 Manufacturers have mostly overcome the durability issue, but one problem remains. "Leather can be kind of boring, I guess," Mr. Brown said. "Designers are always looking for ways to add interest."
 The current generation of high-tech leather tries to recapture the feel of old-fashioned leather. These products can be coated, textured, perforated or embossed with a natural grain, or infused with a fragrance.
Mr. Segerdahl, dean of the industry, seems eager to face the next technical challenge and scorns retirement. "You know," he says, setting up the inevitable pun, "the business just gets under your skin."
 
Seeking Seats Without Skins
 
THE increasing use of leather in automobiles has come even as some fashion designers have turned away from leather, fur and other animal products. The designer Kenneth Cole recently introduced a line of leather-free shoes and belts.
Fashion and celebrity often travel hand in hand. Some music stars have gone out of their way to resist the ubiquitous use of leather in luxury vehicles, special-ordering their cars with prosaic cloth interiors.
"With leather seats, you're sitting on a lot of misery," said Dan Mathews, a spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Mr. Mathews noted that Paul and Linda McCartney typically custom-ordered their top-of-the-line Mercedes sedans with cloth seats, even though they had to wait weeks for delivery.
When a longtime animal rights activist, Kate Pierson, singer with the B-52's pop band, tried to buy a Mercedes ML320 sport utility last year, she couldn't find one with fabric upholstery and the premium sound system she wanted. The dealership in New Jersey told her it would take 10 months to custom-build an ML320 with cloth seats and the high-line audio equipment.
"I just wanted the options without the leather, and it seems like you can't do that," Ms. Pierson said in an interview.
Mercedes is by no means alone. Cloth interiors are either unavailable or require a special order in top-of-the-line cars from manufacturers like BMW, Lexus and Jaguar. In lesser models, leather is grouped with other popular features. "They call it the 'Leather Package,' " Ms. Pierson said. "Can you imagine that? What if they had the 'Fur Package'?" DAN NEIL

HEADLINE: Inspector Says He May Test Iraqi Resolve On Arms Sites

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 21

 BODY:
The chief United Nations arms inspector for Iraq, Richard Butler, warned today that he might soon test Baghdad's resolve to block further weapons inspections by sending his team to examine a new site.
"I do not rule this out," said Mr. Butler, the Australian diplomat who heads the United Nations Special Commission, or Unscom, which is charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. "We have plenty of interesting information, and it is I who decide when to launch an inspection." 
 The arms inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed its long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons before the Security Council will lift economic sanctions imposed in 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait, touching off the 1991 Persian Gulf war.
"If the Iraqis block us then obviously we can't do the inspection," Mr. Butler continued in an interview, adding, "but I simply don't know what the Security Council would do then."
Last Monday, the Security Council called Iraq's refusal to allow the inspectors to visit new sites "totally unacceptable" and instructed the inspectors to continue their work. But it studiously avoided making any new threats against Iraq or saying what it would do if the inspectors were stopped.
In an article on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times that day, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said that the commission had planned "some particularly intrusive inspections" this month, which Mr. Butler, consulting with her, canceled after Iraq broke off cooperation with the inspectors.
"Some in the Security Council would have muddied the waters by claiming again that Unscom had provoked Iraq," the Secretary of State wrote.
But a fresh standoff now between Iraq and the arms inspectors would increase the pressure on the Security Council to acknowledge that its orders are being flouted and to decide on a suitable reaction.
Many diplomats here have noted the contrast between the Clinton Administration's willingness to use force against terrorist organizations in Afghanistan and the Sudan this week and its reluctance to threaten any similar action against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
Since Aug. 5, when Iraq said it would no longer allow the inspectors to visit new sites, the 100-member United Nations inspection team has been confined to monitoring those it has already inspected to insure that they are not used for making prohibited weapons again.
Mr. Butler said he expected Iraq to begin a new vilification campaign against him and his commission on Monday when the United Nations mediator in Iraq, Prakash Shah of India, briefs the Council on his unsuccessful efforts to persuade Iraq to resume cooperation with the inspectors.
"We fully expect a stepped-up campaign in the Baghdad press and from senior officials, accusing us of being American stooges responsible for all the suffering of the Iraqi people," he said.
"They have done it before and they will do it again. The aim is simply to create a smoke screen around their refusal to cooperate or to give me the information I asked for."
Mr. Butler said that on four occasions in 1997 and 1998, independent teams of experts from as many as 15 countries examined Iraq's account of its biological weapons program and pronounced it "not even remotely credible."
He pointed out that for the first four years after the gulf war, Iraq denied having developed any biological weapons at all, only admitting that it sought to produce them in 1995.
Similarly, in the chemical weapons field, Mr. Butler said Iraq began by admitting to having made only 200 liters of the deadly nerve agent known as VX, which proved unstable and could therefore never be used in weapons.
But in fact, he said, the Special Commission has now established that Iraq manufactured some 3,900 liters of VX. Inside broken bomb casings, it has also found traces of both VX and the chemical used to stabilize it, which shows that Iraq did develop VX weapons.
Finally, Mr. Butler said he suspected that Iraq might be modifying its Volga and Al Samoud missiles to give them a range of more than 150 kilometers, about 95 miles, which is prohibited by the Security Council.
"When I asked them to stop," he said, "they refused and said I could monitor the missiles. But what chance is there of successful monitoring when they've suspended cooperation?"

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: C. Beth Cotner;
Putnam Investors Fund

BYLINE: By WILLIAM R. LONG 

 BODY:
WHEN to sell is an anxiously asked question in a jittery stock market. C. Beth Cotner offers some answers.
Ms. Cotner, lead manager of the Putnam Investors fund, imposes a "trim discipline" for fast-growing stocks: If a holding goes up 10 percent or at more than twice the market rate within 10 days, she trims her position by 10 percent, thus locking in some profit. 
 "A lot of times when stocks go up quickly it's because there's very positive news or positive developments that investors get euphoric about," she said, "and then later on, the euphoria wears off or something happens so the stock comes back down again."
On occasion, she buys back trimmed shares after the price has declined.
Such practices have helped make Putnam Investors a strong performer during her tenure. The fund -- categorized as a large-capitalization growth fund -- returned 18.59 percent for the 12 months ended Thursday, surpassing the 16.79 percent average of its peer group, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago. And the fund has narrowly outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index over the last three years and five years.
Started in December 1925, Putnam Investors is one of the three oldest open-end funds in the country. It has assets of $4.5 billion. Ms. Cotner, 45, has been lead manager since the end of September 1995; she previously managed mutual funds at Kemper Financial Services.
 THE fund's management team uses quantitative screening with a point system to find attractive stocks.
A computer model developed by Putnam Investments, based in Boston, scores companies on a 1-to-5 scale in each of five categories: potential earnings surprises, earnings revisions, cash-flow reinvestment, dividend yield and sales-to-price valuation.
Combining the category scores gives a company a composite score of 1 to 5, and a stock with a 1 or a 2 merits further study.
"When we've back-tested our model, 1's and 2's have consistently outperformed the market," while 5's have underperformed, Ms. Cotner said.
Then comes fundamental research -- visiting the companies, their suppliers and their competitors, then putting together extensive five-year earnings and cash-flow models.
Ms. Cotner said she discussed all buying decisions with the fund's co-managers, Richard B. England and Manuel H. Weiss.
"If there's a controversial issue, we try to assign someone to be the devil's advocate," Ms. Cotner said. No miracles are required for a stock to make the portfolio, she added, but "we try to reach the right decision, not just one that seems to be easy to reach."
Once a stock is in the portfolio, the three managers continually review its financial and management fundamentals. If there is a basic problem, or a company is likely to miss earnings targets, Ms. Cotner said, "we'll eliminate the whole position."
Or, when a company is doing well and its share price is growing, "we'll trim the stock, if it just gets to be too large as a percentage of the overall portfolio," she said. The co-managers rebalance the portfolio each quarter.
For example, "we would trim back something like Microsoft to 3 percent," Ms. Cotner said. "If we just let it ride all the time and it never hit the trim discipline, it might just gradually over time grow to be 10 percent of the portfolio, and that's too big."
Using their quantitative scoring program, the co-managers rescreen the portfolio's stocks daily, immediately looking into any that have fallen to a 4 or 5.
"If it remains a 4 more than a week or two, it triggers a sell decision on our part, and by the time it gets to a 5, it's gone from the portfolio," she said.
Growth stocks tend to do better than value stocks under current economic conditions, with a slowing economy and stable interest rates, Ms. Cotner said, but she acknowledged that because of its growth bias, Putnam Investors tends to be slightly more volatile than the benchmark S.& P. 500 and could underperform in a down market.
 FINDING stocks that would weather a bear market is not easy, she said. The best bets might include drug chains and grocery chains, "areas that are relatively immune" from economic or political events, she said.
Among these groups, Putnam Investors has stakes in Safeway Inc., the Walgreen Company and the CVS Corporation.
CVS, the nation's No. 2 pharmacy chain, after Walgreen, has been expanding rapidly through acquisitions and now has more than 4,000 stores.
In 1997 it merged with Revco, which had more than 2,500 stores, and this year it bought Arbor, a Michigan chain with more than 200 stores.
"They get a lot of their sales through filling prescription drugs," Ms. Cotner said.
Thanks to the aging population and recent approvals of new drugs like Viagra, "prescription drugs are growing very rapidly," she said, adding that "drugs are taken no matter whether the economy is strong or weak."
CVS is also good at merchandising in the other parts of its stores, she said, adding, "They have been able to go into the newly acquired stores and ramp up their product offerings in what's called the front end of the store."
Ms. Cotner predicted that CVS earnings would grow 18 percent this year and again next year. Putnam Investors bought the stock, which is now trading at $44.25, at $22 more than two years ago. She expects the stock to reach $57 in 12 months.
Another retailer that Ms. Cotner likes is Wal-Mart Stores. It has been improving its systems by allowing stores to cut prices to meet local competition and to manage in-store inventories more efficiently. Putnam Investors started buying Wal-Mart stock in spring 1997 at about $28 a share, and it continued to buy over the last year, for an average cost of about $40, Ms. Cotner said. The stock ended last week at $65.1875.
A year from now, the price could be $75, she estimated.
The No. 1 holding in Ms. Cotner's fund is Tyco International, a holding company with a market capitalization of about $35 billion and subsidiaries that offer disposable medical and specialty products, fire and security services, flow-control supplies and equipment, electrical and electronic components and underwater telecommunications systems.
Tyco announced in May that it was buying the U.S. Surgical Corporation, a medical products company, in a $3.3 billion stock trade. That and other acquisitions, Ms. Cotner said, are expected to raise the company's earnings.
"Basically, their strategy is to buy the company," Ms. Cotner said. "They cut costs quickly in the first year, and then they build the businesses in the second, third and fourth years so that not only do they get cost-cuttings, but they get growth."
Tyco is expected to earn $2 a share for the fiscal year ending in September, up about 40 percent, and for the next year she foresees $2.65, up about 33 percent.
Her fund bought Tyco early last year "at around 30," she said. In Putnam's last S.E.C. filing in January, Tyco accounted for 2.1 percent of assets. A spokesman said the fund had since built up the position, but declined to say how much. Tyco is now trading at $59, and Ms. Cotner predicted that it would reach about $80 in 12 months.
Such predictions, of course, are based on the assumption that a particular stock's gains will not be wiped out by the treacherous currents of a volatile stock market. But the thought does cross Ms. Cotner's mind.
She spent her childhood in Crescent City, a usually tranquil spot on the coast of Northern California, where a tidal wave struck in 1961. "A lot of houses there got wiped out -- a lot of casualties," she said. "Maybe you can tie that in to the tidal wave of today's market."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
The Black Investor, Playing Catch-Up

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
ALFRED G. OSBOURNE got right to the point recently in urging stock ownership on a group of African-American health care workers in the Bronx.
"Over time, inflation is going to eat your assets alive," Mr. Osbourne, a broker for the financial services group of the American Express Company, warned an audience clad in lab coats and scuffed sneakers at the Morrisania Health Center in the South Bronx. To pay for children's college educations and build a retirement nest egg, he said, "you need to have some money in the equity market; mutual funds are one of the nice ways to get started." 
 Nothing new there. But the reaction was illuminating. Most of the more than 50 people who attended Mr. Osbourne's workshops this day filled out forms requesting private consultations with him.
But he often sees such reaction these days when he speaks to blacks about investing. Moreover, he says, roughly two out of five of the people he sits down with set up a stock-buying plan and "follow through and stick to it."
A momentous shift is taking place in the investment practices of black Americans. Abandoning the conservative habits of their parents and grandparents, rising numbers are putting their savings into stocks rather than real estate, insurance policies and certificates of deposit.
Traditionally, blacks have shied away from stocks -- partly out of mistrust of Wall Street, partly because Wall Street showed little interest in their money and partly out of ignorance as to how the stock market worked. "My parents didn't even have a checking account," said George M. Daniels, who grew up in St. Louis and who has helped run an African-American investment club in Manhattan for 15 years. "We aren't taught a lot about these things. We didn't know. The main thing then was insurance."
But as the black middle class has mushroomed in recent years and black buying power has surged -- to more than $500 billion this year from just over $300 billion in 1990 -- blacks are being wooed by brokers as never before and are increasingly jumping on the stock-market bandwagon.
"Historically, in the African-American community, the vast majority of the family's assets was in the house, with the rest in the automobile, with virtually no money invested in the equity market," said J. Eugene Grigsby, a public policy specialist at the University of California at Los Angeles. Until the late 1970's, most middle-class African-Americans worked in the public sector. But as more blacks took jobs in the private sector, especially at big corporations, they became more familiar with investment concepts like "stock options, financial statements and returns on investment," Mr. Grigsby said, and the allure of stocks grew.
Today, 57 percent of black households with annual incomes of more than $50,000 have money in the stock market, according to a survey conducted by Yankelovich Partners for Ariel Mutual Funds, an investment company in Chicago that is run by blacks, and Charles Schwab & Company, the big discount brokerage firm. While there are no comparable survey figures for past years, brokers and investment bankers said the percentage represented a huge increase from the mid-1980's.
To be sure, the proportion of whites in the same income bracket who own stocks is much higher -- 81 percent -- according to the study, but specialists say the gap appears to be closing. Anecdotal evidence shows that the number of predominantly black investment clubs has proliferated, though the National Association of Investors Corporation in Madison Heights, Mich., the country's main investment club organization, does not track their numbers. And a recent survey by Target Market News, a Chicago research firm that monitors habits of black consumers, shows that the number of black investors has been growing rapidly since 1995.
"A rush to catch up is the driving force," said Ken Smikle, the president of Target. "There is a need to rush, frankly, because the market has been ignored for so long."
J. Fred Acree, 38, a mortgage loan originator with a minority-owned firm in Winston-Salem, N.C., illustrates the trend. When he was growing up in Augusta, Ga., his family "had the house, and we had the insurance," Mr. Acree said.
"Anything else, we weren't really aware of," he added. "There wasn't really anyone to make us aware of that."
After attending college, Mr. Acree spent years putting all his spare cash into a savings account, waiting until just a few years ago to funnel some of the money into stocks.
The opportunity to deal with a black stockbroker -- "the only one I know of in that office" -- also gave him "a little bit more of a sense of pride," he said.
His broker, Duane Davis, who works for First Union Brokerage Services in Winston-Salem, recently founded the Coalition of Black Investors, a national organization that is holding seminars across the country to address what it perceives as a lack of knowledge among black Americans about finance and investments.
"The fact is that the largest emerging market in the world is the minority market in this country," the Rev. Jesse Jackson said this summer at a New York conference intended to attract capital to minority groups. "African-Americans and Latinos control more than $700 billion a year in buying power. That's more than all of Mexico, all of India, all of Switzerland, all of Indonesia and all of South Africa."
Mr. Jackson also has been putting pressure on investment banks to hire more blacks and other minority-group members.
 
'The New Boom Market'
Big retail banks, long the main point of contact for blacks with the financial services industry, have for the last 20 years been taking steps to improve corporate diversity efforts and to focus marketing on ethnic groups. Only lately, though, has the brokerage industry awakened to the potentially lucrative market. But it has done so with a rush of activity, even as the bull market is starting to look a bit long in the tooth.
Mic Alexander, who works in her family's commercial-printing business in Charlotte, N.C., said she now receives an average of five investment pitches a week from investment firms, even though "lack of time and lack of interest" have largely kept her away from the stock market. Nevertheless, she said, her mother's interest has been piqued.
Tony Chapelle, publisher of Securities Pro, a newsletter that reports on African-Americans in the securities industry, said there was "a realization among the more progressive firms that blacks have money and they represent the new boom market."
At American Express, Thomas V. Nicolosi, a group vice president and Mr. Osbourne's boss, said that it was in the early 1990's, after his company completed a diversity study, that he fully realized that financial services firms were not adequately serving some ethnic groups. And it has been only in the last two or three years, he said, that American Express has created nationwide teams to offer financial education to potential black clients.
As part of its aggressive courting of black investors, American Express this year began using Tiger Woods, the champion golfer of African-Asian parentage, and his father, Earl, who is black, as a key part of its marketing strategy in print and television advertisements.
Likewise, Merrill Lynch started several stock investment programs aimed at minority-group investors after taking a close look at recent census data and calculating their growing economic power, according to Dan Haughton, a senior director for marketing services at the firm. Merrill Lynch has also been hiring more black stockbrokers.
"Our clients, our shareholders are demanding more and more that our employees look like them," said Westina Matthews, Merrill Lynch's first vice president and senior director, who earlier this year was given the responsibility of promoting diversity at the firm. Though there are still just a handful of African-Americans in the upper echelons of Wall Street, they include E. Stanley O'Neal, the chief financial officer of Merrill Lynch, probably the second-most-prominent black in the industry, after Kenneth I. Chenault, president and chief operating officer of American Express.
Black-owned investment firms are also getting the message out. Ariel, one of the biggest, with more than $2.5 billion in funds under management, has set an ambitious goal. "Our mission is to make the stock market a subject of dinner conversation in every black home in America," said Mellody Hobson, Ariel's senior vice president for marketing, when her company and Schwab released the recent survey. Schwab said it joined Ariel in sponsoring the survey because it wanted more information on what it saw as an underserved market.
 
Smaller Nest Eggs
Notwithstanding their budding love affair with stocks, blacks have a long way to go to catch up with other investors.
While middle- and upper-class Americans of all races have been stampeding into equities, racking up average gains of 20 percent a year for most of the last decade, the figures for the overall population indicate that this has brought more benefits to the white majority. According to 1994 census data, the latest available, only 6.2 percent of African-Americans owned equities, compared with 23 percent of all Americans.
One reason for that is that more affluent blacks generally save less than their white counterparts. The Ariel-Schwab survey, for example, showed that black households with annual incomes of $50,000 or more saved an average of $267 a month, versus $488 for similar white households. (That comparison, however, is skewed somewhat by the fact that the black families surveyed had lower average incomes than the whites -- $75,800, compared with $82,100.) As a result of the lower rates of stock ownership and savings, the black households in the survey had accumulated much smaller average retirement nest eggs than white families: $42,000, compared with $88,000.
Historically, blacks "have had less capital to invest, and the capital they did have, they took a more conservative strategy than they should have done," said Christopher J. Williams, an African-American Wall Streeter who left Lehman Brothers a few years ago to start his own bond business, the Williams Capital Group.
In addition, he said, many African-Americans until recently "did not have longstanding employment with companies to get into 401(k) plans." Such plans, which typically allow an employee to invest automatically in a range of mutual funds, are the path to first-time equity investments for as many as a quarter of all investors, according to the Ariel-Schwab poll.
 
The Unwelcome Mat
As more blacks are tempted by stocks, they face a nerve-jangling quandary: whether to jump in now as the seven-year bull market shows signs of sputtering, or to hold back and possibly fall even further behind. Some black investors fear that they may be the last people to join the party and the first to suffer a hangover.
"We're getting on board a train that is already moving," said Edgar J. Hicks, 50, an African-American grain broker in Omaha. "My contention is that when this thing does back off, we may be the ones that get hurt the most, because we are investing late in the cycle."
Mr. Hicks has joined an investment club that grew out of the African-American congregation at the Salem Baptist Church in north Omaha. Now in its third year, the 20-member club has had so-so results in its stock market investments, despite the market's huge run-up during the period.
"We're doing O.K., but part of our problem is we've bought the popular stocks," Mr. Hicks said, meaning shares in companies that already had seen the best of their gains or that simply were familiar to the group because of their big local operations. Lucent Technologies was a winner but Calenergy and Union Pacific have been disappointments.
"There are real pressures on us out here, when the market is running this good," he said. "If we aren't participating in this, we are losing."
Mr. Hicks said he first struggled to understand the ins and outs of the stock market in the 1960's, when he was growing up in Shreveport, La., the son of a physician. As a young man, he made a disastrous first investment in the Penn Central Transportation Company, the debt-ridden railroad that ultimately collapsed in the late 1970's. He said he was drawn to Penn Central because he was "always interested in the grain market, the railroad, and the outside." But these vague instincts were no substitute for the tough research that might have provided the young investor with some inkling of the troubles brewing at the company.
"The problem I had was, who could give you pointers on how to do it?" Mr. Hicks said in an interview from his office at DHV Inc. in Omaha. Such information wasn't easy to come by for a black man; even in the 1970's, he recalled, he was practically turned away at the entrance of the local office of Merrill Lynch. "You weren't well-received when you went in there," he said, describing how the office manager would hurry to meet him at the door and block his way.
(James Wiggins, a Merrill Lynch spokesman, said, "If he was offended in any way, we'd want to apologize for that, because it's certainly not our policy to treat anyone badly who comes into our offices.")
Even after 25 years in his business, Mr. Hicks said, he still occasionally feels that some whites look on him as a curiosity.
"I find it a real struggle," Mr. Hicks said. "People are inquisitive about a black person being in finance, trading in grain."
 
More User-Friendly
 Critics of financial services companies say the firms still have a long way to go in their dealings with minority populations.
Hilary Bailey, a Jamaican-born economist, surveyed 700 fellow members of St. Paul's Community Baptist Church on Hendrix Street in Brooklyn about their financial circumstances and habits. Based on the results, he faulted local financial firms for failing to offer the community a broad-enough array of services and products, from business loans to retirement investments. Big banks were the dominant providers of financial services for the people he polled, Mr. Bailey said, but they mostly sold mortgages and credit cards.
Mr. Osbourne, the American Express broker, says he is trying to change such patterns. Churches like Mr. Bailey's, he said, are ideal places to promote his products. "I do a tremendous amount of work with the churches -- that's my target market," Mr. Osbourne said in an interview at his office in the Kew Gardens section of Queens. Mr. Osbourne, who says he advises 540 clients, half of them black, recently sponsored a brunch at Canaan Baptist Church in Harlem for 55 pastors.
Still, the old resistance can die hard. "There is a mistrust of Wall Street" in the black community, said Mr. Chapelle, the newsletter publisher. He recalled how his own father, a lawyer who grew up in the shadow of the Great Depression, said he "would rather play the horses than invest in the stock market," because of his fears about the potential for market manipulation by big Wall Street firms.
"Wall Street may conjure images of opportunity and shared prosperity for white Americans, but black Americans have generally seen Wall Street as somewhere that is suspicious," Mr. Chapelle said. "For the most part, Wall Street has never been a place that has been trying to make investments in black America."
A result, he said, is that "African-Americans are still about 10 years behind the Money magazine, baby-boomer generation."
 
Taking the Plunge
While that may be true of the group, a growing number of individuals investing for the longer term -- especially college-educated blacks -- are keeping up with the pack. Consider Charles Hicks, a safety engineer with the Ford Motor Company in Detroit.
Mr. Hicks said he first became interested in investing after college. He and some of his contemporaries decided to start an investment club, which is still going strong 18 years later and which he says has achieved compound annual average returns of close to 30 percent a year. The group has even bought into radio stations, he said.
Or consider 15 Fund Inc., an investment club in New York City that was created in 1983 by friends who decided to give up Lotto and try their luck in stocks.
"We used to pool our money to buy lottery tickets," said Mr. Daniels, a founder of the club, whose members at the time were mainly church workers. "We didn't win anything. So we said we'll do better if we get into the stock market."
The friends started putting in $25 a month each, said Mr. Daniels, who is now retired from his job as a journalist with the United Methodist Church in Manhattan; some have since raised their contributions to $50 or $100. The club has invested in blue-chip stocks like Coca-Cola Enterprises, the bottling company, as well as Home Depot and Lucent, to earn average annual returns of 15 percent to 16 percent over the last decade, he added.
The goal of the club, which now has 14 members and belongs to the National Association of Investment Clubs, is to earn returns of 10 percent to 15 percent on each stock and to double its money every five years.
Mr. Daniels, who never bought stocks until he became involved in the club, said black investors' caution about the stock market was understandable. "Anything that you don't know much about, you're scared about," he said.
But African-Americans have become more sophisticated about stocks in recent years, he said -- especially the younger generation. Mr. Daniels has bought his 7-year-old grandson some stock in McDonald's, he said, and likes to tell him that "that's one of your hamburgers you're eating" when they visit the local outlet.
"I'll do it later with Disney," he said.

Studying the Fine Print In Tuition Saving Plans

BYLINE: By ANNE TERGESEN 

 BODY:
WHEN Michael Cryans had to save for college for his older son, Cameron, now 22 and entering his senior year at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, he did it the old-fashioned way: He put aside about $25,000 in savings bonds and passbook accounts.
Now in a second marriage, Mr. Cryans has a 1-year-old son, Connor. And this time, Mr. Cryans has a new range of financial instruments at his disposal -- a good thing, too, because that $25,000 would barely cover half the projected cost of a year at a private school by the time Connor enrolled. 
 "Having had the opportunity to put one child through college already, I can appreciate the commitment you have to make to be prepared," said Mr. Cryans, who is 47 and a small-business consultant.
Indeed, he and his wife, Julie, have already started to save for Connor in one of a growing number of college savings plans run by state governments.
Last year, amid considerable fanfare, Congress created the Education I.R.A., similar to an individual retirement account, in which parents may save for their children's education. But somewhat overlooked were steps Congress took to clarify the tax status of the state-sponsored plans, which permit much larger contributions than allowed by the Education I.R.A. and are thus likely to attract much more consumer interest.
Among other things, Congress allowed the state plans to expand beyond tuition to cover room and board, effectively doubling the amount of money that families can save through them. The range varies from state to state, but many allow total contributions of as much as $100,000.
In response, the number of state-sponsored college savings plans is expected to double this year, to 41, according to the College Savings Plan Network, a nonprofit organization that tracks and advises the funds, with almost all the growth coming from a breed of state plans that resemble mutual funds. Indeed, the New York metropolitan region is seeing a sprouting of such funds: Connecticut started its program in January; New Jersey's began earlier this month, and New York's will commence in September.
Though college savings plans vary from state to state, there are two basic varieties: the older type, which guarantee returns, and the newer, which don't. Until this year, most plans came with guarantees to lock in tuition rates at current prices. In Ohio, for example, parents of a newborn who paid $3,655 last year can be sure their investment will cover a year at a state-run college or university.
Generally, should a child ultimately not attend a public college in that state, the sum can be transferred to another institution -- in or out of state -- or to a sibling. It can also be refunded, minus a small penalty fee.
Guaranteed plans are intended to do no more than keep up with the "college inflation rate" -- the rate of increase in tuition, which is now 6 percent to 7.5 percent. The new savings plans aim to do better.
These plans, many of them managed by professional investment powerhouses including Fidelity Investments and T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F., typically take greater risks in hopes of earning higher returns. And like the bonds and stock mutual funds in which they invest, the new plans come without safety nets: Thus, investors' nest eggs could sour as easily as they could soar.
Guaranteed or not, are the state-sponsored plans a smart way to save?
Despite the new tax advantages, most financial planners are cool toward both concepts. With college inflation running several percentage points below the 10 percent average annual return on stocks, guaranteed-plan investors can do better elsewhere, said Ray Loewe, president of College Money, a financial planning firm in Marlton, N.J.
Financial advisers are also suspicious of the nonguaranteed plans, pointing out that most are too new to have the track records they look for. And while these plans deliver tax savings, they also tack on more fees than popular no-load mutual funds. For example, to participate in New Hampshire's plan, the Cryans will pay annual charges of $3 for every $1,000 they have saved.
The plans are also not as flexible as regular mutual funds. For example, if Connor decides not to go to college or the Cryans need money for an emergency, the family will owe taxes and a 15 percent penalty on the account's investment growth. And though financial aid rules vary from college to college, many count state plans as scholarships or a child's property -- treatment that can compromise eligibility for grants.
Still, for many people, the tax benefits may outweigh these disadvantages. Gains on investments in regular mutual funds are taxed at a parent's capital-gains rate, generally 20 percent, but growth in a state plan is taxed only when used, and then at the child's tax rate, which is usually 15 percent. Many states also exempt gains in their plans from state taxes.
Moreover, several new plans use an asset-allocation method that financial planners favor, investing in portfolios of several stock and bond funds that grow more conservative as a child ages.
Fidelity, which edged several rivals to win the new plan business for Delaware, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, sees it as an important part of college financing's future. Fund companies cannot sell the plans directly because only states can legally sponsor them.
"When we looked at the changes in the tax laws, these programs represent for most people the best alternative," said Stephen Mitchell, senior vice president at Fidelity.
 THOUGH less popular now, the guaranteed plans would be revitalized if stocks sank or college inflation accelerated. Indeed, risk-averse investors seem willing to shed a few percentage points of gains for the security of a guarantee.
"I don't feel like we are losing anything," said Gwen Martino, a school librarian in Brookfield, Ohio. By saving $100 a month for the last six years, she and her husband, Daniel, have amassed nearly enough to buy Daniel Jeffrey, 9, and Alessandra, 6, a year's tuition each at an Ohio public college. "Granted, we could make more, but isn't that always the gamble with the stock market? You could make more but you could also lose your shirt," Mrs. Martino said.
As for the Education I.R.A., contributions are limited to just $500 annually; its biggest selling point is its tax-free status: all gains accumulate free of Federal taxes, provided the funds are used for school. That makes it "the hands-down winner in terms of tax advantage" among college financing alternatives, Mr. Mitchell said.
Parents thinking about investing in both a state-sponsored plan and an Education I.R.A. should think again. You cannot contribute to both, at least in the same year.

Information Age? Maybe Not, When It Comes to Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
EVEN as the Internet has given consumers a powerful tool for learning what things cost, sizable chunks of American business seem determined to make price comparisons hard, sometimes frustratingly so.
Consider the Oreck Corporation, which boasts that its compact XL vacuum cleaner has been embraced by luxury hotels and that the XL's four-pound supplementary vacuum is so powerful that it can pick up a 16-pound bowling ball. Oreck promotes these products heavily on radio and television, on fliers accompanying credit-card bills and in such mass-market publications as Parade magazine. 
 But the prices of these marvels are not divulged: The potential buyer must mail or phone a request for an "information kit" to learn them.
A consumer may also be frustrated when banks post or orally quote mortgage rates but refuse to actually make agreements on these terms until he plunks down cash to "lock in," typically hundreds of dollars.
"This sure discourages comparison-shopping," contended Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, which has mounted a campaign against the practice.
Then there is America Online, which was luring new subscribers with offers of free time but without specifying the costs at the end of the trial period. The company agreed this spring to explain its charges more clearly as part of a broad settlement with 44 state attorneys general.
Except in financial services, there are few laws or regulations requiring sellers to disclose prices to prospective buyers, whether the item in question is a house or car -- both usually subject to negotiation anyway -- a box of cereal or even the product widely considered to serve as the economy's most visible barometer, a gallon of gasoline. For the most part, the Government just polices advertising to keep it from being false or misleading.
"Our interest gets piqued if it's a way to restrain competition or if there's consumer deception involved," said Willard K. Tom, deputy director of the Bureau of Competition of the Federal Trade Commission. (In a recently settled case over competition issues, the F.T.C. had contended that a group of farm-equipment dealers in Kentucky and Indiana had withheld advertisements from an industry journal after it published ads by other dealers featuring prices lower than those offered by the group members. The F.T.C. had also contended that the journal later agreed to stop accepting ads that included prices.)
One obvious reason that consumers are often left to guess at prices is that manufacturers and retailers know that general American prosperity has reduced the need for many people to watch how they spend each nickel and dime.
But there is more to it than that, marketing and advertising specialists say. Generally speaking, marketers say they are finding an emphasis on price to be a poor, often self-defeating strategy. It tends to erode consumer perceptions of product quality, and also eventually loses impact even with shoppers whose primary consideration is price. That's because the bargain-hunters wait to buy only during the inevitable sales.
The notion of buying goods at sale prices "becomes an entitlement," said Tom Lawson, managing partner at Arnold Communications, an advertising agency in Boston.
Just as important, others say, is a desire not to unnecessarily intensify competition.
"Marketers aren't pushing prices because they don't want to get into wars," said Audrey Guskey, professor of marketing at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. And manufacturers see little to gain by parading before Wall Street their current inability to raise prices in a minimum-inflation climate.
Asked about his strategy of deferred price disclosure, David Oreck, the chief executive of the vacuum cleaner company, said it was a matter of practicality. "We have several different models and there's just so much you can say in an ad," he said.
Perhaps, the specialists suggested, the Oreck strategy is to concentrate on prospects who are motivated enough to request price information, at the risk of losing some potential customers who assume that Oreck cleaners are priced beyond their means. The products, which Mr. Oreck calls "kind of mid-range," average $300 to $400.
It is clear, though, that the rapid proliferation of Internet technology has complicated marketing strategies. "A whole new source has emerged for price information that wasn't there before," said Joseph Plummer, director of brand strategy at McCann-Erickson Worldwide.
Some sellers, though, avoid electronic commerce "for fear that people would go on the Internet and comparison-shop," perhaps unfairly penalizing goods that should command premium prices, said Frank Torres, a spokesman for Consumers Union.
 YET according to a study by researchers at Pennsylvania State University's Smeal College of Business, consumer sensitivity to price "tends to be lower on line" than in stores, particularly when the sales pitch describes a product's other attributes, like nutritional value of a food product.
In some cases, of course, the lack of a price tag is pure snob appeal, its absence intended to suggest that the product "is for the kind of people who don't have to worry about the price," said Diane Cook-Tench, director of the Adcenter at Virginia Commonwealth University.
Or, as has been said about yachts, if you have to ask what one costs, you can't afford it.

RUSSIA
Floating Like a Butterfly Or Sinking Like a Stone?
The Russian Government moved hastily last week to avert financial collapse with a series of drastic measures, including delaying payments for 90 days on foreign debt owed mostly by banks, a restructuring of Government bonds and the sacrifice of the ruble to market forces. The value of the Russian currency is now free to float as low as 9.5 to the dollar, a risky step -- tantamount to devaluation -- that many people fear could prompt a new round of inflation. It could also wipe out as much as a third of the ruble's purchasing power in an economy heavily dependent on imports. The decision came after a request for $22.6 billion from the West was turned down. Standard & Poor's cut Russia's long-term foreign-currency debt rating by two notches. For this beggar at a McDonald's in Moscow, the collapsing ruble was not of immediate concern.
 
THE MARKET
A Roller-Coaster Ride
The global economic crisis and the aftermath of United States strikes on Afghanistan and the Sudan ravaged Wall Street stocks on Friday. After rising strongly early last week, the Dow fell slightly on Wednesday, more than 80 points on Thursday, and another 77.76 points on Friday, to close the week at 8533.65. Earlier on Friday the Dow had been down more than 200 points. The ups and downs over the week left some traders holding their heads. 

COMPUTERS
An iMac Moment
Shares of Apple Computer climbed to near a three-year high after the company's debut of its iMac personal computer, being scrutinized here by a potential buyer in New York. Apple said it had advance orders for 150,000 of the new computers, which, the company says, will get users onto the Internet very quickly. Dell Computer is also flying high, reporting a 62 percent gain in earnings for its second fiscal quarter, exceeding Wall Street analysts' estimates. Dell also cited market research showing that it had moved into the No. 1 position in the United States in desktop computer sales, and the No. 2 position over all, behind Compaq Computer.
 
JAPAN
Honda's Global Dividend
After years of taking grief from its Japanese rivals for its overseas emphasis, Honda Motor is now benefiting more than ever from that globalization. Even with the domestic market shrinking rapidly, Honda, Japan's No. 3 auto maker behind Toyota and Nissan, reported a 26 percent profit gain for the latest quarter, largely because of sales in Europe and in Honda's largest market, the United States. Other Japanese car makers did not have such a good week. Moody's Investors Service cut its rating of Toyota Motor's long-term debt, citing concern that falling sales in Asia would eat into profits. The downgrading followed an earlier announcement by Moody's that it had lowered the credit ratings of Nissan Motor and Mitsubishi Motors. Still, Toyota's credit rating remains well above those of General Motors, Ford Motor and Volkswagen.
 
THE ECONOMY
This New House
Housing construction jumped last month for the second straight month -- its fastest pace in more than a decade. New housing units were going up at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,718,000 units in July, the heaviest activity since 1987. The Federal Reserve did its part to help that boom by deciding to leave short-term interest rates at 5.5 percent. Given that United States consumer prices rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent in July after a 0.1 percent increase in June, the Fed's action was not unexpected. . . . The trade deficit narrowed slightly, to $14.2 billion in June, but was still not far from the record high as deficits with troubled Asian nations continued to soar. The June deficit was off 8.9 percent from the record $15.5 billion in May, marking the first decline since January.
 
GLOBAL WARMING
It's Melting, It's Melting
Alaska is thawing, and much of northern Russia and Canada with it. And many scientists say the warming of these cold regions is one of the most telling signals that the planet's climate is changing. Experts have long said that in an era of global warming, this bellwether region should warm more and faster than the Earth as a whole, and that is just how things are turning out, to the consternation of walruses and people alike. According to a 1997 study, longer summers have allowed Alaska's tourism industry to grow and should expand shipping in the region, too. But the warmer weather is taking a heavy toll on forests, and by extension, eventually the forestry industry. The warming has promoted a buildup of tree-eating insects in general and has prompted some species, like the spruce budworm, to move farther north. Across southern Alaska, some of the forest is more than sick; it is dead or dying, and spruce bark beetles are the killers. Scientists estimate that a third to half of Alaska's white spruce have died the last 15 years.
 
JOBS
Downsizing With Less Gusto
The country's most comprehensive survey of permanent layoffs found that in the last three years, downsizing affected a smaller percentage of the work force than in any other period this decade. But the layoff rate is still significantly higher than in the 1980's, and women now get pink slips almost as often as men. Eight million people were pushed out of their jobs involuntarily in the 1995-97 period, the Labor Department said in its report, or one out of every 15 adult job holders. That was down from 8.4 million in the previous three years, or one in 12 workers, the decade's worst performance. But downsizing is still occurring at a faster rate than in the late 1980's. Then the displacement rate was one out of every 18 job holders. (Article, page 11.)
 
SEMICONDUCTORS
The Chips Are Down
Two computer chip makers said they expected sharply lower quarterly results because of Asia's economic crisis, and a third said its quarterly net earnings fell 81 percent. The warnings from LSI Logic and National Semiconductor, coupled with the results from Analog Devices, suggested that any talk of a recovery in the chip manufacturing industry might be premature. Chip companies are finding that they are much more vulnerable to Asia's problems than they had thought. "When something like Asia happens, it doesn't really matter how good your products are or how well managed your company is, you're going to feel it," said Drew Peck, an analyst at SG Cowen & Company.
 
SWEDEN
Business@ArcticCircle.com
A mouse pad made of reindeer hide? Well, maybe that's a bad example of a high-technology business with a big future. But Sweden has a few other ideas up its reindeer coat-covered sleeve, including extreme telecommuting. In an effort to slow the flight of people from what is already one of the world's most sparsely settled areas, the Government is encouraging businesses to set up computerized telephone-call centers in remote Arctic Circle villages -- such as Arvidsjaur, where Sara Andersson, above, is director of trade -- and to staff them with young people who otherwise would be scouting for work in the population centers to the south, or abroad. The companies benefit from special Government subsidies, and they find that outlying parts of Sweden have a supply of educated, keyboard-literate young people with the Swedes' noted ability to function comfortably in several languages. Swedes and telephones have a cozy relationship: The country has the highest number of lines per person in the world -- 70 for every 100 inhabitants -- and 44 percent of Swedes have mobile phones.

HEADLINE: Struggling To Bring Back The Glitter;
Today, the Diamond District Is More Crass Than Class. Can It Survive? Solomon Gad's Offspring May Hold a Clue.

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
THE Orthodox Jewish men in the broad-brimmed black hats stopped talking business long enough to turn their heads and stare. It wasn't that the sight of women in the Diamond Dealers Club was such an oddity, but five women walking through together was somewhat unusual, particularly one in such a short skirt with such long legs.
That was Nicole Hendelman, 26, who had come to the club to have lunch with her mother and three aunts in the kosher restaurant, where white cloths cover cafeteria-style tables, and meat and milk cannot be served together. Nicole's grandfather, Solomon Gad, the 74-year-old family patriarch, was treating. 
 That it was Ms. Hendelman's first time in the club was surprising, given that her entire family is in the diamond industry, that she has been designing jewelry since she graduated from Syracuse University and that many young people starting out in the business use the club's trading floor to make contacts, a kind of temporary office as they become more established.
While much of New York's diamond industry remains a closed, male-dominated network concentrated on a single block -- 47th Street between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas -- Ms. Hendelman seems very much at home there and confident about her prospects. "You need a big mouth," she said. "And I definitely have one."
Perhaps aggressiveness, and the optimism that comes with youth, are essential. But the city's diamond industry, which handles more than 90 percent of the diamonds that come into this country, has also changed over the last 20 years, opening up to a younger generation, a wide variety of ethnic groups -- Indians, Russians, Koreans -- as well as to more women.
The city has also made a concerted effort to address the tarnished reputation of the diamond district, long thought of as a teeming, disreputable bazaar where wide-eyed suitors in the market for engagement rings are easy marks for high-pressure hucksters.
Last year, Mayor Giuliani designated the area a business improvement district, allowing it to assess some 2,600 business owners nominal dues -- landlords pay 25 cents per square foot -- for uniformed security officers on foot patrol from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. every day but Sunday, street cleaning and new lights. These capital improvements began just last week with the repair and expansion of the curbing and the pouring of glittering concrete.
The work is due to conclude by Christmas, with the installation of diamond-shaped illuminated pylons that will be suspended at the corners of the district to create two twinkling gateways. "It will enhance the look of the street," said Terrence Clark, the executive director of the BID, "and be fitting of what the diamond district stands for, which is glamour and sparkle."
People who work in the district say security has already increased. "It's a kinder, gentler place," said Eli Hass, who runs a diamond-cutting import-export business, E.N.H. International. "The security has improved so markedly in the last five, seven years."
Mr. Hass was recently re-elected to a second two-year term as president of the Diamond Dealers Club, which offers its 1,800 members a 35,000-square-foot trading floor at 580 Fifth Avenue in which to meet one another and to buy and sell gemstones.
Those in the diamond industry say these improvements, coupled with a strong economy, have made their field increasingly attractive to young people who once might have rejected it as cloistered, unscrupulous or both. Mr. Hass said he hoped to attract more young people with an apprentice scholarship training program, which he is starting in the next month or so, to teach diamond cutting to those who want to go into the business but don't have family connections.
"The industry has opened up in many, many ways," said Mr. Hass, who was recently elected vice president of the World Federation of Diamond Bourses, an international association of diamond organizations. "It was a very mysterious type of industry, and the only ones who came into the industry were people who had family in the business. These days, all kinds of people come in."
Ms. Hendelman is someone who has benefited from the industry's new openness to women and young people, as well as from a family that is well known throughout the industry. Many of her relatives in the business are women, who have tried to protect her from some of the struggles they went through and helped pave the way. Of the seven children born to her grandfather, Mr. Gad, a longtime diamond dealer, six are women, all of whom have worked or are working in the district.
They are not the street-level retailers many shoppers associate with the district, the ones who preside over counters full of pricey stones while outside neon signs blink "Buy and Sell." They are the people behind the scenes, wholesalers in office towers several floors above the stores who buy, sell and cut diamonds, and design and manufacture diamond and other jewelry.
Nicole Hendelman and her mother, Ruth, work on the 24th floor of 580 Fifth Avenue, known as the Diamond Building. The Diamond Dealers Club is on the 11th floor. Mr. Gad works down the hall from it.
Osnat Gad, 51, the eldest child, works a few floors down, running her own business importing colored stones and manufacturing wedding bands. A sister, Zipora Eisenberg, 50, works one block up with her husband, Larry, who specializes in emeralds. Her twin sisters, 45, both work for their brother, Isaac Gad, 33, in a building across the street: Ahuva Nazarian as an office manager, and Dalia Gad, in sales. The youngest sister, Liza Rosenthal, 36, used to work for her father but is now home on Long Island raising her three children.
"Most of what we call the wholesale diamond trade is vertical in the sense that it's upstairs," Mr. Hass said.
 
Strides, Yes, but the Path Has Not Been Smooth
Ruth Hendelman, 48, a compact woman with an expansive warmth and wide smile, has been designing and selling diamond rings for 24 years. "I grew up with emeralds," she said. "I used to wear rings on every finger."
She shares her 22-by-10-foot office with Nicole, who said her mother has been invaluable in helping her with designs and pricing as well as vouching for her with new clients: a necessary blessing for those getting started in the business.
Despite the strides they have made, these women say their paths have not been smooth. They insist that the diamond business is still a male-dominated industry in which men do not trust women as much as they do each other. At the most conservative end of the spectrum, Hasidic men -- who are still a major force in the business -- are prevented by Jewish law from even shaking a woman's hand.
"In this industry, women are second class," Ruth said.
Although Osnat has up until now employed only women in her company, which buys and sells colored stones, she said she had recently hired a man to make things easier with suppliers and customers. "Men want to hear men," she said. "They talk to him, they call him back, they have much more respect for him."
A soft-spoken, elegant, worldly woman, Osnat said she had a difficult time when she began her career 18 years ago, especially when she traveled to foreign countries to buy gems: Sri Lanka for sapphires, Thailand for rubies, Colombia for emeralds.
"Women are second-class citizens," she said, echoing her sister. "Men don't understand a woman separating from her family in the sense of making her own money."
Clients kept her waiting, she recalled. They made her alter her demeanor, forcing her to appear far more retiring than she was. "I would have to create myself in their image," she said. "I couldn't show my strength. I would have to always manipulate them to get what I wanted."
And, some of the Gad sisters say, they did not feel their father was behind them. He traveled throughout his career and only recently has become a stronger presence in their lives. "Did he encourage me?" Ruth said. "No. Did he help me? No."
Osnat added: "My dad, I would say, only after 15 years has given me a lot of respect. He has not told me in words, but I think he has shown me.
"He always says he wishes he had six boys," she went on. "That used to hurt me."
All of Solomon Gad's daughters say their father made it desperately, demonstratively clear how much he had wanted a son. "It was a big disappointment for my father," Zipora said. "We grew up wanting it because that's all that was discussed and we were part of it, wanting it. We didn't know any different. Since I was a little kid, we knew we needed a son to carry his name."
So Mr. Gad and his wife, Shoshana, kept having children until, finally, Isaac was born 33 years ago. "I cannot explain to you in words the day my brother was born, what a joy it was for my father," Zipora recalled.
But Isaac Gad, 33, says that although he was the long-awaited son, he did not have it much easier than his sisters. As a young boy, he spent summers working for his dad, sorting diamonds, doing paper work, accompanying his father on buying and selling trips. "He was definitely grooming me," Isaac said. "I was pressured extensively to go into business with my father."
Instead, Mr. Gad went to law school at New York University. "It was never my intention to go into the business," he said. "I felt it was too Old World, backward. I wanted to be a lawyer."
Then, he said, he disappointed his father yet again by dropping out of law school. He did go to work for his father at that time, but said he had lasted only about a month. "He's just a very tough, tough individual," he said. "Things had to be done his way or no way."
Isaac Gad, an easygoing talker who wears loafers without socks, said his relationship with his father has improved over time, especially since he has now made something of himself in the business.
In 1990, he began working as a loose-diamond distributor for his mother's brother, David Vardi. Today, he specializes in manufacturing mass-market "bridal wraps," rings that fit over solitaire diamonds and that sell for an average of $399. (At first, he called his company Vardi & Gad Corp., but later changed it to Paul Winston because, he said, it sounded more American and summoned up images of the prestigious jeweler, Harry Winston.)
Now he has 23 people working for him in New York, 8 salespeople on the road and 200 in his factory in the Dominican Republic. He said his business registered $5 million in gross sales in 1997, up from $850,000 in 1992.
And his father? "I speak to him once a day," Isaac said. "I use him as one of my key advisers in dealing with the bank, customers, vendors."
 
Neither Age Nor Illness Stops the Family Patriarch
Solomon Gad still commutes to work on the subway four days a week in his black yarmulke and white cardigan, even though he has been ill since he suffered a ruptured esophagus and lost about 100 pounds. He said he had planned to retire seven years ago but decided to keep reporting to work until his body stopped him. "I like to come," he said. "I like to go."
Mr. Gad was born in Afghanistan in 1924. At age 19, he said, he was already a successful rug trader when he met his wife, Shoshana Vardi, then 16. The Gads moved from Peshawar, Pakistan, to Bombay to Israel and finally settled in a six-bedroom English Tudor house in Forest Hills, Queens, in 1962.
In the 1950's, Mr. Gad started selling emeralds with one of his eight brothers, a partnership, he says, that ended amicably in 1972. His children say it wasn't so amicable. "The division of the merchandise was a big conflict," Zipora recalled. "The more money they made, the more greedy they became."
Although he already has 12 grandchildren, Mr. Gad told his daughters over his plate of salmon at the Diamond Dealers Club -- after scolding them for ordering only salads -- that he would give each of them a mink coat for every new grandchild.
Nicole said she has to get married first before she thinks about children. Her wedding to Brian Dersovitz, a college sweetheart, is scheduled for next Sunday at the Pierre Hotel. She plans to come down the aisle to "Sunrise, Sunset," wearing a silk organza gown and a three-carat diamond engagement ring that was designed by her mother.
Mr. Gad's children describe the family as generally close, although Osnat does say that father chides her for not keeping in touch. "He calls me and tells me I never call him," she said. "You get busy during the day, and he's not as busy as he used to be." Ruth said she spoke to her father and mother every day, to Osnat every day, to Ahuva every other day. They spend holidays together, eating their mother's Persian rice pilaf and other Middle Eastern specialties.
While family members are sometimes competitive when it comes to business, they also like to keep it in the family. Ruth and Isaac buy their colored stones from Osnat. Isaac buys some diamonds from his uncle, Mordechai Vardi, in Israel. "I have at least 15 cousins who are all within the industry," Isaac said.
Much of what his children now recount Solomon Gad remembers differently. He fondly recalls how, during several summers when his wife visited family members in Israel with Isaac and Liza, he took the five older girls on car trips. They sang Hebrew songs on the road and one time had to leave a restaurant without eating because the waiter kept bringing shellfish, which is not kosher.
He says that he has always encouraged his daughters in their careers and that he was not profoundly disappointed when Isaac or any of his other children ultimately chose to go into business for themselves, rather than with him. "At the beginning, it was hard for me, but now I understand," he said. "They are good. They are succeeding."
 
A World of Handshakes And Old-Fashioned Trust
While the people in the diamond industry have changed significantly in recent years, Solomon Gad says, the terms of deal-making remain the same. It is a business that relies on trust -- a handshake, somebody's word.
This kind of old-fashioned negotiation is on full display amid the buzz at the Diamond Dealers Club. Members huddle under long-necked table lamps and in various corners to work out their trades, unwrapping diamonds from their pockets or bargaining over prices. There is a synagogue on the premises, racks of Jewish newspapers, clocks that show the time in Ramat Gan, Israel, New York and Antwerp, Belgium, a major diamond center.
Mr. Gad said there was a time in his early days when it was essential for him to start the day at the club. He would arrive at 8:30 most mornings to find a table with good natural light. Now it is merely a place he drops in on occasionally to keep in touch with old associates.
Aside from providing a trading floor, the club does not get involved in members' businesses, Mr. Hass, the president, said. Should problems arise over the terms of an agreement between dealers, the club has a dispute resolution system, but Mr. Hass said such cases were rare -- perhaps 120 a year, most of which were settled amicably.
He emphasized how much the club's makeup had changed over the last decade. Ten percent of its members, for example, are Indians, up from about 2 percent 10 years ago. "Today, it's as open an admission policy as you can possibly imagine," he said.
Although women have been eligible for admission since the club was founded in 1931, Mr. Hass said, they did not begin to join until the 1960's. Even today, he said, there are only about 100 women among the 1,800 members. While Mr. Hass described this as progress, women in the Gad family seem to feel differently.
"Why should I go there?" Ruth Hendelman said. "Did you see how everybody was looking at us? Do you need people staring at you? I'm there to do business. They just see women. It's a man's club."
The difficulties they encountered when they started out in business are one reason that Osnat and Ruth have sought to give a leg up to Nicole, a high-energy, upbeat woman who majored in metalsmithing at Syracuse. After Nicole worked for Fabrikant & Sons, the jewelry manufacturer, Osnat hired her niece part time, and eventually Ruth invited her daughter to share her office space.
"She always worked with her hands, which I cannot do," said Ruth, who keeps a record of every magazine mention of her daughter's work. "I don't have that talent."
Nicole Hendelman uses her tiny, shared office for attending to the sales side of her growing business and her Upper West Side apartment to create her own line of jewelry, Nicole Hendelman Ltd. Her first customers were her friends. Now Henri Bendel and Nordstrom have carried her handmade necklaces and earring in 14-carat gold and sterling silver with semiprecious stones like smoky topaz, citron, amethysts, black onyx and pink tourmaline. Her pieces, which sell for $120 to $195, have been featured in magazines like Glamour and Accent.
She said she got ideas for her designs by looking at people on the street and flipping through magazines. "I have it all in my head," she said. "I don't put it on paper." But she would never wear her designs on 47th Street. "Everybody copies," she said. "Everybody tries to make it cheaper."
As for her relationship with her grandfather, Ms. Hendelman says it has been nothing but mutual affection.
"He brings me fruit every day," she said. "He's so caring with his grandchildren. He absolutely adores each and every one of us."
While Mr. Gad still clings to the memory of his once-bustling daily routine, he seems at peace with his slower pace. In large part, this appears to be because his children -- and at least one grandchild -- are carrying on in his business. Indeed, despite the ways in which their father may have failed them, Solomon Gad's children seem grateful for all that he has taught them, proud of their history and excited to be in an industry that has long been such a part of their lives.
"I think in the end, all parents just want their kids to grow up and be happy," Isaac said. "He sees that I've already done that. He's content. He's done his job."
 
Ring Maven and Amateur Psychiatrist
 
LIKE all of those who deal in diamonds, Ruth Hendelman spends her days evaluating the icy, sparkling stones based on cut, color and quality, deciding which to use in the rings she makes to order. The better the color and quality, the higher the price. "I think color is very important," she said. "All the young people are looking for color."
Color grades are denoted by letter, she explained: D through F mean colorless, G and H near colorless, K through M faint yellow, N through R very light yellow and S through Z light yellow. Most stones that she sells, Mrs. Hendelman says, range from D through F. "You train your eye," she said.
She hunches over the diamonds, spread, small and sparkling, on her desk, searching for imperfections with her 10-power magnifying glass. If she sees nothing, the stone is perfect, but that is rare. Often there is a featherlike line or a slight tint.
Flaw rankings descend from flawless to VVS1 (very, very small imperfection), VVS2, VS1, VS2, SI2 (slightly imperfect) and SI-1. Most diamonds Mrs. Hendelman sells range from VVS-2 to SI-1, she said, and the authenticity of almost all have been certified by the Gemological Institute of America.
After a client chooses a diamond and decides whether he wants stones on the side, like baguettes, Mrs. Hendelman fashions the ring in wax for final approval. Then the ring is cast in platinum, 18-carat or 14-carat gold, depending on the client's choice, the diamond is set and the ring is polished.
Mrs. Hendelman says she comes up with her prices -- from $5,000 to $40,000, depending on the size of the diamond -- by consulting the Rapaport Diamond Report, a weekly newsletter published by the Rapaport Corporation, which details the prices of diamonds in the wholesale marketplace. Mrs. Hendelman says she usually offers a discount -- she declined to say how much -- to try to insure that customers return. "I make less money so they will come to me for other things," like wedding bands, pearls or diamond stud earrings.
But, unlike the practice on the street, there is no haggling. "My price is a final price," Mrs. Hendelman said.
Business is good these days, she said. Classic styles are in: antique settings, white diamonds, platinum and pearls. "People, this year, you cannot imagine what they were spending," she said. "They were spending like $10,000 to $40,000 on gifts for their wives."
Laughing, she admits to a personal sales technique. "I don't usually let people out of the office" without making a purchase, she said. "I talk nonstop."
And she functions as an amateur psychiatrist to the prospective grooms who are buzzed inside. "There are a lot of problems when they get engaged," she said. "He will be sweating -- dripping literally. His underarm is completely wet -- it doesn't matter what age -- and his hand is shaking, he cannot hold the tweezers, and they're very cute and I try to make them more comfortable."
Mrs. Hendelman said that like one young customer who popped the question on the Yankee Stadium scoreboard, at least half the men who buy her rings call her after they have proposed to tell her how it went. "Some of the stories," she said, "are wonderful." ROBIN POGREBIN

Gold: A Hedge That's Worth Its Weight in History

BYLINE: By ERIC HUBLER 

 BODY:
A BIT over four years ago, an aging German Jew who has seen a lot of trouble gave his niece a wedding gift of three gold coins, along with this admonition: "May you never have to use them."
Let's hope not. Those coins, slumbering in a bank vault, have declined 26 percent in dollar terms. Blue-chip stocks, meanwhile, and, some real estate have more than doubled. 
 What kind of hedge is that -- a hedge against getting rich? Is gold, the traditional talisman against everything from tyrants to inflation to stock market plunges, losing out?
No, says Douglas M. Cohen, an analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter -- but you could be forgiven for thinking so. "History is full of episodes where people have said gold is dead, and sure enough, it's tended to rally back very strongly," he said. "Gold has thousands of years of history on its side."
What's scary now is that, at about $289 an ounce, gold is not far from its production cost of $250 to $260 an ounce, though it is up from January's 18-year low of $278.
Indeed, gold has quite a roll call of negatives. Start with currencies: Because gold is denominated in American dollars, which are currently strong, it is less affordable than it once was in traditionally gold-hungry markets like India. But even with demand down, production has been rising in Australia, Canada and South Africa, and there are fears of more gold coming to market, perhaps from the Russian central bank or the International Monetary Fund seeking to raise cash during Russia's fiscal crisis.
What is bad for gold has been even worse for gold shares. Gold has fallen less than 2 percent in 1998, but Morningstar Inc., the Chicago mutual fund publisher, says the average precious-metals fund fell 21.8 percent this year through last Monday and 43.5 percent in the last year. But Harry Bingham, who manages two gold funds for Van Eck, says gold is as important as ever. "Gold is the only money," he said. "You might say silver is money, but that's only pocket change. And everything else we call money is really a credit instrument."
After the 1929 market crash, when stocks declined 90 percent, gold rose 70 percent, and the shares of gold producers like Homestake Mining catapulted 700 to 800 percent. Talk about a diversifier: "Ten percent in that would have salvaged the whole portfolio," Mr. Bingham said.
"We're seeing some paper money just evaporate" today, he said, citing the Indonesian rupiah and the South Korean won. "So I think we're probably fairly close to a turning point in the perception of the value of gold versus paper money."
Daniel B. Leonard, manager of the Invesco Strategic Gold Portfolio fund, said: "If you were in the yen and bought gold a couple of years ago, you're looking pretty good now." The same goes, he says, for people who have to put food on the table with rubles or yuan or Canadian dollars.
In the United States, gold investors typically buy shares in either gold mutual funds or mining companies, rather than the metal itself. Bill Martin, manager of the American Century Global Gold fund, favors Barrick Resources, which has reduced costs to $150 an ounce at a new mine in Peru and has sold its production forward for $400 an ounce for three years.
Leo Larkin, a metals analyst at Standard & Poor's, mentions Newmont Mining, Placer Dome and Barrick as low-cost producers.
The woman with the wise uncle, meanwhile, reports that those three nuptial coins are staying right where they are.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT: FOCUS ON BONDS;
Yields on Municipal Bonds Make a Haven Look Better Than Ever

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON 

 BODY:
MUNICIPAL bonds, often a haven from a turbulent stock market, are more attractive than they have been for years because of a narrower gap between their yields and those of Treasury securities.
High-quality, long-term municipal bonds, which usually yield nearly 20 percent less than Treasury bonds, are now yielding only 10 percent less. That may not sound very appealing, but after taxes, that narrowing can become a big positive. Here's why: While interest from Treasuries is subject to Federal income taxes, most muni interest is generally tax-exempt. 
 That means that investors in the top Federal tax bracket of 39.6 percent would need a return of more than 8 percent on a taxable investment to have the same after-tax return that they could get on a municipal bond yielding 5 percent, and the 30-year Treasury bond is now yielding only 5.43 percent.
"Municipal bonds are not a very exciting investment," said Joe Mysak, editor of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer, a newsletter published in New York. But considering the uncertainties of the stock market, he added, "maybe you want something where you know you're going to get your money back."
The spread between yields on Treasury bonds and municipal bonds is as narrow as it has been since Steve Forbes undercut the market with a call for a flat income taxduring his Presidential campaign in 1996. A flat tax would have negated the chief appeal of municipal bonds, their tax-free coupons.
Before that, the tightest spreads were seen a decade earlier, when investors anticipated the tax cut that ultimately came when the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was passed.
The prices of municipal bonds, which move in the opposite direction from their yields, have become so attractive to some professional investors lately that even hedge funds have been buying munis, although such funds do not pay taxes and, therefore, enjoy no benefit from the bonds' tax status.
"When the municipal market gets to levels we're seeing at this stage of the game, you start to get crossover buyers, and we've seen that over the last 30 days," said Peter Allegrini, who runs the municipal bond group at Prudential Investments in Newark. Such buyers, including insurance companies and arbitragers, are seeking capital gains when the bonds return to their normal relationship to Treasuries. "The relationship will get back in sync again," he said.
 SPREADS are tight because demand for municipal bonds is very light while the supply is surging. Ever since interest rates spiked in 1994, domestic investors have taken a dim view of bonds, sending fixed-income securities into their steepest price decline in at least 70 years. Foreign investors, a mainstay of the market for Treasury bonds, shun municipal bonds because the tax exemption is worthless to them.
But the supply of munis is growing, because governments and agencies are investing heavily again in infrastructure projects -- and issuing bonds to pay for them -- even as they refinance other bonds that yield 6 percent and more with new debt priced closer to 5 percent.
"I think municipals are an extreme opportunity here," said Reid Smith, manager of the Vanguard Municipal High Yield Portfolio and Vanguard Municipal Insured Long Term Portfolio, pointing to yields as high as 5.05 percent for a high-quality, 30-year issue. For someone in the top Federal tax bracket, the taxable equivalent would be 8.36 percent.
"That is very handsome," Mr. Smith said, bigger than the yields on many junk bonds but with much less risk.
He noted that bond refinancings in the first half of this year totaled $42 billion, or more than twice as much as in the first half of 1997. Issuance of all municipal bonds was up 50 percent, to $146 billion. Considering that more munis are often issued in the second half of a year, the total for 1998 could exceed the $293 billion in the record year of 1993.
"We're on a pace to exceed $300 billion in new issues," said Tom Metzold, manager of several tax-free Eaton Vance funds.
And investors have started to warm to munis, Mr. Metzold said. Nearly $1 million a day is coming into his national and high-yield municipal bond funds; this time last year, that much was flowing out. "It appears the more proactive investor is beginning to realize there is tremendous value in the municipal bond market," he said.
Usually, bonds with the longest maturities and lowest credit quality pay significantly higher yields than shorter, high-quality debt. But the spreads are much narrower than usual in today's tax-free market.
Mr. Smith said the riskiest investment-grade municipal bonds -- hospital bonds rated BBB -- yielded 90 to 95 basis points more than high-quality bonds two years ago, but now pay just 40 to 45 basis points more. (A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.) Bonds rated BB, the highest junk rating, have seen their usual 175-point premium reduced to 90 points. Meanwhile, 20-year and 30-year municipal bonds are yielding only about 50 basis points more than those with a duration, or effective maturity, of 10 years.
"You're absolutely not being paid for low quality" or long-duration bonds, Mr. Smith said. He said the best buys were high-quality, intermediate-term tax-free bonds.
Unless an investor is wealthy, buying mutual fund shares may be the best way to hold municipal bonds, Mr. Mysak said.
"The price of admission to the tax-free market is inordinately high, compared to the stock market," he said. The usual minimum is $5,000 to $10,000 a bond, and to diversify you need at least a half-dozen of them. "This is why so few people enjoy tax-free income," he said.
But there is an important caveat for anyone investing in credit markets through funds instead of direct ownership: bond owners who keep their securities until maturity do not lose principal; fund shareholders do not have this protection. If a fund sells securities at a gain, it will have to pass on a capital gain to shareholders, and if it sells at a loss, it passes on the loss. This surprises some shareholders who think of their fund as tax exempt, but the exemption applies only to the yields. Of course, the advantages of diversification and security selection in a fund may well outweigh this disadvantage.
 INDEED, the overall risks of investing in bonds are not trivial, even if they are less than those of the equity market. Bond values will sag if interest rates rise, and, in less turbulent times than investors are facing today, returns can be expected to lag behind those of stocks. Gerard Breitner, president of Excomp Asset Management in Manhattan, noted: "Historically, over the long haul, equities do much better than tax-free bonds."

Books Did It for Amazon, but What's Next?

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
MANY an eye, on Wall Street and Main Street alike, is trained on the Internet, seeking signs that its much-hyped promise as a channel of retail commerce is beginning to be realized.
The big breakthrough so far, the bookseller Amazon.com, demonstrated that ordinary products not composed of chips and bits can be successfully retailed over the Internet. And, perhaps more important, it showed that investors see no need to wait for consistent operating profits before betting heavily on a company that may have found the key. 
 So the old question of whether Internet retailing can work is giving way to a new question: In which retail categories will the next Amazons emerge?
Forecasters say the stakes are high. Forrester Research, a market research firm in Cambridge, Mass., expects the on-line retail market to mushroom from $4.8 billion in sales in 1998 to more than $17 billion in 2001.
But Forrester expects 86 percent of that trade to be in just five categories, all of them already established on line: Computers, software, entertainment, books and travel.
"Those industries that are most susceptible to on-line retailing are already obvious," explained David Alschuler, an electronic-commerce analyst at Aberdeen Group, a consulting firm in Boston. The best candidates are those where consumers do a lot of research before buying and want information that traditional sales channels have a difficult time supplying, he said.
Still, Internet experts have already spotted opportunities for a new round of on-line retailers.
One company that may have its toe on the escalator is Etoys, a year-old on-line toy retailer still in the venture-capital stage. It sells about 3,000 products, according to Kate Delhagen, director of on-line retail strategies at Forrester.
"Etoys has built up a good, customer-friendly front end of the business," Ms. Delhagen said. "And they've done a good job matching inventory to logistics."
Another category that analysts are calling ripe for Internet retailing is consumer electronics.
Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies Inc., a consulting firm in Campbell, Calif., sees Amazon's recent deal to acquire the Junglee Corporation as giving it an important leg up in the field. For comparison-shopping on the World Wide Web, Junglee offers consumers a powerful search engine, one of the few ways to research consumer electronics prices.
The demographics certainly seem right. Consumer electronics shoppers tend to be men with relatively high incomes -- among the people most likely to use the Internet.
But traditional electronics retailers like Circuit City and Best Buy have so far been slow to step into cyberspace. And Nicole Vanderbilt, director of digital commerce at Jupiter Communications, an Internet consulting company in New York, said start-ups have a difficult time breaking in because they lack the buying power of larger retailers and must deal with a raft of distributors.
So despite the large volume of computer products now sold on line, "no one yet has come forward and positioned themselves as a category killer" in other consumer electronics, Ms. Vanderbilt said.
Some electronics retailers are moving ahead. In mid-June, Tops Appliance City linked up with Cybershop International, a publicly traded on-line retailer of luxury merchandise like Coach bags and Mikasa tableware, to develop a new Web site.
Mr. Bajarin saw rich opportunities for retailers of cameras. "There's an amazing amount of comparison-shopping among photography shoppers," he said, yet Web sites are often so primitive that consumers must phone for prices.
Discount buying clubs are another area that analysts say can do well on the Internet. The leader so far is Net Market, a Cendant subsidiary. But a competitor, Value America, has attracted attention with heavy advertising; in July it filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to go public.
Industry experts also see apparel as gaining momentum on line, despite clothing manufacturers' traditional slowness to adopt new technology. Ms. Vanderbilt said one company with an early, interesting niche is Pivot Rules Inc., formerly a maker of golf clothing. In May it switched gears and began developing a Web site called Bluefly, offering designer apparel at deep discounts.
The company's chief executive, Kem Seiff, said the off-price apparel business frustrated many consumers with hit-or-miss excursions to stores full of chaotic clothing racks. And catalogue companies struggle with the unpredictable availability of off-price apparel.
 ANALYSTS are divided over the prospects for selling mundane items like groceries over the Internet, offering widely divergent revenue forecasts.
"We think it will grow into billions of dollars eventually, but not soon," said Ms. Delhagen of Forrester. "And that's because there's a very powerful dynamic at work. Even though we say we hate grocery shopping, it's still very easy to do" and typically does not require a lot of research, she said.
Analysts say Peapod Inc., a publicly traded pioneer in on-line grocery sales, may expand nationwide only gradually because so many of its wares are perishable. By contrast, Net Grocer Inc. concentrates on longer shelf-life products and is expected to gain momentum.
In mid-July, America Online agreed to make Net Grocer the exclusive supermarket delivery service for its customers in exchange for a $15 million fee over the next three years, a share in ad and transaction revenues and warrants to buy Net Grocer stock. Net Grocer has also filed plans to go public.
It's a short leap from groceries to drugstore sundries, and, so far, the best-capitalized on-line entry seems to be Drugstore.Com, a privately held company founded by a former Microsoft executive, Peter Neupert.
Ms. Vanderbilt of Jupiter thinks on-line sales make sense for basic supplies that consumers often need to restock, like toilet paper and soap. But drugstores' best profits are from goods that are hard or impossible to sell on line: prescription drugs and impulse purchases like cosmetics.
Wal-Mart and Net Grocer already offer some drugstore items on line, Ms. Vanderbilt said, but the selection is limited, and, in Wal-Mart's case, not heavily promoted. "We think there's an opportunity here for a category killer like Amazon," she said.

HEADLINE: The World;
To Save the Ruble, Russia Dances With the Wolves

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
NOT so long ago, armchair diplomats took comfort in their mastery of heady terms like throw-weight and detente, and tested their mettle parsing the differences between SALT talks and START talks.
But the end of the cold war and the swift, furious opening of financial markets in far-flung locales like Malaysia, Brazil and the Czech Republic have changed all that. Now anyone interested in world affairs has to contend with a new vocabulary.
As Russia's woes of the past week have illustrated, the new buzzwords of international diplomacy are devaluation, currency speculation and debt moratorium -- terminology just as opaque and loaded with free-floating dread as anything in the cold war lexicon.
By week's end, not only were Russian lawmakers calling for the resignation of President Boris N. Yeltsin, but the world's financial markets were being pummeled, largely because of fears set in motion by the decision of Mr. Yeltsin's Government to devalue the ruble.
A devaluation typically occurs when a country suffering through an economic downturn decides it's time to lower the value of its currency in relation to another -- usually the dollar -- to give its exporters more muscle in international trade. A country's exports suddenly become cheaper overseas and, ideally, local cash registers start ringing.
Early last week, Russia decided to do just that, announcing that it would let the value of its currency fall as low as 9.5 rubles to the dollar from 6.5 rubles, effectively devaluing its currency by 34 percent.
Yet Russia is not likely to get much of a boost from the devaluation because the price of its most important export, oil, has already plunged this year, as have prices for other basic commodities the country exports. If Russia exported cars, CD players or personal computers, devaluation might have helped undercut the prices of other international competitors. But, as any shopper knows, Russia makes nothing that competes with brand names like Toyota, Sony and Compaq.
 
No Choice
The flip side of devaluation is that it makes imports more expensive. Since Russia imports quite a bit of food and other staples, the average Russian is going to find it even harder to make ends meet. And Russian financial institutions that owe dollar-denominated loans are discovering that the cost of paying off their debts will rise in direct proportion to the drop in the ruble's value.
Bad news all around. So, why did Russia devalue?
"They had no choice," said Nancy Kimelman, chief economist for Thomson Financial Services in Boston. "You have everyone and their mother trading against the ruble and if you don't want it to fall below a certain level the Government has to go in there and defend it. And the Government didn't have the cash to do that because Russia is basically bankrupt."
What Russia has learned, as have several Asian countries that are now economic basket cases, is that inviting market forces into your economy also invites the wolves. Traders who make their living betting on the direction of currency prices smell blood when a strong currency masks a weak economy. Russia, which had already squandered International Monetary Fund aid bolstering the ruble, opted out of the blood bath.
"The Russians know that if they defend the currency's value it's just going into the pocket of some currency trader," Ms. Kimelman said.
 
Wiggle Room
Russia also declared a debt moratorium last week, which amounts to a 90-day breather on the repayment of $40 billion in foreign loans and perhaps as much as $100 billion in "hedges" -- insurance that traders and banks use to protect themselves from sudden currency swings.
Moratoriums typically give battered economies some wiggle room by allowing lenders and borrowers to renegotiate loans. But the tactic, which has had mixed results in countries like South Korea and Indonesia over the last several months, does nothing to address underlying economic problems.
Nonetheless, Russia's moratorium was lauded by some analysts. "I wouldn't have advised them to devalue," said Morris Goldstein, a former I.M.F. official and a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "I think it would have been smarter to restructure the debt first."
But everyone has to be treated fairly for such a restructuring to work, and foreign investors, who have grown used to reaping fat profits in Russia, went into a tizzy last week when they learned that some of the debt would be repriced more favorably for domestic investors than for foreign investors, according to Credit Suisse First Boston. Foreign investors, threatening never to open their wallets in Russia again, quickly slapped down that proposal.
Private jets are now ferrying foreign lenders into Russia to repackage the debt in a way that all sides can agree on, and a new proposal is expected by tomorrow. But while the debt restructuring may calm Russian markets, the devaluation genie that has been let out of the bottle may produce even more turmoil in the economy.
Paradoxically, Russia carried more weight on the international stage in the old world of detente than in the new world of devaluation. It still sits atop a formidable nuclear stockpile, but for all its military might the nation of 147 million people currently lacks the economic heft of the temporarily declawed Asian tigers. And in a world where vast sums of money zip across borders with a few taps on a computer keyboard, the ruble is just a blip on traders' screens.
"It's unfortunate," Ms. Kimelman said. "If Russia had the wealth to support its geopolitical might it would be a different story. But they don't."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
The Bull Market Is Alive (In Bonds)

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
For all the Sturm und Drang endured by stock market investors in recent months, equities have remained the favored vehicle. In the race for returns, however, bonds are the hands-down winners. In the last 12 months, a 30-year Treasury bond has produced a total return of 15.4 percent; the Dow industrials are up 9.98 percent.
Prices of United States Treasuries rocketed last week as investors fled troubled overseas markets for them -- the most stable securities in the world. On Friday heavy buying pushed the yield on the 30-year bond down 1.4 percent, to 5.43 percent. 
 Given the recent move up in bond prices, many investors wonder whether it's time to sell and lock in their gains. After all, no less an investment guru than Warren E. Buffett recently dumped his holdings in zero-coupon bonds, a position he had amassed last year.
Although bonds may retrace some of their steps when world markets settle down, their long-term prospects remain excellent, said Charles I. Clough Jr., chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch. Mr. Clough has been a bond bull since 1996 -- one year too early, he acknowledges. But now, the scenario that he mapped out two years ago, when he suggested that investors put more of their money in bonds than stocks, seems to be unfolding.
"Bonds will outperform stocks this year and also in 1999," Mr. Clough said. "That may be because stocks provide very little return. Our anticipation is that they trade sideways."
Why will stocks be lackluster as bonds shine? In Mr. Clough's view, it all derives from an expected slowdown in the American economy, caused by a falloff in capital expenditures. "What has made the economy so strong has been a boom in corporate investments," he said. "But that has put a lot of capacity out there, which is reducing prices." As a result, cash flow after capital expenditures is starting to decline at many corporations, a sign that we may be near the top of the investment cycle.
How low could bond yields go? Try 5 percent on the 30-year bond by year-end, which would give a total return of around 14 percent for the year, based on recent prices.
Yields could drop even further with a recession -- a distinct possibility in 1999, in Mr. Clough's view. The long bond yield could fall to 4 percent, bringing returns of nearly 30 percent to someone buying bonds today.
Gemma Wright, strategist at Fimat USA Inc., a broker-dealer in New York that specializes in futures and derivatives, concurs that bonds are a buy, but cites another reason. She sees more investor dollars chasing fewer Treasury issues. At the end of August, for example, a five-year Treasury note with $12.4 billion in face value is maturing, with no five-year issue to replace it. Similarly, the reissuance of a maturing two-year note will raise $4.5 billion less than the issue it is replacing. That's almost $17 billion looking for a home in just those two issues in just two weeks' time.
Demand for Treasuries, meanwhile, will come from portfolio managers investing in mortgage-backed securities. These folks are lagging behind their benchmarks and will buy Treasuries to make their bogeys. "The supply side is smaller yet demand will be big," Ms. Wright said. "For people concerned about global fragility, there's only one place to be: U.S. Treasuries."

HEADLINE: Managing Flood Waters in China

 BODY:
This summer's floods on the Yangtze River in central China and the Songhua River in northeastern China have already left nearly 14 million people homeless, indirectly affected 240 million more and damaged more than 50 million acres of land. The flood season is not yet over, but the death toll, estimated at 2,000 by Chinese authorities, shows that flood management has improved since the 1954 floods that claimed 30,000 lives. In the past four decades, the Government has built extensive dike systems and created emergency overflow areas to divert water from densely populated urban centers.
There is now growing concern that maintenance of these flood management systems, particularly in the Yangtze region, may be neglected as the Government pours billions of dollars into the ill-conceived Three Gorges Dam. When completed in 2009, the dam will create a lake nearly 400 miles long, displace 1.2 million people and inundate important archaeological sites. Chinese authorities have long cited flood control on the Yangtze as a primary justification for the project. The latest floods, they say, prove the need for the dam. But analysts with the International Rivers Network, a conservation group, argue that much of the flooding has taken place in the lower reaches of the Yangtze, fed by tributaries whose waters would not be controlled by the Three Gorges project. 
 In fact, the presence of the dam might actually result in worse flooding disasters in the future. By creating a false sense of security, the dam could attract more development to flood-prone areas and lead to reduced investment in downstream dikes. If the dam failed to control a large flood, the fatalities and economic loss could be worse than if it had not been built.
After the Mississippi floods in 1993, the United States Government rethought its flood-management strategies. Hydrologists and geologists now consider large dams only marginally useful in flood control because the reservoirs are typically kept high for power generation, with only limited capacity to accommodate surging flood waters. Instead, many argue that restricting development on flood-susceptible land, carving out more overflow areas for flood waters and making buildings flood-resistant are smarter ways to protect lives and property.
The Chinese have been battling floods on the Yangtze for centuries. A single mammoth dam would probably not have averted the recent disaster. But its construction could siphon resources from more effective flood management strategies.

To the Editor:
Re "Financial Planners Fume at the Taking of a Title" (Investing It, Aug. 2):
As a retired librarian, I understand why certified financial planners are dismayed to learn that some New York City welfare workers are now being called "financial planners," too. 
 Anyone who does any sort of work with any book collection has for years been called a "librarian," even though librarians should have a graduate degree in library science.
Professionals in all fields should work together to restrict their titles to those who have appropriate qualifications and do the appropriate work.

HEADLINE: Utah Struggles With a Revival of Polygamy

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY

 BODY:
As this state rebuilds highways and hotels to play host to the 2002 Winter Olympics, modern Utah is wrestling with a social institution inherited from its 19th-century Mormon pioneers -- polygamy.
In this conservative state, "don't ask, don't tell" means that sheriffs and judges turn a blind eye to polygamy, a felony that has not been prosecuted here in almost half a century. 
 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, whose founder sanctioned polygamy, has excommunicated polygamists for more than a century. But in the current laissez-faire legal climate, the number of Utahans living in polygamous families has increased tenfold in the last 50 years and is now at about 40,000 people, or 2 percent of the state population, social scientists say.
In today's open climate, the debate over the practice is led by two rival groups savvy in the modern ways of Web sites, news conferences and television talk shows. Tapestry of Polygamy, a self-help group of former polygamous wives, says it seeks to "free" women and children from polygamy. The Women's Religious Liberties Union, an association of women content with their lives in polygamous relationships, seeks to legalize what it calls "plural marriage" and to win a ban on discrimination against polygamists.
"This is going to be a mini-civil war -- we are going to free the slaves," said Carmen Thompson, the spokeswoman for the Tapestry group, which is setting up a network of "safe houses" to help women and children escape polygamous households.
Mary Potter, the spokeswoman for the opposing group, retorted: "Women in my group are happy in their relationships. They don't want other people to narrow their rights."
What has fueled the issue of polygamy statewide as well as nationally is the case of a 16-year-old girl who stumbled into a remote gas station in northern Utah this summer. Covered with fresh bruises on her legs, arms and buttocks, the authorities said, the girl had run seven miles through the night, fleeing her father's belt and the future he had ordained for her: marriage at the age of 16 to her uncle, and life as his 15th wife.
The teen-ager's 911 call has resulted in a charge against her father, John Daniel Kingston, a leader of a wealthy but secretive polygamous clan based in a Salt Lake suburb. Rowenna Erickson, a Tapestry member who left the clan in 1991, said that incest, child marriage and birth defects were becoming more frequent in the clan, which numbers about 1,500 people.
Although Ms. Erickson said the value of the clan's ranches and companies totaled more than $150 million, she asserted that women and children in the group often lived in poverty, earning minimum wages from business and receiving food stamps.
Ms. Erickson said that John Daniel Kingston had fathered 10 children with a half-sister and that the 16-year-old girl who fled was his eldest child. Identified only by her initials, M.N., she testified in late July in First District Court here that last fall she had been secretly married against her will to an uncle, David O. Kingston. After she ran away twice, she said, her father drove her 80 miles north of here to a ranch that the clan uses for disciplining what it considers wayward women and children.
"I could taste the blood in my nose," she testified, recalling how her father punched her on the drive up Interstate 15 to the ranch. After taking her to an old barn, she said, "He told me to take off my jacket."
"He was taking off his belt," she told the court between sobs. "He said he was going to give me 10 licks for every wrongdoing. He said there were three."
After being whipped 28 times, she said, she passed out.
Her father was charged with felony child abuse and her uncle with one count of incest and one of sexual abuse of a minor. The father, who has pleaded not guilty, is scheduled to go on trial in October in First District Court. The charge carries a penalty of 1 to 15 years in prison.
The uncle, who appeared in court on Aug. 17, did not enter a plea. He is scheduled to appear again on Sept. 1. Each count carries a penalty of up to five years in prison.
Now 17, the girl lives in a foster home and plans to return to high school next month. One year ago, she worked as a receptionist for Carl E. Kingston, the lawyer who now represents her father. The lawyer, a cousin of the father and the uncle, did not return repeated calls to his law office here.
Even though they are not members of the Mormon Church, most polygamists in Utah call themselves "Mormon fundamentalists," reaching back over 150 years in church history to the early 1840's, when Joseph Smith, the church founder, sanctioned the practice. According to his belief, "true Mormons" could attain the highest levels of heaven by conceiving as many children as possible so that they would bring more souls out of the limbo of pre-existence.
In the 19th century, polygamy was the pivotal issue that delayed statehood for the Utah territory for almost half a century after the first request by Mormon pioneers. Statehood came only in 1896 after Wilford Woodruff, president of the church, formally disavowed polygamy and after Utah approved a state constitution with the clause: "Polygamous or plural marriages are forever prohibited."
Until the early 1950's, men found to be living in polygamy were routinely jailed by the state. The last major raid on a polygamous colony, on the Utah-Arizona border in 1953, backfired in the face of negative public reaction to photographs of children being torn from their parents and taken to foster homes.
Since then, Utah has largely taken an increasingly tolerant stance toward polygamy. In 1991, the Utah Supreme Court ruled that polygamous families were eligible to adopt.
In July, Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, a Republican, speculated that polygamy might enjoy protection as a religious freedom. After protests from women who had left polygamous marriages, the popular Mr. Leavitt quickly amended his stance, saying that "plural marriage is wrong, it should stay against the law, and there is no place for it in modern society."
In Salt Lake City, easily Utah's most liberal city, support for prosecuting polygamists is tepid -- 54 percent, according to a poll of 1,000 area residents this spring, published in The Salt Lake Tribune.
Polygamy is difficult to prosecute because the men generally obtain marriage licenses for only their first wives. Subsequent marriages are performed secretly, and the additional wives often present themselves to society as single women with children.
Citing the difficulty of proof, Utah's Attorney General, Jan Graham, announced recently that she had advised prosecutors to avoid prosecuting cases of consensual adult bigamy, which carry jail terms of up to five years and fines of up to $5,000.
"Do we want polygamy squads looking in windows to see who is sleeping with whom?" asked Reed M. Richards, Utah's chief Deputy Attorney General. Referring to what are sexual crimes in Utah that are committed by consenting adults, he added: "If you are not making any effort to prosecute fornication, adultery or gay people indulging in sodomy, why polygamy?"
Instead, Utah officials have reached a consensus to crack down on crimes that sometimes surround polygamy -- child abuse, statutory rape, welfare fraud and incest. This year, the Utah Legislature raised the age for statutory rape to 17 from 16. Next year, the Legislature is expected to raise the minimum marriage age to 16 from 14.
To the women of Tapestry, male manipulation and exploitation are the glue of polygamy.
"Once you threw out the religion, all of us women realized that it was made for the benefit of men," said Vicky Prunty, who left two polygamous marriages with a total of six children. "He would stay with the other women until I ran and dropped on my knees and asked forgiveness -- which I did a couple of times."
Carmen Thompson, who had five children in two polygamous marriages, agreed, saying: "He would pit the wives against each other; as long as there was turmoil, there was more control. He would come for a sexual favor, saying the other women wouldn't do it for him."
But Irwin Altman, a University of Utah psychology professor who studied 24 "Mormon fundamentalist" families, said: "The stereotype that men are cynical and just in it for a good time does not hold up with our data. The man is a nomad. He rotates around. He doesn't know where his clothes are half the time. For privacy, some will go into their cars."
Poverty is often a hallmark of polygamy in this country. The border towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Ariz., targets of polygamy raids in the 1950's, are now heavily subsidized by Federal and state aid, according to a study of welfare and tax records by The Salt Lake Tribune. The two towns, with a total population of about 6,000, rank in the top 10 in the states in the mountain time zone for receiving Federal aid for poor women and children. With an average household of 8.5 people, Hildale has the lowest average Federal tax return of any Utah town, $651 for each filer.
With household incomes about half the state average, the Tribune study found, the two towns have received almost $5 million in recent years in Federal and state aid to build better houses and sewers.
"These people struggle economically," Professor Altman said. "It is a tough deal economically."
Yet because of high birth rates and conversions to Mormonism, polygamy in Utah has rebounded from a low point involving a few thousand people in the 1950's, Professor Altman said. Recalling that Federal troops and judges tried to eradicate polygamy more than a century ago, he said of Utah's polygamists, "They are here to stay."
Indeed, four years ago, Wilford Woodruff Steed died in Colorado City at age 94. He left 6 wives, 43 children and 235 grandchildren. Mr. Steed was born 10 years after his namesake, Wilford Woodruff, proclaimed the Manifesto -- the first church order to all Mormons to stop practicing polygamy.

HEADLINE: Reduce Surplus In Fishing Fleet, Wildlife Group Recommends

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MONTEREY, Calif., Aug. 22

 BODY:
The number of fishing boats chasing a diminishing fish population worldwide is far greater than originally estimated, and the fleet should be slashed by two-thirds, according to a report this week by the World Wildlife Fund.
The report suggests that fishing boats worldwide can catch 155 percent more fish than can be replaced through normal reproduction. That is a big increase from the latest United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization study, which estimates overcapacity at only 30 percent. 
 Too many boats and too few fish could eventually devastate the industry, the World Wildlife Fund study said.
"The prospect of a crash is possible unless there is a drastic attempt to reduce the worldwide fleet," said Gareth Porter, the study's author. "Without really radical surgery, the situation gets worse and worse."
Every fishing region faces over capacity, including the United States, the European Economic Union and China, Mr. Porter said this week.
Mr. Porter's report comes before an October United Nations meeting of fishing nations, in Rome, where environmentalists hope to propose solutions to overfishing.
"We're seeing an increasing recognition that this is a problem that needs to be dealt with," said Scott Burns, director of marine conservation for the World Wildlife Fund. "As it is now, fishermen have to fish harder and spend more money catching less fish."
One solution may be to issue each fishing company tradable rights to a percentage of the catch. The rights could be leased or sold.
"If no one has the right to harvest any portion of a stock," Mr. Porter said, "every fisherman must strive to capture as much of the catch as possible because it is assumed that any fish in the water will be taken by someone else." Mr. Porter added that the setup has worked well in New Zealand, Australia and Iceland.
One problem with the proposal is deciding how to fairly and evenly divide the fishing rights.
Mr. Porter also called for an end to government subsidies to the fishing industry, which he estimates at $11 billion to $21 billion annually worldwide. Subsidies can range from boat building grants to a minimum price for fish. They make fishing more attractive to newcomers and prop up ailing companies suffering from a lack of fish, Mr. Porter said.
Other solutions governments may consider are buying and scrapping fishing boats and training workers for new jobs.
Overfishing has long been recognized as a problem, with species like haddock and cod fished until they have almost disappeared.
Now, as fish supplies shrink and demand rises, fishermen can maintain their incomes despite catching fewer fish. But overfishing can lead to permanent changes in the ecosystem, Mr. Porter said.
"The high-value fish disappear, and they're replaced by lower-value fish," Mr. Porter said. "What they call 'trash' fish have become a much larger portion of the total catch."

HEADLINE: Rape Resists the Inroads Of the City's War on Crime

BYLINE: By KIT R. ROANE 

 BODY:
In an era of plummeting crime rates, there is one category of violent offense that has resisted the trend: rape.
New York City's murder rate has plunged 60 percent in four years; robberies have dropped nearly 50 percent. But reports of rape are down only 13 percent in the same time period and have shown only a small decline this year, police statistics show. 
 The many factors credited with making New York's streets so safe -- the new policing tactics, the quality-of-life crackdown, the waning crack epidemic, the booming economy -- have had only a limited effect on the rape rate, the police and prosecutors say. The reasons are varied, they say, but all serve to underscore their belief that among violent crimes, rape stands apart.
"It's a completely different animal that you can't prevent through traditional crime-fighting techniques," said Marjory D. Fisher, who heads the Queens District Attorney's special victims bureau. "When you flood a corner with police officers or attack quality-of-life crimes, you may affect the gun rate or the drug arrest rate, but you aren't going to affect the rape rate."
A primary reason, Ms. Fisher said, is that in most cases, rapists know their victims, exploiting an intimacy that allows them to attack behind closed doors, away from other people, beyond the reach of the police. In such circumstances, placing bars on windows, avoiding dark alleys and not talking to strangers are no protection.
Of the 2,779 rapes reported in New York City last year, more than 75 percent were said to be committed by an acquaintance or relative of the victim's, the police said, a figure that they said was borne out year to year.
Police Commissioner Howard Safir points to this statistic as the best explanation for the relatively slow decline in rapes compared with other violent crimes. The number of reported rapes remains high simply because women are far more likely now than in years past to report acquaintance rape, he said.
The Commissioner and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani have repeatedly commended the efforts of the Police Department to expand resources used to combat rape and to remove the stigma that has kept many victims from going to the police for help.
"Many of those rapes would not have been reported in the past because people did not have the confidence that they would be treated with sensitivity and anonymity," Mr. Safir said.
Over the years, the police and prosecutors' offices have established special units of investigators trained to deal with the particular difficulties that emerge when questioning victims of sex crimes. Many hospitals also have hired counselors to assist rape victims.
Coverage of some of these innovations by the news media has prompted some rape victims to report their assaults, said Casey Jordan, an associate professor of justice and law administration at Western Connecticut State University. Even coverage of some notorious rape trials like those involving William Kennedy Smith in Florida and Alex Kelly in Connecticut have encouraged some to come forward, she said.
"The outcome of these cases is irrelevant," said Ms. Jordan, who specializes in studying rape trends. "The message that women have gotten is that the victim has fought to see a rapist brought to justice and these victims have been seen as heroines."
Another factor affecting rape statistics, the police say, is the difficulty in capturing the small but troubling number of rapists who repeatedly attack strangers. The number of rapes by strangers has risen 8 percent in New York City this year, after a 20 percent drop in the previous three, police statistics show.
Prosecutors said they do not believe that there are more rapists on the loose, only that they have been able to cover their tracks even after multiple assaults.
Many rapists have been able to circumvent recent advances in DNA fingerprinting and fiber analysis by such simple acts as wearing gloves, masks and condoms, investigators say.
One rapist who has eluded capture by using these tactics is a man thought responsible for more than 30 attacks in the last four years on women in upper Manhattan and the Bronx.
The police said he has disguised his appearance with scarves, bandannas, handkerchiefs and ski masks. He attacks women quickly from behind as they enter apartment buildings, elevators or alleys from Harlem to the northeastern Bronx, they said.
His constant characteristics appear to be that he carries a black gun, takes only gold jewelry, orders his victims not to look at his face, and uses condoms.
The police say condom use among rapists is on the rise, noting that some rape victims have pleaded with their attackers to use them because of the fear of AIDS. While that may minimize the health risk for the victim, the use of condoms denies investigators an important type of evidence, the so-called genetic fingerprint that forensic experts can recover from semen.
These factors add to the already peculiar difficulties that detectives face in trying to capture the rapists who are strangers to their victims: unlike most other criminals, they nearly always work alone, seldom brag about their exploits and usually commit the act at a time and in a place they have scouted out and chosen precisely for its lack of witnesses.
"Unlike homicide or a robbery, very rarely do they say to their buddies, 'Hey, I raped that woman in the paper yesterday,' " said Lieut. Susan Morley, head of the Police Department's sex crimes liaison unit.
"You really don't get many tips on these crimes," she added, noting that homicides usually involve a connection between victim and assailant, and that robbers can often be traced through the property they have stolen.
And even if a rapist is caught, there is no guarantee that he will go to prison. While the conviction rate in homicide cases routinely reaches above 85 percent, the rate for rape cases usually is 40 to 50 percent -- making it more likely that some rapists will be freed to rape again, prosecutors say.
Despite the encouraging increase in the willingness of women to report rape, many experts say that sexual assaults continue to be the most underreported of all major crimes and that they are believed to occur twice as often as the statistics show.
According to a well-regarded 1992 independent study, "Rape in America," 13 percent of all women have been raped at least once. And 62 percent of the rapes happened before the age of 18, according to the study, conducted by the National Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center at the Medical University of South Carolina and by the National Victims Center in Arlington, Va.
Dr. Eleanor Pam, who heads the research and resource center on domestic violence at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that while it was impossible to determine if the number of rapes are really rising or falling, the increase in the number of women willing to report the crime was a significant bellwether. She said that she took little comfort in it.
"These statistics show that violence against women continues unabated and that we haven't done anything significantly to impact it," she said. "We are just beginning to acknowledge it as a crime and accept the scope of its diversity."

HEADLINE: Another Week Without Tax On Clothing

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

 BODY:
Pressing a political point and catering to back-to-school shoppers, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday that most clothing or shoes sold in New York City would be free of sales tax during the first week of September.
The tax, including the state and city levies, totals 8 1/4 percent, so the weeklong break will mean a savings of $7.42 on a $90 pair of Nike Air Max running shoes. 
 This is the fourth such week in the city in two years, as the Mayor continues to push state legislators to do away with the tax. In the session that ended in June, the State Legislature went partway, eliminating the tax on clothes and shoes that sell for less than $110, beginning Dec. 1, 1999.
The week to splurge this year will be Sept. 1 to 7, when the city's exemption will cover goods costing less than $500 each.
"This is the best job-creation program that New York has come up with in probably 50 years," Mr. Giuliani said. "The purpose of encouraging people to shop for clothes during the tax-free week is to create an example, really, of what can happen if you eliminate the sales tax."
Mr. Giuliani praised legislators for meeting him partway, but urged them to go further. "When we started three years ago, the cynics said this couldn't be done in Albany, and we fought and we scratched and we pushed very hard," he said.
Some retailers said their sales had tripled during past tax-free weeks. City officials contend that they more than make up for the tax money they lose, since more people are hired and shoppers stay in the city instead of heading for the suburbs.
A leading retail analyst, Kurt Barnard, cautioned that part of the sales increase during tax-free weeks consists of sales that would have occurred anyway, but are shifted to the taxless periods because people time their purchases to save money.
But Mr. Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, based in Upper Montclair, N.J., said tax-free weeks clearly increased sales over all.
"It brings sales to the city of New York that normally would go to other areas, and makes it possible for a lot of people on tight budgets to buy a few more things," he said. "You go in to buy a suit, and maybe you pick up a tie."
The Mayor made the announcement at Moe Ginsburg Men's Better Clothing, on Fifth Avenue, where he tried on a double-breasted Italian suit for the benefit of 10 television cameras.
"I don't know if it's exactly a suit I could get away with," Mr. Giuliani said, patting his midriff. Surprise: The suit, carefully chosen by store executives and the Mayor's aides, fit flatteringly.
"That's pretty nice, huh?" the Mayor said. "I don't think I've ever had a suit like this." Then he touched the breast pocket of the $680 suit and said, "Could you put a little 'N.Y.' here, or something?"
The city, which is promoting the tax break with posters showing a shiny apple and other classroom cliches, has printed a long list of items that are eligible for the tax break, and those that are not.
The exempt items include aprons, bathing caps, corset laces, lab coats, riding pants, shoelaces, socks, tights, tuxedos (unless rented) and underwear.
Taxable items include bobby pins, goggles (unless prescription), helmets, ice skates, party costumes, roller skates, shin guards, sunglasses, wallets and wigs.
The store the Mayor visited, Moe Ginsburg, has been among the most aggressive promoters of the city's tax-free weeks, and got a jump on this fall's campaign by declaring all of August tax free, with the tax coming out of the store's profit.
The store's president, Paul S. Ginsburg, said his sales tripled or quadrupled during past tax-free weeks.
And Arifur R. Khan, 24, manager of Wheels of London, a shoe store in Greenwich Village, said his sales increased 10 percent to 20 percent during tax-free weeks.
"Kids browse before tax-free week," he said, then come back and buy.
In Manhattan, several shoppers said they would put off purchases to take advantage of the tax-free week.
Monica Samuels, 38, who was stocking up on bras for her daughter at Conway, on 34th Street, said, "If you really know how to shop, you don't have to wait around for a no-sales-tax week."
But she said she would wait until the first week of September for more expensive items, including gym shoes and blue jeans.
Emily Fanuele, who lives in Greenwich Village and was on her way out of Gap Kids on Sixth Avenue, said that she would wait to stretch the $200 she planned to spend on her 7-year-old daughter, Angeline.
Ms. Fanuele said she would love to see the sales tax eliminated, "but I'll take what we can get."
Arnold Gleckman, 46, who has a daughter, Mimi, headed for nursery school, was suspicious. "Are they going to mark up the price?" he asked.
During the city's tax-free week last September, shoes were not covered, which the Mayor said "created mass confusion."
The city's sales tax includes 4 percent for the city, 4 percent for the state and 0.25 percent for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
According to estimates by the city's Economic Development Corporation, the plan passed by the Legislature will mean an increase of 13,200 retail jobs, while total elimination of the tax on clothing and shoes would produce 19,600 jobs.
"Sales are often perceived as just marketing, but this is a genuine discount off the price, and consumers realize that," said Charles Millard, president of the economic development agency.
Mr. Giuliani said eliminating the tax was "the best way to create jobs -- not for government to subsidize jobs."
"The better way to create jobs is to have vital, growing businesses," he said.
As the Mayor headed out of the fifth floor (Contemporary European Collections) at Moe Ginsburg's yesterday, he handed the suit to Mr. Ginsburg.
"Hold on to this," Mr. Giuliani instructed. "I'll come back at a quieter time."

HEADLINE: TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: THE LAW;
Rulings in Clinton-Starr Bouts May Hinder Future Presidents

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 22

 BODY:
President Clinton's defense of his private conduct this year has endangered more than his reputation and credibility. The legal battles he has fought to avoid acknowledging that his behavior with Monica S. Lewinsky was inappropriate may have eroded Presidential power and prerogatives for future Presidents, legal experts, constitutional scholars and political scientists say.
The precedents set by court decisions rebuffing Mr. Clinton's efforts to halt a sexual misconduct suit by Paula Corbin Jones and prevent close aides and bodyguards from testifying before a Federal grand jury investigating the Lewinsky matter have profound implications, the experts say. Among them are these: 
 *Presidents can now be sued for private conduct while still in office.
*Government lawyers may be compelled to disclose advice they provide to Presidents.
*The notion that executive privilege protects a President's conversation with his advisers has been restricted.
*Members of a President's personal security force can be called to testify about his or her movements, actions and habits.
And Mr. Clinton voluntarily set a precedent, as the first President to testify before a grand jury investigating his own actions. One potential battle, over the possibility that a prosecutor can require a President to appear by issuing a subpoena, was avoided -- at least for now -- when Mr. Clinton agreed to testify. But Mr. Starr has told the President that he still might subpoena him to compel testimony about matters Mr. Clinton declined to discuss.
Not lost on students of the Presidency is that these legal precedents did not flow out of Mr. Clinton's efforts to protect conversations involving national security or sensitive law-enforcement or economic policy. They resulted from the President's effort to hide an affair with Ms. Lewinsky that he later acknowledged. Executive privilege protects conversations about sensitive Government matters between the President and top advisers.
Now, many of those who ponder the impact on the institution fear serious consequences, including the potential for more lawsuits against Presidents in office, an inhibition to give Presidents candid advice, a disinclination to write memorandums or diaries, and difficulty recruiting quality advisers because of the risk of large legal fees. "It's just been a disaster for the Presidency," said Harold Bruff, dean of the University of Colorado Law School.
The President's legal battles continue. The White House asked the Supreme Court on Friday to overturn a lower court ruling requiring that some of Mr. Clinton's legal advisers testify in the Lewinsky case.
Mark Rozell, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert on executive privilege, said: "I think much of the Clinton strategy has weakened traditional Presidential power with respect to executive privilege. In part, that's because they have sent up losing argument after losing argument for what appears to me to be attempts to delay the Starr investigation."
Not everyone lays the blame for erosion of Presidential power at the feet of the Clinton White House. Several scholars and lawyers also fault Mr. Starr for disregarding potential damage to the Presidency in his aggressive pursuit of Mr. Clinton.
Though concepts like executive privilege and attorney-client confidentiality, which protects the conversations between lawyers and their clients, often have an abstract or theoretical air to the public, the loss of these prerogatives to Presidents can have real consequences. Legal experts say the erosion of such powers may make it harder, for example, for Presidents to recruit competent and trusted advisers. A host of Clinton advisers have been subpoenaed by Mr. Starr and appeared before grand juries investigating accusations of Presidential misconduct, even conduct that took place before the President was elected. Most have had to pay their own legal bills.
Mr. Bruff said he once turned down a job in the White House counsel's office. "One of the reasons for rejecting it," he said, "was that I can't risk my family's life savings for potential legal bills."
Some lawyers also lament the Supreme Court decision in the Jones lawsuit that permitted sitting Presidents to be sued, a precedent some consider potentially damaging.
"The Court assumed that because there were so few civil suits against the President in the past, that there would not be many such suits in the future," said Walter Dellinger, a Duke University Law School professor and former Solicitor General. "But the future is a different world, because no litigant will ever have to go to the Supreme Court again to commence a lawsuit against the President of the United States. All a litigant has to do is file suit in any Federal or state court."
Ms. Jones's lawyers, among others, say the case reached the High Court only because Mr. Clinton declined to settle. "There was no real desire on their part to settle; they wanted to wait until the Supreme Court finished," said Joseph Cammarata, one of Ms. Jones's lawyers at the time. Robert S. Bennett, Mr. Clinton's lawyer in the Jones case, did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
Some scholars dismiss the notion of any permanent damage to the Presidency and dispute assertions that court decisions will constrain Presidents from confiding in advisers. What is there to fear, they say, as long as discussions do not involve illegal acts or abuse of power?
Charles O. Jones, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Wisconsin, also does not buy the argument that compelling the President's bodyguards to testify will mean that he will seek to avoid them as much as possible. "Why would he place his life in jeopardy?" Mr. Jones asked.
The concept of Presidential prerogatives is an elastic one, scholars say. It is not mentioned in the Constitution and is mainly defined by case law and by whether a President feels confident that if he asserts it, he will not pay a political price.
It is the latter area, some experts say, where the Clinton Administration has done the most harm, by making it likely that future Presidents will be more hesitant to evoke a principle of prerogative like executive privilege for fear of political accusations that they are trying to hide questionable actions.
"When it turns out that the President was only covering up his own embarrassment, it becomes easy for people to say, this wasn't about principle at all," said Peter M. Shane, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh Law School who is a former Justice Department lawyer. "Now when the next President comes along and tries to do the same, politically it becomes much harder. People are going to say, 'Wait a minute, this is just another stonewall.' "

HEADLINE: Tribal Garden Helps to Ease Pain of Cutbacks In Welfare

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: ETHETE, Wyo.

 BODY:
In the face of cutbacks brought about by the overhaul of welfare programs, members of the Northern Arapaho Tribe here on the Wind River Reservation have started a seven-acre community garden with donated land, seeds and equipment to grow vegetables for themselves and for the elderly and disabled who cannot work.
"We were concerned that when time runs out, when they are no longer eligible for Government assistance, what are they going to do for food?" said Glen Revere, a nutritionist with the Indian Health Services on the 2.8 million-acre Wind River Reservation, about 100 miles east of Jackson, Wyo. "Then we came up with the idea for this community garden, and it's been bigger than we ever expected in so many ways." 
 At the all-volunteer garden, this is the time of year when potatoes grow larger than a man's fist, popping out of the soil, and five-foot-high cornstalks develop ears with red, yellow and white kernels ripening inside. The conditions on these wide plains near the Wind River Range of the Rocky Mountains can be harsh with high winds and late springs, allowing only a 90-day growing season.
Mr. Revere's partner in this effort is Irene Houser, director of the Northern Arapaho Tribe Community Services, who has distributed produce around the Wind River Reservation and to the Pine Ridge Reservation in southwestern South Dakota. Ms. Houser, a Northern Arapaho tribal member, said that people were stunned when she brought them bushels of potatoes, onions, squash, zucchini, tomatoes, beets, radishes and other vegetables. "They asked, 'How much are you going to charge me for this?' " she recalled. "I said, 'It's free,' and they were so happy. Many of them didn't have food in their house when I showed up."
Mark Soldierwolf, a 70-year-old father of nine and grandfather of nine, said: "That food lasted us about six weeks. We dried some things, boiled some. Just ate all of it."
Mr. Soldierwolf, a Northern Arapaho who served with the Marines in World War II and the Korean War, lives with his wife, Florita, one daughter and one grandchild. They receive food stamps for a $300-a-month budget for the four of them, but they said they often fed any member of their family who stopped by. Mr. Soldierwolf estimated they saved $70 with the free vegetables.
Mr. Soldierwolf's family represents the problems that plague many of the 1.3 million American Indians who live on reservations, where 49 percent are unemployed. It is estimated that at least half the American Indian population lives in poverty, the Bureau of Indian Affairs reports. Mr. Soldierwolf said all but one of his adult children were unemployed.
"If you can make it to the end of the month you're all right," Mr. Soldierwolf said, referring to the monthly food stamps. "It's worse than in the Depression." Mrs. Soldierwolf nodded, with tears in her eyes.
The Wyoming Department of Family Services says the Northern Arapaho on the reservation account for 18.9 percent of all welfare cases in Wyoming. The reservation population of 12,000 -- including 6,000 Northern Arapaho tribal members, about 3,000 Shoshone tribal members and 3,000 from other tribes -- represents about 2.5 percent of the state population of 480,000.
Mr. Revere and Ms. Houser hope the garden can help reduce a dependence on welfare by producing cash crops, growing traditional Indian plants to be sold on or off the reservation, Mr. Revere said.
On the Crow Reservation in Montana, at a five-acre garden to be planted this fall, the plan is to let people work part of their welfare community service time at the garden.
"We are trying to provide people with skills that they can use here or take with them," said Charlene Johnson, a Crow tribal member and nutritionist with Indian Health Services. "Indians are not horticulturists. They were hunters and gatherers who were forced to garden when they were put on the reservations. There is a lack of knowledge about how to plant and water crops."
Howard Lujan, a father of four, used seeds Ms. Houser gave him to grow ceremonial Indian corn in a little garden on the side of his house. "I will give this corn to anyone who wants some because it is part of our religion," he said.

JUST MY SOUL RESPONDING
 Rhythm and Blues, Black Consciousness,
 and Race Relations.
 By Brian Ward.
 Illustrated. 600 pp. Berkeley:
 University of California Press.
 Cloth, $60. Paper, $24.95. 
 The true subject of "Just My Soul Responding" is not soul music or even rhythm and blues -- unless that post-World War II catchall category is retrofitted to encompass soul and a little funk and disco but not hip-hop or recent black pop. Rather, Brian Ward sets himself to tracing the evolution of black pop from the dawn of rock-and-roll (a misty moment here signaled by the Chords' "Sh-Boom" in 1954) until his material peters out in the mid-1970's. Even though he would have been better off plodding on for another 250 pages, into the 90's, the book deserves a place alongside Charles Keil's "Urban Blues," Arnold Shaw's "Honkers and Shouters," Peter Guralnick's "Sweet Soul Music" and Nelson George's "Death of Rhythm and Blues" and "Where Did Our Love Go?"
By no means does "Just My Soul Responding" rank above them, however. Ward, who teaches American history at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in England, blusters a great deal about superseding the competition. "Ultimately," he claims, "the story of rhythm and blues reveals the inadequacy of both excessive romanticizations of the counterhegemonic power of black popular culture, and of Frankfurt School-style critiques of mass culture." Yet none of the books cited above indulge in either fallacy. When he gets down to cases, Ward either attacks commentators of little standing or snipes at the decontextualized ideas of more skillful writers whose discoveries, as the footnotes establish, he is not above appropriating.
Especially since Ward is no theoretical innovator himself -- his brightest insight is the cultural-studies commonplace identifying black pop as an arena where entertainers are "dramatizing and celebrating the black community's refusal to succumb to the mental and spiritual ravages of racism and poverty" -- this academic chest beating is a counterproductive distraction. Instead, Ward should rely more confidently on his strength: the rare combination he achieves of diligent professional historian (he is one of the editors of "The Making of Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement") and passionate fan. With scant firsthand experience of the music in situ, he has scoured liner notes, collector magazines, newspaper archives, academic journals and documents of the civil rights movement and has produced an account that is evenhanded and common-sensical but also committed and felt.
Ward's method is to argue his thesis by linking rhythm and blues to "mass black consciousness." An ardent integrationist at heart, he posits a plausible connection between the racial openness and relative gentility of black pop in the 50's and the middle-class ambitions many poor black Americans nurtured during the postwar economic boom, especially after the Supreme Court's school desegregation decision in 1954. As he explains it -- mechanistically, but reasonably -- the more race-conscious soul and funk genres reflect the increasing militancy that produced the black power movement. This Ward sees as an understandable but unfortunate reaction that ensued when racial progress slowed to a crawl (or went into reverse) because whites had realized that "to open up the American dream to everyone" would require "the wholesale restructuring of American society, government and economy." Ward is enthusiastic about the cultural heat of black consciousness -- he knows soul's elaborated call-and-response and funk's improvisational rhythmic complexity would never have developed among artists who were courting whites. But in the end he seems to regret it anyway. Politically, he doubts separatism can work in a predominantly white nation. And musically, he is put off by the machismo of these styles -- far more so, it must be said, than most black women seem to be.
Ward overplays an unrepresentative smattering of personal interviews and commits other gaffes -- ascribing too much significance to a racist attack on Nat (King) Cole in 1956 and, comically, identifying a white Polygram executive as the bass singer of the Platters. But he offers much that is fresh. There is sharp critical writing about the Clovers at the beginning of his story and Parliament-Funkadelic at its end, and a surprisingly persuasive reading of Chuck Berry's "Promised Land" as a shadow history of the first Freedom Rides. And although others have made the point, he is properly emphatic about the refusal of black fans and entrepreneurs to go along with the taste makers who feel slickness and sophistication are not "black." In a paradigmatic instance that cannot be cited too often, the Southern funk of Memphis and Muscle Shoals was the product of white-owned companies and white-dominated house bands, while the supposed sellout pop of Motown was created and marketed by blacks.
Best of all, Ward provides some eye-opening revelations about the civil rights movement. A young Martin Luther King Jr. warns against the evils of rock-and-roll. A young Julian Bond sends up the notion of natural rhythm. The Black Panther Party lays out the revolutionary limitations of song. Most memorably, having reminded us that the crucial musical supporters of the civil rights movement were non-R & B artists like Lena Horne, Sammy Davis Jr. and Joan Baez, Ward establishes Harry Belafonte -- who was a left-wing activist well before he became a folk-pop superstar -- as the angel of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
So until we get a survey that combines Ward's exhaustive research with Guralnick's literary sweep, Keil's social vision and George's easy authority, "Just My Soul Responding" will remain an uncommonly comprehensive introduction to the formative decades of black rock-and-roll, which Ward situates more single-mindedly than most in black history. Ultimately, his quirks and personal preferences only add flavor, and to his credit, he does not let them hogtie him. If his theorizing about "mass black consciousness" is tendentious by definition, it remains credible, not least because he never forgets how varied the individuals, interest groups and casual social associations that underlie such intellectual conceits always turn out to be when you look them in the eye.

ACHESON
 The Secretary of State Who Created
 the American World.
 By James Chace.
 Illustrated. 512 pp. New York:
 Simon & Schuster. $30. 
 Over the past 12 months American foreign policy has dealt with issues like the enlargement of NATO, bailouts of South Korea and Indonesia by the International Monetary Fund, discussions with Japan on economic revival in the context of the United States-Japan Security Treaty, and new initiatives on the part of South Korea's President Kim Dae Jung to open a dialogue with the North across the Demilitarized Zone. What all of these have in common is that they were carried out within the context of international institutions established in the period 1944-51, institutions that reflected the vision and energy of one individual, Dean Gooderham Acheson.
 As an assistant secretary of state for economic affairs he attended the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, where the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund were established; as Under Secretary of State he oversaw the passage of financing for the Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan; as Secretary of State he negotiated the establishment of NATO, stood firm for the defense of South Korea and put in place a security agreement with Japan. It is hardly an exaggeration to state, as James Chace does in the subtitle of his new biography, that Acheson was the Secretary of State who "created the American world."
 In "Acheson," Chace, the editor of World Policy Journal and the author of several books on international affairs, covers a great deal of familiar ground and does not present much new information on the period's historic controversies. Nor does he provide us with significantly clearer insight into the inner man than is available in Acheson's own memoirs, "Morning and Noon" and "Present at the Creation." Nonetheless, this biography is engrossingly good reading simply as a story of the dizzying sequence of monumental events in which Acheson took part, and for what it tells us about what is required by way of character in an outstanding statesman. At the core of Acheson's achievement was an understanding that in a democracy great things can be accomplished in foreign policy, but only if the underlying rationale is carefully articulated and tirelessly promoted. This was a lesson he first learned as an assistant secretary winning Congressional support for the Bretton Woods agreement, and it is one that subsequent administrations have often failed to heed.
 In view of Acheson's reputation as an arrogant and effete elitist, it is ironic that many of his most outstanding triumphs lay in persuading an often niggardly, isolationist and (between 1946 and 1948) Republican Congress to support a costly internationalist position for the United States. Like Henry Kissinger, Acheson was extremely good at using the press to get out his side of the story. And it is easy to forget how bold many of the initiatives with which he was associated actually were.
 It was not a foregone conclusion that the United States would spend $400 million on aid to Greece and Turkey and even larger sums for the reconstruction of Europe. It was not obvious that the United States should help rebuild the economies of Japan and Germany shortly after their defeat. Nor was it easy to argue with the Republicans in Congress -- many of whom considered themselves what Newt Gingrich now calls "cheap hawks" -- that the United States should commit itself to a large peacetime buildup of its conventional forces rather than rely on nuclear weapons alone. To create support for the Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan, Acheson employed rhetoric that he himself knew was excessively alarmist in its Manichaean portrayal of the Soviet Union. While many (including Chace) argue that he was hoist with his own petard by legitimating the virulent anti-Communism that Senator Joseph McCarthy later turned on him, such critics fail to appreciate the fact that carefully nuanced language often fails to achieve its underlying purpose.
 Chace's account of the early cold war reads strangely, because it fails fully to acknowledge, on the basis of material recently released from the Soviet archives, that "we now know," as the Yale historian John L. Gaddis puts it, certain things about Soviet intentions that were opaque to policy makers at the time. In 1946, for example, Acheson was involved in drafting the so-called Acheson-Lilienthal report, which would have put nuclear energy under the control of an international authority so that the Soviet Union would not feel threatened by this new and terrifying resource. Chace criticizes Truman for turning this scheme into the tougher Baruch Plan, an initiative quickly dismissed by Moscow, and he suggests that had Roosevelt lived he might have been able to negotiate the mother of all arms control agreements, a nuclear duopoly with Stalin. Many academic careers were made in the 1960's and 70's on the basis of similar speculations about how the cold war might have been averted through timely cooperative overtures to the Kremlin. But any such overtures were doomed to failure because, as Gaddis puts it, we now know that "as long as Stalin was running the Soviet Union a cold war was unavoidable."
 Chace's failure to concede what we now know extends to one of the most celebrated events in Acheson's career, and one that fixed his reputation for character in later generations: his refusal to disavow Alger Hiss when Hiss was accused by Whittaker Chambers and Richard Nixon of being a Communist. Hiss's brother Donald was a law partner of Acheson's at Covington & Burling, and later a subordinate in the State Department. From various Soviet-bloc documents that have appeared since 1991, it would appear that Soviet infiltration of American leftist organizations was in fact quite extensive, and that Hiss was guilty as charged. None of this, of course, excuses McCarthy's behavior or diminishes Acheson's stature for failing to turn his back on a friend. But the clubbiness of the elite social circles in which Acheson moved may have blinded him to the possibility that some of his close associates had stepped over the line.
 Chace's biography also tends to underplay Acheson's failures, particularly in Asia. As Secretary of State in 1949 he placed unwarranted hopes on an early Chinese-Soviet split, a development that didn't materialize until 15 years and two Asian wars later. He underestimated the viability and importance of non-Communist regimes in Taiwan and South Korea, a blindness that (though admittedly shared by much of the American military establishment at the time) had to be paid for in blood after North Korea's invasion in June 1950. And at the other extreme, he failed to rein in Gen. Douglas MacArthur when MacArthur sought to unify Korea after the spectacular landing at Inchon.
 The most interesting material in this book concerns the way in which Acheson's success was, like that of Harry Truman, related to the incorruptibility of his character, and to an inner self-confidence that freed him from slavish dependence on public opinion. Acheson was as close to his independent-minded mother as he was distant from his stern Episcopal bishop father, whose approval he never fully earned. From the former he inherited a rebellious streak that nearly got him expelled from Groton and led to a less than stellar performance at Yale. But in his early 20's, as Acheson came into contact with Louis Brandeis, whose clerk he was, and Felix Frankfurter, who became a lifelong friend, something in him changed. He began to take studies and work seriously, all the while retaining a fierce independence that surfaced when it counted.
 Acheson was actually fired by Roosevelt from his first Government job as Under Secretary of the Treasury because he believed that Roosevelt's scheme to reset the price of gold was illegal, a view from which this relatively junior official could not be budged. In later years Acheson was able to find ways of skirting the law in pursuit of policies of which he approved, like Lend-Lease. His firing shows, however, that he had an inner moral compass that stood him in good stead through the difficult decisions of the period.
 While he believed that government service was a duty and a privilege, he was never desperate to remain in the public eye. He spent a great deal of time trying to resign from jobs and return to private life, only to find himself turned down by bosses eager to retain his services. Given the present Administration's hesitant, public-relations-driven foreign policy, it is hard to read this account of Acheson and Truman and not feel considerable nostalgia for an earlier Democratic Administration, when giants truly walked the earth.

HEADLINE: Why Limit Integration To Public Housing?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
It is a laudable goal of Republican lawmakers in Congress to achieve socioeconomic integration of public housing projects by opening them up to the working poor (front page, Aug. 19). 
 While there may be some displacement, the benefits appear to outweigh the costs.
However, there is another way to achieve integration far from the inner-city housing projects -- in the middle-class, mostly white suburbs that house the constituencies of these well-meaning Republican legislators.
And for the sake of consistency, I expect these same legislators to work toward the dismantling of archaic zoning bylaws in their local communities to allow multi-use, "new urbanism"-type developments with affordable housing interspersed with single-family homes and apartments above storefront shops.

HEADLINE: Ford Bidding To Take Over Korea's Kia

BYLINE: Agence France-Presse 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 23

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company is among four bidders in the race to take over South Korea's ailing Kia Motors Corporation and its truck-building affiliate.
A 10-member team is assessing the bids submitted by Ford and three South Korean car makers Friday to take over Kia, which went bankrupt last year and set off a spate of business failures that led to South Korea's financial crisis. 
 "All four bidders appeared to have submitted very strong bids," a spokesman for Kia Motors said.
Analysts said Ford appeared to have the advantage over the three Korean contenders -- Samsung Motors Inc., Hyundai Motor Company and the Daewoo Motor Corporation.
The four manufacturers bid for at least 51 percent of Kia Motors and its truck-building affiliate, the Asia Motors Company, which collapsed in July 1997.
Kia's assets are estimated at around 7.72 trillion won ($5.94 billion) and liabilities at 8.75 trillion won ($6.73 billion).
Asia Motors has liabilities of 3.73 trillion won ($2.87 billion) and assets of 1.64 trillion won.
The bid-assessment team, including experts from Anderson Consulting of the United States and Banque Nationale de Paris, will study and grade the four bids and hand them over to a committee that will decide who wins the competition.
The committee, including economists, accountants and industry experts, is expected to announce its decision on Sept. 1.
Ford, which already has a stake of 16.9 percent in Kia, was expected to win the highest marks for its financing plans and programs to hire workers and increase exports.
But the American company was expected to win a low score in its bidding price. Ford reportedly plans to invest some $300 million, while the highest bidding price is expected to be close to $1 billion.
If Ford manages to win control of Kia, the deal could drastically revamp the country's embattled auto industry, the world's fifth biggest with an annual capacity of four million units before the financial crisis hit last year.

Allstate Is Expected to Sue For Repeated Overbilling
Allstate was expected to sue about a dozen Southern California doctors and chiropractors and their assistants today for $25 million for repeatedly overbilling or billing for services they never provided in hundreds of accident cases over the last several years.
The Insurance Research Council, an industry organization in Illinois, contends that nearly 40 percent of the claims for auto accident injuries now involve fraud. And insurers say some doctors and clinics are capitalizing on real accidents and real injuries by seeking reimbursement for procedures not required and never performed. Page D2

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Warm Tones Make the Image

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from two new 30-second commercials that the Vallone campaign plans to begin broadcasting today. 

 
CANDIDATE -- Peter F. Vallone
 
PRODUCER -- Doak, Carrier & O'Donnell, Washington, D.C.
 
ON THE SCREEN -- In two similar 30-second advertisements, Mr. Vallone is seen in a series of cozy settings, chatting with groups of people, helping children in a classroom, conferring with doctors and working at his desk.
 
SCRIPTS -- Announcer: "His career is a study in principle, character and consistent purpose. He led the fight for safe cities, safe streets. He fought for clinic-access legislation to protect a woman's right to choose. To investigate police brutality and corruption, he passed legislation for a civilian complaint review board. He appropriated $6 billion to modernize city schools. And now he's taking on the people's fight to keep the Yankees in the Bronx. A quiet, modest man who's made doing right a way of life. Peter Vallone. New York first."
 
Announcer: "His cause has always been the needs of working families. Now he's running for governor to put New York families first. Peter Vallone, he'll create thousands of jobs by requiring state government to buy products from New York companies. At state and city colleges, he'll reward students who maintain a B average with half-price tuition. And he'll take on H.M.O.'s and insurance companies and pass a patient protection act so doctors, not insurance companies, make medical decisions. Peter Vallone for governor. New York first."
 
ACCURACY -- The first ad fairly depicts some achievements of Mr. Vallone's 12 years as Speaker of the New York City Council, though former Mayor David N. Dinkins surely gets much of the credit for the "Safe Streets, Safe City" program that expanded the Police Department. Some economists dispute the claim in the second ad that Mr. Vallone's plan to favor New York contractors would benefit the state's economy.
 
SCORECARD -- These ads are intended to help define Mr. Vallone, still an unknown quantity to most voters, in the warmest of tones. That it has taken until three weeks before the primary for any Democrat to begin such an effort shows how pressed the Democrats are for money. Though polls show him roughly even with Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross in the contest for the Democratic nomination, Mr. Vallone's strategists want to concentrate on building his image rather than attacking her, which they fear could backfire.

HEADLINE: U.S. Expected to Seek Scottish Trial in Hague for Pan Am Suspects

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is expected to announce on Monday a proposal to create a Scottish court in the Netherlands to try two Libyans accused of blowing up Pan Am flight 103 jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, a decade ago, American officials said today.
The Administration has arranged a conference call Monday morning from Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and national security aAdviser Samuel R. Berger to relatives of the victims to tell them of the decision, the officials said. 
 It is not clear that Libya will accept the American proposal, although it is close to an alternative the Libyans had proposed.
The plan to hold a trial in The Hague, but under Scottish law and presided over by Scottish judges, was floated by the United States and Britain a month ago. It represents a turnaround for the Administration, which had previously said that the Libyans would have to be tried either in the United States or in Scotland for the December 1988 bombing, which killed 259 people on the plane and 11 others on the ground.
American officials said the proposal seemed a reasonable compromise. The Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, has been campaigning to lift the United Nations economic sanctions imposed on Tripoli because of its refusal to hand over the two men, both Libyan intelligence agents, for trial. Colonel Qaddafi has proposed that the men be tried under Scottish law, though not in Scotland, by a panel of international judges, and he wants sanctions lifted once a trial begins.
American officials insisted today that the idea of Scottish judges in a trial under Scottish rules was "non-negotiable," and said holding it in The Hague mattered less. The proposal would call Colonel Qaddafi's bluff, another official said, and if he refused, sanctions would remain.
But the relatives of some victims expressed concern that the Administration would weaken its conditions. Susan and Daniel Cohen of Cape May Court House, N.J., whose only child, Theodora, then 20, died in the bombing, oppose a compromise and said that they were skeptical that the Administration would keep its word.
"This compromise is a slippery slope," Mr. Cohen said today, "and any terrorist could now say, 'I don't want to be tried in the U.S., I want to be tried in Bosnia' or wherever."
Mrs. Cohen said that with British corporate pressure high to resume business with Libya, "I have the terrible feeling we're being hustled here" and that sanctions will be lifted prematurely.
"Too much is being made of these two individuals, and not enough is made of the fact that they are part of a government apparatus in Libya," Mrs. Cohen said. "Berger and Albright told us personally that we can't move unilaterally against a terrorist country like Libya, that we need international support. But they just did it in Afghanistan and Sudan, which just makes this all more bizarre."
An Administration official said the proposal had found support within the Organization for African Unity and the Arab League, and that Washington would press them to go public and urge Libya to comply.

HEADLINE: Ministers Call for Prayer After Clinton Admission

 BODY:
President Clinton's acknowledgment of an inappropriate relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky was a focus of sermons in churches around the nation yesterday. Following are excerpts from several sermons, as recorded and transcribed by The New York Times.
 
'We Are Not Quite Sure Where It Will Take Us'
The Rev. Richard Manzelmann
Cornwall Congregational Church
Cornwall, Vt.
There were some sad and revealing confessions by the President of these United States. Some may be glad, I suppose, but others may well be a bit shaken by it. I don't suppose we were really very surprised by these confessions, but had hoped against hope that it wasn't so. And we are not quite sure where it will take us. . . . 
 There are texts about forgiveness which some may want to think about. And there are texts which bring it home to us as well. Paul says quite clearly, "We all fall short." . . .
And Jesus, who never wants us to be too hasty with our judgments, said, "Do not judge so that you may not be judged yourself. For with the judgment you make you will be judged, and the measure you give may be the measure you get." The words may sting a bit. Well, He makes it come home, doesn't He? Not just there, but here. It's endless. It makes us mad. It makes us sad. We are tired of it. Let us get on with our life together. There are other, more frightening things to worry about.
 
'Whatever the Loss,' There Can Be an End to Grieving
The Rev. Hardy S. Clemons
First Baptist Church
Greenville, S.C.
The sermon was based on I Samuel 16:1-3, in which Samuel anoints David to lead Israel after rejecting many other men deemed unsuitable.
Sometimes we never know the answer to our grief will take until we've gone all the way through the valley and the shadow of death, but for Samuel in this case, he did find an answer to the grief that was debilitating him.
Of course, we are aware that Israel is not the only nation that has grieved over a tall, handsome, brilliant, powerful leader and his struggles with character and sin. We know something about that kind of national grief as well.
I cannot speak for you. I can tell you about my hurt, my anger, my sorrow, my incredulous unbelief at what we have experienced in these last days, but I'm not here to talk about that situation, I'm here to say that whatever the loss that occasions grief, there can be an end to grieving. This is our hope as believers. . . .
If grief is ever going to end it will end when you learn you've got to do it badly before you do it well. I think we see that to some extent with Mr. Clinton this week. All sorts of reactions have come forward about what he should have said and what he shouldn't have said. I would love to have been a consultant to him in the writing of that speech. I believe I could have helped him if he would have let me.
But I also came away from that speech with a genuine respect for a man who will get up, having looked the nation in the eye and lied, who looked in our eyes and said, "What I did was not only inappropriate, it was wrong." And if he didn't do it to my satisfaction, I don't think that's as important as that he did do it.
And I would invite you to apply that to whatever grief you may be struggling with in your own experience, related to illness, related to death, related to some other disappointment or loss. It is very important to do it badly in order to learn to do it well. Grief will last long enough for us to learn that.
 
'Not Judging,' Yet Seeing 'A Very Painful Truth'
The Very Rev. Nathan D. Baxter
Washington National Cathedral
We may yet have legitimate suspicions about the political motive of the endless investigations. However, we can no longer deny that the haunting shadows we have dreaded are indeed much more the sad reflections of a soul we would love, than the projections of a partisan body politic which would assault it. . . .
Now Jesus taught, "Judge not that ye be not judged." And I know all too well the truth in St. Paul's words where he says "that all have sinned, you and I, and fallen short of God's glory." But this is not judging, it is acknowledging a very painful truth. I still believe Mr. Clinton loves his country and I know that he loves his family, and I know that he loves his God. And I know that God loves him. But our desire to keep sin private or ignore immorality is a judgment upon all of us. Unless we acknowledge moral failing -- without excuse -- the soul of our nation will not heal. I believe, more importantly, our children will be even more confused as to whether the truest treasure of our common life as a nation is found in the state of the economy or the character of our moral integrity. . . .
I still believe that there is a social agreement in human society, among the children of Eve and Adam. A standard which is often abused but is still the barometer of our moral life, and that is modesty. We do expect, including in our sexual matters, responsible behavior, self-control and respect for the sensitivities of others. People of faith understand that this commitment is not just moral but it is also holy -- it is blessed of God. Responsibility, self-control and respect. This is modesty, our moral contract as a community.
The contract of modesty belongs in business, it belongs in religion, it belongs in law, and in the social sector, just as it does in politics. But we often wink at its abuse in politics because we say politics is about the negotiating of power, and therefore we believe that politics by nature is dirty work. But I know some very fine politicians, and they remind me that politics is also about stewardship. It is about the stewardship of values.
Ultimately what should make us respect leaders in a democracy is not simply intelligence, or charisma, or competence with power, ideology or any professional skill or native gift. The most important characteristic of leadership in a democracy is the ability to demonstrate accountable character, morally accountable character. Ultimately, the real power of politics is moral.
 
'It Is Appropriate for Us To Come Together in Prayer'
Dr. J. Kie Bowman
Hyde Park Baptist Church
Austin, Tex.
This has been an interesting week, a challenging time in our country. Our President is involved in a personal scandal that could end up disgracing the personal office of the President. This puts us at risk as a nation. Therefore it is appropriate for us to come together in prayer.
As de Tocqueville told us, America is great because America is good. And he said that America will only continue to be great only as long as it is good. Today, we need to pray for this nation. . . .
Lord, we lift our President before you today. As I Timothy Chapter 2 tells us, we are to pray for our leaders. So Lord, I lift the President of our country before you. Give him moral courage and give him wisdom.

HEADLINE: SHAKE-UP IN RUSSIA: THE U.S. REACTION;
Despite Confusion, Clinton Will Keep Date With Yeltsin

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Senior Clinton Administration officials said today that they were troubled by President Boris N. Yeltsin's decision to dismiss his reformist Cabinet so close to the summit meeting with President Clinton next week in Moscow. But a spokesman said Mr. Clinton had decided to go ahead with his trip.
Officials acknowledged that they were taken by surprise by the move, which also reinstated the former Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. Five months ago, Mr. Yeltsin dismissed Mr. Chernomyrdin without warning and installed the young Sergei V. Kiriyenko as Prime Minister with a Cabinet of economic reformers with no evident political constituency. 
 "This won't affect the trip or the timing of the summit at all," said P. J. Crowley, a White House spokesman. "We have important bilateral issues. This is an internal Russian matter and we obviously will watch it closely. We will continue to work with the Russian Government to advance the reform agenda. What faces Acting Prime Minister Chernomyrdin is the need to take effective steps to address Russia's economic difficulties."
Asked whether Mr. Yeltsin's action raised doubts about his control and stability, one official said, "It depends on your starting point." Senior officials say that Mr. Yeltsin has "his ups and downs," and that he has never regained the stamina and focus he displayed before his heart attack at the end of the 1996 presidential campaign.
"He can get up for a big meeting or telephone call with Clinton," one official said. "But it's not clear he can work for more than a few hours at a time."
While Mr. Clinton did not try to reach Mr. Yeltsin today by telephone, Vice President Al Gore spoke with both Mr. Kiriyenko and Mr. Chernomyrdin, who is closer to Mr. Gore than to any other American official. Mr. Gore tried to gauge the political climate before Mr. Clinton arrives in Moscow on Sept. 1, and to ask how Washington can help calm markets.
"Gore's purpose was to urge a continuation of the policies of economic reform," a senior White House official said. "Chernomyrdin has demonstrated in the past that he's more of a reformer than many people thought, and he has a lot more support in the Duma," the Russian Parliament, which has been blocking reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund.
The official said it was inappropriate for Mr. Gore to raise the question of postponing the summit talks. Another official said, "It would be a great mistake for us to pull the plug."
But some prominent and experienced voices outside the Government urged postponement and expressed concern over the apparent American policy of supporting Mr. Yeltsin no matter what he does.
Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser for President Jimmy Carter, called on Mr. Clinton to postpone the talks for a month or more.
"There is no point for a bleeding President to be visiting a sick and unstable President," Mr. Brzezinski said in an interview. "I think a postponement would be very good for both sides. Under the circumstances it will be very difficult for Clinton to concentrate on long-range issues, and they need to be discussed by leaders able to make their policies stick. Right now it will be a summit of posturing and pretense on both sides. And the United States and Russia need serious, useful summits."
Mr. Brzezinski said it was clear that Mr. Yeltsin "is passing from the scene," and he urged the Administration to "reach out and establish a dialogue with other leaders," including Moscow's Mayor, Yuri Luzhkov; the former general Aleksandr Lebed, now a governor in Siberia; the economic reformer and Yeltsin critic Grigory Yavlinsky, and the Communist Party leader, Gennadi Zyuganov.
"We ought to very clearly and deliberately get off the 'My dear friend, Boris' kick," Mr. Brzezinski said. "Yeltsin governs at most a perimeter of 30 kilometers outside Moscow, and even that is not under his full control."
American officials said that Mr. Clinton plans to meet opposition and Parliament leaders on Sept. 2 in Moscow, and that all the men Mr. Brzezinski named were invited.
The return of Mr. Chernomyrdin, Mr. Brzezinski said, "begins to turn a tragic situation into a farce." Mr. Chernomyrdin's return had been pressed on Mr. Yeltsin for some time by the Russian economic oligarchy, in particular by Boris Berezovsky, who once served as Mr. Yeltsin's national security adviser.
The oligarchs stand to lose a lot of money because of the devaluation of the ruble last week -- which Mr. Yeltsin insisted would never happen and which Mr. Kiriyenko carried out anyway. "We now have what we might call a provisional oligarchical Government," Mr. Brzezinski said.
Anders Aslund, a former economic adviser to the Russian Government and now with the Carnegie Endowment, described the Yeltsin move as a disaster.
"It means Yeltsin is finished, it makes him look like a puppet, and Russians can't stand weak leaders," Mr. Aslund said. "This really puts Clinton in an awful situation. You don't want to go to a country where there is so much uncertainty in the Government."
The reversion to the stolid Mr. Chernomyrdin will not please the markets, Mr. Aslund said. "Chernomyrdin is the man who ran Russia into its big economic troubles, and the oligarchs are very happy to have him back," he said. "It won't provide confidence to the markets."
A senior American official said market confidence was Mr. Gore's theme with Mr. Chernomyrdin, especially with key Parliament sessions coming. "We'll find out this week if the shift of authority leads to any noteworthy changes of emphasis in the Russian economic plan and in the level of support the Duma is willing to provide," the official said. "The market reaction will be very significant."
Dimitri Simes, president of the Nixon Center, a Washington-based think tank, said Mr. Kiriyenko's Government was too narrow and too liberal, "uninterested in dialogue with the Duma and contemptuous of public opinion and attitudes."
Mr. Chernomyrdin, for all his faults, has demonstrated his support among foreign investors and in the Parliament, where he controls the second-largest faction, Mr. Simes said.
In general the Clinton Administration seemed to fumble for a response this August Sunday, with the President at Martha's Vineyard, some top advisers at the beach and others at home in Washington trying to recover from a stressful week.
The national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger; Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, and Defense Secretary William S. Cohen were all on Sunday talk shows, but their interviews had been taped before the news came out of Russia.
Until this latest shock from Moscow, senior Administration officials were minimizing the risks to Mr. Yeltsin and his Government of the economic upheavals, which officials attributed largely to the Asian crisis and the softness of oil prices.
Still, senior Treasury officials were not prepared to provide Russia any more money after the failure of the last I.M.F. loan package of only a month ago, which sent $4.8 billion to Moscow as part of a $22.6 billion package.
And senior State Department and White House officials were very angry with Mr. Yeltsin's sharply critical comments after the American missile strikes last week against targets in Afghanistan and the Sudan. Mr. Yeltsin, perhaps for domestic advantage, was harsh in his reactions, criticizing Washington for not consulting him and not working through the United Nations Security Council.
To American leaders who felt they were acting with urgency to protect more American lives, Mr. Yeltsin's comments were "offensive," one official said, "and went over very badly around here."

HEADLINE: How Routine Parade Application Set Off Harlem Political Tempest

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
In late January, New York City received two applications from a nonprofit organization in Washington seeking permission to stage a "First Amendment Educational Event."
In one sense, the applications were routine if somewhat unclear, representing only two of the tens of thousands of requests that the city receives every year for block parties, parades and street fairs. In another sense, the two pieces of paper were the bureaucratic equivalent to kindling; in the months to come, they would pit an out-of-town black nationalist who spouts anti-Semitism with a smile against an outspoken white mayor with few ties to the city's black leadership. 
 Now, Khalid Abdul Muhammad -- best known for his anti-white diatribes -- has charged in a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan that the discriminatory policies of the Giuliani administration prompted it to deny his application for a Million Youth March in Harlem on Sept. 5, the Saturday of the hectic Labor Day weekend.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, meanwhile, has alternated between keeping his counsel and denouncing the event as a poorly planned "hate march" that his aides expect will take place in some form, permit or no permit.
Caught in the middle of this race-tinged quarrel is the community of Harlem, whose leaders are now bracing for an event that several of them never wanted. Some criticize Mr. Muhammad for promoting an event that couples, however subtly, the instructive message of black-youth empowerment with destructive messages of intolerance. They also say that for all his talk of black unity, he was woefully late in sharing his plans with most of Harlem.
"Let me get this straight," said Bill Perkins, the City Council member from Harlem. "You're going to have a party in my house and you don't even tell me about it?"
At the same time, several leaders say Mr. Giuliani has used harsh, simplistic language to describe an event that also stresses pride among blacks and loving guidance for their young. The Mayor can afford to generalize, they say, because most of his political support comes from whites and conservatives, far from the streets of Harlem.
These leaders say many people may participate in anti-Giuliani protest rather than in pro-Muhammad support. After all, they argue, Mr. Muhammad has neither the appeal nor the money to stage a significant event -- especially when another, better-organized event for the country's black youths is being held in Atlanta on the same weekend.
"I can't think of any individual who has been more deliberately destructive than Khalid Muhammad, but what separates him from just being a racist is that his statements are all calculated to evoke a reaction," said David A. Paterson, the State Senator from Harlem. "And he tried to use inflammatory language to dupe Mayor Giuliani into attacking him. And since Giuliani is an unpopular person in the African-American community, he then comes back to the community and plays himself off as a martyr, an Adam Powell who is being attacked, or a Malcolm X. He disguises himself as the current-day Adam or Malcolm, when in fact he's a cheap carbon copy."
In the end, Mr. Paterson said, the Mayor "gave the marchers what they wanted."
In dismissing such opinions as "absurd" on Saturday, Mr. Giuliani used the very language that makes some Harlem leaders cringe. "We either had to just ignore it and pretend that a person who has engaged in the worst kind of rhetoric about Jews, about whites, about Catholics, about the Pope -- that he should be allowed to carry a banner leading a lot of children. Or we could say something about it, which we did."
Mr. Giuliani's aides leave the First Amendment implications of blocking the march to be discussed in court, with the next hearing scheduled for Wednesday. But they maintain that the administration has wisely handled one of the most delicate and potentially volatile predicaments that a municipality can face.
As for the Mayor's occasional comments, Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington said New York City was more than just Harlem; there are Jews, Roman Catholics, gay men and lesbians -- all concerned with the message of Khalid Muhammad.
"They want to know that the leader of this city is focused," he said. "They want to hear what he's thinking."
At first, no one knew what to think, in part because Mr. Muhammad's plans kept changing. In the applications filed in January, his aides requested the date of Sept. 19, not Sept. 5; they now say they want to reach young people before schools and colleges reopen. One request asked for Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn; the other asked for Malcolm X Boulevard in Harlem. In a third request, to the Parks Department, organizers had also asked for Central Park, Randalls Island "or street."
If Mr. Muhammad's intentions were unclear, his history was not. The man behind the applications is so virulent in his anti-Semitic, anti-white speeches that he managed to annoy Louis Farrakhan, the minister of the Nation of Islam who has also been known to make anti-Semitic remarks. Since being ousted from the Nation of Islam hierarchy in 1994, Mr. Muhammad has become a college-campus attraction who commonly refers to Jews as "bloodsuckers" and "hook-nosed."
According to Mr. Washington, the Deputy Mayor for Community Development and Business Services, the discussions between the city and the organizers began poorly and got worse.
At first, Mr. Muhammad wanted to stage the event on Fifth Avenue, and then on Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn -- both of which the city refused. The city countered with Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx or Randalls Island, on Sept. 19 -- all of which the organizers refused.
In late May or early June, Mr. Muhammad told the city that the march would take place in Harlem over the Labor Day weekend. City officials explained that more than 100 permits had already been granted for activities in Harlem for that weekend, that the days-before-school sales of local businesses would be disrupted, that the police for the holiday weekend were already taxed.
"Basically, he tells us what he's going to do," Mr. Washington recalled, "against the will of the city, without permits." He added, "They virtually hijacked the community."
Malik Shabazz, a lawyer from Washington and a close aide of Mr. Muhammad's, said the organizers had become frustrated with what they perceived to be an institutional thwarting of their rights to free speech. "Essentially, they were trying to derail the process," he said.
By early July, Harlem's leaders had learned that an event called the Million Youth March was probably coming to their neighborhood. They also learned that both the city and the organizers had been discussing this possibility for weeks. Mr. Paterson and Mr. Perkins were among those not placated by a visit from an emissary of the Mayor's -- in this case, Mr. Washington -- to explain the situation.
"Some of us felt that they're calling on us to deal with this, but when we have other issues -- youth issues or other concerns -- we don't get the calls back," Mr. Perkins said. "But overriding that was the sense of responsibility that this was taking place in our neighborhood. And regardless of the poor behavior of the Mayor, we had a responsibility to deal with it."
Mr. Washington dismissed those concerns, saying that notification a few days earlier would not have changed the dynamics. And there was another factor. "The Giuliani administration doesn't negotiate by consensus," he said. "They're legislators. They don't run programs, they don't operate the city, with all due respect to them. Never do we call people and ask for their advice and tell us what to do."
Mr. Paterson said that attitude was both typical and self-defeating. "No one is denying that he's excellent in lowering the crime rate and being the catalyst for business and economic development," he said of the Mayor. "Black people are affected by that too. But he comes to the table with such a negative understanding of how black people feel: 'They're not going to support me, so I'm not going to pay attention to their concerns.' "
Mr. Paterson and others say most of Harlem learned of the planned event not from its organizers but from news reports of the increasingly antagonistic quarrel between Mr. Muhammad and Mr. Giuliani.
Mr. Muhammad seized the media attention to share a view of a world that he sees as dominated by Jews -- New York is a "Jewish-controlled city," for example -- and to issue thinly veiled threats of what might happen if the city did not relent, threats that seemed to contradict his purported message of nonviolence. He reminisced about bringing 50 armed followers to a Ku Klux Klan rally in Jasper, Tex., in June, and threatened to lead an angry march, including gang members, through the Jewish neighborhood of Crown Heights in Brooklyn.
"We have radical revolutionary youth who will be coming here," he said, "who will be quite ready and quite prepared in the numbers of hundreds and thousands and millions to fight this devil in the streets."
Mr. Giuliani called Mr. Muhammad a hatemonger -- correctly, Mr. Paterson said. But he said Mr. Giuliani had coupled that condemnation with the denial of the march permit, allowing critics to contend that the strong-willed Mayor was violating constitutional rights to block yet another message he found offensive.
Then last week, a critic from the Mayor's past surfaced to further complicate a tense situation. The Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, a prominent Baptist minister who was criticized earlier this year for calling Mr. Giuliani a racist, expressed his support for the march, but not for Mr. Muhammad. The Mayor, who had previously allowed aides to speak for him in denouncing the minister's racism charge, now seized the opportunity to respond.
"You may have forgotten, but I don't, the hate language he used in reference to me," Mr. Giuliani said last Thursday. "So I would expect that he would naturally gravitate toward a march that engages in this kind of hate rhetoric against Jews, against other people."
Mr. Paterson, Mr. Perkins, and others in Harlem saw the Mayor's remarks as gratuitous and inflammatory. Mr. Perkins said he immediately told Deputy Mayor Washington to deliver a message: "Tell him to please shut up. Now, you put it to him the way you think appropriate."
It is not known where this fight over the rights to a Saturday in Harlem will lead. Although most agree that a Million Youth March would not attract a million people -- organizers predict about 150,000, while city officials expect a much smaller number -- there remain many questions.
If Mr. Muhammad receives a permit, does he have the money to pay for the insurance, portable toilets, security details and other costs of holding a street event? Will the entertainers being touted as participants actually attend? If he marches without a permit, how many will join him? How will the city respond? And, last, could the city have better handled this challenge?
Charles B. Rangel, the Harlem Congressman and an early critic of Mr. Muhammad, declined to respond to the last question. He said his time and thoughts would be better spent on joining others in preparing Harlem for the unknown.
"It's a very sensitive thing," he said.

HEADLINE: Shift in Politics And Economics Seen for Hawaii

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: HONOLULU, Aug. 23

 BODY:
For the last seven years, Hawaii has felt the winds of economic change blowing only one way across the Pacific Ocean.
While most of the country has prospered, enjoying job growth, state budget surpluses and contented citizenry -- all to the benefit of many political incumbents facing re-election this year -- Hawaii remains a stubborn exception. 
 Here, despite the spectacular vistas of ocean, mountains and lava fields that make tourism the backbone of the state economy, turmoil in Asian financial markets has rocked the islands like an unrelenting hurricane, causing a sharp decline in investment, minimal growth in tourism, job loss and public pessimism. Hawaii's annual economic growth rate in recent years, half of a percent, pales beside a national rate that has reached as high as 3.9 percent.
In recent weeks, economists have detected slight indications that the worst may have passed and that Hawaii could finally be turning a corner -- much to the relief of Gov. Benjamin J. Cayetano, the latest in an unbroken line of Democratic governors since Hawaii joined the union in 1959. Upon his election in 1994, he inherited the worst fiscal crisis in state history, and now that the budget has been balanced for two years, he is trumpeting his policies as a reason to re-elect him in November.
But Mr. Cayetano, the nation's first Filipino-American Governor, may yet become just another victim of the Asian crisis.
As if the stars over Hawaii's sparkling beaches and pristine waters have suddenly realigned, a Republican, Mayor Linda Lingle of Maui, is favored to defeat him in November, according to the latest statewide polls. How startling is that? Among the 76 members of the State Legislature, only 14 are Republicans, and across Hawaii, Republicans are outnumbered by such a wide margin that some say they are embarrassed or reluctant to admit their affiliation.
Nonetheless, the enduring sluggishness of the economy seems to be pushing many people beyond a point where party loyalty determines their vote, and after four decades of Democratic rule, the state's 1.2 million people might finally be in for a change.
"There is a growing sense here that Hawaii has become a little like the old Soviet Union or North Korea with its centralized, absolute power," said Randy Roth, a law professor at the University of Hawaii on the island of Oahu and president-elect of the state bar association. "Monopoly of political power has cut off all debate, and that has evolved into the political culture."
Mr. Roth, whose nonpartisanship allowed him to moderate a local radio talk show for five years, became so impressed with Ms. Lingle that he abandoned his neutrality last week to join the campaign as a volunteer.
Economic policy and one-party rule were never major concerns in Hawaii until the collapse of the Japanese yen in the early 1990's ended years of heavy investment by Japanese banks. The economic activity had become so frenetic and dazzling that Cayetano officials now concede that it stunted any creative planning by the previous administration of Gov. John D. Waihee 3d.
"This was a boom period, and government wanted to stay in control," said Seija Naya, a former bank economist who is director of the state's Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism. "They added more regulations, charged more fees and made it harder for businesses to receive approvals."
The Japanese investors barely noticed. Then the bubble burst, and recession set in. Since 1991, many hotels and businesses built with Japanese money have sold for a fraction of their original cost. And no longer do Asian investors knock on the doors of fancy homes and offer the owner $1 million or more to sell on the spot.
The Asian withdrawal overshadowed other disturbing developments. Production of sugar and pineapple, once staples of the state economy, has been falling for decades as the Philippines and Caribbean nations produce them more cheaply. Only a few plantations are still operating, and the number of agricultural jobs in the state decreased by 36 percent, to 7,200 last year from 11,300 in 1982.
The Federal Government also hurt the state economy, largely through the reduction of personnel at the state's military bases. In 1996, the number of Federal employees in Hawaii fell by almost a quarter, to 74,119, from a high of 97,853 in 1988.
Mr. Cayetano, 57, a lawyer and former state legislator, has worked hard to blunt the impact of the Asian crisis. In an interview at the Capitol last week, he recited a long list of accomplishments, saying he has reduced the size of government by 500 people, cut the state's personal income tax for the first time, increased spending on marketing to attract visitors to islands other than Oahu, and created novel incentives like eliminating landing fees for airlines to attract new carriers to the state.
"We have made some hard decisions that have hurt us politically," he said. "But that's the way it is."
Ever so slowly, his policies are beginning to help nudge the state forward again. Tourism from the mainland is rebounding, compensating for Asian visitors who are staying fewer days and spending fewer dollars. Unemployment is starting to drop. New small businesses are opening. An embryonic high-technology industry is emerging.
But those changes have done little to dampen growing support for Ms. Lingle, who is attracting people in both parties who say Mr. Cayetano and the Legislature have done too little too late to make any meaningful recovery possible.
Ms. Lingle, 44, a native of St. Louis who came to Hawaii in 1976 as a journalist, has served as Maui's Mayor the last eight years. She is facing a former Mayor of Honolulu, Frank F. Fasi, in the Sept. 19 primary. But Mr. Fasi, 77, a native of Hartford and a frequent candidate for Governor who has run as a Democrat, a Republican and as leader of his self-created Best Party, is not viewed as a serious threat.
In part because her island is favored as a vacation spot more by Americans than Japanese, Maui has resisted much of Hawaii's economic downturn. The number of jobs on Maui has increased in five of the last six years, enabling Ms. Lingle to sharpen her attack on Democratic policies that have not done more to help the state economy. She has outlined a five-point revitalization strategy, which includes a comprehensive plan to diversify the economy and simplify business regulations.
"This is a turning point in our history," she told a rally of 600 voters this week in the middle-class suburbs of east Honolulu. "It's time for a change, and change is about joining the other 49 states with economic revitalization that is taking place all across the country."
Though few of Ms. Lingle's ideas are radically different from Mr. Cayetano's, she has nonetheless caught a wave of voter disenchantment, emerging at a time when many Hawaiians are receptive to the idea of change if only for change's sake.
Ms. Lingle has also captured the attention of leading Republicans on the mainland. Just last week, she flew to New York City for a fund-raiser with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani that she said had brought her $100,000 in campaign contributions.
"I'm intrigued by her," said Calvin Griffin, the owner of a small tent manufacturing company here on Oahu who described himself as an independent voter and frustrated over policies that have caused him to subcontract work to California and Mexico, rather than employ Hawaiians. He said he had come to the rally to hear more of Ms. Lingle's ideas.
"I could create 50 to 100 more jobs, but I've had to cut back because of restrictive regulations," Mr. Griffin said. "I think it's because of the good old boy network here. It's not what you know. It's who you know."
Mr. Cayetano argued that his administration was taking steps to eliminate the red tape that frustrates small business owners like Mr. Griffin. He also said that any Governor would have been stymied by the dramatic drop in foreign investment that Hawaii experienced, to less than $500 million in 1994 from $3.6 billion in 1990.
Though conceding that the state must do a better job finding new jobs and revenues to ease the reliance on tourism as the major economic engine, Mr. Cayetano said many voters had ignored the accomplishments of his administration and failed to see the nascent signs of recovery.
But he also acknowledged that convincing voters that the state is finally on the right track could be a daunting challenge this year. "There is a big mood for change here," Mr. Cayetano said, referring to Ms. Lingle. "She is the favorite to win the Republican primary. She is a good speaker, and she has painted herself as a fresh face on the screen. But we have planted the seeds so we can diversify the economy. And finally we are seeing some positive signs."

YELTSIN DISMISSES AIDES PUSHING ECONOMIC REFORM
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia dismissed his new team of economic reformers and reinstalled Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as Prime Minister, just five months after he derided Mr. Chernomyrdin as a spent force and cast him out of the Government. Mr. Yeltsin offered no explanation for his decision, which raised fresh doubts about the Kremlin's commitment to tough economic reforms and unsettling questions about President Yeltsin's ability to govern. A1
 
Senior Clinton Administration officials said they were troubled by President Yeltsin's decision, taken so close to a summit meeting between the two leaders scheduled for next week in Moscow. But a spokesman said that Mr. Clinton had decided to go ahead with his trip. Officials acknowledged that the move had caught them by surprise. A9 

Using Mountains as Defense
The mountains of Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is accused of setting up terrorist camps, have long provided a formidable defense to attack. The Soviet Union tried and failed to destroy the camps in the 1980's. Although American officials claimed "moderate to heavy" damage after hitting them with cruise missiles, it is uncertain that the United States can do much better. A1
 
Hassan al-Turabi, the driving force of Sudan's Islamic government, said he believed that Osama bin Laden would try to retaliate against the United States. The Sudan also persisted in its assertion that the plant destroyed by American missiles in its capital, Khartoum, was not capable of making a precursor for nerve gas. A6
 
A welter of reports about new suspects and leads for the investigation into the bombing of the United States Embassy in Kenya have appeared in Kenyan newspapers, all unconfirmed, some tantalizing, some patently untrue, while the F.B.I. has kept a tight lid on information. A6
 
Setback for Congo Rebels
Government soldiers and their allies in Congo recaptured a critical military base near the Atlantic coast, greatly reducing the possibility that rebel forces could march into the capital. But the rebels appeared to have seized Kisangani, the country's third-largest city, solidifying their positions in the east. The developments raised the possibility of a protracted war in which the Government and the rebels would fight each other from entrenched positions. A1
 
Details on Sudan Attack
Facing questions about the missile attack on a pharmaceutical plant in the Sudan, the Clinton Administration sought to justify the strike by offering details linking the factory to the production of chemical weapons. Two Administration officials said that before the strike last week, the United States had obtained a sample of a chemical used in making VX, a deadly nerve agent. A6

For Hawaii's Voters, It's the Economy
Despite recent indications that the worst may have passed for Hawaii's economy, its Governor may still become a victim of the Asian financial crisis that has rocked the islands. Gov. Benjamin J. Cayetano is the latest in an unbroken line of Democratic governors since Hawaii joined the union in 1959, but polls show that a Republican is favored to defeat him in November. A1
 
White House Strategy Struggle
On the day in January that the accusations about Monica S. Lewinsky and the President became public, one set of advisers -- the lawyers -- wanted Mr. Clinton to be vague in his public responses and by no means say the word "sexual." The other set -- the political team -- pressed for early candor. The fight over strategy reflects the ongoing tension inside the White House and inside the President. A13
 
Federal officials who hoped the President's speech last week would end months of distractions forced by the Lewinsky matter found themselves disappointed. They now face fallout that threatens not just Mr. Clinton's legacy, many said, but his Administration's muscle as well. A13
 
A Mother's Campaign
Yolanda Manuel has become the spiritual leader of what she calls a campaign for justice to pressure the authorities into bringing charges against a college student who saw at least the initial stages of a sexual assault and strangulation of her 7-year-old daughter last year, but did not go for help.

Harlem the Battleground In Dispute Over March
The community of Harlem is caught in the middle of a race-tinged quarrel between a black nationalist, Khalid Abdul Muhammad, and the Giuliani administration. Mr. Muhammad, best known for his anti-white diatribes, has charged in a lawsuit filed in Federal court that the discriminatory policies of the Giuliani administration prompted it to deny his application for a Million Youth March in Harlem on Sept. 5. The Mayor has alternated between keeping his counsel and denouncing the event as a poorly planned "hate march." A1
 
Keeping Track of Health
New York City Transit is revamping what officials have conceded is a flawed system for tracking its employees' health, after reviewing medical files of its 16,000 workers in the wake of a fatal crash last year caused by a chronically ill bus driver who had a seizure. The record-keeping system is being computerized, among other measures. B1

HEADLINE: In Brooklyn, Same Cast in New Race

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Four years ago, Javier A. Nieves was a young, first-term State Assemblyman widely described in political circles as one of Brooklyn's bright, up-and-coming legislators. But the years since then, at least in political terms, have not been particularly kind to him.
In 1994, Mr. Nieves was defeated in his first re-election campaign, losing by 79 votes. A year ago, he tried to run for a City Council seat, but his nominating petitions were challenged and he was removed from the ballot in the Democratic primary. 
 This year, Mr. Nieves, 40, is running again for the Democratic nomination for his old Assembly seat, vying to represent a district in Brooklyn that meanders from Park Slope to Bay Ridge, with its anchor in Sunset Park. In a race laced with bitterness that has lingered for four years, Mr. Nieves is facing the man who defeated him, Assemblyman Felix W. Ortiz.
While Mr. Nieves, an architect, has considerable name recognition within the 51st Assembly District and has put together a large network of campaign volunteers, all of that muscle is apparently being matched by Mr. Ortiz, 38, who in the last four years has garnered support from a wide array of politicians in and near the district.
Mr. Nieves's strategy is to portray Mr. Ortiz as a lackluster Assemblyman who has done little to bring new jobs to a community that has more than its share of unemployed residents.
"This is an area with significant unemployment," Mr. Nieves said. "And this is an area where our schools are not performing nearly as well as they should. We don't hear anything from the incumbent Assemblyman on these issues."
He suggests that he would be more attentive than Mr. Ortiz to the district's constituents. "I would devote myself more effectively to economic development and in helping to create jobs," he said.
Mr. Nieves insists that, although he has neither money nor the support of elected officials, his continued work in community organizations and his two-year stint in the Assembly have made him as well known as Mr. Ortiz. Also, he said, he has put together a political network of workers in the district who will undertake a strong effort to get voters to the polls in the Sept. 15 primary.
"The way I'm going to win this race is through pullout," Mr. Nieves said, standing beside a parking meter on bustling Fifth Avenue one morning last week. He said he considers it an achievement to have made it on the ballot, explaining that the Democratic Party organization in Brooklyn had challenged his petitions in court, a step frequently taken to keep insurgents off the ballot.
"I've survived and overcome the first hurdle," he said. "They didn't expect me to make it on the ballot. But now, I've got my people, my volunteers ready to get people to the polls. I lost by 79 votes four years ago. That's not going to happen again this time. We're determined to win this time."
That may well prove more difficult this year, however. Since his election to the Assembly, Mr. Ortiz has himself assembled a formidable network of political volunteers. Last year, Mr. Ortiz oversaw the successful campaign of his friend and political confidant, Angel Rodriguez, who ran successfully in a crowded Democratic primary for a City Council seat. The volunteers are being called out in full force this year.
Unlike 1994, Mr. Ortiz's campaign is enjoying the strong support of the Brooklyn Democratic organization and its chairman, Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr., as well as the support of some unions.
"In 1994, I had no union support, no political endorsements, and I still managed to get elected," Mr. Ortiz said. "I will do this year what I did then: put together a grass-roots campaign. I am knocking on doors and meeting people at the subways. The hard work will pay off."
In a recent discussion of the campaign, Mr. Ortiz barely talked about his opponent, whom he never mentioned by name. Instead, he talked about several of his initiatives. For example, he discussed committees that his office had established to study the needs of immigrants coming into the district.
"I try to focus on what my constituents need," Mr. Ortiz said. "I prefer to think of myself as a public servant, instead of a politician."
And he talked about his efforts to provide more stringent monitoring of some manufacturing conditions through legislation, saying there were sweatshops in his district where working conditions need to be improved.
The 51st Assembly District was redrawn in 1992 to increase Hispanic voting strength. It includes largely Hispanic sections and parts of the growing Asian population in Sunset Park. In the 1990 census, the district was about 60 percent Hispanic, 21 percent white, 11 percent black and 8 percent Asian. Demographers say that the number of Hispanic and Asian residents has increased steadily since then.
Several Democratic officials in Brooklyn suggested that Mr. Nieves faced a decidedly uphill struggle. While he was considered an effective legislator in his single term and became vice chairman of the Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus, he nonetheless developed a reputation for being aloof.
Mr. Norman, the Brooklyn Democratic leader, said the party organization was putting some of its financial and organizational resources at Mr. Ortiz's disposal.
"He has done a great job, and we're very committed to helping him," Mr. Norman said. In the meantime, Mr. Nieves has sought the support of some of Mr. Norman's political opponents, namely United States Representatives Edolphus Towns and Nydia M. Velazquez, both of Brooklyn. But neither has made an endorsement.
Neither Assembly candidate has raised much money for the campaign, and no debates are scheduled, so the race is most likely to be played out on the streets of the district.
"This is our first time going one-on-one against each other," Mr. Nieves said. "And this is going to be a campaign that will be won by the candidate who does the best job getting people to the polls."

HEADLINE: Harry Lunn Jr., 65, Art Dealer Who Championed Photography

BYLINE: By MARGARETT LOKE 

 BODY:
Harry H. Lunn Jr., the international art dealer who played a major role in creating a fine-art photography market that has seen canonical vintage prints sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars, died on Friday in Paris, where he had a home.
A week earlier, while preparing to board a train to his country house in Normandy, Mr. Lunn had a heart attack and lapsed into a coma, said Clark Worswick, a friend. He was 65. 
 Until Mr. Lunn marketed photographs on an unprecedented grand scale -- with big inventories, slick catalogues and sales on several continents -- few thought photographs would sell to the public.
During the first two decades of this century, Alfred Stieglitz's gallery 291 was much more a showcase for modern art than it was a photography gallery. In the 1930's and 40's, Julien Levy showed photographs at his New York art gallery, but there was no market for them. In the 1950's, Helen Gee's Greenwich Village coffeehouse, Limelight, had a photographic gallery at the back that exhibited the work of masters like Paul Strand, Robert Frank and Imogene Cunningham. But even when pictures were about $15 each, only a few sold.
In 1970, when Mr. Lunn became interested in photography, only one gallery in the United States -- opened by Lee Witkin in Manhattan in 1969 -- was devoted to the medium. Mr. Lunn had a gallery in Washington that sold lithographs and drawings. While visiting a publisher of etchings and photographic portfolios in Manhattan, he saw Ansel Adams's "Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico." "This was an extraordinarily graphic, marvelous image," he recalled in a 1996 interview. "As a dealer in prints I could very much relate to it. I didn't even know who Ansel Adams was."
In January 1971, Mr. Lunn exhibited Adams's photographs. Shortly before the show's opening, The Washington Post ran a lengthy review of the show saying, as Mr. Lunn put it, that "this was the greatest thing since Moses and the Tabernacle." From that show, Mr. Lunn sold an astonishing number of Adams prints; at $150 for a 16-by-20-inch picture, sales totaled $10,000.
Mr. Lunn cast far afield, becoming the first art dealer, for instance, to exhibit photographs at the Basel Art Fair in Switzerland. And he was one of the biggest buyers of vintage prints at Sotheby's in London, which had begun offering photography at auction in 1970. In 1975 Sotheby's New York began holding regular photography sales. Christie's New York soon followed.
Informed that Adams would not make more prints after the end of 1975, Mr. Lunn ordered 1,000 prints, concentrating on popular images like "Moonrise," buying them at an average cost of $300. Mr. Lunn created similar markets for a formidable list of photographers including Walker Evans, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus and Heinrich Kuhn.
In 1993, a Stieglitz image of Georgia O'Keeffe's hands with a thimble sold for $398,500 at Christie's New York. At the spring photography auctions in New York this year, when sales at four houses totaled a record $10.28 million, Sotheby's sold a 16-by-20-inch "Moonrise" for $20,700.
Mr. Lunn was born in Detroit in 1933 and majored in economics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. During his senior year, in the mid-1950's, he was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency. He remained with the agency until 1967 when Ramparts magazine mentioned his involvement in the National Students Association, whose international wing was a C.I.A. front.
His cover blown, Mr. Lunn resigned. He had dealt privately in original etchings and lithographs while he was stationed at the United States Embassy in Paris in the early 1960's, and in 1968 he opened his Washington gallery.
Once photography entered his life, Mr. Lunn became an avid student, growing especially passionate about 19th-century French photography.
Such was Mr. Lunn's reputation, said Mr. Worswick, a photography collector and curator, that about 25 years ago when he was offered a collection of 263,000 Edward S. Curtis photogravures, he went to Mr. Lunn because he was "the only person who could handle it."
As it turned out, Mr. Lunn was financially unable to acquire the collection but the two men became close friends.
Mr. Lunn closed his Washington gallery in 1983 and dealt privately after that. He made a point of buying and promoting the work of controversial contemporary photographers, including Robert Mapplethorpe, Andres Serrano, Joel-Peter Witkin and the team of McDermott and McGough.
Mr. Lunn is survived by his wife, Myriam; two daughters, Alexandra and Florence, and a son, Christophe, all of Paris.
Hank O'Neal, a friend of Mr. Lunn's since the 1970's who has often written about the work of the photographer Berenice Abbott, got to know Mr. Lunn when the art dealer and Marlborough Gallery in Manhattan jointly bought most of Abbott's early vintage prints and held two exhibitions. Like Mr. Lunn, Mr. O'Neal had worked for the C.I.A. One of the rituals they shared was the celebration of Abbott's birthday each year.
With homes in Paris and New York, Mr. Lunn treated trans-Atlantic travel as though it were a taxi ride across town. Last month, he flew to the United States from Paris to commemorate what would have been Abbott's 100th birthday, joining a group that visited her grave in northern Maine.
Mr. Lunn had brought the newest fragrance from Paris, as he had every year for Abbott's birthday, and he sprayed it on her tombstone. "I was walking about," Mr. O'Neal recalled, "and 30 or 40 feet from her grave I saw a flat marker that said 'Harry L.' I called to Harry. He came over and he sprayed that marker too."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE ATTACKS: IN THE SUDAN;
For This Islamic Tactician, Battle With U.S. Has Begun

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, the Sudan, Aug. 23

 BODY:
The man who is the driving force of the Islamic government that gave Osama bin Laden refuge here for two years said today that he believed that Mr. bin Laden would try to retaliate against the United States.
"When you start fortifying your embassies it becomes very attractive -- the Americans have made themselves very attractive targets," the official, Hassan al-Turabi, a Sorbonne-educated intellectual who agrees with much of Mr. bin Laden's militant view of the world, said in an interview. "Probably he would try to mobilize friends -- ex-Afghan fighters from Arab countries -- and try to hit back against the Americans, anywhere." 
 The United States attacked sites in the Sudan and Afghanistan that it said are financed by Mr. bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi whom Washington has linked to the Aug. 7 bombings at the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
Mr. Turabi, the Speaker of Parliament and ideological power behind the governing National Islamic Front, is accused by American intelligence officials of having an important political and financial relationship with Mr. bin Laden.
He said he did not know how much Mr. bin Laden's effectiveness had been destroyed by the American attack on the bases in Afghanistan.
But like other Sudanese officials, Mr. Turabi dismissed the American contention that a pharmaceutical factory here was financed by Mr. bin Laden and served as a cover to make a precursor for nerve gas.
In a line of argument used by officials of his Government since the American attacks, Mr. Turabi branded the United States "terrorist" and accused it of "hating Islam."
Mr. Turabi, who serves tea to guests in floral china cups and is vocal in his contempt for the United States, said he had met Mr. bin Laden "only once or twice" in the Sudan. He said he had not been in contact with Mr. bin Laden since the Saudi was asked to leave here in 1996.
But he seemed to know Mr. bin Laden well enough to describe him as having a "belligerent" temperament and being a man of few words and "a fighter."
He insisted that Mr. bin Laden was not involved in training Islamic fighters at camps in the Sudan -- as the Americans have maintained -- but acknowledged that he had been asked to leave the Sudan because of pressure from Saudi Arabia.
"Bin Laden was not even issuing leaflets from here," Mr. Turabi said. "He was trying to behave."
But apparently in an effort to clean up its reputation as a harborer of terrorists, the Government of the Sudan acceded to the requests from Saudi Arabia, as well as from the United States and Britain, that Mr. bin Laden depart. Mr. bin Laden had been exiled from his homeland in 1994 after calling for a holy war against the Saudi Government. He is a suspect in the bombing of two American military installations in Saudi Arabia that killed a total of 24 Americans in 1995 and 1996.
Mr. Turabi, a lawyer who masterminded a military coup here in 1989, described retaliation by Mr. bin Laden against the United States as entirely justified. "You respond as violently as the violence," he said.
The Sudanese Government persisted today in its case that the Shifa Pharmaceutical Plant, which was destroyed by American cruise missiles, was not a dual-use facility capable of making a precursor for VX nerve gas as well as medicines.
In an effort to demonstrate that the plant was purely a civilian one, the Government has allowed foreign reporters to traipse all over the wreckage, and today it invited the chief United Nations representative in the Sudan, Phillip Borel, on a tour.
But after stepping around broken pieces of the building and over debris that includes wrappers and bottles used for human and veterinary drugs, Mr. Borel said only technical experts could determine precisely what the plant made. He said he saw no reason why United Nations technical experts should not investigate.
One Western official here said there was some surprise in the diplomatic community that the United States had attacked the plant, in the industrial area of the city, which opened last year and was only lightly guarded.
Another, older plant, more closely guarded and with high security walls, has long been considered suspicious, the official said. Western diplomats living near the older plant believe that Iraqi technicians frequently visit it, the official said.
There are other theories, however, that the plant that was destroyed was only lightly guarded as a deception to keep suspicions low.
Whether Mr. bin Laden, the son of a wealthy Saudi construction family, was a financial backer of the plant remains unclear. He was certainly well known as a major investor in a Government that has presided over an economy that has enriched a few at the top but ravaged most of the population.
According to one estimate here, Mr. bin Laden brought as much as $500 million to the Sudan when he came in 1994. One of his most important contributions was a $300 million line of credit, a well-informed academic said.
Mr. bin Laden's construction company built a new road from Khartoum halfway to Port Sudan, but it is unclear whether he divested himself of his business interests here when he left in 1996.
During his two years in Khartoum, Mr. bin Laden lived in a new, large, comfortable two-story brick and stone house with a tiled roof in Ryadh, a well-to-do neighborhood.
A neighbor, a retired diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. bin Laden kept to himself and never socialized among Sudanese. He was well protected by his own security men and others provided by the Government. Down the street from the house, the Government dug a trench to stop traffic from passing by the bin Laden residence, the neighbor said.
Mr. bin Laden was punctilious about attending a nearby mosque with a turquoise minaret five times a day for prayer, the neighbor said. He arrived in the Sudan with four wives, the neighbor said, all of whom dressed in the most conservative black Islamic robes, which covered the women's entire faces. The family had about 10 children, with the eldest boy about 18, the neighbor said.
Another neighbor, Magla Abdel Gafaar, 24, said she became friendly with one of Mr. bin Laden's wives, Hamza. Ms. Gafaar said Hamza was the daughter of Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the Saudi oil minister whose smooth talk and dapper dress personified the oil-producing nations as they wrested control of their oil from foreign companies in the 1970's.
Sheik Yamani also used his nation's vast oil reserves to dominate the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries, which embargoed oil exports in 1973 to punish governments that supported Israel.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 11, 1998, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Aug. 24 about the Speaker of the Sudanese Parliament referred incorrectly to a wife of Osama bin Laden, a Saudi whom the United States has linked to the bombings at the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last month. She is not a daughter of Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the former Saudi Oil Minister.

HEADLINE: From Mosque To Museum;
Restoring an Object's Surface May Petrify Its Heart

SERIES: Past/Present: Staircases to Devotion

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

DATELINE: MARRAKESH, Morocco

 BODY:
Not long ago, the imam at the Casbah mosque agreed to show an interested outsider the mosque's ancient minbar.
The idea was to compare it to the 12th-century minbar, or pulpit, from the Kutubiyya mosque here, which conservators from the Metropolitan Museum of Art have lately restored and installed to justified local fanfare, in the remains of the city's immense Badi Palace. The Kutubiyya's minbar is worth traveling halfway around the world to see. And it is not likely ever to go anywhere else. 
 Minbars are portable pulpits, decorated wooden staircases on wheels from which the imam addresses the congregation during Friday worship. Six years ago, the Met asked to borrow the Kutubiyya minbar for "Al-Andalus: The Art of Islamic Spain," a big loan exhibition. But the minbar was too fragile to travel; in fact, it badly needed repair.
So the Met did something unusual in the museum world: It proposed to restore the minbar, never mind any exhibition. Mahrukh Tarapor, the museum's associate director, arranged the deal directly with the Moroccan King, Hassan II. Patti Birch, an honorary trustee of the Met who has a home in in Marrakesh, offered to pay for the restoration. The Moroccans supplied craftsmen to help.
The whole deal took a while to get in motion, but two years ago, Met conservators and installation and lighting experts got started. They worked with a Moroccan architect, El Mostafa Hbibi, and several Moroccan woodworkers to shore up the minbar's rickety structure, secure loose panels, clean the surface and design a place for it in the Badi Palace Museum. The result is one of the most amazing sights in Marrakesh, a charismatic object, sublime and handsomely installed.
The smaller Casbah minbar is exquisite, too -- though a wreck -- and is still in use. So however they compare esthetically, the two minbars have now become fundamentally different kinds of objects.
The Kutubiyya minbar, after all, is a modern museum object. Its display in the Badi Palace represents essentially American exhibition standards and a Western approach to conservation. There are no interpolated carvings, for instance, as there are on the other minbar; the very idea of adding new touches to it seems outrageous, like trying to pass off a fake.
On the other hand, the Casbah minbar remains part of a culture seamlessly integrated with the past. It belongs to a living faith. Nearly as old as the Kutubiyya's, it could also be retired to a museum, though one can imagine it being treated quite differently.
For example, in Fez, several hours to the north, city planners have decided to hire local artisans, people from the city's walled center, or medina, who have been strictly trained in an old craft tradition, to fix up the decorated facades of ruined monuments, adding their own designs in the style of the originals. There's nothing kitsch or ersatz about the plan. The medina is not a theme park or a museum. It's a community. The workers who live there get jobs with the restoration, and the buildings are put back into use. One landmark site has become a museum; others are mosques, restaurants, homes and a university dormitory.
 
Relative Values, Parochial Esthetics
It is a philosophy of historical continuity: If the heel on your favorite shoe breaks, you don't throw the shoe away or stick it on a shelf to admire it. You replace the broken heel with a new one and keep walking.
Looking at the minbar in the Casbah mosque, it is possible to be reminded how modern conservation, like almost every other issue in art, is a matter of relative values and parochial esthetics. Western conservators, loyal to a secular museum culture, claim a certain objective rightness based on scientific devotion to a work's historical integrity. This is a perfectly justifiable approach if you think in terms of museum objects. But which context is ultimately more faithful to the spirit of something like the minbar: the Casbah mosque or the Badi Palace Museum?
Every generation has claimed to understand the intent of past artists. Restorers in previous centuries who saw the darkened Sistine Chapel ceiling were convinced that Michelangelo was a painter of shadows, so they added their own dark touches to his work, reinforcing a view of him that affected future restorers, and so the cycle proceeded. When an artist named Mazzuoli stuck darkening glue to the Sistine ceiling in the early 18th century, he was just reflecting the beliefs of his day, as restorers today, having cleaned away the grime, reflect the modern faith in science, technology and historical revivalism. A century from now, the ceiling will probably look as much like a work of late-20th-century restoration as the darkened ceiling looked like an anachronism.
The point isn't that the Kutubiyya minbar should be returned to the Kutubiyya mosque and put back into service. It was removed to storage years ago because people here decided that it was too precious to be used.
Commissioned by the Almoravid Sultan Ali Ibn Yusuf in 1137, it was made in Cordoba, Spain. More than 12 feet high, it originally consisted of more than a million differently carved pieces of bone and colored woods, some pieces the size of sesame seeds, in the shapes of stars, Y's, hexagons, arabesques, scrolling vines, palmettes, pine cones, blossoms, checkerboards and Arabic letters. (There are inlaid inscriptions cut from African blackwood and outlined in bone.) Pieces have fallen off during the last eight centuries, but the Met's conservators have painstakingly restored what is left.
A modern craftsman, as a test, recently took a week to reproduce, coarsely, one of the minbar's panels, and from this, experts guess that the whole minbar required 72,000 man-hours of labor.
It was shipped in pieces down the Guadalquivir River, across the Strait of Gibraltar and on camelback over the Middle Atlas mountains to Marrakesh, where it was reassembled.
Someone has estimated that during the eight centuries that it was rolled in and out of its closet in the mosque every Friday, the minbar traveled a total of 250 miles. Imagine rolling one of your family's heirloom dinner plates between New York and Washington, and you can estimate, more or less, the wear and tear.
The Met acted remarkably in the situation, committing resources to an object that doesn't directly benefit its audience. Skeptics may have asked why the museum was so generous. But one can't help wondering: If something equivalent from the West -- say, a Giotto altarpiece -- had been discovered abroad and needed repair, wouldn't American museums have competed for the honor to restore it?
 
A Museum With One Treasure
The Kutubiyya minbar has found a home in the most dramatic secular setting here: the vast, crumbling Badi is essentially a museum only for it, at least so far, because no other objects are inside. The 16th-century palace was destroyed by the ruler Mouley Ismail in the 17th century, its gold, marble, onyx and ivory stripped and used to build a palace in Meknes, some 200 miles northeast of here. With a courtyard the size of several football fields, what is left of the Badi might plausibly be compared to the Baths of Caracalla in Rome. The minbar occupies one of the few palace rooms that still has a roof.
There's nothing in Marrakesh quite like this mix of old with new: an up-to-date display in a ruin. At dusk, as visitors start to leave, storks, which nest on the Badi's walls during the day, descend into the palace courtyard to waddle around the reflecting pools and orange trees. The storks make a kind of clacking sound; they lean their heads way back and smack their beaks together. And as the noise of the city dies down a little, they sound like an orchestra of castanets, drowning out the coo of the doves that also live in the palace.
It's almost prehistoric. And suddenly a 12th-century minbar doesn't seem so old.
 
Past/Present
This is the second article in a series about how different cultures interpret and make use of the art of the past. The first article examined restoration efforts in the old city, or medina, of Fez.

HEADLINE: For Butterflies, a Promise of Peace With Truckloads of Trees

BYLINE: By CAROL YOON 

 BODY:
HIGH in the mountains of central Mexico, monarch butterflies arrive by the millions each winter to take refuge, their black and orange wings festooning stands of towering fir trees. But conservationists have grown increasingly concerned as the butterflies in these small patches of forest, some of which were set aside as preserves, compete with the needs of the residents around them.
Now conservationists are trying to help the butterflies by helping the residents. In July, 40,000 trees were planted near El Rosario in the state of Michoacan in an effort to save the fragile habitat where monarchs congregate after their long flight south from the eastern United States and Canada. 
 Rather than becoming new roosts for monarchs, the newly planted trees, are intended to be cut.
The idea is to provide the local farmers with trees they can grow for firewood, construction and selling, leaving the monarch forests intact.
"The monarch overwintering areas were really being hit hard," said Robert L. Small, who runs the Michoacan Reforestation Fund, a one-man fund-raising organization aimed at buying trees to reforest the mountaintops of central Mexico.
The local subsistence farmers "were poor and had to have wood to live on, and they would sell whatever they could," Mr. Small said.
"This is extreme poverty," he said. "We're trying to give them an economic alternative that they've never been offered before."
Mr. Small, a retired public administrator who runs the fund from his home in Oakland, Calif., raises money that is used by the La Cruz Habitat Protection Project, the Mexico-based arm of this conservation effort, to buy the trees.
The project had a tentative start last year with the planting of 7,000 trees, most of which were killed by El Nino according to Jose Luis Alvarez, the Mexican nurseryman who has overseen the planting.
Expressing frustration over the many previous failed attempts to stop logging in the area, Dr. Lincoln Brower, a biologist at Sweet Briar College in Virginia and a monarch advocate, said: "I've grasped at a lot of straws in the last 20 years. A lot of what people do is for show, but Bob and Jose may really have found something.
"I don't see any alternatives that anyone has suggested that have as much promise as this one does."
By planting seedlings, Oyamel firs, the trees where the monarchs roost, and pines, farmers can begin making money from reforested land in a few years, Mr. Alvarez said. Oyamels can be harvested as Christmas trees in four years, and pines can be harvested for wood in as little as five years. The hope, Mr. Alvarez said, is for farmers to use the donated trees to begin a cycle of planting, harvesting and replanting that will maintain a standing forest.
But at first, even giving away the trees was not easy. Mr. Alvarez said residents were concerned that if they reforested their land it might be taken by the Mexican Government as a monarch sanctuary.
Mr. Small said that in 1986, when the Government set aside land for the monarchs, the people in the communities that had been using those forests received no financial compensation.
Mr. Alvarez said that attitudes were slowly changing and that all 40,000 seedlings he delivered to El Rosario were immediately loaded onto burros and carried up the mountainside by farmers to plant on their land.
Conservationists agree that even next year's hoped-for planting of 100,000 trees is just a beginning, the equivalent of a mere 100 acres of forest. They say the effort must grow considerably to keep the monarch sanctuaries out of harm's way in this poverty-stricken region. At least one similar reforestation effort is under way, run by the Mexican Government.
Planting trees near the monarch sanctuaries may have benefits besides the obvious economic ones.
As trees have been cut around the sanctuaries, stronger winds are blowing through the reserves, drying the normally moist habitat and making the trees more prone to disease, Dr. Brower said.
As trees are planted, he said, this potentially devastating problem should begin to disappear.
Mr. Alvarez said: "There are thousands of acres out there that have been transformed into corn or oat fields. I want it all to go back to forest. I think this is definitely the answer."

HEADLINE: Where to Focus Our Economic Jitters?

BYLINE: By Alan S. Blinder; Alan S. Blinder is a professor of economics at Princeton University and vice chairman of the G-7 group. He is a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
We Americans are now in the summer of our economic content. But much of the rest of the economic world has become a dangerous place. Several Southeast Asian nations are in what can only be called a depression. China, it is said, may have to devalue its currency. Japan is sagging badly. Russia lurches from one crisis to the next. And parts of Latin American look shaky.
Some pessimists are even fretting about the United States: the stock market seems precarious, we save too little, our trade deficit is alarming, the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates, growth is slowing. But I believe that our worries should be directed across the Pacific; anxieties about the American economy are overblown. 
 Although the great American growth machine slowed dramatically in the last quarter, the apparently meager 1.4 percent growth rate resulted largely from an inventory correction and the General Motors strike. Without those two factors, growth would have topped 4 percent despite a notable drag from foreign trade.
And besides, a little slowdown is welcome right now, when there is a real danger of overheating. The stock market has been correcting -- calmly so far -- for what seem to be the right reasons: it is coming to see unrealistically optimistic earnings forecasts as, well, unrealistic. And those awful trade deficits, I would argue, are just what the doctor ordered for the rest of the world.
So there is no need for panic on the domestic front. Neither is the situation in Russia, which is grabbing the gloomy headlines these days, a serious economic concern for the United States (although it is a deadly serious foreign policy matter). The Russian economy is simply too small and too little connected to the rest of the world to matter much.
If you want to worry, start with Japan. Its economy, once mighty, has struggled for most of this decade and now appears to be in the grips of a serious recession. Despite near-zero interest rates for nearly three years and several large stimulus packages, the economy has failed to perk up. And the Japanese political system has repeatedly shown itself incapable of taking decisive action.
Since Japan accounts for roughly one-eighth of the world economy, all that is bad enough in itself. But there is much more.
Most obviously, much of Asia is in serious trouble, and the region's biggest economy is too sick to help. A healthy Japan could be assisting its smaller neighbors financially while they lifted themselves out of the morass, in part by exporting to Japan. But that escape route has been effectively closed by Japan's recession.
Can Asia recover while its largest economy sinks? It's a good question, to which I fear the answer is no.
Furthermore, the whole world is fearful of financial contagion. When Thailand's markets got sick in July 1997, Malaysia's and Indonesia's quickly followed. A few months later, a crack in the (comparatively) tiny Hong Kong stock market echoed loudly in New York. In June, a falling yen shook emerging markets all over the world, and a sinking ruble did so again this month. Imagine, then, the potential financial repercussions of a real financial meltdown in Japan.
What to do? The United States may be the undisputed world leader, but most of the answers lie in Japan.
First, and most assuredly foremost, Japan must clean up its banking mess and nurse its financial system back to health. In my view, it is more important that Japan do so quickly than that it follow what might be called the American way -- shuttering moribund banks, paying off depositors with public money, kicking out the management and selling off the bad assets. That recipe sounds about right to me. But remember that, in the case of our own savings and loan debacle, we dithered for years before finally biting the unpalatable bullet. If insisting on an American-style approach will delay the process further, better to use a less confrontational, more Japanese approach -- even if that means, for example, keeping wounded banks alive by merging them into stronger ones. The motto should be, Just do it.
Second, government policy must remain strongly expansionary. That means keeping interest rates extremely low, enacting permanent tax cuts and providing even more dollops of Government spending. The time to debate the merits and demerits of these three ways to stimulate domestic spending is long gone. Japan must use every option available.
Third, both Japan and the rest of the world need to tolerate an exchange rate in the current range (about 145 yen to the dollar) or even lower. Let's not forget that Japan is still home to some of the world's great manufacturing corporations. A cheaper yen makes these companies' products more attractive to foreign buyers. The important point here is that having a super-weak yen should not be viewed as a permanent condition. Rather, it is a temporary, cyclical phenomenon, much like near-zero interest rates and the yawning budget deficit. As the Japanese economy recovers, so will the yen.
Critics object that a weak yen imperils other Asian countries by making their exports less competitive. They have a point, but an exaggerated one. Only South Korea competes directly with Japan in a variety of product lines; other Asian countries aim lower on the technology ladder. And remember the object of this exercise: to get the Japanese economy growing again. A healthy Japan will provide markets for its neighbors.
And what about the United States? Is there anything our Government should be doing to help? Yes, but fortunately not much, other than to make sure that our own giant economy keeps humming.
First, the world's financial markets certainly do not need an interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve right now. Fortunately, Fed decision makers have been smart enough to do nothing for almost 18 months now.
Second, even though I subscribe to many of the criticisms of the International Monetary Fund, Congress should quickly pass the I.M.F. financing measure that the Administration has requested. Yes, this may amount to throwing some good money after bad. But we can ill afford to shut down the world's economic fire department just when dry tinder appears to be everywhere and sparks are flying.
Third, our Government should keep badgering the Japanese, who seem to need lots of external pressure to overcome internal political inertia. However, less smug American triumphalism might be in order. For example, as suggested earlier, the Japanese need not fix their banking problems in precisely the way we fixed ours. The United States should behave more like a worried companion trying to talk sense into a friend, less like a haughty scold.
Finally, with our economy operating at (or indeed beyond) capacity while Asia is in the doldrums and Europe is in only so-so shape, we must expect our already huge trade deficit to grow. Providing a market for weak-sister economies may be the most constructive thing we can do for the world economy right now. And, fortunately, we spendthrifty Americans are in an excellent position to do just that. It would be a colossal mistake if our growing trade deficit were to push the United States into protectionism. That's not the way a leader behaves in a dangerous world.

Wall Street has reason to lose sleep over some signs that U.S. shoppers are showing fatigue.

BYLINE: By Gretchen Morgenson 

 BODY:
THEY'VE shopped and they've shopped. Now are they starting to drop?
The marathoner of the moment, as far as Wall Street is concerned, is the American consumer, one of two prime movers behind the booming economy of the last four years. Shop-happy consumers brought the nation out of the recession back in 1991 and, together with corporations investing in capital equipment, have kept growth in gross domestic product perking far longer than in any other economic cycle. These same free-spending consumers are needed to snatch up foreign goods and pull the world's faltering companies back from the brink. 
 Now, however, there are signs that the marathoner may be tiring. And since capital spending by corporations is also declining, a prolonged weakness among consumers could add insult to an already-injured stock market.
Straws in the wind on consumer spending come from surveys conducted by International Strategy and Investment, a brokerage firm in New York specializing in economic research. Every week, the firm surveys almost 100 companies, including retailers, auto dealers, manufacturers, home builders and banks.
"We're getting indications that consumer spending is starting to soften," said Jason Trennert, vice president at I.S.I. "We're not counting the consumer out. And no question, lower interest rates are going to provide a fairly strong backdrop for consumer spending. But some of the headwinds on the economy are starting to affect consumer spending."
The analysts at I.S.I. often identify significant economic trends well ahead of the rest of Wall Street. For instance, the firm spotted the Asia debacle and warned of its consequences in the spring of 1997, when most Wall Street firms still considered the Asian economies a picture of health. Ed Hyman, a founder of the firm, has been named the top economist by Institutional Investor magazine for 18 consecutive years.
The most recent data from I.S.I. show the lowest reading on overall economic strength since January, an indication that the economy is cooling. The index, in which 100 represents strong growth, stood at 48.8 as of Aug. 21, down from 50.3 in July and 55.9 in May. The I.S.I. numbers are not seasonally adjusted.
The survey found a whiff of weakness in consumer spending at retailers and auto dealers. For two weeks now, retail sales have slowed at the six large national retail chains interviewed by I.S.I. The weakness was broad based, showing up at both a discounter and a department store chain. I.S.I.'s retailer index fell to 39.6 last week, down from a reading of 54 in May.
Retailers reported strong sales in the first week of August, giving hope for a bang-up back-to-school season. But the sales growth fizzled; subsequent weeks have been dismal.
I.S.I. sees a similar trend in auto sales. Although new-car sales rose slightly last week, Japanese and luxury models were responsible. Many dealers reported significantly fewer car shoppers, Mr. Jennert said. "A couple of weeks ago they thought inventory problems were behind slow sales, but now they say floor traffic is off," he added.
What the consumer does is important because consumption accounts for two-thirds of gross domestic product and because a host of weak countries are counting on Americans to buy their goods while Asians and others cannot. Most forecasters expect that growth in consumer spending will drop from the 6 percent reported earlier this year to about 3 percent by year-end. If this number turns out to be too optimistic, the economy will feel the pain.
Further clues to the shoppers' mind-set come today when the Conference Board releases its consumer confidence figures. On Friday, the University of Michigan publishes its confidence report. In early August, the Michigan sentiment figures showed only a slight decline from the previous month.
Mr. Trennert wonders if the consumer pullback that his firm is beginning to see is a result of the summer squalls in the stock market. Are consumers spending less because many of them have lost money, at least on paper?
"Our work has shown a strong correlation between retail sales and the performance of stocks," Mr. Trennert said. "Stocks tend to lead by about four weeks. Everytime we've seen the stock market move up or down signficantly, the moves tend to influence consumer spending." Since the value of the average stock portfolio is probably down 10 to 25 percent from the highs, it would not be surprising if consumers reined in their spending a bit.
One thing consumers still have going, of course, is declining interest rates. With Treasury yields near historic lows, home-mortgage refinancings will put additional income in consumers' pockets. So, even if stocks continue to drift lower, American investors will have some good news to balance out the bad.

HEADLINE: Mr. Yeltsin's Unsteady Hand

 BODY:
Five months after abruptly firing Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Boris Yeltsin has just as abruptly brought him back. An increasingly erratic President Yeltsin flailing about in the Kremlin is becoming a major cause for concern in Moscow and in Washington, recalling the unnerving days when ailing and aging Soviet leaders like Leonid Brezhnev continued to wield power despite faltering judgment.
Although Mr. Chernomyrdin is a known quantity, his return to office is anything but reassuring. It seems to signal a particularly untimely retreat from economic reform. The challenge for President Clinton, who still plans to proceed with a Moscow summit meeting scheduled for next week, is to lend a stabilizing hand to the Yeltsin-Chernomyrdin Government, without appearing to lend American endorsement to any slowing of reform. 
 Only last March, Mr. Yeltsin dismissed Mr. Chernomyrdin and, declaring that revitalizing the Russian economy required "new blood," appointed a Cabinet of youthful and committed reformers under Sergei Kiriyenko. Now, in the midst of a dangerous banking crisis that could destroy Russia's ability to borrow in international markets, Mr. Yeltsin has dumped those reformers in favor of a man whose legacy of halfway measures and tolerance for corruption contributed mightily to Russia's underlying problems.
As Russia tries to navigate its way out of a financial crisis that requires making difficult choices, it can ill afford Mr. Chernomyrdin's cautious, compromising leadership style. Economically, Russia is now in a deep, downward spiral. The Government has been unable to collect taxes or pay its workers and has lost the confidence of foreign investors who only months ago were pouring money into a country that was ill equipped to handle it. Finding a way to restructure the debts of both the Government and the Russian banks will be a difficult challenge. The previous Government had promised to announce its plans yesterday, but did not last long enough to do so.
While bringing back Mr. Chernomyrdin makes little sense in terms of Russia's economic problems, it is much easier to decipher politically. Mr. Chernomyrdin, who was himself a Soviet-era industrial manager, has good relations with the two sectors of Russia's political establishment most threatening to Mr. Yeltsin's authority -- the Communist opposition in Parliament and the powerful new financial and industrial groups that now dominate the news media and contribute heavily to political campaigns. By appointing their ally, Mr. Chernomyrdin, the ailing Mr. Yeltsin may have improved the odds on his own political survival at the expense of Russia's economic future.
The big industrial groups bankrolled Mr. Yeltsin's 1996 re-election victory, and their leaders have exercised considerable political influence ever since. They loathed the financial reforms announced by the Kiriyenko administration, particularly its efforts to tighten tax collection. They are also determined to make sure that the Russian banks they own, and not foreign creditors, stand first in line when the Government eventually resumes paying its debts. Mr. Chernomyrdin's return may be a sign that Mr. Yeltsin feels increasingly unable to stand up to these industrial tycoons.
Despite these disturbing signs, Washington should not postpone next week's summit meeting. That would diminish Mr. Yeltsin's waning political prestige. Instead Mr. Clinton and his entourage should use their stay in Moscow to get a firsthand reading of Russia's increasingly volatile political scene. Mr. Clinton should also press for better coordination on foreign policy issues. Mr. Yeltsin's outburst last week against American missile attacks on terrorist targets and Moscow's excessive indulgence of Saddam Hussein highlight the urgent need for repair work in this area.
Finally, Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Chernomyrdin should be reminded that moving forward with economic reforms is the best prescription both for healing Russia and for maintaining strong American support.

HEADLINE: Northrop to Cut 8,000 Jobs In Wake of Failed Merger

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 24

 BODY:
The Northrop Grumman Corporation said today that it planned to reduce its work force by 8,000 people, or about 15 percent, by the end of 2000 as it tries to remain competitive as an independent aerospace company.
The announcement of the cutbacks, most of which will be in Southern California, comes a month after the planned acquisition of Northrop by Lockheed Martin collapsed in the face of Government antitrust concerns. Since then, Northrop, the nation's fourth-largest aerospace company, has seen its stock plunge to about half its peak value amid doubts about whether the company can survive in an industry dominated by three larger rivals: Boeing, Lockheed and Raytheon. 
 Northrop has maintained that it can compete and prosper on its own, and today's announcement was part of the effort to do that.
"Now that we knew that we were going to be independent, we wanted to get on with life," Kent Kresa, the company's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview. He said Northrop would have taken such action "many months earlier" had it not been waiting for the deal with Lockheed to be completed.
Byron K. Callan, a Merrill Lynch analyst, said the cutbacks were part of a trend for weapons companies, adding, "They are focusing on their competitive strengths versus one another rather than on what they can buy next." He said he would not change his earnings estimates for Northrop as a result of today's announcement.
Northrop's stock, which initially rose on the news, fell 12.5 cents to close at $68.6875 -- about half its 12-month high of $139 when it looked as if the merger would be completed, and well below the $90 or so at which the shares traded last month when the deal fell through.
Aerospace stocks have been weak in general partly because of the Asian economic crisis and the feeling that the era of acquisitions is now over, said Paul H. Nisbet of JSA Research in Newport, R.I.
But Northrop's stock has been particularly weak, Mr. Callan said, because investors worry that the company will make a hasty acquisition in an attempt to increase its size.
Northrop, which is based here, said today that it would realign operating units and consolidate laboratories and factories to save $300 million in annual operating costs beginning in 2001. It will take a $60 million charge this year to cover the costs of the streamlining.
The realignment will result in the loss of 2,100 jobs. In addition, the elimination of 4,100 more jobs has been in the works but not announced until today, a company spokesman said. These cuts stem largely from slower shipments of commercial aircraft parts that Northrop makes for Boeing, which has been hurt by the Asian crisis.
The loss of 4,300 jobs beyond those had previously been announced, stemming from the winding down of the B-2 bomber program, for which Northrop is the prime contractor. The company plans to hire 2,500 workers in its information technology and electronics businesses, bringing total employment at the end of 2000 to 46,000, down from 54,000 now.
Some 7,000 of the lost jobs will be in Southern California, dealing a new blow to the region's aerospace employment, which had seemed to stabilize after years of sharp declines. Raytheon and Boeing have also announced big job cuts here this year.
Northrop Grumman also said today that it was unlikely to achieve its goal of $12 billion in revenue until 2003, a year later than planned. But with the new cutbacks, it expects operating margins to rise to 12.5 percent, higher than the previous goal of 11 percent.
The reorganization will reduce the number of divisions from five to three. One division, based in Baltimore, will deal mainly with electronic sensors. Another, in Dallas, will handle commercial and military aircraft systems. The third, in Herndon, Va., will handle information technology and services.

HEADLINE: Claims Against Liz Claiborne Dismissed

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
A Federal judge in Manhattan has thrown out portions of a lawsuit accusing Liz Claiborne, the garment manufacturer, of improperly conspiring with union leaders to betray the interests of workers at a Brooklyn sweater factory. But the judge refused to dismiss two of the workers' key complaints against the union.
The opinion, released Aug. 18 by Judge Harold Baer Jr. of the Federal District Court in Manhattan, came in response to motions by Claiborne and the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, known as Unite, which had sought to have the case dismissed in its entirety. Although the judge refused to eliminate two claims against the union at this stage of the case, he noted that "undoubtedly it will be difficult for the plaintiffs to ultimately prevail" in their fight. 
 "Judge Baer's ruling comes at an early stage in the judicial process, before the union has had an opportunity to submit evidence on its behalf," said Jo-Ann Mort, a spokeswoman for Unite. "We are confident that the case will be dismissed completely on summary judgment, after we have had an opportunity to submit evidence."
The unusual lawsuit was filed last fall by employees of Mademoiselle Knitwear Inc. in Brooklyn, once a showcase of union-management cooperation but now in bankruptcy amid a tangle of angry litigation.
The workers asserted that Claiborne had reneged on a commitment to order many sweaters from Mademoiselle, and that the union had improperly agreed to settle an arbitration case aimed at enforcing that commitment. In exchange for the settlement, the workers charged, Claiborne agreed to pay the union approximately $20 million over three years, none of which would accrue to the benefit of Mademoiselle workers. All of the workers' claims against Claiborne were dismissed by Judge Baer.
As a result, all of Mademoiselle's "baseless and false" accusations "must be considered thoroughly discredited," said Roberta S. Karp, Claiborne's general counsel. Having also won an earlier trademark infringement case against Mademoiselle, she said, the company was confident that it would also win a separate lawsuit pending against it by Mademoiselle.
Judge Baer also dismissed the portions of the complaint that accused the union of accepting what the workers termed "a bribe" from Claiborne in exchange for settling the arbitration claims. Federal labor laws limit the enforcement of union anti-bribery provisions to government prosecutors, not to private plaintiffs, the judge ruled.
"Assuming the workers have been exploited to the extent detailed in the amended complaint with millions of dollars illegally passing from employers to the union and its leadership -- in utter disregard of the membership in their well-being -- a matter deserves a further look and is being referred to the United States Attorney's office in this district for investigation," the judge explained.
The payment was legitimately made under the terms of Claiborne's contract with the union, Ms. Karp said. The Federal prosecutor's office "has been aware for over a year of the allegations the court referred, and it has taken no action," she noted.
Judge Baer also dismissed all claims against the specific local, Local 155, that represented workers at Mademoiselle, because it had played no role in the arbitration dispute or its settlement. The arbitration had been undertaken on behalf of Mademoiselle workers by another union local, Local 23-25, with support from the parent union.
But the judge rejected arguments by Unite and Local 23-25 that their indirect relationship with the Mademoiselle workers barred any claims against them for not fairly representing those workers. "The actions attributed to Unite and Local 23-25 in initiating, conducting and settling the arbitration claims" provided sufficient grounds for the workers to assert in court that they had not been fairly represented, Judge Baer ruled.
To prevail, he noted, the workers will have to show that the union's settlement of the arbitration claims against Claiborne was "arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith" -- a very difficult hurdle, he added. "Nonetheless, at this stage of litigation, the plaintiffs should be allowed to proceed," he ruled.
Howard I. Rhine, the lawyer for the Mademoiselle workers, said he was encouraged by the ruling, and was confident that the remaining claims in the complaint would move forward to trial next spring.

HEADLINE: Lawsuit Attacks Bond Issue Aimed at Indian Expatriates

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
A Long Island man who was not allowed to buy bonds being offered by two Indian banks has filed suit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, saying the practice of offering them only to Indian expatriates violates state and Federal antidiscrimination laws.
"These banks are slapping Americans in the face by offering these bonds only to Indians," said D. Daniel Engstrand, the lawyer for the plaintiff, Leonard Schoenfeld, of Northport, who is not Indian. "A lot of people say, 'Oh, it's like Israeli bonds,' but anybody can buy Israeli bonds. They are not restricted." 
 The suit, filed as a class action on behalf of all non-Indian investors, seeks $387.5 million in compensatory damages for lost investment income and another $100 million in punitive damages from the Bank of India and the State Bank of India, both in Manhattan.
"The suit is meritless, and we intend to defend it vigorously," said Subhash Arora, vice president for operations at the Bank of India. He declined to elaborate.
A woman who answered the telephone at the State Bank of India said that she and others there had been instructed not to comment.
A spokesman with the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington said that there was no securities law that would prohibit such an offering. He added, however, that civil rights law might be applicable.
The bond offering, which began earlier this month and ended yesterday, had raised $2 billion as of last week. The banks are offering 5-year Resurgent India Bonds in $2,000 increments for 7.75 percent interest. The yield on the bonds, which are backed by the Government of India and are to be used for road building and other capital projects in India, is about 2 percentage points higher than 5-year United States Treasury notes.
The bonds, which can be redeemed in dollars, are being promoted to Indian expatriates as a high-yield investment and an act of patriotism, particularly in the wake of declining Western aid following India's detonation of five nuclear devices in May.
Mr. Engstrand, however, said the refusal to sell to non-Indians was in retribution for economic sanctions imposed on India by the United States.
"It's mind-boggling," he said. "Any company doing business in the state is not allowed to refuse to do business or refuse to sell or trade on the basis on that person's nationality or heritage or origin."
Mr. Engstrand said that Mr. Schoenfeld saw an advertisement for the bonds and tried to buy them on Thursday, but both banks refused to sell them to him because he was not Indian. The suit was filed Friday.
The bonds were also offered by Citibank's Non-Resident Indian services. The department could not be reached for comment yesterday evening.
Mr. Engstrand said that the banks stated on the Internet that the bonds were available only to Indians who could prove citizenship with an Indian passport or other documentation. The site also said that people of Bangladeshi or Pakistani origin who had an Indian passport could not buy the bonds, he added.
"They cannot do this in this country," he said. "There is a Federal statute that says that any foreign bank doing business in this country must abide by the antidiscrimination statute of the state in which they are doing business, as well as the Federal antidiscrimination statutes."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Prices of Treasuries Are Mixed; 30-Year Yield Rises to 5.46%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, with the price of the 30-year bond down for the first time in four days as the dollar fell against the Japanese yen.
The dollar declined amid speculation that Japan was ready to take action in the currency market when necessary to bolster the value of the yen by selling dollars. 
 A weak dollar would make dollar-denominated investments like United States Government securities less attractive to foreigners, who have been supporting the recent rally in bonds by seeking the safety of bonds as stock markets overseas tumble.
The 30-year bond was down 1 4/32 , to 100 19/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.46 percent, from 5.43 percent on Friday.
Traders point out that with yields at historic lows, it is becoming harder to get investors to buy Treasury securities. Buying is not expected to increase until investors get more signs of sustained weakness in the American economy.
Another factor in bond pricing yesterday was the turbulence in the stock market. Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income department at the J. W. Genesis Financial Corporation in Boca Raton, Fla., said this environment was not for the faint hearted.
"Today we are seeing and getting inverse reactions to the stock market -- when stocks go up, the bond market goes down; when stocks go down, bonds go up," he said. "Right now we are pretty much in a trading range, and with global events so compelling I doubt any one of this week's economic reports will have much of an impact on prices."
The market will get reports today on consumer confidence in August and existing-home sales in July. Tomorrow durable goods orders for July will be announced, and personal income figures for July will be released on Friday.
Elsewhere, in when-issued trading ahead of tomorrow's $15 billion auction of two-year Treasury notes, the securities are being offered at a price to yield 5.19 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Hicks, Muse in Modest Deal For 62% Coho Energy Stake

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, venturing onto a field already littered with investor casualties, announced a $250 million bet today that the oil business is ready for a comeback.
Hicks, Muse, a leveraged buyout firm based here, agreed to pay $6 a share, in cash, for 62 percent of Coho Energy, an oil exploration and production company with properties mostly in Mississippi and Oklahoma. 
 Although the deal itself is modest, Hicks, Muse says it plans to use Coho and its managers as a platform to buy other companies that find, produce, process and transport oil. Hicks, Muse is also looking over oilfield services companies and properties that companies want to unload.
Hicks, Muse, which usually borrows more than it invests, signaled its seriousness by making its Coho purchase entirely from its own funds. For Coho, the deal amounts to a private offering of additional shares, to Hicks, Muse, that will give it the wherewithal for a shopping spree in an uncrowded market.
Thomas O. Hicks, the Hicks, Muse chairman, said his firm planned to continue buying in the next six to 18 months, then realize the gains over five or seven years as oil prices return from the current $13-a-barrel range to the $18 he predicts.
"Today is the most attractive time we've seen to invest in oil and gas in the last 10 or 15 years," Mr. Hicks said in an interview.
As oil prices have collapsed, so have shares of Coho and most others in the industry. Coho, having traded as high as $13 last fall, closed at $4.6875 on Friday. After news of the Hicks, Muse investment, they rebounded to $5.4375 today.
Analysts called the 28 percent premium over Friday's closing price that Hicks, Muse is paying a sensible long-term proposition. Coho will have the money to become a consolidator among medium-sized oil companies that might be pressed to raise cash by selling some or all of their holdings, said C. Van Levy, an analyst at Jefferies & Company. "Provided these quality properties hit the market, I think it's a good move," he said.
Among the investors who had already jumped in before the shares hit bottom are the Hicks, Muse partners themselves. In May, they personally bought 2.2 million Coho shares at nearly $7 a share. Jack D. Furst, one of those partners, said that today's investment might also be early, but that the firm needed to establish a foundation for further acquisitions now.
For Mr. Hicks, Coho represents a cautious return to a sector he last invested in about two decades ago, only to face the 1980's oil price crash. He learned that oil is too risky for companies to bear heavy debt.
One of the energy industry's best-known outside investors this time around has been Richard Rainwater of Fort Worth. Though not familiar with the Coho particulars, Mr. Rainwater praised the Hicks, Muse strategy. He, too, is hunting for oil-industry acquisitions, having already bought some shares and some oil futures. In a television interview a year ago, he said that he would relish the prospect of $12 to $13 energy prices if it created opportunities. "Now what's happened is people like Hicks, Muse who are pretty smart investors are taking advantage of it," he said today.
Though Mr. Rainwater's energy companies have fallen in recent months, he still has substantial long-term gains.
The Rainwater case for higher oil prices is based on growing global demand -- which has been slowed by Asia's economic turmoil -- and limited resources. In the Hicks, Muse outlook, low prices will force oil production cutbacks, especially in the United States, with rising demand then likewise leading to higher prices.
Coho Energy, named after the salmon to reflect its Canadian roots, operates primarily in Oklahoma, where it spent $250 million for Amoco's properties last year, and in Mississippi. The declining value of other holdings has forced it to take large write-offs this year.
Coho itself has grown through acquisitions, then proving that the acquired properties had far more oil than the sellers thought. Jeffrey Clarke, the company's chief executive, applauded Hicks, Muse's timing. "Most people get into this industry at the top," he said. "These guys have gotten in at the bottom, or as close to the bottom as you're ever going to see."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Ruling on Planned Use of Statistical Sampling in 2000 Census

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the decision by a three-judge Federal panel in a lawsuit filed by the House of Representatives against the Commerce Department over the proposed use of statistical sampling in the 2000 census. The decision was obtained from the Federal District Court's Internet site. 
 Plaintiff, the United States House of Representatives, seeks summary judgment against the Department of Commerce and the Bureau of the Census ("defendants") in this action challenging defendants' plan for the 2000 census. Plaintiff claims that using statistical sampling to supplement the headcount enumeration used to apportion representatives among the states violates the Census Act, 13 U.S.C., and Article I, section 2, clause 3 of the Constitution. The House seeks a declaration that statistical sampling is unlawful and/or unconstitutional and an injunction preventing defendants from using statistical sampling in the 2000 census. . . .
The Constitution requires Congress to conduct an "actual Enumeration" of the population every 10 years "in such Manner as they shall by Law direct." Congress has delegated broad authority over the conduct of the census to the Secretary of Commerce through the Census Act. The Census Act governs the Census Bureau's (the "Bureau") gathering of economic, social and demographic data about the United States, including the decennial apportionment census mandated by the Constitution.
Despite the constitutional mandate to obtain an "actual enumeration" of the population, "no census is recognized as having been wholly successful in achieving that goal." The 1990 Census was no exception. According to the Bureau, " t hough better designed and executed than any previous census, the census in 1990 took a step backward on the fundamental issue of accuracy. For the first time since the Census Bureau began conducting post-census evaluations in 1940, the decennial census was less accurate than its predecessor. . . . the undercount rate of 1.8 percent in 1990 was 50 percent greater than the rate had been in 1980." United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Report to the Congress -- The Plan for Census 2000, (revised August 1997). Specifically, the bureau reports that children, renters (particularly in rural areas), and racial and ethnic minorities were significantly undercounted. Among those the 1990 census missed were 4.4 percent of African-Americans, 5.0 percent of Hispanics, and 12.2 percent of American Indians living on reservations, but only 0.7 percent of non-Hispanic whites. This undercounting of certain groups relative to others, known as the "differential undercount," raises the possibility of Congressional malapportionment, as jurisdictions with large numbers of undercounted persons may have a greater share of the total population than the census figures suggest.
Concerned about problems with the 1990 Census, Congress passed the Decennial Census Improvement Act of 1991, which directed the National Academy of Sciences to study "the means by which the Government could achieve the most accurate population count possible," including consideration of "the appropriateness of using sampling methods in combination with basic data-collection techniques." . . .
Statistical sampling is best understood as using information derived from a portion of a population to infer information on the population as a whole. The Bureau intends to use sampling in three different phases of the 2000 census. . . .
 
Motion for Summary Judgment
The interpretation of two provisions of the Census Act, sections 141(a) and 195, is ultimately determinative as to whether statistical adjustment to the initial head count is permissible or proscribed. These provisions were last amended in 1976, and the resolution of this dispute depends upon the substantive effect of the amendments. Plaintiff contends that while the 1976 amendments encourage, if not require, the extensive use of sampling to collect the myriad of general demographic information that the Bureau is obliged to compile under the Census Act -- from occupational to educational to income -- they do not permit the use of statistical sampling to determine population for purposes of apportionment. Defendants allege that Congress's grant of authority to use sampling techniques extends to the apportionment enumeration. Other courts that have addressed these two sections and the effect of the 1976 amendments have rejected the view that the Census Act prohibits statistical sampling. For the following reasons, the court must disagree.
 
Section 195 of the Census Act
Amended section 195 provides: Except for the determination of population for purposes of apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the several States, the Secretary shall, if he considers it feasible, authorize the use of the statistical method known as "sampling" in carrying out the provisions of this title. . . .
Defendants note that the 1976 amendments to section 195 altered the call for non-apportionment use of statistical sampling methods from "may," which is an authorization, to "shall," which is a mandate. Defendants argue that an exception from a mandate is not a prohibition in the area covered by the exception; instead, the area covered by the exception is discretionary.
To illustrate defendants' interpretation of how this sentence structure operates, consider the directive, "Except for Mary, all children at the party shall be served cake." That all children other than Mary must be served cake is beyond dispute. However, that mandate does not affirmatively prohibit the host from serving cake to Mary. The decision as to whether to serve cake to Mary is, by defendants' understanding of the instruction, a matter left to the host's discretion. Applied to the instant case, defendants claim that with respect to apportionment, current section 195 commits the decision to use sampling to the discretion of the Secretary. . . .
Though defendants' interpretation of the except/shall sentence structure is proper in some instances, the court finds it to be strained and incorrect when applied to amended section 195. . . . In the party hypothetical, one would expect that the person who issued the directive "except for Mary, all children at the party shall be served cake" would be quite surprised to learn that Mary had been served cake. . . .
Consider the directive "except for my grandmother's wedding dress, you shall take the contents of my closet to the cleaners." It is far more likely that the granddaughter would be upset if the recipient of her directive were to take the wedding dress to the cleaners and subsequently argue that she had left this decision to his discretion. The reason for this result, as contrasted with the cake example, is because of our background knowledge concerning wedding dresses: We know that they are extraordinarily fragile and of deep sentimental value to family members. We therefore would not expect that the decision to take a dress to the cleaners would be purely discretionary.
The apportionment of Congressional representatives among the states is the wedding dress in the closet. . . . The apportionment function is, after all, the "sole constitutional purpose of the decennial enumeration." The manner in which it is conducted may impact not only the distribution of representatives among the states, but also the balance of political power within the House. And, the apportionment has a direct effect upon the Presidency as well, as the number of electors in the electoral college is "equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress." That the Congressional apportionment function merits particularized treatment is best demonstrated by the fact that when Congress first authorized the use of sampling in 1957, that function was expressly excepted. Having been completely explicit then, it is hard to believe that Congress decided to rely upon subtle shifts in language to direct the opposite in 1976. . . .
Ultimately, the court agrees with plaintiff's assertion that " d efendants' argument that Congress eliminated a 200-year-old prohibition against the use of statistical estimation techniques in the constitutional census by way of a permissive negative inference from an exception to a statutory mandate is wholly implausible." . . .
It is a cardinal principle of statutory interpretation that dramatic departures from past practices should not be read into statutes without a definitive signal from Congress. . . . Perhaps the most eloquent statement of this concept comes from then-Justice Rehnquist, writing in dissent in Harrison v. PPG Industries, "In a case where the construction of legislative language such as this makes so sweeping and so relatively unorthodox a change as that made here, I think judges as well as detectives may take into consideration the fact that a watchdog did not bark in the night" (quoted in Chisom). Despite defendants' characterization of the force of the legislative history, and the characterization of at least one reviewing court, the court finds no indication that the watchdog barked in the night. . . .
Congress was issuing a much stronger directive to the Department of Commerce to employ sampling methodologies in most aspects of its Title 13 data gathering responsibilities. However, Congress's explicit directive again includes that ubiquitous qualifier -- "except in the apportionment of the U.S. House of Representatives." The inclusion of this "except" language must be read to mean that one area was affirmatively carved out from the general desire to augment the use of sampling -- the area of the Congressional apportionment enumeration. The second sentence of the excerpted language is even more damaging to defendants' argument, as it states that the only difference between the old and the new section 195 is a reduction in the Secretary's discretion to use sampling, not a categorical creation of discretion in an area in which he previously had none.
The absence of the legislature's bark is all the more compelling when one considers what the watchdog is guarding. . . . The House of Representatives' apparent lack of interest in a statutory modification that goes to the fundamental matter of its composition cannot be ignored by the court.
Finally, this court agrees with plaintiff's contention that " i t borders on the absurd that Congress would enact such a momentous change in such an oblique fashion." Had Congress wished to authorize sampling techniques employed in the apportionment enumeration, it could have done so quite simply by either: a) deleting the "except" clause in its entirety; or, b) modifying the clause so as to affirmatively declare what defendants claim to be true by implication; that the Secretary may, in the exercise of his discretion, use sampling techniques to supplement the inital headcount enumeration to determine population for apportionment. Because of the straightforward means available to Congress to accomplish its purported goal, this court declines to ascribe to Congress the "surprisingly indirect route" that defendants advance.
 
Section 141(a) of the Census Act
Whatever strength there is to the claim that using statistical sampling in the apportionment enumeration does not violate the Census Act comes from the fact that section 195 must be read together with the other provision addressing sampling methodologies: section 141(a). Prior to 1976, section 141(a) did not address sampling procedures. The post-1976 version states, in relevant part: The Secretary shall, in the year 1980 and every 10 years thereafter, take a decennial census of population . . . in such form and content as he may determine, including the use of sampling procedures and special surveys (emphasis added).
To the extent that section 141(a), which standing alone appears to permit statistical sampling in Congressional apportionment, and section 195, which indisputably proscribes the same, conflict, the rules of statutory construction dictate the resolution. The more specific provision controls the general. . . .
Consequently, while 141 permits sampling techniques and surveys in the conduct of the decennial census, that general grant is subject to the more specific "Use of Sampling" directive in 195, which, as explained above, explicitly proscribes the use of sampling for apportioning representatives among the states. . . .
Reading section 141(a) and section 195 together, and considering the plain text, legislative history and other tools of statutory construction, this court finds that the use of statistical sampling to determine the population for purposes of the apportionment of representatives in Congress among the states violates the Census Act. . . .
Because this court finds that the Census Act prohibits the use of statistical sampling to determine the population for the purpose of apportionment of representatives among the states, there is no need to reach the constitutional questions presented.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Ask Wider Libya Ban if Trial Is Refused

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
If Libya refuses an offer to try two Libyan suspects in The Hague for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, the United States will press the United Nations to extend sanctions on Libya to include an oil embargo, a senior American official said today.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of Britain confirmed in simultaneous announcements today that they were willing for the Libyans to be tried in a third country, but by Scottish judges under Scottish law. They had previously insisted that the trial take place in the United Kingdom or the United States. 
 American officials called the offer, which is close to a proposal made by Libya, "nonnegotiable" and said Libya must respond quickly by handing over the suspects. Otherwise, they said, the offer will be withdrawn.
There was no immediate response from the Libyan leader, Muammar el-Qaddafi, but the Arab League, seeming to speak for Libya, welcomed the proposal cautiously.
In Cairo, the league Secretary General, Esmat Abdel Meguid, said today: "Libya and the Arab League are in agreement in principle, but we need to know the details, in particular whether there are any conditions. If this proposal conforms with the Arab and Libyan offer for a Scottish panel of judges to try them at The Hague in accordance with Scottish law, this would be the beginning of the solution to the crisis."
The United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, who was asked by the United States and Britain to notify Libya of the details of the proposal and to handle the suspects' extradition, endorsed the idea.
The plane blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, killing 259 people on the aircraft -- including 189 Americans -- and 11 on the ground.
"We note that Libya has repeatedly stated its readiness to deliver the suspects for trial by a Scottish court sitting in a third country," Ms. Albright said. "We now challenge Libya to turn promises into deeds."
Ms. Albright said the plan "is not subject to negotiation or change, nor should it be subject to additional foot dragging or delay."
 If Libya fails to hand over the suspects, who have been identified as Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifa Fhimah, Washington will seek an expansion of United Nations sanctions to include sales of Libyan oil, a State Department official added, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
But other officials said they considered an international oil embargo unlikely. They said, though, that a Libyan refusal would at least make it difficult for the United Nations to ease the sanctions it imposed in 1992 on Libya for refusing to hand over the suspects, who are believed to be Libyan intelligence agents.
If the suspects are handed over, both the United States and Britain will support action in the Security Council to suspend the international sanctions against Libya, which include a ban on flights to and from the country. But American unilateral sanctions against Libya for being what it considers a "state sponsor of terrorism" will continue, American officials said.
Libya has repeatedly broken the ban on flights, sending token flights to Mecca in Saudi Arabia for the annual Muslim pilgrimage. Foreign dignitaries, including President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt last month and President Idriss Deby of Chad today, have started flying to and from Tripoli, the Libyan capital, instead of traveling by road.
Libya has not made any recent announcements on the proposal for a trial in a third country, but the lawyer for the suspects, Ibrahim Legwell, said last month that they would accept a trial in The Hague "if the conditions for a fair trial are provided."
At the time, Mr. Legwell's conditions included an international panel of judges, which the United States and Britain have rejected. But the Libyan Foreign Minister, Omar Mustafa al-Montassir, said explicitly in a letter to the United Nations in January that the judges could be Scottish.
If convicted, the suspects could serve up to 30 years in a Scottish prison, American officials said.
Ms. Albright and the National Security Adviser, Samuel R. Berger, told the families of those who died in the Pan Am bombing about the decision in a conference call this morning. "These families don't all agree on the proper strategy for achieving accountability in this case," Ms. Albright said. "But they all agree that the delays in bringing the suspects to trial have gone on for far too long."
Susan Cohen of Cape May Court House, N.J., whose daughter, Theodora, died in the explosion and crash, said she was very upset about the outcome. "Today has been a day which has been, in a sense, a victory for Qaddafi and the terrorists," Mrs. Cohen said in a telephone interview. "This sets a bad precedent. If terrorists out-wait us, do they now have a right to decide where to be tried? I don't think the Administration has really thought through the longterm implications of this."
American officials in contact with all the families said a majority of them favored the proposal.
Glenn Johnson of Greensburg, Pa., said in an interview today that he, his wife, Carole, and the board members of the group, Survivors of Pan Am 103, supported the idea.
"We felt this might allow us to get justice and get off-center," he said. "This still meets with what we can live with. With everything that's happened, we need to take the initiative, and this will force Qaddafi to make a decision."

HEADLINE: U.S. and Iraq Toughen Stances on Weapons Inspection

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 24

 BODY:
The United States and Iraq hardened their positions today over Baghdad's decision to end cooperation with weapons inspections.
Washington and Britain have begun pressing for an end to periodic sanctions reviews, which would have the effect of keeping Iraq permanently under a crushing embargo "until they're back on the reservation," a Western diplomat said. 
 The last review was in April; the next was scheduled for October.
Iraq insists on a more friendly inspection system and perhaps another visit, or a new initiative, from Secretary General Kofi Annan, bypassing the Security Council.
The new statements of resolve -- stopping well short of any kind of military threat on Washington's part -- followed a report to the Security Council this morning by Mr. Annan's special envoy to Iraq on his unsuccessful attempt last week to persuade the Iraqi Government to resume cooperation.
The envoy, Prakash Shah, an Indian diplomat, told the Council members that in two essentially perfunctory meetings with Iraqi officials in Baghdad earlier this month he had been told that the United Nations was offering nothing new and therefore there was nothing to discuss.
Peter Burleigh, the deputy United States representative said that Mr. Shah "basically said to the Council that he's gotten nowhere."
"The U.S. position is that we will be consulting this week, looking toward a Council resolution on Iraq," Mr. Burleigh said. "We're suggesting the suspension of sanctions reviews until Iraq comes back into cooperation."
Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's representative to the United Nations, said Baghdad still wants a new set of inspectors to replace the existing United Nations Special Commission, known as Unscom, which is responsible for dismantling biological and chemical weapons, missile systems, and the means to produce them.
Iraq has also stopped cooperating with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors nuclear developments.
Mr. Hamdoon also did not rule out shutting down all future technical monitoring and surveillance of Iraq in addition to ending surprise visits by United Nations inspectors, which were terminated on Aug. 5. He said all options remained open to Iraq.
"We have stopped all cooperation with Unscom," Mr. Hamdoon told reporters, "and we are waiting the genuine move on the Council's part to address Iraq's concerns."
"Most important is the restructuring of Unscom as a body," Mr. Hamdoon said. "Unless this restructuring takes place, Iraq finds it very difficult -- almost impossible -- to have any meaningful cooperation with Unscom."
Mr. Hamdoon's pitch to bring the Secretary General into direct negotiations with Iraq again is meeting a cooler reception from Mr. Annan's aides this time, diplomats said. He reached an agreement with Iraq at meetings there in February, averting a crisis.
Washington, which was not enthusiastic about the involvement of the Secretary General earlier this year, now seems intent on keeping him in the forefront of the debate with Iraq, some Council members say. Iraq has violated its agreement with Mr. Annan as well as Security Council resolutions.
Another trip to Baghdad by Mr. Annan has been discussed only in general and preliminary terms, diplomats say. Iraq has not invited him.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Takes Credit for Growth in Tourism

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
A record number of people visited New York City last year, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that his quality-of-life campaign had played a crucial role.
The number of travelers to the city reached 33 million in 1997, up 3.9 million from 1996, Mr. Giuliani said. There was a sharper increase in American visitors than in foreign visitors, who made up only about 20 percent of the total. The number of American business travelers reached 10.4 million, up 28 percent, while the number of American vacationers reached 16.5 million, up 8 percent. 
 Mr. Giuliani and Fran Reiter, president of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, said the strong national economy, hotel construction and increased investment in Times Square were all partly responsible for the jump in tourism. But the Mayor also eagerly credited his quality-of-life initiatives, including bans on sex shops in residential neighborhoods and tighter rules on where businesses can store garbage.
"You shouldn't minimize the importance of improving the quality of life," said Mr. Giuliani, announcing the tourism figures at a news conference in the Novotel hotel in midtown Manhattan. "When people come to this city and see it better than they saw it before, then this is a city they'd want to come back to."
He added, "Each one of the efforts may seem like a small one, but it has a tremendous amount to do with the overall revival of the spirit of the city."
The new domestic tourism figures came from a survey conducted by D. K. Shifflet & Associates, a research company in McLean, Va., which mails questionnaires to 25,000 households around the nation each month asking about recent trips and travel plans. About 60 percent usually respond, said Michelle Schwartz, a spokeswoman for the tourism bureau, which pays D. K. Shifflet for the New York parts of the survey. The statistics on foreign visitors came from the United States Department of Commerce, she said.
New York City was the third most popular destination for American travelers last year, after Orlando, Fla., and Las Vegas, Nev., according to the tourism bureau. In 1996 it ranked fifth, behind Orlando, Atlanta, Chicago and Las Vegas.
Among foreign countries, Argentina accounted for the largest increase in tourists, sending 161,000 Argentines to New York last year, up 46 percent from 1996. The number of visitors from Brazil increased by 31 percent, to 333,000. And the United Kingdom sent 726,000 visitors, up 29 percent from 1996. The largest number of visitors, 983,000, came from Canada, a decrease of 7 percent. The number of tourists from Switzerland fell by 28 percent, and the number from South Korea fell by 27 percent.
Ms. Reiter, formerly Mr. Giuliani's Deputy Mayor and campaign manager, was appointed president of the tourism bureau last winter and promised to mount a more intensive effort to promote tourism in the city. The bureau had been criticized by hotel and restaurant industry leaders for failing to come up with more imaginative ways to lure visitors.
This year has been different, Ms. Reiter said. The city has tried to recruit more tourists from Britain and Germany by putting on elaborate dinners for tourism executives in those countries.
The tourism bureau flew chefs from Lutece, the Rainbow Room, Windows on the World and the "21" Club to London and Frankfurt to cook the dinners, Ms. Schwartz said. Retailers including F.A.O. Schwarz and Donna Karan set up exhibits, and musicians performed songs from Broadway musicals, she said.
The tourism bureau is planning similar marketing efforts for Latin American countries, Ms. Reiter said.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE ATTACKS: IN PAKISTAN;
Missile Said to Be in Hands of Afghan Neighbor

BYLINE: By BARRY BEARAK 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Aug. 24

 BODY:
An unexploded American missile, believed to be a stray from last week's attack on suspected guerrilla training centers in Afghanistan, has been found in a remote area of Pakistan, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry said today.
This proves that Pakistani airspace was violated during the missile barrage, the Ministry said in a statement, adding that a formal complaint would be made to the United Nations Security Council. 
 Panic-stricken villagers discovered the long object lodged in the sand and informed local authorities, press reports said, and an evacuation was ordered.
The missile was handed over to the military, the Foreign Ministry said.
American officials here had little to say about the allegation. "The Government of Pakistan brought this story to our attention, and we are looking into it," said Richard Hoagland, the spokesman for the American Embassy here.
Soon after the attack on the camps in Afghanistan, Pakistan had said that a missile had fallen within its soil, killing several people. To Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's embarrassment, this charge was then deemed incorrect and had to be withdrawn.
So far, Pakistan's protests about the American attack have been delicately measured, attempting to mollify its angry citizens while at the same time not distancing itself unnecessarily from the United States, whose influence might be needed to help Pakistan out of its economic crisis.
The country is close to defaulting on billions of dollars in international loans.
Pakistan is rife with conflicting rumors: that the Government had advance knowledge of the attack and betrayed its allies in Afghanistan; that the Government tipped off the main target, Osama bin Laden, who is accused by the United States of financing terrorist attacks, thus saving his life, and that the Government actually attempted to finger Mr. bin Laden and pinpoint his whereabouts.
Islamic militants here have insisted that Pakistan was a willing helpmate for the United States' attack in Afghanistan.
One group, the Jammat-I-Islami, has charged that, in preparation for the attack, American warships breached Pakistani waters in the Arabian Sea and that the Pakistani Navy chose to ignore them..
But just as the Foreign Ministry was complaining today about American violations of Pakistani airspace, the Defense Ministry dismissed any notion of American encroachment in its seas, saying the warships were "well clear" of its territorial waters.
"It is important that national interests not be compromised by making wild statements," said a Defense Ministry spokesman.

HEADLINE: Study Puts High Price on Fixing a Crumbling City

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
Offering a sobering portrait of an aging metropolis, a new study by the City Comptroller has found that New York would have to spend more than $90 billion over the next decade to make the necessary repairs to put the city's subways, water mains, schools and bridges in safe working order.
The figure is vastly higher than the $52 billion that government agencies now plan to spend on repairs. But the Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, said that if City Hall, the Board of Education and the Transit Authority did not spend more money now on repairs and maintenance, conditions would further deteriorate, meaning costs would be much higher in the future. 
 "If the ultimate goal is to have an adequate physical plant where every facility functions well and safely, this is what is required," Mr. Hevesi said in an interview. "It is not a wish list. This is not the optimal. This is by our definition a state of good repair."
The Comptroller and his report dealt only with the city's fundamental infrastructure; they did not address recent problems -- falling bricks, crashing scaffolding -- that have plagued construction sites and privately owned buildings in the city.
The idea that parts of the city's infrastructure are deteriorating is certainly not new. But the report -- based on the work of auditors, investigators and engineers -- is the first in 20 years to describe the scope of the problem and to estimate the money needed to make repairs.
Schools and the city transit system account for more than half of the projected cost in the report. Providing more space for growing enrollment, and repairing many of the city's 1,028 aging school buildings would cost $28 billion. Fixing the city transit system, including rebuilding and repairing subway stations and improving track and signaling systems, would take an additional $21 billion, the report maintained.
Like any projection, those in the report are based on assumptions -- ranging from the influence of the weather on water pipes to how many people will be riding subways or attending schools -- that may or may not prove accurate in the future.
David Neustadt, a spokesman for the Comptroller, said teams of engineers made sample visits to more than 200 sites and then used what they learned to make projections about the likely condition of similar sites. The investigators also reviewed records from 18 agencies, and used the agencies' own condition reports to make their evaluation.
A spokeswoman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Colleen Roche, declined to comment on the report yesterday afternoon. "We have not been given the same courtesy of being given a copy of the report," she said. "I am not able to comment on what appears to be government by press release."
Mr. Neustadt said that the Comptroller's conclusions were discussed with each agency before the report was written and that there were no major objections.
"None of this," Mr. Hevesi added, "is offered with hostile intent or to be critical." He described the status of the city's infrastructure as " a huge governmental problem that we have to solve."
Despite its large price tag for repairs, Mr. Hevesi's report has some good news. It found that since the city's fiscal crisis of the 1970's, the city has made strides in improving the condition of many parts of its infrastructure, including the subways, jails and many sanitation stations. Over all, the Comptroller said, New York is "a very well-managed city." But the sheer size of the city's physical assets, combined with the cost of maintaining them and their age -- many of them are rapidly reaching the end of their typical life span -- makes it difficult to find a single solution.
The 900-page report, in the works for 18 months, reflects the varied needs and the ways in which small items can quickly add up:
*The city has 223 firehouses, many of which were built decades ago and not designed to handle modern, 12,000-pound fire engines. As a result, floors in 125 firehouses are in danger of buckling, or have already begun to give way. Although the Fire Department has shored up the floors, it only has had the money to fix 46 floors.
*The city's East River bridges -- the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg and Queensboro Bridges -- are undergoing a $3.2 billion rehabilitation. Of the city's 838 other bridges, more than 70 percent are in poor or fair condition. The report says 148 bridges are expected to deteriorate from good condition to fair condition in the next 10 years if maintenance is not increased.
*The report projects a shortage of beds in homeless shelters in two years. By 2007, a shortage of between 1,556 and 4,800 beds is predicted. There are no plans to build more shelters.
*By 2007, 1,060 miles of water mains -- about one-sixth of the system -- will be more than 100 years old, which is their predicted life span. The city only has money to replace 204 miles.
*More than 340 of the city's 468 subway stations need major renovations, at an estimated cost of $5.96 billion. The transit agency expects to spend about $1.82 billion on the repairs in the next five years.
"The title of the study is 'Dilemma in the Millennium,' " Mr. Hevesi said. "And it is a dilemma, it really is."
The city does not have the money to fix everything. And, the Comptroller said that even if the money was available, it would be impossible to do so much construction at the same time. The very effort of digging up pipes, tearing up highways and closing off buildings for repair could bring chaos.
In addition, the city is still paying off debts from financing past projects. Now, about 16 percent of the city's tax revenues go toward paying off its debt, according to the city's Independent Budget Office.
"There is a real tension between the need to spend additional money on infrastructure and the need to control debt service," Douglas A. Criscitello, director of that budget office, said, adding that his office projected that the debt service should reach 18.6 percent by 2002.
"It seems to go in cycles," he said. "The city backed away from some of its capital needs after the 70's fiscal crisis and recommitted in the 1980's. It dipped in the early 90's and has gone back up since then. It tracks the economy."
Samuel I. Schwartz, director of Cooper Union's Infrastructure Institute, said that the city's spending on infrastructure began to drop after World War II and that this accelerated after the 1970's fiscal crisis.
"At the turn of the century, there were 200 workers cleaning the Brooklyn Bridge," said Mr. Schwartz, a former chief engineer for the city's Transportation Department. "By the mid-1980's, there were three."
Mr. Schwartz said the city faced a longstanding problem since deferring maintenance would create greater spending needs in the future. He said the city should consider setting aside money, perhaps from its budget surplus, for annual maintenance.
"The Williamsburg Bridge is a terrific example," he said, citing continuing repairs to the 98-year-old bridge, which also needed extensive maintenance in the 1980's. "Had we maintained the bridge properly, in 1990 dollars we would have spent $190 million over 90 years. Instead, we are going to have to spend in excess of $400 million while we suffer enormous delays due to lane closings."
It is not absolutely necessary that every city asset is in perfect working order, Mr. Hevesi, the Comptroller, said, provided that the city has a plan to manage problems associated with an aging system. The city's Environmental Protection Department, for example, contends that it is more effective to replace water mains during street repairs, or when there is an indication of a problem, than to rip up existing mains based on their age.
Joel A. Miele, the city's Environmental Protection Commissioner, said age was not the primary cause of water main breaks, even when the mains were more than 100 years old. Mr. Miele said the number of main breaks each year had remained constant during the 50 years that the department has kept records. (The 11-year average is 576 breaks, and there were 461 last year.)
Mr. Miele said he did not believe that the department needed any more money to manage safely the water system. He pointed out that the department had kept the number of breaks down and was developing a new computer system to track the condition of water and sewer lines across the city.
"We are very comfortable with the schedule we have," Mr. Miele said.
Improvements to infrastructure are often costly and can be practically invisible to the general public, and therefore are not a favorite topic of politicians. "I can't recall any politician who ran successfully on the issue of infrastructure," said Roy Sparrow, a professor at New York University's School of Public Service.
On the other hand, Mr. Sparrow said, what made New York into a great city was a long-term investment in bridges, ports, railways and roads. The city, he added, is now coming the limit of that investment.
"We are living on past capital," he said.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE ATTACKS: THE CONNECTION;
Doubts Grow That Taliban Would Give Up Terrorist Mastermind to the U.S.

BYLINE: By STEVE LeVINE and RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Aug. 24

 BODY:
With Osama bin Laden having apparently survived the barrage of missiles rained down on his stronghold across the border in Afghanistan, the United States still has the problem of how to get its hands on the man it considers the No. 1 terrorist.
One possibility that has been floated is for the United States to negotiate with the Taliban, the Islamic movement that controls most of Afghanistan, to surrender Mr. bin Laden -- perhaps in exchange for several million dollars in aid or even diplomatic recognition. 
 But diplomats who have dealt with the Taliban doubt that anything could come of such negotiations, particularly with their anger over Thursday's attack.
Furthermore, the Taliban have repeatedly failed to keep promises to United Nations agencies and Western governments -- promises to stop the opium trade, to form a broad-based government and to ease its restrictions on women, like forbidding them to work or to get higher education.
Diplomats and experts say the Taliban will not relinquish Mr. bin Laden largely because of his relationship to Mohammad Omar, the "supreme" leader of the Taliban.
Mr. Omar, 39, is rarely heard from or seen in public, keeping company mostly with a small group of subordinates in the Taliban's leadership council. Mr. bin Laden is one of the few individuals outside this group whom Mr. Omar has permitted to become close to him.
Both men were part of the mujahedeen movement, which waged war against the Soviet Union during its military intervention in Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989. But they did not meet then.
Mr. Omar is said to have fought with a moderate faction and emerged from the war a virtual unknown.
Mr. bin Laden, who inherited a fortune that his father earned building roads in Saudi Arabia, commanded a unit of volunteers under the nom de guerre Abu Abdullah and earned a reputation for being courageous and charismatic. His unit captured the southeastern Afghan city of Khost, in the area bombed on Thursday night. He lost the toes on his left foot in combat.
Not long after the 1989 Soviet withdrawal, Mr. bin Laden, who was not welcome in his native Saudi Arabia because of support for militants, moved to the Sudan and lived in a spacious, well-guarded home on a dusty road in the capital, Khartoum.
It was in the Sudan that Mr. bin Laden, along with building roads, reportedly began to finance militant Islamic movements and assaults against governments he opposed. In 1993, he reportedly sent his operatives into Somalia to attack the American-led peacekeeping mission.
Under pressure from the United States and Saudi Arabia, the Sudan deported him, along with other alleged terrorists, in 1996.
Mr. bin Laden returned to Afghanistan, which was racked by civil war. The mujahedeen leaders ensconced in Kabul, the capital, were fighting among themselves. And a new group had emerged -- the Taliban, whose core fighters came out of Saudi-financed religious schools in Pakistan.
In two years, the Taliban had risen to capture the entire south and most of the west of Afghanistan.
But the Taliban military drive stalled. Its financial resources had all but dried up, and diplomats and Western relief officials who visited the movement's center in Kandahar, the traditional royal capital, believed that it had peaked and was on the decline.
Then Pakistani intelligence officers, who were backing the Taliban, introduced its leaders to a new, wealthy friend -- Mr. bin Laden. Money traditionally plays a key role in Afghan political and military shifts, by winning the fealty of local leaders.
Mr. bin Laden gave $3 million to the movement, said Afghans and diplomats familiar with the transaction, a sum that could go a long way in the poor nation.
With the money in hand, the Taliban and their Pakistani allies began a round of visits to important militia commanders in eastern Afghanistan. These local leaders were plied with cash and threats of lost power, and many agreed to ally themselves with the Taliban.
In a sweep in the beginning of September 1996, the Taliban rushed north with little resistance, capturing Jalalabad. Ten days later, Kabul fell.
Mr. Omar's gratitude to Mr. bin Laden was quickly apparent. Mr. bin Laden, his three wives and a 160-member coterie shifted south to Kandahar. There the two men were often seen together, and an enormous house was built for Mr. bin Laden.
Mr. Omar remains financially beholden to Mr. bin Laden. Economically destitute and considered a renegade movement by much of the world, the Taliban have few sources of income. Chief among them has been opium. Western diplomats said this week that the opium production in areas it controls was increasing and that there were heroin-processing labs inside Afghanistan.
A Pakistan official here said that if Mr. bin Laden was giving the Taliban $10 million a year -- no one knows the real amount -- it would be a lot in the desperately poor country.
In the last few days, Mr. Omar has demonstrated his loyalty.
"We will never hand Osama over to anyone," Mr. Omar said last week. "We will protect him with our blood at all cost."
The air strikes are not likely to diminish that loyalty, diplomats said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
British Air Likely to Buy Airbus Planes

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME, Aug. 24

 BODY:
British Airways, in a blow to the Boeing Company, is expected to announce its first purchase from the rival Airbus Industrie, awarding a contract this week for as many as 259 medium-range, single-aisle planes worth $11 billion, managers at one of the companies said.
The order, if all options are exercised, would be the largest to Airbus by a European airline, as well as British Airways' first break in recent years with Boeing, its main supplier. 
 British Airways, which is the biggest European carrier, is also buying long-haul Boeing 777 jets. The combined purchases are expected to be the basis of an overhaul of the British carrier's routes, which will emphasize point-to-point flights, rather than using feeder aircraft to bring passengers to major hubs, like Heathrow, London's principal airport.
Initially, British Airways is expected to order 59 planes in the Airbus A320 family, with options for as many as 200 more. The value of the orders reflects the planes' list price, but airlines usually receive a discount on large and long-term agreements.
The order -- which could be announced as early as Tuesday, when Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain is to visit Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France -- would be especially welcome to Airbus at a time when the Asian economic crisis has taken a toll. The big Asian carriers had been the mainstay of its business in recent years.
Seeking to portray British Airways' anticipated order as gain for Boeing as well, an executive for the Seattle-based company said late today that Boeing planned on Tuesday to announce a British Airways order for 16 777's and options to buy 16 more, worth about $5 billion based on current list prices.
Still, airline-industry analysts called the Airbus decision a defeat for Boeing in its effort to sell an updated version of its 737. It was the second major European victory for Airbus this year; in February Iberia, the Spanish airline, decided to order as many as 76 medium-haul jets worth $4 billion from Airbus, instead of the 737.
"In this segment, Airbus has put not only its foot in the door, but its whole leg," said Raymond E. Neidl, of Furman Selz in New York. "It's a big loss for Boeing."
Although neither company would confirm the reports, rumors had circulated for some time that British Airways would place an order with Airbus, because of both the European consortium's aggressive pricing and its political access. British Airways said in February that it would ask Boeing and Airbus for bids for short-haul planes to replace aging ones for regional European subsidiaries.
At the time, British Airways executives said they wanted to buy about 30 medium-range planes, worth about $975 million, with options on 70 more, which would have taken the order up to roughly $3.2 billion.
The much larger order appears to reflect the rapid pace of deregulation in Europe, and the challenge posed by heightened competition, both from strengthened mainstream carriers, like Lufthansa, and from newer, no-frills airlines. Earlier this year, British Airways joined the no-frills battle, with a low-fare affiliate called Go.
The Airbus family of single-aisle A320's, which began chipping away at Boeing's 737 about a decade ago, comprises the A320, which carries as many as 150 passengers; the A319, with up to 126 passengers, and the A321, which also carries up to 150.
If British Airways takes delivery of all 259 planes, Airbus would be likely to outstrip Boeing as the carrier's leading provider of aircraft. British Airways has about 350 planes in its fleet.
Still, it appeared that Boeing would not be a total loser. Earlier this month, Robert Ayling, British Airways' chief executive, said the carrier would also order long-haul, wide-bodied jets to meet its future needs as airline deregulation progresses in Europe, and many industry experts expect it to choose Boeing's 777. In the past, British Airways has mainly flown Boeing 747's, 757's, 767's and 777's.
The driving forces behind the British fleet overhaul are moves by the Continent's airlines to deregulation, and British Airways' proposed alliance with American Airlines. Under conditions set by the European Commission for the alliance with American, an AMR Corporation unit, British Airways will have to rely heavily on wide-bodied planes like the 777 for point-to-point flights, while the short-haul Airbus fleet will be used on domestic British and European routes.
Airbus is working to transform itself from a consortium of four European aircraft makers -- Aerospatiale of France, Daimler-Benz Aerospace, British Aerospace P.L.C. and Construcciones Aeronauticas of Spain -- into a single corporation that would be a linchpin of a restructured European aerospace and arms industry.
In July, giving in to British and German pressure, France announced it would relinquish full Government control of Aerospatiale, the nation's largest aerospace company, by selling a big stake to Groupe Lagardere and offering shares on the stock market.

HEADLINE: U.S. Forest Service Hopes to Buy a Costly, but Picture-Perfect, Slice of West

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: JEMEZ SPRINGS, N.M.

 BODY:
In what would be the largest purchase of private land by the United States Forest Service in at least a quarter-century, Congress and the Clinton Administration are working together on a deal for the Baca Ranch, a 95,000-acre expanse of pristine meadows and fir-covered mountains so emblematic of the West that it has served as backdrop for Stetson hat advertisements and Marlboro Man billboards.
For Hollywood directors, Madison Avenue advertisers, or the rare invited guest, the appeal of the isolated greensward cupped in the walls of an ancient volcano is often the same. The family-owned Baca Ranch imparts a rare sense of discovery. Driving on Route 4 over a dark and winding mountain pass, the visitor suddenly emerges into a "Lost Horizon" world of hot springs, trout streams and meadows of wildflowers, where cattle and the state's largest elk herd graze side by side. 
 But the same sense of wide-open Western independence evoked by the vistas has prevented the sale of the land for years. And the deal that is being negotiated for the ranch, which has been owned by one family for almost 40 years, is as much about Western attitudes toward public land as it is about money.
The Administration has long supported the purchase of the ranch, which has been called "the hole in the doughnut" because it is an island surrounded by the Santa Fe National Forest. Last February on a visit to New Mexico, President Clinton even had Air Force One make a detour to fly over the ranch for a better view of its dominant feature -- the 15-mile-wide crater of the dormant volcano.
Republicans, noting that almost one-third of New Mexico is already owned by the Federal Government, have long opposed further purchases. But in August, Republican sentiment began shifting dramatically.
Under legislation drafted by Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, the Baca would be a separate unit of the National Forest system, owned by the United States Forest Service, but managed by a trust, comprised of members appointed by the President. This board would be charged with responding to local concerns and making the park economically self-sustaining.
In addition, Mr. Domenici's bill would tie an agreement to buy the ranch to legislation intended to speed sales of lands owned by the Bureau of Land Management that the agency has decided it does not need.
Republicans, particularly those in Western states, are eager to free up more Federal land for private development.
Mr. Domenici said today that the sale of such land could increase support among Western senators for his legislation, to be introduced early next month.
"I think we could get set aside, this fall, $20 million to $40 million," Mr. Domenici said, "money that says to the owners we are going to do business."
 Reflecting this new Republican interest, the Baca Ranch was visited on Monday by three Republican House members, Bill Redmond, of northern New Mexico; James V. Hansen of Utah, who chairs the National Parks and Public Lands subcommittee of the House Resources Committee, and Ralph Regula of Ohio, the chairman of the Interior subcommittee of the Appropriations committee. After a tour by helicopter and jeep, Mr. Redmond described the Baca as the "Grand Canyon of northern New Mexico."
The last time the owners, the Dunigans, an oil family from Abilene, Tex., expressed interest in selling the ranch, in 1980, the price was $55 million. Competition for the land between the National Park Service and the National Forest Service, as well as the death of the family patriarch, James Patrick Dunigan, squelched any sale.
Although new appraisals have not been completed, the 1998 price could easily be twice as high.
Driving up the price, and public interest, is tremendous population growth in Santa Fe and Albuquerque, two of the state's three largest cities, which are about 90 minutes by car from the ranch. In 1915, when President Woodrow Wilson first considered buying the ranch, recreational tourism was an embryonic activity. Now, more than three million people visit the Santa Fe National Forest every year.
"The Baca could be the Rocky Mountain National Park for the new Santa Fe-Albuquerque megalopolis," said Roger G. Kennedy, a former National Park Service director who lives in Santa Fe, referring to the Colorado park that draws many of its visitors from Denver and Boulder.
 Mr. Kennedy, who ran the National Park Service until 1996, said acquisition of the Baca Ranch was similar to the purchase of land for national parks at the start of the century.
"It's the largest piece of inviolate land anywhere near a major city," he said. "Everything else that size is either very remote or very ugly. This is beautiful and close."
The ranch began to approach its present form about one million years ago, when two massive explosions blew the top off a volcano here, sending 100 cubic miles of ash and lava into the air, some of it reaching what is now Kansas.
In modern times, Indians from the Jemez and Santa Clara pueblos hunted the area in the summer. In 1860, Congress settled a land dispute among ranchers by giving the area to heirs of Luis Maria Cabeza de Vaca, a Mexican sheep rancher. From 1926 to 1962, the ranch was owned by the Bond family, who first grazed sheep, then cattle on the land. Separately, a timber company heavily logged about half of the forest area.
"It's a smaller kind of Yellowstone, with a number of hot spots in the streams," said Frank M. Bond, a Santa Fe lawyer, recalling childhood summers spent on the remote ranch. "Because it has a much more temperate climate that the rest of the Rockies, it has a greater number of bird species."
On a recent afternoon, red-tailed hawks could be seen circling meadows, looking for prairie dogs that popped in and out of their holes. Grouse, mourning doves, flickers and bluebirds abound in this private reserve, which ranges from grasslands and aspens in the valleys to spruce and fir at high elevations, up to 11,000 feet.
In 1962, James Patrick Dunigan bought the ranch for $2.5 million and began gentler management. Through expensive court battles, he ended the timber lease and stopped most of the logging. Mr. Dunigan died in 1980, in the midst of negotiations to sell the ranch to the Federal Government.
His heirs have maintained his management pattern, avoiding overgrazing and logging largely for the health of the forest. Giving priority to the elk, which were reintroduced after World War II, the ranch now maintains more than two elk for every cow -- about 7,000 elk and 3,000 cows.
"I personally have always thought we have been here as caretakers," Anne Dunigan Wilson, Mr. Dunigan's widow, said on a recent visit to a fieldstone hunting lodge her husband had built here.
Andrew Dunigan, one of her sons, said the family has set a December deadline for Congress to show that it is serious about buying the property.
"We are offering the Government and the American people the first opportunity to buy the property," said Mr. Dunigan, a private investor in Dallas. "This is clearly one of the most desirable trophy ranches. There has been great interest over the years by private individuals, some conservation-oriented, some development-oriented."
County zoning allows for houses to be built on lots as small as three quarters of an acre. With growing demand by New Mexico's city dwellers for second homes in the mountains, the threat is real.
"Mobile homes with skirts around them -- that's the specter now," said Dave Simon, regional director of the National Parks and Conservation Association, a group in Washington. As he bounced in a van along a ranch road, Mr. Simon added: "There is constant pressure on ranchers up here to develop. The best places up here would be cherry-picked for development."
The threat of development has caused many conservationists to rally behind the new bipartisan efforts to preserve the area. But environmentalists and the Administration insist that any board be charged with putting conservation values ahead of economic values in running the ranch as a park.
"The resource values of this property must come first," Kathleen McGinty, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said in a statement after visiting the ranch in July. "The trustees may not sacrifice those values in an effort to make the property financially self-sufficient."
While aides of Republican and Democratic Congressional members work to hammer out legislative language by Labor Day, negotiations are spurred by the thought of the Baca Ranch being sold to developers.
"I would hate to see it divided up and sold off," said Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, and a longtime advocate of public ownership of the ranch. "I think prospects are good that we can go ahead when Congress reconvenes."

Fed Reports Decline in Loans to Large Businesses

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Business loans to large customers declined in the second quarter, the first decline since the first quarter of 1996, according to a survey by the Federal Reserve.
The Fed said today that in general the survey provided additional evidence of narrowing of interest-rate spreads but smaller changes in other terms and in lending standards. 
 The Fed said 9 percent of domestic respondents indicated that demand for loans to large customers had softened, attributing the weakness to decreased merger and acquisition activity, lower investment in plant and equipment and more financing from nonbank loan sources. The use of internally generated funds and a decrease in needs for inventory financing also contributed to the lower demand, the Fed said.
The Fed polled 57 domestic banks and American branches of foreign banks for the quarterly survey.
It showed few changes in standards for commercial and industrial loans to middle-sized and large corporate customers among domestic respondents. Just 5 percent of banks eased standards to smaller firms, while 15 percent reported narrowing spreads on loans to medium and large firms, down from 35 percent in the May survey.
In July, acting Comptroller of Currency Julie Williams said a similar survey by her office found banks more willing to accept downside risk "without commensurate potential upside return."

Census Sampling Ruled A Violation of U.S. Law
A Federal court unanimously ruled that the Census Bureau's plans to use statistical sampling to supplement the 2000 census violated Federal law.

HEADLINE: Fatalities From Drunken Driving Drop, but Total Traffic Deaths Hold Steady

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

 BODY:
New figures on traffic deaths, released yesterday by Federal safety regulators, showed that campaigns against drunken driving are producing some success even as the overall number of deaths on the nation's roads remains stubbornly high.
Alcohol-related traffic deaths in the United States dropped by 1,029 last year, a 6 percent decrease from 1996. But the overall number of traffic deaths was virtually unchanged as 931 more people were killed in crashes that did not involve alcohol, a 3.7 percent increase, according to statistics released yesterday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Transportation Department. 
 Traffic deaths involving alcohol plunged in the 1980's but had been showing signs of leveling off until the release of yesterday's data. Alcohol was involved in only 38.6 percent of all traffic deaths last year, the lowest percentage since the Federal Government began keeping records in 1975.
Karolyn Nunnallee, the president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, said that the decrease in 1997 appeared to reflect a public reaction to the Princess of Wales's death in a car crash on Aug. 31 last year, and to a long-running fight in Congress over whether to require states to lower the minimum level of alcohol in blood at which a driver is considered legally drunk.
Tests after the crash that killed Diana found that her driver had consumed several times the quantity of alcohol necessary to be considered drunk in the United States. Congress ended up passing legislation recently that gives extra highway construction money to states with lower alcohol minimums but does not require states to adopt such rules.
Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater attributed last year's decrease in alcohol-related deaths to a steady toughening of state laws against drunken driving and growing public awareness of the problem. The statistics on alcohol-related deaths include drunken pedestrians who are hit by automobiles, as well as drunken drivers.
The rise in deaths not involving alcohol has proved troublesome for safety experts. Dr. Ricardo Martinez, the highway safety agency's administrator, said there were more fatal crashes in daytime, when alcohol is seldom a factor. The increase probably signals that Americans are driving farther each year because of the strong economy, Dr. Martinez said yesterday in an interview.
Yesterday's report estimated that the number of Americans killed for every 100 million miles driven had been steady at about 1.7 since 1992, after falling steeply for decades before then.
The precise death rate may have edged down slightly last year, because Americans drove about 2 percent farther while the overall number of deaths edged down two-tenths of 1 percent. But because of the considerable uncertainty involved in estimating how far Americans drive, the safety agency always rounds off its death rate figures to a single decimal place, and last year's death rate still rounded to 1.7.
Federal regulators have been increasingly worried in recent months that extra deaths may be caused by soaring sales over the last several years of so-called light trucks. These include sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, which roll over more often.
Yesterday's report found that 36 percent of the sport utility vehicles involved in fatal crashes last year had rolled over, compared with 24 percent of pickups, 20 percent of vans and 15 percent of cars. The agency also released separate statistics showing that light trucks were involved in an unusually large and growing number of fatal, two-vehicle collisions last year, although most of the deaths occurred in the cars they hit.
Dr. Martinez said that the very different designs of cars and light trucks were a subject of regulatory concern, but that his agency was looking at data from many years rather than drawing conclusions from a single year's statistics.
"That is an emerging trend that we want to get ahead of the curve on," said Dr. Martinez, a former emergency room physician.
The safety agency said that the number of traffic deaths involving alcohol had fallen to 16,189 last year. The number of traffic deaths that did not involve alcohol rose to 25,778, leaving a drop of 98 in the total number of deaths, to 41,967.

HEADLINE: COURT VOIDS PLAN TO USE SAMPLING FOR 2000 CENSUS

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
A Federal court ruled unanimously today that the Census Bureau's plans to use statistical sampling to supplement the 2000 census violated Federal law.
The Census Bureau had hoped to use sampling to avoid a repetition of the 1990 census, which missed 8.4 million people and counted 4.4 million either twice or in the wrong place while relying exclusively on traditional head-counting. 
 Those who stood to gain by sampling included minority groups, whose members have been disproportionately undercounted.
The issue has achieved a heightened importance because census data are used to apportion House seats and draw boundaries for Congressional districts. With House Republicans holding a razor-thin majority, both parties are acutely conscious of any question that might give one side an advantage.
Beyond the partisan wrangling, the issue is of grave concern to cities because some Federal money is allocated on the basis of population.
The decision was welcomed by Congressional Republicans, whose leader, Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, had brought the lawsuit against the Census Bureau and the Commerce Department. Excerpts, Page A13. The Republicans contended sampling would lead to new errors and be subject to political manipulation. But it dismayed Democrats, who thought that the system would count minority voters missed under recent censuses and that counting them would produce new Congressional and legislative districts likely to vote Democratic.
Opponents of sampling said that the method violated Federal law and the Constitution, which declared that the Federal Government was required to conduct an "actual enumeration" every 10 years. But the special three-judge panel, specifically charged by Congress with hearing census issues, sidestepped the constitutional issue and ruled that the scheme was not permitted under the 1957 and 1976 Federal laws that govern the census. The unanimous decision stressed that the court found no need to decide whether sampling was constitutional because it said the Clinton Administration had wrongly interpreted the Federal law.
The decision can be appealed directly to the Supreme Court, and the Administration is expected to do so.
The judges deciding the issue today were Douglas Ginsburg, an appellate court judge, and Royce C. Lamberth, a district court judge, both appointed by President Ronald Reagan, and Ricardo Urbina, a district court judge named by President Clinton. The panel issued an injunction prohibiting the Census Bureau from using statistical sampling in the next census. In the meantime, the ruling is expected to provide ammunition to Republicans who have been waging a protracted political and legislative battle against sampling.
"I hope this gets the Administration's attention," said Representative Dan Miller, a Florida Republican who is chairman of the House subcommittee on the census. "This is a unanimous decision -- one judge appointed by President Clinton. The wise thing to do is put all their resources into a full enumeration."
But proponents of sampling said today they still hoped for a favorable decision from the Supreme Court. "Ultimately, it will be before the Supreme Court," said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Manhattan Democrat. "Nothing has really changed. The nation needs an accurate count that includes everyone."
The Census Bureau's planned sampling methodology was loosely similar to that of public opinion polls in that it would extrapolate information about the population from partial data. But the bureau's plans are more sophisticated. They involve using traditional methods to count everyone in 90 percent of the households in a census tract -- a neighborhood of about 1,700 dwellings. Data from the 90 percent would be used to determine the number and characteristics of the remaining 10 percent, and a further adjustment of the population would be made on the basis of a survey of 750,000 households.
Today's decision was particularly galling to representatives of undercounted minority groups. "It's inexplicable," said Eric Rodriguez, senior policy analyst with the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy organization. "I don't understand it. We had an undercount of 5 percent of the Latino population in 1990. If this ruling is upheld we have no reason to expect anything but a 5 percent undercount this time."
Because of large concentrations of blacks in inner cities and increased numbers of immigrants, mainly in the Southwest -- two groups that have notoriously low response rates to mailed census questionnaires -- the 1990 census was the first in modern history to miss more people than the census that preceded it.
Today's ruling turned on an interpretation of two seemingly contradictory provisions in the Census Acts of 1957 and 1976. The 1957 act said that "except for the determination of population for apportionment purposes," the Secretary of Commerce "may, where he deems it appropriate, authorize the use of the statistical method known as sampling." The wording codified the practice of sending the census long form -- the questionnaire that asks how many bathrooms there are in the home, for example -- to one in six households.
In 1976, Congress changed the language of the law, saying that except for purposes of reapportionment, the Commerce Secretary "shall" authorize the use of sampling.
Justice Department lawyers had argued that by changing the wording to make sampling mandatory rather than optional, Congress had effectively removed the prohibition against it for reapportionment purposes. Further they argued that in 1976 Congress added amendments -- Section 141 -- to the act that directed the Commerce Secretary to conduct a census every 10 years "in such form and content as he may determine, including the use of sampling procedures and special surveys."
In today's ruling, written by Judge Lamberth, the panel disagreed with the Justice Department's reasoning.
"Though defendants' interpretation of the except/shall sentence structure is proper in some instances, the court finds it to be strained and incorrect when applied to the amended section 195," he wrote. He stressed the importance of the census to the balance of power in Congress between parties and between states, and said it was hard to imagine that Congress would change the rules without explicitly saying so. He quoted from Justice William H. Rehnquist in a 1980 decision:
"In a case where the construction of legislative language such as this makes so sweeping and so relatively unorthodox a change as that made here, I think judges as well as detectives may take into consideration the fact that a watchdog did not bark in the night."
In bargaining last November over the spending bill that covered the Census Bureau, Mr. Gingrich won Administration agreement to allow general tax revenues to pay for the litigation, a deal that enraged many House Democrats.
"They bought him the gun and said 'shoot me,' " said a Democratic staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity, "and the court did."
The White House was confident the court would rule that Mr. Gingrich lacked standing to bring the suit since he could not show how the bureau's plans would cause injury to the House. White House lawyers were also confident that the court would decide that because the Administration and Republicans were still haggling, the case was not yet "ripe" for a court ruling.
Today's ruling went against the Administration on both counts.
 
Proposal for 2000 Census Involves 3 Sets of Samples
A plan proposed by the Census Bureau to use statistical sampling to augment the 2000 census would use three sets of samples. The first set would check a selection of houses in a given census tract -- about 1,700 households -- that are presumed to be vacant. The second would check a proportion of residences from which forms were not returned. And the last would be a random nationwide sample to check for accuracy.
The Postal Service in 2000 will probably estimate that 5 percent of the 119 million residential addresses in the country are vacant, the Census Bureau said. Normally, census forms are not sent to those addresses. But studies have shown that at least 11 percent of the homes the Postal Service said were empty were, in fact, occupied.
The bureau, rather than sending forms, would send counters to 1 in 10 of the houses that Postal Service records show as vacant. The number of those dwellings found to be occupied, and the number of people living in them would then be used to estimate the population in housing units that were thought to be vacant nationwide.
In 1990, the bureau sent enumerators to the 35 percent of all addresses that did not return their mail-in census forms. In 2000, the percentage visited would depend on how many households in each census tract mailed in their forms. If 80 percent of the households in a tract returned a form, the bureau would visit half of those houses that did not respond. If 30 percent of the addresses mailed the forms, census takers would visit 6 out of 7 of those households that did not respond.
The bureau's goal was to have a response by mail or visit from 90 percent of the dwellings in each of the country's 60,000 census tracts. Using the information gathered, the bureau would estimate the number and characteristics of the remaining 10 percent.
Finally, the bureau would randomly select 750,000 households nationwide, making sure that each state and all racial, age, economic and other demographic groups were represented. This sample would be used as a "quality control" to check the accuracy of the bureau's efforts and to make adjustments where necessary.

HEADLINE: Putting Money Where Their Minds Are;
Where Scientists Gather, Wagering Flourishes

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ; James Glanz writes for Science magazine.

 BODY:
AFTER escaping Germany within months of Hitler's rise to power in 1933 and wandering the world separately for 15 years, Maurice and Gerson Goldhaber were ready for the most ordinary of brotherly relationships when they reunited as particle physicists in the United States. So when Gerson was engaged in the experiment of his life, racing to discover a speck of antimatter called the antiproton, Maurice did what just about any scientist in a close family might do: He bet a colleague $500 that the antiproton did not exist.
Far from showing disloyalty, Dr. Goldhaber was merely carrying on a noble tradition -- wagering on the outcome of scientific questions -- that seems as pervasive in labs, observatories and supercomputer centers as pools on college basketball tournaments are in office parks and machine shops. 
 The tradition was already alive when titans like Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton were setting the foundations of modern science -- and making bets.
This century's savants have ponied up on everything from the properties of matter's tiniest building blocks to the fate of the entire universe. The stakes generally range from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars, often in the form of pricey dinners or expensive liquor -- and in at least one instance, 100 gallons of gasoline.
"Many bottles of the finest champagnes and malt whiskies, and even more esoteric stakes, rest in abeyance while observers struggle to count rare photons from remote galaxies," wrote Dr. James Peebles of Princeton University and Dr. Joseph Silk of the University of California at Berkeley in the journal Nature a few years ago.
Such bets are "a way to focus attention on what are the really key issues," Dr. Peebles said in an interview. Others think that because scientific betting is as common as shooting craps in a Damon Runyon story, the custom must say something important about physical research.
"There's often a stereotype that scientists are out to create a ground plan of the universe and that they believe their theories with religious fervor," said Dr. Robert P. Crease, a philosopher of science at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. "Bets are interesting, because they reveal the game-like quality with which scientists often approach their work."
But others are far from seeing anything so significant in scientific bets. Dr. Margaret Geller, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, called them "sort of disgusting." She said, "It has always struck me as one of the rather unsophisticated macho aspects of these fields."
Added Sir Martin Rees, an astrophysicist at Cambridge University, "I actually think it is rather frivolous to make them." In a scientific disagreement, professional reputations are the stakes that count, he said.
Maybe so, but the scientific tote board lights up with remarkable frequency. For decades at the old Bell Laboratories (now part of Lucent Technologies) in New Jersey, a betting "book" lay in the tearoom, where scientists gathered for discussions each day at 4 P.M., recalled Dr. Pierre Hohenberg, a physicist who is now a deputy provost at Yale University. "A few of us were ideologically inclined to say that arguments should end up with a bet," Dr. Hohenberg said. "Talk is cheap."
The handwritten, laboratory-style notebook recorded bets on highly technical subjects like competing explanations for superconductivity, in which certain chilled materials transmit electricity without resistance. It also contained more general wagers on political and economic issues. The book disappeared from the tearoom around 1990, perhaps stolen by a sore loser. Long before then, however, a chance remark by a regular bettor at Bell Labs inspired a similar book on the opposite coast.
"On the front page it says, 'The Official SLAC Theory Group Record of Wagers,' " said Michael Peskin of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in California. It contains 28 pages of mostly scientific bets dating to 1984.
His own proudest entry, he said, is a winning bet against Dr. Sidney Drell at SLAC regarding the existence and mass of the top quark, an elementary particle discovered to much fanfare in 1995. "Dinner for four," said Dr. Peskin with satisfaction.
The German astronomer Johannes Kepler is believed to have begun the game in 1600, when he was given the problem of figuring out Mars's orbit around the Sun from astronomical observations made by his mentor, Tycho Brahe. Kepler took over the problem from a senior Brahe assistant, Longomontanus.
Kepler bet Longomontanus he would crack the problem in a week or so, said Dr. James Voelkel, a historian of science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The stakes are not known, but Longomontanus won going away: It took Kepler five years to find the solution.
That set the stage for what was "undoubtedly one of the most crucial wagers in scientific history," said Dr. Alan E. Shapiro, a historian of science at the University of Minnesota. Kepler's pondering had produced his three laws of planetary motion, which describe the elliptical orbits and how fast planets moved in them. Unfortunately, nobody knew why planets would behave like that.
So as a way to spark competition, Christopher Wren, the English architect and scientist, announced in 1684 that he would give a book worth 40 shillings to anyone who, within two months, could deduce Kepler's laws from the inverse-square law that says the Sun's gravity decreases with the square of the planet's distance from the Sun. Isaac Newton's paper on his solution grew into his Principia, the tract that became a cornerstone of modern physics. "The rest is history," Dr. Shapiro said. By the time he published it, however, years had passed, and Newton could not cash in his winning ticket.
High-profile wagers among scientists continued to crop up from time to time in the 1700's and 1800's. For reasons no one can quite explain, however, the 20th century has been the Monte Carlo night of scientific culture. "In my life I have made countless bets on science; I may not be able to remember all of them," said Dr. Walter Lewin, an astronomer at M.I.T.
Even so, some notable players complain that there is not enough action to go around. "Most scientists are not interested in bets," said Dr. Michael Turner an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago, still fuming after a conference where no one would make a new bet with him on the rate at which the universe is expanding, called the Hubble constant.
"Bets imply a certain irrationality or in-your-face attitude," Dr. Turner said. "I love 'em."
Like a gambler blowing ostentatiously on his dice, Dr. Turner stands out in his enthusiasm, but he is hardly alone. Relating a not-so-unusual episode in his book "The Neglect of Experiment" (Cambridge, 1986), the historian Allan Franklin counted no fewer than three separate bets on tests of whether "parity" -- a kind of left-right symmetry -- was preserved in subatomic interactions.
The late physicist Richard P. Feynman, for example, gave 50-to-1 odds on a dollar bet and paid off when experiments in 1957 showed that the laws of physics were not quite the same when left and right and up and down were reversed, as in a mirror -- just as predicted by two theorists, T. D. Lee and C. N. Yang.
Nearly everyone involved in those bets eventually won a Nobel Prize in physics for one reason or another. Betting by leading scientists continues to the present: Dr. William Phillips of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, who shared a 1997 Nobel, has $100 plus interest riding on whether or not unexplained surprises turn up in the physics of the quantum microworld any time over the next 50 years.
In his wager with Dr. Benjamin Bederson of New York University, Dr. Phillips said he bet against surprises bigger than just a new particle or force, "but I'd love to be wrong."
A similarly high-minded detachment marks the skein of bets made by the cosmologist Stephen W. Hawking. The bets, several of them made with Dr. Kip Thorne and Dr. John Preskill of the California Institute of Technology, often involve the properties of black holes -- massive, collapsed bodies whose gravity is so intense that even light cannot escape. This tone is not always reflected in the stakes: Dr. Thorne won a subscription to Penthouse magazine in one bet against Dr. Hawking.
Often the stakes involve expensive liquor.
That tradition may have been started in the 1950's by Dr. Walter Baade, an astronomer at the Palomar Observatory in California. Dr. Baade bet his colleague Rudolph Minkowski, a bottle of Hudson's Bay Procurable whisky that a strange-looking galaxy spewing radio waves was really a pair of galaxies in collision. Dr. Minkowski conceded the bet and then drank most of the whisky anyway. Justice might have been served, since colliding galaxies fell out of favor a few years thereafter.
In the shadow of Dr. Baade and Dr. Minkowski, Dr. Peebles of Princeton is referee for an international bet on the value of the Hubble constant, a number that describes the rate of expansion of the universe. The stakes: a case of single malt scotch. Dr. Lewin of M.I.T., in two separate astronomical bets, staked a dozen bottles of whisky against a pound of caviar; and six bottles of "superb" champagne against three of cognac and three of champagne. Marc Davis of Berkeley agreed to wager "a case of the best wine from Italy against the best California wine" with an Italian physicist on the size of the largest structures in the cosmos.
Near the end of the oil crisis, almost 20 years ago, Dr. Frank Shu of the University of California at Berkeley bet Dr. George Djorgovski of Caltech 100 gallons of gasoline that by Jan. 1, 2001, theorists will have determined several crucial cosmic parameters to within 20 percent. One such parameter is the mass density of the entire universe -- still a notoriously controversial number. In view of the oil shortage, Dr. Shu and Dr. Djorgovski stipulated that the an amount of of fine wine worth the same amount could be substituted if there were no gasoline left by 2001.
There is at least one good reason for all this wagering, Dr. Djorgovski said. The system that bestows official scientific awards "is usually rewarding old guys for what they've done God-knows-when," he said. He added: "It would be actually nice if there was an active, up-to-date system that would provide prizes for great new achievements quickly. Maybe making bets is a simple, samizdat way of doing that."
Bets can also serve quite a different purpose: as a diversionary tactic to throw other scientists off the scent. In the months leading up to what physicists call the "November revolution" in 1974, Mel Schwartz of Columbia University heard rumors that Dr. Samuel C. C. Ting of M.I.T. had discovered a remarkable new subatomic particle. Dr. Schwartz confronted him -- they were then working in the same laboratory -- but Dr. Ting flatly denied the rumor. Still suspicious, Dr. Schwartz offered to bet $10 that Dr. Ting had found the particle. Dr. Ting accepted.
Dr. Ting immediately wrote in his lab notebook, "I owe Mel Schwartz $10." Dr. Ting said he had been put in an "impossible position," since he wanted to check possible errors before making an announcement. He paid up just two months later, going public after learning that another group led by Dr. Burton Richter of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center had also seen the particle. Drs. Ting, Richter, and Schwartz all eventually won Nobel Prizes. "What I keep kicking myself about is that I didn't make it $200," Dr. Schwartz said.
Of all the reasons scientists make bets, however, by far the most compelling seems to be the urge to make a point in a way that is not soon forgotten.
A few minutes after Dr. Maurice Goldhaber, now 87 and still active in research at Brookhaven National Laboratory, arrived at a party in 1954, he got into an argument with his host over the existence of the antiproton. The particle had been predicted by the great theorist Paul Dirac, an authority few physicists were prepared to contradict. "I said, 'I don't believe it until it is proven,' " Dr. Goldhaber said. After all, he pointed out, there was the inconvenient detail that the universe around us is made of matter, not antimatter.
The host -- a brilliant if rough-cut theorist named Hartland Snyder -- suddenly reached out and grabbed his hand, recalled Dr. Goldhaber. "He said, 'I bet you $500 that the antiproton exists.' Without thinking I said, 'O.K.' " Even though Dr. Goldhaber's brother Gerson was scrambling to detect antiprotons at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and sober reflection told Dr. Goldhaber that his odds of winning the bet were not good, he did not consider backing down.
As it happened, a few months before Dr. Gerson Goldhaber's results were ready, another team at Berkeley detected antiprotons, winning a Nobel Prize for the discovery in 1959. But the widely discussed bet had its own modest influence on the history of science, said Dr. Gosta Ekspong, who was a member of Gerson Goldhaber's team and is now retired from Stockholm University. "People were reported to say that they believed in the existence of the antiproton," said Dr. Ekspong, "because Maurice Goldhaber paid off."

Richard P. Feynman, the physicist, bet Norman Ramsey of Harvard that physics in a mirror world would be unchanged.
THE STAKES -- 50-to-1 odds on a dollar bet.

HEADLINE: Survey Finds Public Support For Vouchers

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

 BODY:
Public opposition to taxpayer support for private and religious schooling, which was clear-cut several years ago, is softening, with Americans closely divided on the use of vouchers to pay tuition at private or church-sponsored schools, according to a poll released yesterday.
A small majority of Americans now favor allowing parents to send their children to any public, private or church-related school if government pays all or part of the tuition, the survey found. 
 The poll, conducted in June by the Gallup Organization for Phi Delta Kappa, a professional association of educators, found that 51 percent favored such support and 45 percent opposed it, a reversal of opinion since 1996, when 43 percent favored it and 54 percent opposed it. In 1997 the results were almost evenly divided, 49 percent in favor and 48 percent opposed. The poll has a margin of sampling error of about four percentage points.
For the first time since the poll began addressing the issue, in 1993, the word "vouchers" was introduced into the questions to reflect the growing prominence of the idea of using government-issued notes to pay for tuition at private or church-sponsored schools.
When asked specifically about vouchers to pay for all of the tuition, 48 percent were in favor and 46 percent opposed. When asked about partial tuition, the public supported the idea, 52 percent to 41 percent.
There has been considerable political and legal controversy over the use of vouchers, especially in church-related schools, and the issue may well be headed for the Supreme Court in its coming term.
Civil libertarians and teachers unions, in particular, have opposed the use of vouchers in religious schools, saying it violates the separation of church and state and will deprive the public school system of an essential part.
Proponents of voucher plans say public schools will benefit from the competition, which will also serve inner-city students by offering them schools with higher standards.
The poll also found that divisions between Republican and Democratic lawmakers on education were not reflected among the public, which registers support for nearly all ideas intended to improve schools.
For example, some 86 percent of Americans support President Clinton's proposal to use Federal money to repair and replace older school buildings, and 71 percent favor voluntary national tests in the fourth and eighth grades, ideas that are opposed by many Republicans. Yet 73 percent of the public also backs the Republicans' proposal to provide block grants to states, with the states taking responsibility for some Federal programs.

HEADLINE: Union Faults G.M. on Plans for Parts Unit

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Leaders of the United Automobile Workers union strongly criticized the General Motors Corporation today, a sign that this summer's strikes in Flint, Mich. did not produce a reconciliation and that next year's national contract talks between G.M. and the U.A.W. will be contentious.
Stephen P. Yokich, the U.A.W.'s president, condemned G.M.'s announcement on Aug. 3 of plans to spin off its auto parts subsidiary. Asked at a news conference here today what the U.A.W. planned to do about G.M.'s plans, Mr. Yokich said that another strike was always possible, although he added that the union might not do anything until Sept. 14, 1999. That is when the U.A.W.'s current national agreements with G.M., the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation are all scheduled to expire. 
 G.M. and the U.A.W. had also agreed at the end of the nearly eight-week-long Flint strikes to begin holding regular, top-level meetings to prevent future confrontations. But Richard Shoemaker, the U.A.W.'s vice president for G.M. issues, said today that there had been few discussions with G.M. since then.
Gerald Holmes, a G.M. spokesman, acknowledged that few meetings had been held since the end of the strikes, but attributed it to vacations. "We are serious about improving the relationship and making this process work," he said.
G.M. executives contended during the strike that the company must reduce its labor costs to start earning a competitive return on its shareholders' investment.
Mr. Yokich and Mr. Shoemaker spoke at their first news conference since they announced on July 28 an agreement to end the strikes. Since then, G.M. has announced several initiatives to try to make the company more competitive: spin off the auto parts subsidiary, consolidate its marketing staffs and build new assembly plants in North America that would require fewer workers.
Both U.A.W. leaders offered a few small hints today of a willingness to compromise. Mr. Yokich, for example, was cautious in discussing G.M.'s plans for new assembly plants.
The new factories would employ fewer workers by relying on outside suppliers to deliver large chunks of vehicles, like complete dashboards, instead of bolting every part together on the assembly line. Some union advocates worry about G.M.'s plans because four out of every five auto supplier factories in the United States are not unionized.
Mr. Yokich said in a conversation with several reporters after the news conference that the union had already won considerable job security for its members and that some changes in production processes were inevitable. The union will put greater emphasis on outside suppliers being in the United States, than being unionized, he said, although the union will still try to organize these suppliers.
Even if jobs are created at nonunion supplier factories in the United States, he said, "It's still an American job, isn't it?"

HEADLINE: Confidence Dips; Home Resales Rise

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Consumer confidence fell this month but held close to a 30-year high, while previously owned homes were resold at a record pace during July, encouraged by plenty of jobs and low mortgage rates.
The Conference Board said today that its consumer confidence index declined to 133.1 in August from a revised July reading of 137.2. The index had set a 30-year high of 138.2 in June. 
 A separate Conference Board index that gauges consumer expectations for the next six months fell to 107.5 this month, the lowest level since October, from 113.4 in July. In another report, the National Association of Realtors said that home resales rose 4 percent last month, to a record annual rate of 4.93 million, after a June decline of 1.9 percent.
By region during July, resales rose 3.3 percent in the Midwest, to 1.25 million units at an annual rate; 13.1 percent in the West, to 1.12 million units, and 1.5 percent in the Northeast, to 680,000 units. They were unchanged in the South, at a rate of 1.87 million units.
The average selling price of an existing home in July fell to $168,500 from $169,200 in June.
Mortgage rates averaged 6.95 percent in July for 30-year loans with a fixed interest rate, compared with 7 percent in June, according to the average of weekly changes in rates published by Freddie Mac.

Here's some advice for passengers if there is a strike this weekend at Northwest Airlines.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
AS of yesterday, Northwest Airlines was still holding out the possibility of avoiding a strike by its pilots, but prudent passengers should prepare for the worst. That means bracing for a possible strike any time after midnight Saturday, unless there is a settlement.
Northwest, travel agents and other airlines are offing advice about how best to cope with a strike -- along with the caveat that airline strikes, no matter how brief, are almost always frustrating and disruptive. 
 If booked on a Northwest flight that departs before Saturday, the carrier said a strike would not disrupt your travel plans. In addition, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Northwest's partner, said that even in the event of a strike it intended to fly all scheduled trans-Atlantic routes.
If you are booked on Northwest, but decide to double-book on another carrier to insure against being stranded, be advised that almost all the other major carriers are temporarily making even their first-class and business-class tickets nonrefundable on flights to and from Northwest's hubs at Minneapolis-St. Paul, Detroit and Memphis. That hard line on the part of Northwest's rivals is to protect themselves from droves of no-shows in the event there is no strike.
Unless there is a strike, Northwest's nonrefundable ticket restrictions remain in force. Then if Northwest cannot accommodate passengers on another carrier, it will make a full refund.
The chances of accommodating many Northwest ticket holders on other carriers during a strike are slim. Almost all airlines already have record passenger loads, and almost none have spare planes or the ability to add extra flights. Also, the closer it gets to the long Labor Day weekend, the more crowded all airplanes will be.
Moreover, many of the domestic routes flown by Northwest are to small cities throughout Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa and the Dakotas, cities where other carriers have few flights. And Mesaba Airlines and Express Airlines I -- Northwest's principal regional carriers, which will suspend operations in the event of a strike against Northwest -- provide the only air service to many cities in the Midwest and cities served from the Memphis hub.
Even in the Pacific, where Northwest has been a major presence for decades, the economic crisis in Asia has led almost all carriers to reduce service to Japan and other nations, or to substitute smaller airplanes.
On a somewhat happier note, Northwest frequent fliers who planned to use a free ticket that expires during the strike, if there is one, will have the expiration date of those miles extended.
Finally, Northwest is encouraging passengers with questions about flights to get in touch with their travel agents or phone its toll-free reservations line in the United States or Canada (800 225-2525). But keep in mind that flights are often canceled at the last minute, and that reservations lines are often jammed for hours during or just before a strike.
 
More Airline News

Upgrading a Cluster of Older Hotels in Manhattan

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
Throughout central Manhattan, the comeback of the hotel market in the mid-1990's is bringing new investment, major building renovations and economic success to what were marginal properties in the 80's. The work has often been undertaken after new ownership and management takes over. And it goes forward with a certain number of long-term tenants in place.
Among the buildings in line for this treatment in coming months are two properties long associated with low-rent, single-room-occupancy operations. 
 One is the Martha Washington Hotel, with entrances at 30 East 30th Street and 29 East 29th Street, long owned by Bernard Sillins. Another is the Allerton House for Women, at 130 East 57th Street, on the southwest corner of Lexington Avenue, formerly operated by the estate of Sol Goldman. Mr. Goldman died at 70 in 1987, leaving an estimated 400 New York City properties. About 15 have been sold, said Allan Goldman, his son. He and his sister, Jane Goldman, are now operating the rest.
In deals that closed a year ago, Property Markets Group, a real estate investment company owned by Ziel Feldman and Kevin Maloney, has taken control of both properties and is now in the early stages of major rehabilitation programs. Property Markets owns about 75 Manhattan buildings, with about 2,400 apartments and 60 stores, all bought in the 90's. One of these is the Belnord, the landmarked 276-unit rental building at 225 West 86th Street, which was purchased in partnership with Gary Barnett in 1994. The company's office now is in rebuilt space on the fifth floor of Allerton House, where Mr. Goldman long had his office.
"We have been attracted to hotels that are distressed and underutilized because of years of neglect," said Mr. Feldman, a 40-year-old real estate lawyer. Mr. Maloney, 39, is a former savings bank lending officer. They have hired Bohn Associates, an architectural and interior design firm, to develop a design theme for their hotels.
Property Markets Group is also a managing partner in a group that bought the Commander, a fully occupied 218-unit apartment hotel at 240 West 73d Street, two years ago. A renovation program there is perhaps three years off, Mr. Feldman said.
Renovation involves re-equipping and often reconfiguring rooms once they are vacant, as well as new carpeting and lighting and major lobby renovation. Existing tenants, whose occupancy rights are protected by the city's hotel rent stabilization regulations, are offered upgraded rooms in consolidated locations, but sometimes they will not consent to move from rooms that they have occupied for decades.
Farthest along in the reconstruction process among Property Markets Group's hotels is the Broadway American, at 222 West 77th Street, on the southeast corner of Broadway. It is a 12-story building, built in 1910, with 425 rooms and 7,000 square feet of retail space. In 1991, a reconstruction was undertaken by a management that held a long-term lease, but the lessee ultimately lost the project to the owner, the Goldman estate.
"About 20 percent of the rooms had bathrooms when we bought it," Mr. Feldman said. "The rest used common baths in the hall." There are now about 85 long-term tenants, most of them dating to the days when the hotel was operated as the Ben Franklin apartments. About 75 agreed to relocate to upgraded rooms on lower floors, but the rest have stayed in place in their unrenovated rooms.
The reconstruction plan envisions ultimately reducing the total number of rooms to 341, of which 48 would be convertible to two-room suites. Three new levels are being added at the roof level to create penthouse suites with views of both Central Park and the Hudson River. The Manhattan firm of David Kenneth Specter & Associates was the architect.
The hope is that the hotel will be ready for guests by the end of year, Mr. Feldman said. Room rates will average $150 a night, he said.
The Broadway American will join a growing group of recently renovated Upper West Side hotels, among them the Lucerne, the Beacon and the Milburn, that have a total of roughly 1,000 rooms and are getting rates of more than $150 a night, hotel specialists report.
The Allerton Hotel for Women, with 464 rooms, was one of a chain of moderately priced hotels that was started by James S. Cushman in 1916. When Property Markets Group acquired the lease from the Goldman estate a year ago, about 50 women, all long-term tenants, were still living in the building, Mr. Feldman said. Leasing to outsiders ceased six months ago, he said.
Like many former Goldman properties, its potential value, because of its location, is far greater than its earning capacity in its present condition. But before a building permit is granted for interior reconstruction, a new owner must obtain a certificate from the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development assuring that there has been no harassment of tenants to vacate their apartments. The process normally takes three to five months.
Last year, certificates of no harassment were issued for 124 buildings, and so far this year, the figure is 77, the department said, adding that claims of harassment have led to hearings in only a handful of buildings. Denial of a certificate bars an applicant from applying again for three years.
The Martha Washington is closing for new guests this week, but the occupancy rights of its 153 permanent tenants will remain undisturbed, Mr. Feldman said. The purchase price for the 469 rooms was $18.5 million, he said.
The Allerton House for Women was leased for 49 years from the Goldman estate at a figure starting at $2.5 million a year, he said. The rate is linked to the rental potential of close to 15,000 square feet of retail space in the building.

The Serpent In the Garden Of Renewal

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
PLUMP, green apples plopped to the ground as Jose (Chema) Soto pried them loose from the branches. He climbed down and caught his breath, a reminder that he should exercise more since having a heart attack. He beheld the tree, which towered over the Caribbean-style wooden shack that he and his friends built in the middle of a Bronx community garden bursting with enough vegetables and flowers to rival any greengrocer.
Decades ago, this was just an empty lot on the corner of 158th Street and Brook Avenue. Mr. Soto and his friends turned it into Rincon Criollo -- Down-Home Corner -- where they nurture more than just plants. It is a place where the traditional Puerto Rican music of bomba and plena has flowered. It is ground zero for folklore. 
 Too bad for Mr. Soto that it is also near ground zero for the next phase of the Melrose Commons urban renewal zone, where hundreds of new homes have already arisen on surrounding blocks. For Rincon Criollo and 14 other community gardens that have long thrived on lots leased annually from the city, the future seems as unpredictable as the weather. A few months ago, the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development took control of the properties to allow for speedier development. Some gardens will vanish under bricks and mortar. Mr. Soto is lucky, since borough officials have proposed letting him start over a block south in what is now a fenced thicket of weeds. Some luck.
"What are we supposed to do, take our peach and apple trees out by the roots?" Mr. Soto said. "Over there, the ground is full of rocks. It took us more than 20 years to do this. Before we see trees like this over there, we'll be dead."
He pointed to the proposed lot. "Not even a curse would grow there," he concluded. "Don't move me anywhere."
The community gardeners have banded together to mount their own urban land reform effort. They have met with politicians, circulated petitions and enlisted the aid of advocacy groups. They knew that their leases were temporary, but they wonder why the city had to go after them, considering all the other lots that have lain fallow and fenced in for years.
"Why didn't they take it before, when it was dirty?" said Luis Gonzalez, whose garden is near Crotona Park. "Are they showing it to potential buyers because they saw how we cleaned it up?"
Adding to their worries, they said they have yet to hear from Housing Preservation officials to explain what plans lie ahead. A spokeswoman for the agency did not respond to a reporter's questions about the Melrose gardens.
THE Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, said development plans, still five years away from groundbreaking, are jeopardizing four gardens. He said that a community effort to redesign the neighborhood has included plans to relocate several existing gardens and create three more acres of parkland. He suggested that the city agency take a closer look at such local efforts.
"We're trying very hard here to do the right thing for the community so it can rebound with housing and gardens," he said. "But with a plan. Not the way H.P.D. does, which is, 'Give me all of it, and I won't talk with you.' It's mindless, to use a favorite mayoral term."
Several dozen gardeners met at Rincon Criollo last week to map new strategies. They were joined by residents of other communities who were also fighting to preserve their oases. Some of them munched on grapes picked from vines dangling above the maze of spotless walkways between the garden plots.
"The government never expected this," Mr. Soto said. "This used to have only rats, junkies and a hole that was 10 feet deep. Now it is a place for deep culture."
Miguel Sierra, a plenero who has been active in Rincon Criollo for 15 years, can attest to that. From the little shack on Brook Avenue, he has gone on to perform at theaters and museums. In turn, he has played host to countless musicians, athletes and politicians who make sure they pay their respects at Rincon Criollo whenever they visit the city.
"This is the missing link between Puerto Rico and New York," he said. "Here. We feel like we're in Puerto Rico."
The plenas that he sings add to that atmosphere. For years they carried the news of the era in song. The gardeners' current plight would seem like a logical topic for a plena. "We are working on one," Mr. Sierra said. "It is our secret weapon. We will hold onto it until the last minute."

HEADLINE: Who's Afraid of Genetic Engineering?

BYLINE: By Jimmy Carter; Jimmy Carter, the 39th President of the United States, is chairman of the nonprofit Carter Center.

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
Imagine a country placing such rigid restrictions on imports that people could not get vaccines and insulin. And imagine those same restrictions being placed on food products as well as on laundry detergent and paper.
As far-fetched as it sounds, many developing countries and some industrialized ones may do just that early next year. They are being misled into thinking that genetically modified organisms, everything from seeds to livestock, and products made from them are potential threats to the public health and the environment. 
 The new import proposals are being drafted under the auspices of the biodiversity treaty, an agreement signed by 168 nations at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The treaty's main goal is to protect plants and animals from extinction.
In 1996, nations ratifying the treaty asked an ad hoc team to determine whether genetically modified organisms could threaten biodiversity. Under pressure from environmentalists, and with no supporting data, the team decided that any such organism could potentially eliminate native plants and animals.
The team, whose members mainly come from environmental agencies in more than 100 different governments, should complete its work within six months and present its final recommendation to all the nations (the United States is not among them) that ratified the treaty. If approved, these regulations would be included in a binding international agreement early next year.
But the team has exceeded its mandate. Instead of limiting the agreement to genetic modifications that might threaten biodiversity, the members are also pushing to regulate shipments of all genetically modified organisms and the products made from them.
This means that grain, fresh produce, vaccines, medicines, breakfast cereals, wine, vitamins -- the list is endless -- would require written approval by the importing nation before they could leave the dock. This approval could take months. Meanwhile, barge costs would mount and vaccines and food would spoil.
How could regulations intended to protect species and conserve their genes have gotten so far off track? The main cause is anti-biotechnology environmental groups that exaggerate the risks of genetically modified organisms and ignore their benefits.
Anti-biotechnology activists argue that genetic engineering is so new that its effects on the environment can't be predicted. This is misleading. In fact, for hundreds of years virtually all food has been improved genetically by plant breeders. Genetically altered antibiotics, vaccines and vitamins have improved our health, while enzyme-containing detergents and oil-eating bacteria have helped to protect the environment.
In the past 40 years, farmers worldwide have genetically modified crops to be more nutritious as well as resistant to insects, diseases and herbicides. Scientific techniques developed in the 1980's and commonly referred to as genetic engineering allow us to give plants additional useful genes. Genetically engineered cotton, corn and soybean seeds became available in the United States in 1996, including those planted on my family farm. This growing season, more than one-third of American soybeans and one-fourth of our corn will be genetically modified. The number of acres devoted to genetically engineered crops in Argentina, Canada, Mexico and Australia increased tenfold from 1996 to 1997.
The risks of modern genetic engineering have been studied by technical experts at the National Academy of Sciences and World Bank. They concluded that we can predict the environmental effects by reviewing past experiences with those plants and animals produced through selective breeding. None of these products of selective breeding have harmed either the environment or biodiversity.
And their benefits are legion. By increasing crop yields, genetically modified organisms reduce the constant need to clear more land for growing food. Seeds designed to resist drought and pests are especially useful in tropical countries, where crop losses are often severe. Already, scientists in industrialized nations are working with individuals in developing countries to increase yields of staple crops, to improve the quality of current exports and to diversify economies by creating exports like genetically improved palm oil, which may someday replace gasoline.
Other genetically modified organisms covered by the proposed regulations are essential research tools in medical, agricultural and environmental science.
If imports like these are regulated unnecessarily, the real losers will be the developing nations. Instead of reaping the benefits of decades of discovery and research, people from Africa and Southeast Asia will remain prisoners of outdated technology. Their countries could suffer greatly for years to come. It is crucial that they reject the propaganda of extremist groups before it is too late.

HEADLINE: Administration to Fight Ruling Barring Sampling in Census

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
While acknowledging that a Federal court ruling on Monday was a blow to its efforts to use sampling to supplement the 2000 census, the Clinton Administration said today that it would still press Congress for the money the Census Bureau would need to plan for sampling.
The Administration immediately said it would appeal the ruling, which was made by a special three-judge panel that said statistical sampling violated Federal law. Late this afternoon the Administration filed a notice of appeal asking the Supreme Court to review the decision. 
 "This is the first stop on a long journey of resolution," said Everett M. Ehrlich, a former Commerce Department official who is now a Democratic member of an independent board that is monitoring the Census Bureau's plans.
But any Supreme Court ruling is not expected until next year. That leaves plenty of time for the Administration and House Republicans to engage in a knock-down-drag-out fight this fall over a spending bill to pay for the bureau's plans for the next census -- plans that still include the use of sampling.
Advocates of statistical sampling say it would provide a more complete count of the nation's population. Groups that analysts say were underrepresented in the 1990 census could benefit from a census in 2000 based on sampling. These groups, mostly the urban and rural poor, tend to live in predominantly Democratic areas, and therefore counting them might benefit that party in drawing district lines.
Republicans rejoiced in the court ruling. "The public perception is that it certainly enhanced our standing," said Pete Jeffries, a spokesman for Representative Dennis Hastert, an Illinois Republican and ardent foe of sampling. "This shows that this is just another example of the Clinton Administration trying to run roughshod over the law and the Constitution."
Robert J. Shapiro, Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs, the division that oversees the Census Bureau, was just as vehement that sampling would prevail.
"Regardless of the court decision," Mr. Shapiro said, "this is going to be a very tough political fight that will be hard-fought on all sides. The opponents of the use of scientific methods will try to use this ruling to try to make their case, just like the proponents of scientific methods use the testimony of noted scientists to make their case."
The court decision and the coming fight in Congress flow from an agreement negotiated in November by Speaker Newt Gingrich and Erskine B. Bowles, the White House chief of staff.
Under the deal, which broke a logjam over a spending bill, Mr. Gingrich was able to proceed with a lawsuit paid for by taxpayers to have sampling declared unconstitutional or illegal, the suit heard by the three-judge panel. The agreement also allowed for any decision to be appealed directly and expeditiously to the Supreme Court.
The spending bill, under the agreement, would not fully finance the Departments of Commerce (which oversees the Census Bureau), Justice or State for the full fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, though there is dispute between the parties on just what it would finance. The Administration and the Democrats say the agreement was to finance the three departments for six months while everyone waited for a decision on sampling from the Supreme Court. The Republicans assert that they agreed to finance only the Census Bureau, and only for six months.
The Administration is pushing for financing all of the operations of the Commerce, Justice and State Departments for six months, figuring that the pressure of a looming Government shutdown -- even a partial one -- would drive the Republicans to resolve the sampling matter.
The Republicans reason that if the Census Bureau were to run out of money next spring the Administration would be so desperate to gain the rest of the financing that it would agree to drop its plans to use sampling.
The fight over sampling also comes as Mr. Clinton's personal popularity has been brought low by his acknowledgment of his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky.
"The President's political difficulty certainly has to be factored in," said one former Administration official familiar with the census battle. "It could go either way."
But some Democrats say that the possibility that Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, will submit a report to Congress that accuses Mr. Clinton of having engaged in illegal activity might strengthen Mr. Clinton's resolve in the census fight.
"The President's highest priority is to regain the confidence of the Democrats in Congress," said Tony Coehlo, the former House whip who is another Democratic appointee to the census monitoring board. "He ain't going to renege on this one."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Marsh & McLennan to Buy Big British Insurance Broker

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
Fortifying its position as the world's largest insurance broker, Marsh & McLennan of New York said yesterday that it had agreed to buy the London-based Sedgwick Group, the largest independent broker in Europe, for $2.05 billion in cash.
The deal increases Marsh & McLennan's business with the largest corporations in Europe and with midsized companies in the United States, the two main areas that Sedgwick had developed. And while Marsh & McLennan has a commanding presence in financial services, Sedgwick brings the combined company expertise in marine and energy coverage, from oil-drilling rigs to the suppliers of drilling equipment. 
 "The biggest things we get in this are operations in places where we were not operating, or not operating as well, and a greater accumulation of professional expertise," said A. J. C. Smith, Marsh & McLennan's chief executive. In Asia alone, he said, "this doubles our scale."
To acquire the British company, Marsh & McLennan agreed to pay 2.25 a share, or about $3.60 -- 58 percent more than Sedgwick's closing price on the London Stock Exchange Monday. The price, a total of 1.25 billion, or $2.05 billion, works out to about 15 times earnings under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States at a time other insurance brokers have been trading at 10 or 11 times earnings.
The deal was the latest in a struggle for dominance in the worldwide brokerage business between Marsh and its chief rival, the Aon Corporation of Chicago. And analysts said they thought Marsh had agreed to pay such a premium partly to keep Sedgwick out of the hands of Aon. Otherwise, said Ira L. Zuckerman, vice president for research at Nutmeg Securities in Westport, Conn., "they wouldn't have made as high a bid as they did."
"My feeling," Mr. Zuckerman added, "is that it was sort of pre-emptive."
Joan Steel, an Aon spokeswoman in Chicago, declined to comment on whether the company had been interested in buying Sedgwick. Nor would she discuss analysts' speculation that Aon might submit a higher bid.
Some analysts also suggested that alternatively Aon might consider offering a higher bid for the Willis Corroon Group, another big London brokerage that an investor group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the New York buyout firm, said last month it had agreed to buy for $1.4 billion. Ms. Steel of Aon would not comment on that prospect either.
Sedgwick and Willis Corroon were the last of the big competitors of Marsh and Aon, leaving a handful of smaller insurance brokers that analysts said were likely to be bought in coming months.
The American depository receipts of Sedgwick -- each representing five shares -- rose $5.125, to $17.375 yesterday; Marsh & McLennan's shares fell $1.125, to $55.5625.
Marsh had a little more than $6 billion in revenue last year, compared with $5.7 billion for Aon. The combined revenue of Marsh and Sedgwick at the end of last year would have been $7.6 billion, putting the new company far ahead of Aon.
Aon moved ahead of Marsh, the longtime leader in the business, in January 1997 with the purchase of Alexander & Alexander Services for $1.23 billion. But then Marsh reclaimed the No. 1 spot two months later by taking over Johnson & Higgins for $1.8 billion.
In growing ever bigger, the companies hope to gain economies of scale, and to increase their market share and the range of expertise they offer customers. With more influence, they hope also to be able to negotiate better prices with insurers for their corporate clients.
Keith Buckley, a senior vice president and analyst at Duff & Phelps, said corporate customers could benfit from lower prices from Marsh if it succeeded in cutting costs through the merger. "But the downside is that competition between the brokers will have lessened," he said. "Corporate customers will be forced to deal with fewer, more powerful brokers, which may not always have their best interests at heart."
Mr. Smith, Marsh's chief executive, said he was "comfortable that the price" his company was paying "was a good one." Some savings, he said, would come in trimming the combined work force of 52,000. But he said more of the reduction was expected through retirements and turnover than through layoffs.
With the Sedgwick deal coming so soon after the acquisition of Johnson & Higgins, Cathy Seifert, an S&P Equity Group analyst, said this raised questions about how smoothly Marsh would be able to combine the two companies. "If it is very disruptive," she said, "that could be a positive for Aon."
In seeking to solidify the deal, Marsh's bankers obtained a commitment from the holders of more than 40 percent of Sedgwick's stock that they would accept the offer. There is a caveat, however. If another bidder offers 10 percent more, the deal can be reconsidered.
Asked whether he expected a counterbid from Aon, Mr. Smith said, "I would hesitate to be involved in a bid for a professional management staff where the staff were committed to somebody else."

Purchase by Reinsurer
 FRANKFURT, Aug. 25 (Bloomberg News) -- Hannover Re, the world's fifth-largest reinsurer, said today that it had agreed to buy the Clarendon Insurance Group of the United States for $500 million.
Hannover Re is buying Clarendon from management and from a Finnish company, Kansa International.
Clarendon, of New York, is active in so-called program insurance, covering groups of individuals like young drivers, a high-risk category.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Pay Farmers to Shoo Cows Off City's Watershed

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
In a move aimed at cutting the flow of pollution and parasites into New York City's drinking water, the United States Agriculture Department plans to unveil a $10.4 million program today that will pay farmers to stop growing crops and grazing cattle along streams feeding the city's upstate reservoirs.
The goal is to transform the banks of 165 miles of watershed streams from easily eroded cropland or pasture into pollution-filtering buffer zones of grassland and forest, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said in a statement to be released today. 
 Farmers who abandon fields along streams will be paid a yearly fee of $100 to $150 an acre for the loss of the use of their land, agriculture officials said.
Several dairy farmers living near the reservoirs expressed cautious interest in the program yesterday.
David Post, whose grandson belongs to the eighth generation of his family to work their 200-year-old farm in Stamford, said he recognized the value of having forested areas, cool streams for trout and banks untrammeled by cow hooves. If the money is sufficient to compensate for the loss of prime land, he said, then plenty of farmers will sign up.
"This will probably work all right," he said. "I'm a hunter and fisherman, I like to see wildlife. And, believe it or not, I'd just as soon send the cleanest water down there that we can -- as long as it doesn't impact me and my family."
The money, to be paid to farmers under contracts lasting 10 to 15 years, is a tiny fraction of the $600 million New York City has already committed to spending to prevent pollution of its far-flung water supply.
But by providing a strong financial incentive to farmers to move plows and cows back from stream banks, the Federal project is expected to significantly improve water quality, city environmental officials said yesterday.
Anything that has the potential to eliminate the sight of a herd of cows wading and defecating in water bound for city faucets is welcome, said Joel A. Miele, the city's Commissioner of Environmental Protection.
For decades, such sights have been commonplace around several of the city's largest reservoirs, in rural regions west of the Hudson River. "I quiver when I think about it," Mr. Miele said. "Hopefully we'll see less and less of that.
"I recognize the fact that the farmers need every bit of acreage they've got there to stay economically viable. This program thanks the farmers financially for giving up that little bit."
Ninety percent of the city's drinking water starts out as runoff in rural hills 100 miles to the northwest, in the Catskills and Delaware River Valley, where the water trickles across farmers' fields and picks up undesirable silt, chemicals, nutrients that promote algae growth, and intestinal parasites before traveling downstream into reservoirs and eventually city taps.
Almost all of these contaminants are naturally removed from the water as it flows toward the city, but Federal environmental officials have increasingly pressed the city to either bolster protection of its water at the source or build a $6 billion filtration plant. New York is one of the few cities in the nation whose water is not filtered.
The Agriculture Department initiative will complement the work of several city programs created in the last four years. Gale Sheridan, executive director of the Watershed Agricultural Council, a quasi-public, city-funded agency that encourages farmers to reduce pollution, said the Federal program "gives a chance for farmers to get an annual payment that they can use to rent land further from the water."
"That keeps them in business, and helps us have better water quality," he said.
The new program in the New York City watersheds is a variant of a long-standing national program, the Conservation Reserve Program, that encourages farmers to leave some sensitive lands fallow. But the payments offered were too low to attract farmers in upstate New York, where fertile valley-bottom land for dairy herds has always been a coveted commodity.
The New York program, limited to the 350 farmers whose fields drain into the city water supply, effectively doubles the payments offered under the Conservation Reserve Program.
Related efforts to reduce farmland runoff using Agriculture Department money have already begun in Maryland, where farm pollution has tainted Chesapeake Bay, and in Illinois and Minnesota, where rivers are similarly suffering, agriculture officials said.
In New York, $7.7 million of the program's $10.4 million cost will be paid by the Agriculture Department, with the remaining $2.7 million to be paid by New York City, department officials said.
Timothy D. Searchinger, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund, a private group based in New York, said farmers in the Northeast cannot survive financially without this kind of compensation. "Probably the only way to preserve farming there is if these dairy farmers produce not only milk, but environmental benefits," he said.

HEADLINE: States Bracing For Northwest Pilots' Strike

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
They are stockpiling baby diapers, trying to line up extra buses and appealing to other airlines for help, but the authorities in Minneapolis, Detroit and seven upper Midwestern states from Illinois to North Dakota admit that there is not much they can do if pilots at Northwest Airlines strike on Saturday, shutting down the region's single largest airline.
"The impact on us would be devastating," said Kevin J. Kramer, the director of economic development for North Dakota, where Northwest provides virtually all the state's jet service. "We have all our eggs in one basket." 
 The situation is not much better in Detroit and Minneapolis, which are home to the nation's 9th- and 13th-busiest airports. An estimated 8 out of 10 flights in and out of both cities are Northwest's.
In a letter to President Clinton earlier this month, the Governors of Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin and four other states estimated that their economies would lose hundreds of millions of dollars in the first week alone if Northwest, the country's fourth-largest airline, stopped flying.
No one can say for sure whether a strike will be averted before the deadline -- one minute past midnight on Saturday morning. The latest round of negotiations between Northwest and the pilots began at an undisclosed location on Aug. 17 under the auspices of a Federal mediator, who has ordered both sides not to talk to reporters. The negotiations are to continue right up to the strike deadline.
Both sides say publicly that they are eager to reach a settlement, and Donald J. Foley, Northwest's chief spokesman, said some progress had been made during the recent negotiations. But the key issue of pay remains unresolved.
As Saturday draws closer, the belief among politicians and business executives that there will be a strike appears to be increasing.
Northwest began notifying passengers yesterday that it would cancel about 100 domestic flights Friday to insure that its planes are not stranded in far-off airports if the pilots walk out.
"We have made the appropriate preparations to pull down the airline as of midnight on Friday night if we are unable to reach an agreement at the negotiating table," Mr. Foley said.
Last year, when the pilots struck American Airlines, a unit of the AMR Corporation, President Clinton intervened within minutes, ordering the pilots back to work and the negotiators back to the table.
But some believe that the President, in his politically weakened state following his admission of an inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky, will be more reluctant to intervene now.
"We told our clients early in the process that Clinton would intervene," said Brent Garback, the chief executive of Total Travel Management, the largest corporate travel agency in Michigan. "But given his problems we now think he won't."
Mr. Clinton may also be reluctant to interfere because the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents pilots at Northwest and 49 other carriers, is a major contributor to the Democratic Party. Earlier this month, 24 Democratic Congressmen, including the minority leader, Richard Gephardt of Missouri, and the Democratic whip, David Bonior of Michigan, wrote the President, urging him not to intercede.
A White House official who insisted on anonymity said that as he had in the American strike the President would not intervene until after the strike deadline to maintain the pressure on both sides to settle.
Robert B. Reich, who was Labor Secretary during the American strike, said that the President was not likely to act this time unless it was clear that both sides were looking for a face-saving way out.
"Certainly the President doesn't want to be viewed as powerless," said Mr. Reich, now a professor at Brandeis University. "He especially doesn't want to look that way now."
The average Northwest pilot now is paid $120,000 a year, according to the union. Northwest says it is offering its 6,200 pilots a 10 percent pay increase over five years, placing them on par with their counterparts at United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, the three larger domestic carriers.
The pilots counter that Northwest is not offering the hefty stock options and profit sharing that the other airlines give their pilots. They are asking for a 15 percent wage increase over five years, greater job security and guaranteed vacation time.
But the real issue is what the pilots and other Northwest workers feel they are owed for the sacrifices they made in 1993, to save the airline when it was near bankruptcy. Northwest's 45,000 unionized employees accepted wage cuts and work rule concessions worth $886 million.
The largest share, worth $365 million, came from the pilots, who agreed to cut their wages and other benefits 15.5 percent for 39 months in exchange for three seats on Northwest's board of directors and more than 14 million shares of stock.
Since then, the airline industry and Northwest have rebounded, registering four years of record profits. The unions say they want their share.
In addition to the pilots, Northwest also faces tough negotiations with five other unions. Last month, the International Association of Machinists, which represents 27,000 Northwest workers, rejected a tentative contract that would have given them a 14 percent pay increase.
Workers have been particularly embittered by $73 million worth of stock sold by Northwest insiders earlier this year when the share price was near its 52-week high of $65.3125. The group was led by John H. Dasburg, Northwest's chief executive, who sold 322,000 shares worth $19 million, according to CDA/Investnet of Rockville, Md.
With a strike looming, Northwest stock has since slid more than 50 percent, reaching a 52-week low of $28.50 a share on Friday. It closed yesterday at $29.50, up 56.25 cents.
Samuel C. Buttrick, an airline industry analyst at Paine Webber, estimates that Northwest will have lost up to $100 million in the month before the strike deadline because of lost bookings. But he added that Northwest had $3 billion in cash, more than enough to weather the storm.
Officials in Minneapolis and Detroit said their appeals to other airlines to send in extra planes during a strike had failed because, with the booming economy, most airlines are flying at full capacity.
But Paul Omodt, a spokesman for the pilots' union, called concerns about the impact of a strike exaggerated. "It is kind of ridiculous to think there are no alternatives," he said. "If there is a strike, there will be an initial shock to the system. But then some airlines will pick up the routes. It is found money for them."

The Ruble Falls Steeply, Causing New Wave of Panic
A fresh wave of panic swept through Russia's financial institutions as the currency plunged, three banks announced a merger to shore up their stability and the Government disclosed a plan to stretch out repayment of its debt.
 Coming at a moment when Russia's newly designated Prime Minister is still negotiating with the Parliament over the makeup of his Government, the ruble's abrupt drop stoked new fears of inflation similar to the spiraling rates that sent Russia into a depression in the early 1990's. The drop in the value of the currency was the deepest in four years. It was stopped only when the central bank of Russia intervened. Page A1. 

Most major market indexes were rallying strongly early yesterday, but dropped slightly after hearing about the situation in Russia. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 36.04 points, to 8,602.65. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed up 4.72 points at 1,092.86. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index gained 7.35 points, to 1,798.17. But the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks hit a new 52-week low, falling 3.94 points, or 1 percent, to 389.76. D6.
 
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.43 percent, from 5.46 percent. D6.
 
Inquiry Into Microsoft's Intel Role
The Government is investigating whether Microsoft has used its market muscle to force even Intel to shelve new technology efforts that conflicted with Microsoft's ambitions. The antitrust lawsuit accusing Microsoft of using unfair business practices to protect its monopoly in operating systems and to extend that monopoly into the new markets for Internet software and commerce was filed by the Justice Department and 20 states. The trial is scheduled to start Sept. 23. A1.
 
Marsh & McLennan's $2 Billion Deal
Marsh & McLennan has agreed to buy the London-based Sedgwick Group, the largest independent broker in Europe, for $2.05 billion in cash. The deal increases Marsh & McLennan's business with the largest corporations in Europe and with midsized companies in the United States. D2.
 
British Airways Orders Airbus Jets
British Airways has ordered as many as 188 short-haul, single-aisle jets from Airbus Industrie in a contract worth $8.5 billion. Until now, British Airways had relied on Boeing as its supplier. D2.
 
U.A.W. Criticizes G.M. Spinoff
Stephen P. Yokich, president of the United Automobile Workers, has condemned General Motor's plan to spin off its auto parts subsidiary, and said another strike was always possible. But he added that the union may not do anything until its agreement with the Big 3 American auto makers expires next fall. D2.
 
Consumer Confidence Index Drops
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index declined to 133.1 in August, but analysts said the decrease did not signal a big change in sentiment, although consumers might start to exercise some caution. In another report, the National Association of Realtors said that home resales rose 4 percent in July, to a record annual rate of 4.93 million. D3.
 
I.M.F. Is Softening Its Policies
The International Monetary Fund is softening its policies, becoming more tolerant of arrangements it would have rejected a year ago, and even allowing some Asian debtors not to repay all they owe to foreign banks. A10.

HEADLINE: Ship With Proud History Arrives at Its New Home

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: GLEN COVE, N.Y., Aug. 25

 BODY:
When the Regina Maris, a 90-year-old three-masted wooden barkentine, was being towed out of Greenport Harbor Sunday night, crew members said that those left behind on the dock were taking bets that she would never make it through Plum Gut's rough tidal waters.
"The tide was running against us, but she slipped right through," said Rudolph Schukert, a crew volunteer. "She was built to sail, and sometimes it felt like she was under her own power. You forgot she was being towed." 
 This morning, flags flying, the 239-ton vessel eased into Hempstead Harbor here, 90 nautical miles west of Greenport, and was welcomed to her new home port by the Mayor of Glen Cove, Thomas R. Suozzi, who climbed her rigging and declared her a symbol of his efforts to revitalize the city's waterfront.
The 140-foot-long Danish-built vessel, whose maritime history includes the smuggling of Jewish refugees from northern Europe during World War II, was scheduled to be scuttled at sea at the end of this month. Officials in Greenport, her home for the last eight years, said the aging vessel had become a public liability.
Touched by her history of helping others to survive, Mayor Suozzi decided to come to the ship's rescue and provide her a new home.
"There are only about 200 tall ships left in the world, less than half of which are made of wood," he said. "And the Regina Maris is only one of two wooden barkentines left. The supply of these tall ships is small, but the demand is great."
Mayor Suozzi said it could cost as much as $4 million to make the ship seaworthy again. Although Mr. Suozzi said he hoped to be able to raise the money through private donations, he said the ship would be a dockside attraction even without a complete restoration.
The first to contribute to the effort was Barbara Johnson, a Nassau County legislator from Port Washington, who paid the towing fee.
"I'm an American Jew and I had relatives who perished in the Holocaust in the ovens at Auschwitz, and when I heard that this ship was used to transport Jews to save them, I was determined to pay for the transport of the Regina Maris to Glen Cove," she said.
She presented a check for $3,000 to James Barker, of Barker Marine Limited of Port Washington, who towed the ship at cost. Mr. Barker, in turn, gave the check to Hope House Ministries of Port Jefferson, which provides shelter for the homeless.

HEADLINE: Lewis Powell, Crucial Centrist Justice, Dies at 90

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Lewis F. Powell Jr., the Supreme Court Justice who brought a voice of moderation and civility to an increasingly polarized Court during his 15-year tenure, died today at the age of 90. An announcement from the Court reported that Justice Powell, who retired 11 years ago and had been in failing health, died of pneumonia at his home in Richmond, Va.
Justice Powell already was one of the country's most prominent corporate lawyers, with practical legal skills polished by decades of experience, when his nomination to the Court by President Richard M. Nixon in 1972 gave him an unexpected second career. He was 64 years old, an age at which he said he had expected to start "tapering off," when he took the seat made vacant by the retirement of Associate Justice Hugo L. Black. 
 His role on the Court eventually became so central to the institution's ideological balance that his retirement in 1987 unleashed a furious political battle over the nomination of Robert H. Bork, the prominent conservative President Ronald Reagan named to replace him. Mr. Bork's nomination was defeated and the seat eventually went to the more moderate Anthony M. Kennedy.
First in his native Virginia and then on the national scene, Mr. Powell had long since reached the highest ranks of the legal profession. He had been president of three major legal organizations, the American Bar Association, the American Bar Foundation and the American College of Trial Lawyers. He was a senior partner of one of Virginia's oldest law firms, a trustee and general counsel of Colonial Williamsburg and a director of 11 major corporations.
Born into the insularity and rigid stratifications of the post-Reconstruction South, Justice Powell cherished his roots in Richmond and at the same time transcended them. From a young age, he was drawn to the wider world while maintaining his ties to home. His long life in some respects mirrored the journey of the modern South from the country's fringe to its mainstream. He described his initial response to the Supreme Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 decision that segregation in the public schools was unconstitutional, as one of shock. Yet as a Virginia civic leader and later as a Supreme Court Justice, he stood for moderation and consensus-building on matters of race.
He played a pivotal role on a Court that was marked by sharp ideological divisions. He was the balancer and compromiser, a political moderate with an aversion to heated rhetoric and doctrinal rigidity. Neither his colleagues nor lawyers practicing before the Court could take his vote for granted. He had to be persuaded by the weight of argument, and his vote was frequently the decisive one, whether the subject was state aid to parochial schools, remedies for racial discrimination or the rights of illegal aliens.
The most important opinion of his Supreme Court tenure was probably one in which he wrote only for himself. In the Bakke case, a landmark affirmative action decision in 1978, he bridged two competing four-Justice blocs to extract an opinion that barred the use of rigid racial quotas but permitted race to be taken into account in university admissions.

 
He never lost either his acute sense of the Court's great power or his conviction that the power had to be used sparingly. For him, judicial restraint was crucial to keeping the balance of power among the three branches of Government.
A concurring opinion he wrote in a 1974 decision, holding that a taxpayer could not bring a suit challenging the way the Central Intelligence Agency was financed, expressed as clearly as anything else Justice Powell's vision of the role of the Court.
"We should be ever mindful," he wrote in United States v. Richardson, "of the contradictions that would arise if a democracy were to permit general oversight of the elected branches of Government by a nonrepresentative, and in large measure, insulated judicial branch."
"Repeated and essentially head-on confrontations between the life-tenured branch and the representative branches of Government will not, in the long run, be beneficial to either," he said. "The public confidence essential to the former and the vitality critical to the latter may well erode if we do not exercise self-restraint in the utilization of our power."

On the other hand, Justice Powell did not hesitate to place the Court's weight on the side of those who had nowhere else to turn. In 1982, he joined the Court's liberal bloc in providing the crucial fifth vote for a decision requiring Texas to give a free public education to the children of illegal aliens.
"I am not unmindful of what must be the exasperation of responsible citizens and government authorities" over the influx of illegal aliens, he wrote in concurring with the majority opinion in Plyler v. Doe. But the fact remained, he said, that "innocent" children were being denied an education solely because of their parents' illegal status, and were thereby "singled out for a lifelong penalty and stigma." He said that "it can hardly be argued rationally that anyone benefits from the creation within our borders of a subclass of illiterate persons."
 
A Courtly Demeanor And a Tidewater Drawl
If in his professional career Lewis Powell seemed to epitomize the legal establishment, his courtly demeanor and soft Tidewater drawl made him the image of the classic Southern gentleman. Almost ascetically thin, he was so unassuming that he often appeared to melt into the background. In crepe-soled shoes, he strolled the Court's corridors and grounds unrecognized by tourists.
His questions from the bench during oral argument were few and were posed in a voice barely above a whisper. But they were precise and potentially devastating to the argument of any lawyer who did not have the answer. His soft manner did not hide the quick and tough mind that had served him both as a lawyer and as head of the Richmond school board in the 1950's, a troubled decade during which he argued successfully against the "massive resistance" campaign that some white city leaders advocated in defiance of the Supreme Court's desegregation mandates.
According to his biographer, Prof. John C. Jeffries Jr. of the University of Virginia Law School, a burning ambition and desire to excel drove Mr. Powell as a young lawyer into positions of leadership in his law firm, his profession, and his community; an ability to win the confidence of clients and colleagues made his success possible.
Lewis Franklin Powell Jr. was born in Suffolk, Va., on Sept. 19, 1907, into a family with deep roots in the region. One of his father's relatives, although not a direct ancestor, was Nathaniel Powell, one of the original Jamestown settlers and for a time the colony's acting governor. Justice Powell's mother, Mary Lewis Gwathmey, was raised on a Virginia plantation by an uncle who had accompanied Gen. Robert E. Lee to the surrender of the Confederate forces at Appomattox.
The family's proud history was no guarantee of lasting prosperity. Mr. Powell's father, raised on a modest farm with little formal education, finally achieved a hard-won financial security as manager of a Richmond company that manufactured boxes and furniture.
Lewis Jr. was the oldest of four children. Growing up in a near-rural area of Richmond known as Forest Hill, he attended a local private academy that aimed at preparing boys for the University of Virginia. But he engaged in a gentle form of rebellion and struck out instead for Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va., where he achieved both academic and social success and began to expand his horizons.
As president of the student body, he attended a student leadership conference in California and met Edward R. Murrow, a student leader from the state of Washington. The young Southerner and the future television journalist became close friends, traveling together in Europe after a student conference in Brussels in 1930 and visiting together again in London during World War II.
Mr. Powell was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and received his undergraduate degree in 1929 with a major in commerce. By counting some undergraduate courses toward a law degree, he was able to graduate two years later from Washington and Lee's law school, where he was first in his class. Throughout his life, he kept strong ties to Washington and Lee, to which he gave his personal and Supreme Court papers, now housed in the Lewis F. Powell Jr. Archives on the campus in Lexington.
After law school, Mr. Powell earned a graduate law degree from Harvard Law School. One of his classes was an administrative law seminar taught by Felix Frankfurter, who later served on the Supreme Court and who impressed the young lawyer with a pragmatic approach to legal issues that was very different from the more formal and unskeptical approach of the professors at Washington and Lee.
 
Moving Back To Richmond
After turning down an offer of a job at a prestigious Wall Street law firm, Davis, Polk & Wardwell, Mr. Powell returned to Richmond in 1932, moved in with his parents and began his legal career as an associate in a small firm. Soon he moved to a bigger firm, and by 1938 had become its 10th partner. Except for his service in World War II, he stayed at that firm, known for many years as Hunton, Williams, Gay, Powell & Gibson, until he took his seat on the Supreme Court. He played a leading role in the evolution of the firm, later known as Hunton & Williams, beyond its regional roots to a corporate law practice that was national in scope.
In 1936, when he was 28, Mr. Powell married Josephine Pierce Rucker, the daughter of a prominent Richmond obstetrician. The two had met years earlier, but Mr. Powell first became interested in the doctor's daughter after hearing that she had set a broad-jump record of 22 feet at Sweet Briar College. Their marriage was a lifelong love affair that produced four children: Josephine Smith; Ann Pendleton Bowen, known as Penny; Molly Sumner, and Lewis 3d. Mrs. Powell died in 1996. In addition to his children, Justice Powell is survived by nine grandchildren and one great-grandson.
He volunteered for military service in World War II, spending more than three years in Europe and North Africa as a combat and staff intelligence officer with the Army Air Forces. He rose in rank from first lieutenant to colonel, earning the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star and Croix de Guerre. He spent the last half of his tour in a military intelligence unit known as the Special Branch, helping to analyze decoded German messages. He presented daily briefings to senior officers, including, at times, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, who used the top-secret information to select Allied bombing targets. Colonel Powell ended his assignment with several dozen officers under his command, and his return to peacetime law practice was something of an anticlimax.
Active in the American Bar Association early in his career, he served a term as its president from mid-1964 to mid-1965. He used the position as a platform to lobby for an increased Federal role in providing legal services to the poor, and helped shape the legal services program of the Office of Economic Opportunity.
Although he never held elective office, he was a leading figure in Virginia public affairs as head of the Richmond school board from 1952 to 1961. He was a member of the Virginia State Board of Education from 1961 to 1969, serving as its president for the 1968-69 term.
At that time, Virginia was dominated by the Democratic machine of Senator Harry F. Byrd, who advocated stiff resistance to the Supreme Court's 1954 desegregation decision. Mr. Powell believed that such resistance would be deeply destructive. Under his leadership the Richmond schools did not defy the Court. On the other hand, integration was very slow in coming to Richmond as elsewhere. When Mr. Powell left the school board in the spring of 1961, only two of 23,000 black students in the Richmond public schools were attending school with white children.
 
Backing by Kennedy For the High Court
Ten years later, the Congressional Black Caucus opposed his nomination to the Court, arguing that he should have done more from his position as a community leader to fight segregation and its legacy. Liberal Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee came to his defense, however. When the committee approved his nomination, Senator Edward M. Kennedy and three other Democratic members issued a concurring report that praised Mr. Powell's record. "Lewis Powell was one of the courageous men in Virginia who was determined to obey the law of the land," the report said.
In 1990, Virginia inaugurated as its governor L. Douglas Wilder, the first black person in the country to be elected governor of a state. Mr. Wilder invited Justice Powell, who was retired by then, to administer the oath. As Professor Jeffries recounted the scene in his book, "Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr." (Scribners, 1994), Justice Powell called out above the applause that followed the swearing-in: "It's a great day for Virginia!"
Professor Jeffries wrote: "For the sea of young black faces raised in pride and triumph, the good wishes of a frail old white man may have meant very little, but to those with long memories, it was a gracious benediction from the best of the old order."
Nixon announced Mr. Powell's nomination to the Supreme Court, along with that of William H. Rehnquist to fill a second vacancy, to a nationwide television audience on Oct. 21, 1971. The announcement came barely 24 hours after the American Bar Association's judicial fitness committee refused to endorse two Nixon candidates who had been considered the front-runners for the seats. Mr. Powell had turned down an earlier offer of a seat on the Court from the Nixon Administration, and rebuffed Attorney General John N. Mitchell's effort to interest him in the new vacancy. He finally accepted with a deep reluctance that was overcome only by a direct appeal from Nixon, who said it was Mr. Powell's patriotic duty to serve.
The bar association gave its former president its highest possible rating, and the nomination was well received in legal circles. He was confirmed by the full Senate on Dec. 6, 1971, and he and Mr. Rehnquist were sworn in as the 99th and 100th members of the Court on Jan. 7, 1972.
Justice Powell approached his new job without any great relish. He regretted leaving Richmond and the law practice that he loved. "The truth is that I'd rather be a lawyer than a judge," he told his former colleagues. "I really prefer to be competitive rather than neutral, detached and disinterested." Nevertheless, he said, he had no doubt that if he had it to do over he would still accept the appointment.
After moving to Washington, Justice Powell maintained strong ties to Richmond. He and his wife kept their Richmond house, a colonial mansion that had belonged to Mrs. Powell's parents, and returned there every summer. He also kept an office in the Federal courthouse in Richmond. In Washington, the couple lived in an apartment in the southwest section of the capital, near the Potomac River.
 
60 Hours a Week On Court's Business
But the Court, when it was in session, was Justice Powell's real home. He told a group of lawyers and judges in a 1983 speech that except for the summer recess, he worked 60 hours a week, "considerably more than my chargeable hours ever were at the peak of a large and demanding law practice."
Justice Powell's role as the Court's master of compromise and coalition-building was nowhere brought into sharper focus than in the 1978 case of Allan P. Bakke. That case, in which the Court was asked to rule on the legality of a state medical school admissions program that set aside a fixed number of places for black and other minority-group applicants, sparked a vigorous national debate over affirmative action that continued for years.
With the Court split 4 to 4, Justice Powell extracted a controlling opinion from the deadlock by joining first one four-member bloc and then the other. He agreed with one group of Justices that the challenged program was unlawful because it totally excluded whites from any consideration for the 16 places. But he then joined the other four members of the Court to conclude that a university could properly consider race and ethnic origin as a "plus" factor among other factors to achieve a diverse student body.
"The State has a substantial interest that legitimately may be served by a properly devised admissions program involving the competitive consideration of race and ethnic origin," Justice Powell said in his solitary opinion. The concept of affirmative action was preserved and the debate, at least in the short run, defused.
 
Pivotal Role in Cases Of Church and State
Justice Powell also played a pivotal role in numerous Supreme Court cases that defined the constitutional boundary between church and state. Cases challenging various programs of state aide to parochial schools reached the Court with regularity, and Justice Powell's vote was often decisive in upholding or striking down a particular program. In that role, the former school board president was keenly aware of the potentially inflammatory nature of the debate over the relationship of religion and government. He believed that, apart from doctrinal niceties, it was vital for the Court to avoid fueling those fires.
For example, in 1977 he joined a fragmented majority that upheld an Ohio parochial aid law. In his concurring opinion in Wolman v. Walter, he noted that "at this point in the 20th century," the risk of "deep political division along religious lines" was "remote."
But in 1985, with the political debate over church and state at a peak, Justice Powell provided the fifth vote striking down parochial aid programs in New York City and Grand Rapids, Mich. His concurring opinion in Aguilar v. Felton, the New York case, cited the "continuing risk of continuing political strife," noting that "the potential for such divisiveness is a strong additional reason" for finding the programs unconstitutional. In the 30 religion cases in which he participated -- many of them decided by closely divided votes -- he was never on the losing side. The Court itself eventually adopted a different approach to questions of church and state, overruling the Aguilar case in a 1997 decision called Agostini v. Felton.
More often than not, Justice Powell voted with the conservatives in cases dealing with criminal law. He believed that prison inmates and their lawyers abused their right of access to the Federal courts by filing frivolous lawsuits, and he joined a majority of the Court in the mid-1980's in invoking new procedures for avoiding protracted appeals in death penalty cases.
He voted to uphold the death penalty in numerous cases, including a notable case that asked the Court to examine accusations that application of the death penalty was infected by racism. Challengers to the death penalty in Georgia presented statistics showing that killers of whites were more likely to be sentenced to die than those whose victims were black. Writing for the Court in a 5-to-4 opinion, McCleskey v. Kemp, Justice Powell said that the statistical study did not "demonstrate a constitutionally significant risk of racial bias" sufficient to invalidate the death penalty in Georgia.
The death penalty was one of two subjects on which Justice Powell changed his mind after he left the Court. He told his biographer, Professor Jeffries, in a 1991 interview that he regretted his vote in the McCleskey case and other death penalty cases. "I have come to think that capital punishment should be abolished," he said.
He described his view as based on pragmatic concerns rather than on questions about the morality or constitutionality of the death penalty itself. Doubts about the death penalty could never be resolved and would inevitably bring the judicial system itself into disrepute, the Justice said. Professor Jeffries detected a deeper source of disquiet in the retired Justice. "After 15 years of capital cases, Powell knew firsthand their deadly hold on the judge's peace of mind," he wrote.
 
With the Majority In Roe v. Wade
Justice Powell was a member of the majority in Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that gave women the constitutional right to obtain abortions, and he did not waiver in his support of that principle. He wrote the Court's opinion in a 1983 case striking down restrictions on abortion imposed by the city of Akron, Ohio. His opinion acknowledged and rebuffed the efforts of anti-abortion forces to persuade the Court to overrule Roe v. Wade. The argument was settled, Justice Powell wrote; the doctrine of adherence to precedent "is a doctrine that demands respect in a society governed by the rule of law."
In an interview with the British Broadcasting Company after his retirement, Justice Powell described a long-ago incident at his law firm that had shaped his views on the desirability of legalized abortion in the years before Roe v. Wade. A 19-year-old messenger for the firm had called him at home early one morning with a desperate request for help. His girlfriend had died while trying, with the messenger's help, to abort a pregnancy. The messenger could have been charged with murder.
In the interview, Justice Powell said he visited the city prosecutor on the young man's behalf. "To make a long story short, no prosecution was ever brought," he said, adding: "So I was in full agreement with the decision of the Court in Roe. I thought a woman ought to have the right, and I still think so."
In 1986, the question for the Court was whether the constitutional right to privacy recognized in Roe v. Wade should also apply to consensual sex between homosexual adults. In a 5-to-4 decision, Bowers v. Hardwick, the Court rejected that analysis of the right to privacy. Justice Powell joined Justice Byron R. White's majority opinion that described as "at best, facetious" the argument that there was constitutional protection for homosexuality.
Four years later, in a question-and-answer session after a speech to students at New York University Law School, Justice Powell said he had originally voted the other way but had changed his mind at the last minute. He said he now regretted his vote and had concluded that the dissent "had the better of the arguments."

Poor Health Forced Retirement
He announced his retirement on the last day of the Supreme Court in June 1987, giving health problems as the reason. Two years earlier, he had nearly died of uncontrolled bleeding after surgery for prostate cancer and had not regained his energy. He was 79 years old, reed-thin and frail in appearance. But he had an active and productive retirement. Until 1996, when his health declined sharply, he sat regularly as an appeals court judge -- an available but little-used prerogative of retired Justices -- on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond. He gave speeches, gently but pointedly reminding his former colleagues of the importance of civility and adherence to precedent. On Jan. 7 last year, 25 years to the day after taking the oath as a Supreme Court Justice, he closed the office he had kept at the Court and returned to live full time at his home in Richmond.
A political firestorm followed Justice Powell's departure from the Court in 1987, though he never commented on it. President Reagan nominated Robert H. Bork, a Federal appeals court judge and leading conservative legal scholar who had made no secret of his view that much of modern constitutional law, from the criminal procedure rulings of the Warren Court to the abortion decision in Roe v. Wade, was profoundly misguided. The Democratic-controlled Senate defeated the nomination after a nearly four-month battle. A second nomination for the vacancy, that of Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, was withdrawn. President Reagan's third choice, Anthony M. Kennedy, a Federal appeals court judge from Sacramento, Calif., was eventually confirmed and took Justice Powell's seat on Feb. 18, 1988.
President Clinton paid tribute to Justice Powell yesterday, saying: "For over 15 years on the Supreme Court, he approached each case without an ideological agenda, carefully applying the Constitution, the law and Supreme Court precedent regardless of his own personal views about the case. His opinions were a model of balance and judiciousness. As a result, he was the decisive voice on the court in addressing some of the most important issues of our day."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Picks a Chief Lobbyist Whose Father Once Held the Job

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani appointed Anthony P. Piscitelli yesterday to be the city's chief lobbyist in Albany, saying Mr. Piscitelli had a "genetic capacity" for the position because his father held the job two decades ago.
Mr. Piscitelli is replacing Robert M. Harding, who became the Mayor's budget director last month after spending four years as the city's lobbyist in the State Capitol. He will be in charge of promoting the city's legislative agenda in Albany, a job requiring strong persuasive powers. 
 Mr. Piscitelli's father, Peter A. Piscitelli, was the city's chief lobbyist under Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1978 and 1979. He is now a partner in Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman & Dicker, one of the most powerful lobbying firms in New York. Anthony Piscitelli, known as Skip, spent the last two years working for Wilson, Elser, which represents mostly private businesses on matters involving city and state government.
Wilson, Elser was paid $1 million last year to influence governmental decisions, more than any other firm that lobbies the city, according to a report by the City Clerk's office.
"Skip Piscitelli brings a tremendous amount of experience to this very important assignment," Mayor Giuliani said in announcing the appointment, "one that's really critical to the fiscal stability of the city and critical to our achieving many of our policy objectives. In addition to his vast experience and knowledge as a lawyer and as a person who understands what's going on in Albany, this is also inherited."
People who have worked with Mr. Piscitelli described him as low-key and experienced. He was an assistant lobbyist for the city from 1990 to 1994, working on environmental and economic development issues under both Mayor David N. Dinkins and Mayor Giuliani. Mr. Piscitelli, 42, then spent two years as a lobbyist at Gibney, Anthony & Flaherty, the firm that employed Peter J. Powers, one of the Mayor's closest friends, until Mr. Powers became a deputy mayor in 1994.
"My general impression is that Skip's a nice guy who has been doing lobbying for quite a while," said Abraham M. Lackman, finance director for the State Senate and Mr. Giuliani's first budget director. "He has paid his dues."
Both Mr. Piscitelli and his father are Democrats, but both said their greatest strength was transcending party labels. Still, Mr. Piscitelli said his biggest challenge would be convincing legislators from New York City who are not allies of Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, that "we're there to carry the message of the city of New York."
But in the end, the Mayor's combative style will probably be an asset to Mr. Piscitelli, Mr. Lackman said. "People perceive this Mayor as being powerful," he said. "And when people perceive your principal as being powerful, it makes your job easier."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE ATTACKS: THE CONNECTION;
Iraqi Deal With Sudan On Nerve Gas Is Reported

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, the Sudan, Aug. 25

 BODY:
At the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991, when the Sudan was one of Iraq's few remaining friends in the world, the Government here struck a bargain with Baghdad, foreign diplomats and Sudanese said today.
In return for Iraqi financial help and assistance by military and civilian experts, the Sudan agreed to allow its installations to be used by Iraqi technicians for steps in the production of chemical weapons, they said. 
 The deal was beneficial to both countries. The struggling Sudan got economic help, and Iraq was able to move ahead with chemical weapons far away from the gaze of United Nations weapons inspectors.
"Sudan is a wonderful place to do secretive things," a former Sudanese Government official said.
A diplomat here said the Clinton Administration had known about the Iraqi chemical weapons activities here for some time. The United States attacked a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum last week and says it was because the factory was making a rare chemical used for the nerve agent VX.
The Sudanese Government has insisted that the factory was used only for the manufacture of medicines and has called for an international investigation to prove its contention.
The diplomats and the former Government official said it was not absolutely clear at which of several plants the Iraqis were working on chemical weapons or their precursors. It was not clear either, the diplomat said, whether completed chemical weapons were made or only precursors.
They said, however, that a military complex on the southern outskirts of the city, not the plant that was attacked, was the most likely place for the production.
Immediately after the gulf war, 40 Iraqi Government employees were sent to the heavily guarded military complex, one diplomat said.
"The Iraqis are there to guard chemical weapons or substances that Iraq doesn't want in Iraq," the diplomat said.
Hundreds of other Iraqi experts have worked in various fields in the Sudan since the gulf war, including the manufacture of munitions, the diplomat and the former Government official said.
The destruction of the pharmaceutical factory in the industrial area of Khartoum was a surprise because it had been touted since its opening in early 1997 as a breakthrough in the local production of inexpensive medicines, the diplomat said.
It was reportedly only lightly guarded.
Administration officials said on Monday that the pharmaceutical factory, Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries, had been targeted after soil samples from outside the plant, secretly obtained months ago, were found to have a rare chemical needed for the manufacture of VX.
The chemical, ethyl methylphosphonothinonate, known as Empta, has no industrial uses, the Administration official said. The only viable explanation for the presence of the "precursor chemical" is the production of VX, the official said.
Today, Administration officials said the pharmaceutical plant was not the only installation in the Sudan suspected of producing chemicals for VX, but rather the one where the United States had the most persuasive evidence.
"There were other facilities where there was really hard evidence," an official said, "but there was not a smoking gun; there was not a soil sample."
It seemed possible that the pharmaceutical factory was not actually making the "precursor chemical" that the Administration described, the diplomats here said. They believed that the factory had been chosen as a target because it could be more precisely hit than the military plant and without running the risk of spreading deadly vapors.
The Administration has said in the last two days that it was confident of its justification for hitting the pharmaceutical plant and saw no reason for an investigation into whether Empta was produced there.
Traces of Empta would survive destruction of a site by fire, said a chemical weapons expert, Amy E. Smythson of the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington. The center specializes in arms control research.
Under Secretary of State Thomas R. Pickering said today in Washington: "We see evidence that we think is quite clear on contacts between Sudan and Iraq. In fact, el Shifa officials, early in the company's history, we believe, were in touch with Iraqi individuals associated with Iraq's VX program."
Iraq and Iran are about the Sudan's best friends in the Arab world. Because the Sudanese Govenrment has been accused of harboring training centers for terrorists, the Sudan has tense relations with neighboring Egypt and poor relations with Saudi Arabia.
Relations between the United States and the Islamic military rulers who came to power here in 1989 deteriorated to the point where the American Embassy was closed in 1996. The Sudan is on the State Department's list of terrorist states.
The Iraqi-Sudanese relationship has blossomed over time and includes the assignment of Iraqi military officers at an air base outside Khartoum, Sudanese officials say. The Iraqis have helped with civilian activities, including repairing irrigation machinery for agricultural projects, they said.
The Iraqis and the Sudanese have also developed trade relations, including an order from the destroyed pharmaceutical plant for veterinary drugs to be exported to Iraq. The sanctions committee of the United Nations Security Council approved the supplies under the "oil for food" program that allows Iraq to sell some oil despite economic sanctions in order to buy relief supplies.
The export-import relationship involving civilian products could well have been developed to help cover the export of agents for chemical weapons, officials said.
The immediate connection between the pharmaceutical plant and Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile now living in Afghanistan whose training camps were hit by cruise missiles the same night as the Sudanese factory, was not clear.
The United States originally suggested that the pharmaceutical plant was financed by Mr. bin Laden, which could have been the case during the plant's construction, diplomats said.
The factory is now owned by Saleh Idresse, a Sudanese who also has citizenship in Saudi Arabia. Businessmen in Khartoum said Mr. Idresse had plenty of cash, the sources of which are not clear. They said he had paid $27 million in cash for the Shifa plant.
He is also reported to have invested in what Sudanese refer to as the Government "military industrial complex." This includes the plant in southern Khartoum, the diplomat said, where the Iraqi technicians worked on the chemical weapons agents.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Iraq Denies Involvement
 UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 25 (By The New York Times) -- Iraq's representative at the United Nations denied today that his country had been involved in the development or production of chemical weapons in the Sudan and said the Iraqi Government would welcome an independent investigation of the factory in Khartoum destroyed by the United States.
"Iraq has had pharmaceutical contracts with the Government of Sudan, and I believe that this was the factory that was producing those medicines," said Nizar Hamdoon, the Iraqi representative, said of the Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries plant.
"So in that context, we have had commercial ties," Mr. Hamdoon said. "But beyond that, we strongly deny that there has been any chemical connections."
He accused the United States of trying to deflect attention from the attacks on the factory by saying Iraq was helping the Sudan produce components for the nerve gas VX.
Copies of documents from an Iraqi order placed with the plant, under the program that allows Iraq to import food and medicines to alleviate the hardships of sanctions, show that Iraq ordered 100,000 liter bottles of a compound that United Nations officials said was intended for de-worming farm animals.
The purchase was approved by the Security Council sanctions committee on Iraq, but there is no record of the shipment's having been made or received.

HEADLINE: Seaside Dreams From Asbury Park

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: ASBURY PARK, N.J., Aug. 25

 BODY:
In the last dozen years this long-sagging New Jersey shore city has seen an eclectic bunch of would-be saviors, with plans ranging from the mundane to the sublime.
There was the Indian tribe that wanted to open a boardwalk casino. There were the followers of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi who bought a beachfront hotel in a plan to create a transcendental meditation center. 
 And there was the developer who proposed a series of entertainment pavilions along the boardwalk, saying the family of Michael Jackson would operate one and Jacques Cousteau's organization another.
All of them ran aground, whether stalled by recessions, bankruptcies or a pervasive skepticism over the city's ability to reduce high rates of crime and poverty. But today a small group of residents and business owners rushed yet again into the fray, urging members of the City Council to accept a new offer from the New Jersey Redevelopment Authority to take on the long-stalled rebuilding effort.
Standing in the shadow of the hulking and incomplete Ocean Mile Condominiums project, which was abandoned by a bankrupt developer in 1992 and became a symbol of the city's plight, the group called the Asbury Park Consortium called on other residents to join them in putting away their fears of further disappointment.
The state agency could offer funds and expertise for planning, as well as help in attracting private development -- assistance that members of the consortium said was crucial to any successful rebuilding effort. But opponents of state involvement say they are skeptical of the promises of outsiders, and wary that state officials might press for more low-income housing development.
Proponents said that ceding some control to the state was a small price to pay to jump-start a redevelopment effort that has languished for so long. "It's a simple choice between something versus nothing," said John Hamilton, a Councilman who supports state involvement. He said that few if any desirable private developers were pressing to help rebuild the mile-long stretch of properties across from the beachfront and boardwalk.
The Council is slated on Friday to hold the first of two votes on inviting the state into the city.
William Best, the executive director of the state authority, said the 18-month-old agency had so far spent $13 million in 17 cities in the state and leveraged more than $52 million in private investments. Financed with about $425 million, the agency can offer a range of help to 67 specially designated cities, he said.
This city of 17,000 people, just 60 miles from New York City, probably last saw some luster in the 70's when a local star, Bruce Springsteen, was packing them in at the Paramount Theater and Convention Center on a boardwalk that was still lined with amusements and carnival rides. It had already been declining as a resort area for some years, and racial disturbances at the time sped that decline.
Today the city is 70 percent black and has an unemployment rate of 18 percent -- more than three times the statewide rate. The city's median income is $20,754, about half that of surrounding Monmouth County. About 22 percent of its families have earnings below the poverty level and 31 percent of its residents do not have high school diplomas.
In the 80's, the city adopted an ambitious redevelopment plan, of which the Ocean Mile condominiums were a key element. But the developer, Joseph Carabetta, who had the rights for the entire waterfront, was swamped by the recession and was forced to declare bankruptcy. Lawsuits by creditors and disarray among members of the Council over what course to take further complicated the city's efforts to move on.
"The only ones who got rich were the lawyers," said Rita Marano, owner of Kingsley Avenue Deli, as she displayed an editorial cartoon of lawyers dragging sacks of money out of town, from a local paper several years ago.
Even as all of this was going on, Asbury Park's leadership was undergoing a racial change from white to black. Long-smoldering distrust between whites and blacks mixed with the disappointment and finger-pointing of the failed redevelopment efforts to make movement even more difficult, said Henry Vaccaro, a former partner in the bankrupted redevelopment effort.
Coalitions have grown up and collapsed. Council members have been elected only to be voted out in recall elections over promises they had made.
"We've been deceived and disappointed so many times by so many people that we don't know who to trust anymore," said a local landlord, Norman Lemonde, with a world-weary shrug.
Like Mr. Vaccaro and Ms. Marano, Mr. Lemonde says he is wary of state involvement. Citing state efforts in the 70's and early 80's, they equate state involvement with the building of low-income housing rather than commercial development. They also say that they fear an increase in people on government assistance and an ever-expanding local government, which they say has become the city's employer of last resort in the absence of private sector jobs.
Mr. Best insisted that the state had no such plans, but Ms. Marano's motto is once burned, twice cautious.
"It's a sin to say it, but some people can make a lot of money on poor people," she said.
Mr. Hamilton, the Council member pushing for the city to ally formally with the state redevelopment authority, said he welcomed the support of the people who held the press conference today.
Unlike Mr. Vaccaro and other veterans of the heated and contentious early years of the redevelopment effort, they were new, more optimistic voices. One immediate result of the state involvement would be the payment of some $6.5 million in back taxes on the redevelopment acres held by Mr. Carabetta. In the absence of those revenues, the city has been increasingly dependent on state aid to meet its budget.
Echoing Mr. Hamilton's optimism is Wilbert Russell, the city's fourth city manager in three years, who has been on the job for just three months. He said he has been struck by how consumed people were with the mistakes of the past as he has worked to help the Council evaluate the idea of state involvement.
"I see their disappointments," he said, "but I just keep telling them that if they keep looking back, that's where they are going to wind up."

HEADLINE: Slowly, Rising and Falling, Flood Swallows Town

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: DEL RIO, Tex., Aug. 25

 BODY:
Pat Calderon was standing on tiptoe atop his projection television console, the dark water in his living room so deep it was licking his chin, when his 82-year-old disabled mother, who was floating nearby on an upholstered love seat, asked if he would mind fetching her a dry blanket.
"I said, 'Mom, look where we are, we're in a flood,' " said Mr. Calderon, a fifth-grade teacher from San Felipe Estates in Del Rio. "I was holding on to that love seat so it didn't tip over and dump her in the water. I felt like that Titanic guy." 
 For six hours, they were stranded like that, the water slowly rising and then slowly falling, revealing a jumble of sopping carpet, furniture, books, videotapes, electronic equipment, all covered in gunk. A candle had bobbed all night on a floating end table while lightning flashes revealed the swift current tearing through what was left of his neighborhood.
"I was in the middle of this stuff and I couldn't believe it was happening," Mr. Calderon said.
Small groups of mud-streaked residents picked through what was left of their soggy belongings in San Felipe Estates today as hundreds remained homeless and the city struggled to return to normal after the disaster that left 10 dead on both sides of the river and more than 20 still missing. Five others had also died in flooding farther north in the Texas Hill Country.
The huge swell that put two-thirds of Del Rio under water early Monday -- some of it, like Mr. Calderon's neighborhood, more than eight feet under water -- had gushed down San Felipe Creek and its normally dry tributaries into the Rio Grande, and it was already halfway to the Gulf of Mexico by this afternoon.
All that was left was a swath of town covered with mud and debris, collapsed buildings, buckling pavement, chewed-up bridges and cars scattered everywhere, upside down, on their side, on top of buildings, on top of one another, so many matchbox cars in an untidy toy box.
"It came so quickly," said Councilwoman Gloria Sotelo, who was handing out drinking water at an American Red Cross shelter this afternoon. "By the time you crossed the street, the water was up to your knees. By the time you turned back, it was up to your shoulders."
Ms. Sotelo, like many of the more than 600 people seeking shelter in the Del Rio Civic Center because their homes were gone or uninhabitable, had known some of the six people in town who officials said had died and the dozen or so who were swept away and were still missing.
"It's too sad to think about now," Ms. Sotelo said.
Across the river, in Ciudad Acuna, Mexico, 4 people died in the floods and 10 remained missing, said Mario Neyra, a Mexican relief official.
Red Cross doctors worked from folding tables on the Del Rio civic center's stage while hundreds of people sprawled on cots and foam mattresses, and children scampered through the crowd.
Jessica Porras sat on a pillow on a metal folding chair in the civic center, her day-old daughter, Ruby, squalling in her lap.
"My husband was at work and I started having contractions around 11 o'clock Sunday night," Ms. Porras said. "It was all of a sudden the rain came and the kitchen started filling up with water. The water kept going up and the contractions kept getting worse, so I finally called an ambulance."
Ms. Porras had her daughter at 2:14 A.M., while the water was rising, and when she returned home next morning, she found it flooded. Neighbors said she and the ambulance had barely beat the deluge.
Cyndi Wright, a Red Cross spokeswoman, said that 635 people had slept in the center Monday night and at least that many were expected tonight. Two other shelters had been closed Monday night when the rising water threatened to swamp them. In Eagle Pass, more than 700 people slept in five shelters.
"We seem to have enough food, but water is still at a premium," Ms. Wright said.
Ms. Sotelo described the flood's victims as "mostly poor, about 90 percent of them, and a lot of them without insurance, so I don't know how we're going to handle it."
Del Rio is a remote city of more than 30,000 people in the arid scrub land on the Rio Grande 145 miles west of San Antonio. Like the rest of Texas, it was in the midst of the biggest drought in at least four decades when the remnants of Tropical Storm Charley dumped 17 inches of rain on Sunday and early Monday.
Though there is some ranching nearby, and a few small farms, most of the city's economy flows from its border crossing, the factories just south of the border and Laughlin Air Force Base. "We're basically a small, working community, and this flood hit the poorest part of town," Ms. Sotelo said. "The whole county has come out to help with this, though."
Local fast-food outlets sent hamburgers, tacos and sandwiches to the shelters. Churches were collecting old clothes. The flood swamped the city's water pumps, and the taps are expected to stay dry for several more days, forcing people to use swimming pool water to wash. Dozens of people walked with plastic buckets down to the swollen creek to fill them with muddy water to flush their toilets.
Around the city, people waited in line for drinking water donated by the Air Force and by local ranchers with untainted wells.
"We've just got a town that's full of precious people," said Jackie Isenhour, a retired restaurant owner who was also helping out at the shelter.
The swell that hit Del Rio early Monday had passed through Eagle Pass, the next significant city downriver, by late Monday night. Unlike Del Rio, Eagle Pass had some warning. Hundreds were evacuated and, while the water did flood many city streets, there were no deaths or injuries.
Across the river, in Piedras Negras, one person was killed in the flooding, Mr. Neyra said, and three people were still missing tonight.
Farther downriver, at Laredo, all three international bridge crossings were ordered closed and the swell is expected to sweep through about 1 P.M. on Wednesday. Just beyond Laredo is Lake Falcon, which officials said would swallow up most of the flood water and stop it from pushing farther downriver.
Pat Calderon said his mother, Leonore, was resting comfortably at a relative's house tonight. She had resisted leaving their house when the water started rising. "She was in her wheelchair, grabbing onto the wall, saying she wouldn't go," he said. By the time it was clear that they ought to leave, the water was too high to get away.
"First I put my mother on her bed, then watched the water come up the bedpost," he said. "Then the mattress started floating. The water came up to my chest. I had to stand on a chair, and it came up to my chest again. If that love seat hadn't floated by, I don't know what I would have done with my mother."
He looked around the wreckage of his house, mud, like peanut butter on a sandwich, smeared across it. The current had picked up his blue Lincoln, carried it 50 yards up the street and dumped it on the roof of his brother's auto parts store.
"I hope we never go through anything like this again," Mr. Calderon said. "At least we made it. We're a little stinky, but we made it."

HEADLINE: Schumer Proposes New Spending Programs

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Asserting that Wall Street's wave of prosperity had failed to lift most inner-city neighborhoods in New York, Charles E. Schumer, a Democratic candidate for Senate, proposed a series of Federal spending programs yesterday to encourage development in downtrodden cities and to raise the incomes and savings of the poor and middle class.
Mr. Schumer, a Democratic Congressman from Brooklyn, urged a sharp increase in the minimum wage, tax credits for first-time home buyers who move into designated urban neighborhoods and a new tax-free savings account program in which the Government would partially match savings that low-income families put aside for at least five years. 
 Mr. Schumer framed his proposals, which he gave in a speech in Jamaica, Queens, as a specific appeal to minority voters, who tend to make up a significant proportion of the turnout in Democratic primaries. Mr. Schumer -- one of three Democrats seeking the nomination to challenge Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato -- said that poor minority neighborhoods had failed to share in Wall Street's good fortune, producing what he warned was a dangerous imbalance in the state's economy.
"Remember the 20's," Mr. Schumer said, referring to the decade leading up to the Great Depression. "If the prosperity and the wealth is concentrated at the very top, sooner or later there's not enough buying power in the rest of the population."
Mr. Schumer noted that New York has ranked near the bottom of the 50 states in job creation. "That's unacceptable," he said. "When you consider how much the bull market on Wall Street has done to help our economy, you realize just how poorly the rest of New York is faring."
The Representative, who has proposed a variety of spending programs in this campaign -- including making college tuition deductible -- said the cost of his latest proposal would be less than $1 billion. He added that he would pay for the proposal by cutting defense spending or agriculture subsidies. "I think we can easily find a billion dollars," he said.
The speech came after a period in which Mr. Schumer had kept a relatively low-profile public campaign schedule, possibly reflecting the fact that candidates in all the major races this year have found it difficult to compete for attention with President Clinton's legal difficulties and the bombings in Africa. Mr. Schumer, however, has been running a heavy schedule of campaign advertisements, unlike either of his rivals, Mark Green, the New York City Public Advocate, and Geraldine A. Ferraro, the former Queens Representative.
Mr. Schumer delivered his speech at the Jamaica Business Resource Center, a nonprofit organization that assists minority and small-business owners. The Congressman sat at one end of a table, addressing an audience of just 15 people, including his mother and father, who were in the neighborhood and stopped by to hear their son speak.
Some of the details of Mr. Schumer's proposals, which he described as a "major policy address," appeared to be falling into place as the day went on. Asked after his address if interest earned on his proposed savings account would be tax exempt, Mr. Schumer responded: "You know, that's a good question. I don't think it would be tax free, but maybe it should be. Making it tax free would be a good idea."
Yesterday afternoon, after a series of inquiries, Mr. Schumer's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, called a reporter to say that both the interest and the money invested in the account would be tax free. Mr. Wolfson said it was largely a moot question because most families that would qualify for the program made too little money to be obliged to pay taxes.
Under that program, parents with a household income of less than $25,000 a year would be able to have $10 deducted from their weekly paycheck, which would be matched by $5 a week from the Government. That would produce savings of $780 a year, not counting interest.
Families would not be allowed to spend the money for five years. After that, there would be no restrictions on how the money could be used, though Mr. Schumer said he hoped families would spend it on such things as paying for college tuition or a down payment on a house.
Mr. Schumer also proposed raising the minimum wage, now $5.15 an hour, to $7.50 by 2002, and linking it after that to inflation. Efforts to raise the minimum wage have been strongly resisted by Republicans in Congress.
Mr. Schumer also proposed that first-time home buyers get a $2,000 tax credit when they buy homes in low-income neighborhoods designated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. And he said that nonprofit groups, like churches and hospitals, should get the same payroll-tax credit for hiring people on welfare that is currently awarded to private business.
"None of what I talked about today constitutes a handout," Mr. Schumer said. "A handout is temporary."
He added: "I am talking about a plan that can never be taken away, a plan that levels the playing field so that the game is fair."
Mr. Schumer mentioned neither of his rivals in his speech, and they, in turn, offered a reserved reaction to the proposals. Both Mr. Green and Ms. Ferraro support an increase in the minimum wage. Mr. Green has proposed raising it to $7.33, but Ms. Ferraro has not offered a specific number.
"There are a lot of ideas, but I don't think these are new ideas," said Stephen Gaskill, Ms. Ferraro's spokesman. "Those are things that are out there already. He's packaging this as a new innovative program, and it's not."

HEADLINE: Gore Gives No Hint That Anything Could Be Amiss

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: HONOLULU, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Looking tan and relaxed after a two-week Hawaiian vacation, Vice President Al Gore returned to full public view today, giving little hint that anything of major consequence had happened while he was away.
In a daylong schedule here that included a rousing speech to a convention of 5,000 civil servants, a stop at an elementary school and a rally for the Hawaii Democratic Party, a noticeably energized Mr. Gore emphasized the positive and the future, focusing on issues like education, health care and the need for union members and Democrats to support the party in the November elections. 
 Mr. Gore's remarks were unusually fiery for someone who has openly joked about his reputation as a stiff and sometimes awkward speaker.
Through much of his address to the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees underlining the Administration's strong support for labor, he belted out many of his points, lacing his remarks with jokes and gestures that ignited the crowd.
He concluded with a challenge for the 1998 elections: "Are you willing to more than match the intensity that the right-wing extremists will bring to the battles that lie ahead?"
The response was a loud and long standing ovation.
But Mr. Gore's remarks were equally notable for what he did not say, leaving little doubt that the omissions were part of a calculated effort to distance himself from matters that roiled Washington last week. He made no mention of President Clinton's acknowledgment of a relationship with a former White House intern nor did he acknowledge new questions that have come up about his own fund-raising activities in the 1996 campaign.
In what a spokeswoman for the Vice President indicated would be the rule for at least the next few days as Mr. Gore and his wife, Tipper, make their way back to Washington, he took no questions. The Gores are scheduled to leave Hawaii on Wednesday for San Francisco, where he plans to attend several more events before leaving for Washington on Thursday afternoon.
For Mr. Gore, whose allegiance to President Clinton over the last six years serves as a springboard for his own Presidential aspirations, the months ahead are laden with political peril for him and the Democratic Party.
Unlike the President, Mr. Gore has enjoyed a virtually spotless public persona throughout his long political career.
But an important question facing him is whether voters will continue to be able to separate the two men, or whether Mr. Clinton's problems have so sullied his Administration they will damage Mr. Gore as well. And while voters may see Mr. Gore as more trustworthy, if less magnetic, than Mr. Clinton, the Vice President may have his own troubles down the road as Attorney General Janet Reno reconsiders whether to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate fund-raising telephone calls he made from his office.
If she does so, the campaign finance investigation, which has failed to capture much public interest so far, may become an enormous liability for him.
As a consequence of Mr. Clinton's difficulties, Mr. Gore must maintain a delicate balance between his loyalty to a close friend who has been damaged, but who has done more than any other President to lay the financial groundwork for his running mate's ascension, and a detachment that enables the Vice President to preserve his own integrity, his sense of loyalty and, of course, his political viability.
"He has to walk a fine line, the nature of which is pretty clear," said Stuart Rothenberg, a political analyst in Washington. "Bill Clinton has been Al Gore's No. 1 benefactor. He is also the No. 1 reason Al Gore is the heavy favorite to become the party nominee for President. So he needs to remain loyal to the President but at the same time maintain a separate identity to avoid the appearance he is Bill Clinton's toady."
The practical question for Mr. Gore is how to clutch all the benefits of serving as Mr. Clinton's friend and adviser while avoiding the obvious baggage of the President's relationship with the former intern, Monica S. Lewinsky.
With elections three months away and the Administration eagerly seeking support for its proposals on education, health care, the budget surplus and other issues, Mr. Gore might be most helpful for the party and himself, aides said, by campaigning around the country for Democratic candidates.
Even the schedule of his first two days after vacation suggests that he is keen to get started. Here in Hawaii, where the economy has sagged for seven years and Democrats have controlled state government for nearly 40, Gov. Benjamin J. Cayetano is trailing in polls to a Republican challenger. Both Mr. Cayetano and Representative Patsy Mink accompanied Mr. Gore today.
In San Francisco, Mr. Gore is scheduled to attend a reception on Wednesday night for Michela Alioto, a former Gore aide who is the Democratic candidate for California Secretary of State.
While many Democratic officials say that Mr. Gore might be an ideal emollient to soothe any public disdain for a wounded President, Republicans may be just as happy to have Mr. Gore out stumping -- but for entirely different reasons.
"If Al Gore is coming to my state, I would have no problem or hesitation raising the facts of the cloud of controversy about 1996 and his role in illegal or unethical behavior," said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster.
To many voters of both parties, the unresolved fund-raising issues could prove far more problematic for Mr. Gore than any of Mr. Clinton's problems.
Questions about Mr. Gore's role were once put to rest, last December, when Attorney General Reno said she had found no evidence that Mr. Gore had raised money for direct aid to the campaign.
But the issue arose again last week when it was disclosed that the Justice Department had obtained a 1995 White House memorandum with handwritten notations that appeared to contradict Mr. Gore's account of his fund-raising telephone calls, according to Government officials. The notations indicate that Mr. Gore and several campaign officials discussed how some of the large contributions raised by the Vice President would be diverted to accounts to directly finance the Clinton-Gore campaign, Government officials said.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Lets Its Rule on Full Repayment Slip

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Pummeled by Asia and now Russia, the International Monetary Fund is gradually softening its policies, becoming more tolerant of arrangements it would have rejected a year ago -- and even allowing some Asian debtors not to repay all they owe to foreign banks.
Now the Russian Government is pushing this process of favoring the country in crisis a step or two further. 
 The Russians have announced that $40 billion in debt, scheduled for repayment over 18 months, will be "stretched out," and paid over three to five years. Probable devaluations of the ruble over so long a period raises the odds that foreign lenders, which include Chase Manhattan and Bank of America, will not be fully repaid in dollars.
As a result, one of the great debates of the Asian crisis is showing signs of being settled by events.
The I.M.F. and its powerful mentor, the Clinton Administration, have faced criticism for months now that their policies are pitched to assure full repayment of foreign lenders, at the cost of economic growth. Rescuing these lenders and investors from their risky actions only encourages more risky lending and more financial crises. Or so the argument goes, even among some Democrats and Republicans in Congress who oppose an $18 billion appropriation to fund the I.M.F. But now events appear to be overtaking words.
"We are basically reacting to the realities that are unfolding," said John Boorman, the I.M.F.'s director of policy development and review.
Trying to revive the disastrous Indonesian economy, for example, the I.M.F. since May has encouraged corporate borrowers in that country to renegotiate their debts to foreign lenders. The hope is that with a lower debt load, these companies can return to more normal operations. In some cases the foreign lenders are agreeing to collect less than 100 cents on the dollar. It is the first time that has happened with I.M.F. blessing since the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980's.
What's more, the fund has shifted away from demanding of the Indonesian Government one of its standard austerity measures: a budget surplus. That demand ended last month when the I.M.F. agreed instead to enough extra government spending, particularly for imported food, to run up the deficit to 8 to 10 percent of the total budget.
"I don't think we have ever at the I.M.F. had a program where we targeted a fiscal deficit as large as 8 to 10 percent," Mr. Boorman said.
Russia puts the fund, and the Clinton Administration, much more on the spot. The fund had authorized a $22 billion loan to Russia, only to have the Russians, earlier this month, devalue their currency and change the repayment terms for much of its debt, including the $40 billion in Russian short-term government paper.
Foreign investors, converting dollars to rubles, had bought about $10 billion of this total, and now that the repayment has been prolonged, ruble devaluations are likely to wipe out some of their investment. The stretch-out terms, announced today, provide for interest payments in the 20 percent to 30 percent range, annually -- probably not high enough to offset ruble devaluations.
Stanley Fischer, the fund's first deputy managing director, offered an angry characterization of the Russian initiative. "The I.M.F. regards the fact that Russia was unable to meet its commitments and has had to restructure them unilaterally as extremely unfortunate and regrettable," Mr. Fischer said. "The nature of the international economy will change if this is the way business has to be done."
Does that mean the I.M.F. won't make its next scheduled loan payment to Russia of more than $4 billion, scheduled for next month? Not necessarily.
The fund does not pressure banks to swallow loan write-offs against their wishes, but this time something like that could happen. Russia must comply with some loan conditions, Mr. Fischer and Mr. Boorman said. Above all, the Russian Duma, or lower house of Parliament, and Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, Russia's new Prime Minister, must accept the I.M.F.-imposed goal of a balanced budget in two or three years. But repayment to foreign lenders, in full, may be allowed to slip -- if the Government can demonstrate that it has no choice to revive its economy.
"If markets are going to operate properly," Mr. Boorman said, "and if markets are going to price risk appropriately, then in some circumstances that risk is going to materialize, in nonpayment of some debt, as it is materializing now."
One of the I.M.F.'s severest critics, the Harvard Institute for International Development, headed by the economist Jeffrey Sachs, is beginning to recognize, and applaud, the shift taking place at the fund.
"The fund is moving in the right direction, but slowly," said Steven Radelet, a Harvard Institute economist. "Unfortunately we were months into the Asian crisis before the I.M.F. began to adapt these more flexible policies. Its officials are coming around because their initial strategies failed" to revive the countries they were trying to help.
The fund, for example, has relaxed its blanket opposition to budget deficits. It has pulled back on its endorsement of unrestricted short-term lending across borders, recognizing that such loans set off the Asian crisis, when the lenders tried to call them in. And it is publishing, on the Internet, the texts of various agreements that in the past were not made public.
The fund's shifting stance is not without precedent. Years of stagnant economies in Latin America followed the debt crisis of the early 1980's when most Latin nations defaulted on debts owed to foreign banks. After nearly eight years in which the banks tried to force repayment of the entire debt, the Reagan Administration and the I.M.F. brokered an agreement that guaranteed repayment, but of a greatly reduced amount.
But the Mexican debt crisis of 1994 met with stiff resistance on the part of the I.M.F. and the Clinton Administration to any debt write-offs or concessions in standard I.M.F. practices. The same reaction greeted the Asian crisis. When South Korean banks, for example, renegotiated their foreign debt late last year, the I.M.F. blessed an agreement that stretched out repayment of short-term debts over several years, but called for repayment of the full dollar amount, with interest.

APPLIED MATERIALS TO CUT 15% OF ITS WORK FORCE

BYLINE: Reuters 

 BODY:
Applied Materials Inc., the world's largest supplier of equipment used to make computer chips, said yesterday that it planned to cut 2,000 jobs, or about 15 percent of its work force, in response to a global downturn in the semiconductor industry. The company will cut 750 jobs in Santa Clara, Calif., where it is based, and 600 at its plant in Austin, Tex. Most of the other cuts will be at sites around the world and will take place by the end of October. The company will also cut executive salaries by 10 percent. Applied said it expected to report a nonrecurring charge for the restructuring and to record a loss for its fourth quarter, ending Oct. 25. Since December, Applied has been restricting hiring, reducing the number of temporary workers and contractors and scheduling mandatory shutdown days.

USEC INC. ANNOUNCES PLAN TO CUT ITS WORK FORCE BY 500

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Usec Inc., which enriches uranium for nuclear power plants, said yesterday that it would cut 500 jobs, or 10 percent of its work force, as it worked to trim costs and compete with foreign rivals. This year the company will offer voluntary severance packages to 125 workers in Paducah, Ky., and 125 in Portsmouth, Ohio, and next year it will make similar offers to 250 more employees. Usec said that if not enough workers accepted the offers, it would dismiss people to meet its target. Usec was created by the United States Government in 1993 to take over uranium enrichment previously handled by the Department of Energy. The Government sold the company last month in a public offering of 100 million shares at $14.25.

Shortage of Workers Imperils Connecticut

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Connecticut's economy is booming now, but it could slow down because there are fewer workers for too many jobs, according to a quarterly economic report.
"In order for this growth to continue, we have to find people to fill these jobs," said William A. McEachern, a University of Connecticut economics professor and editor of The Connecticut Economy, which was published this week. 
 Since 1992, the state has added 121,000 jobs, or 80 percent of the jobs the state lost during the recession of the late 1980's and early 90's, according to the report. While the state continues to add jobs, job growth has slowed during the first half of this year.
Professor McEachern said that the economic slowdown may already have begun, but that he wanted to see what happens over the next quarter or two of this year before making that call. It will be difficult for Connecticut companies to attract more workers to the state, since most regions of the country are doing as well as Connecticut, he said.
Some workers could be found by tapping into the ranks of the underemployed -- part-time workers who would like full-time jobs and self-employed people who want extra income, according to the report.

Citibank Sued Over Bonds

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Citibank is the newest target in a discrimination lawsuit that charges three banks with excluding non-Indians from a bond sale.
State Bank of India and Bank of India were sued for $487.5 million last week in State Supreme Court in Manhattan in connection with their sale of five-year, 7.75 percent India Resurgent bonds only to people of Indian descent. Citibank was added to the suit yesterday because it also sold the bonds exclusively to Indians, said D. Daniel Engstrand, the plaintiff's lawyer. 
 "It appears that Citibank is willing to disregard American antidiscrimination laws in its pursuit of a new client base made up of wealthy Indian investors living in the U.S.," Mr. Engstrand said in a statement.
Citibank officials were not available for comment. Citibank is owned by Citicorp.
State Bank of India said the bond sale, completed yesterday, raised a larger-than-expected $4.1 billion, which may help offset economic setbacks following India's nuclear tests in May. The bonds are attractive because they offer an interest rate higher than United States Government five-year bonds.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Sometimes Delightful, Never Easy: It's Fringe

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS 

 BODY:
It was quite a few minutes past the monologue's scheduled starting time in the stifling Red Room on East Fourth Street, a space so cramped it could be a candidate for renovation by California Closet. Wilting theatergoers were daubing strands of disintegrating tissues across their scalps as the man in charge stepped to the front of the theater.
"Sorry we're starting late," he said, "But --" 
"That's 'Fringe'!" an audience member piped up, finishing the thought.
Yes, that is. Over at Surf Reality, a living-room-size space above a shop on Allen Street, a performer named Trav S.D. was bulldozing his way through his mock lecture, "Misshapen Jack the Nebraska Hunchback," when a fuse blew and the lights went out. In the freakish darkness, Trav implored, "Do you have the lantern?," at which point the man at the light board retrieved a flashlight and, shining it directly into Trav's face, illuminated the rest of the show.
The incessant whirr of floor or ceiling fans, useless against the humidity in any event, seemed to work like water torture on the nerves of some solo artists -- one I went to see had disconsolately failed to return for her curtain call -- and the light headedness induced by the intolerable heat during an all-male production of "The Importance of Being Earnest" made a case for retitling it "Into Thick Air."
But you know what? That's Fringe. The conditions at the second New York International Fringe Festival may not be ideal -- O.K., in some instances, the state of the restrooms alone is enough to make you run screaming into the night -- but the notion is not to impress the theatergoer with plushness. The youthfully self-important assumption of the festival, which continues through Sunday in 17 spaces in the East Village and Lower East Side, is that you have a need to be here almost as much as the young performers who are trying out ideas and personae -- trying out whole theatrical paths, really -- and to heck with the lights and the air-conditioning.
In practice, this ethos tends to push the playgoer to extremes. You can feel especially desolate at the really bad stuff: the only thing more unbearable than a self-indulgent piece about guitar-playing 25-year-olds living together in a warehouse, railing against corporate greed and dreaming of careers in poetry, is staging the piece in an underventilated garage. Conversely, there is an exaggerated sense of validation when, to your relief and pleasure, a show defies the odds, and works.
As its name implies, a fringe festival, pioneered in Edinburgh as an offbeat adjunct to a renowned play festival, is an opportunity to spotlight the work of aspiring playwrights, actors and directors. The New York festival, spread over a dozen days, is providing exposure this year to 144 troupes, monologuists and performance artists in what is perhaps the most theater-intensive city in the world.
The resulting audience is well-informed and jaded: at any given show, a casting agent may be sitting next to an acting student who is next to a rabid fan of that stalwart of Off Off Broadway, Mac Wellman. Which also makes for a demanding audience, although not necessarily an unappreciative one. The packed house Sunday night for "The Importance of Being Earnest," for instance, was so patient and intrepid it practically brought tears to a reviewer's eyes.
Presented in the sweltering confines of the Red Room, less a playhouse than an unintended bayou, and reduced by its adapter and director, Hugh Hysell, to a lean but playable 80 minutes, the production was just good enough to have been worth it. Mr. Hysell's notion was a tweaking of Wilde's farce, to make it a comedy of gay coupling. As it turns out, however, its most significant feature is not the cheeky inventiveness of turning Gwendolen and Cecily into Gerald and Kurt, but the comic ingenuity of the young actors who played them, Adam Beckworth and Harris Dorman.
No other scene in this production, updated to the present and set in Chelsea and the Hamptons, quite rises to the level of the one in which Gwendolen-Gerald and Cecily-Kurt banter with only slightly disguised contempt after discovering they both are engaged to a man named Ernest. It succeeds not so much because it works on Mr. Hysell's terms, but on Wilde's. Mr. Beckworth's readings of the playwright's indestructible aphorisms are dead-on; they manage to sound minted yesterday. "I never travel without my diary," he avers. "One should always have something sensational to read in the train."
Mr. Hysell's worst idea is a prologue establishing gay matrimony as a legal right; his best is a Lady Bracknell, played in drag by Dan Matisa, as the most masculine character on the stage. And while the entire cast is eager to please, on Sunday night it was the audience, 100 strong, who deserved an ovation. How smart it would have been, in the play's cocktail scene, for the butler Merriman to have distributed cool drinks to the overheated crowd.
In many of the festival offerings, the best one can hope for is to find satisfaction in some aspect of a production. In "Rum and Vodka," a monologue by the Irish playwright Conor McPherson, whose "The Weir" is expected to come to Broadway later this season, John O'Callaghan plays a charming alcoholic monster who relates the story of the previous three days of his dissipated, worthless life, in which he loses his job, abandons his family, takes up with a woman and commits a senseless act of violence.
The tale Mr. McPherson spins may be a subtle one, but Mr. O'Callaghan, under Ed Sahely's direction, supplies no discernible variety to the story's shifting tone. Although he recounts it as history, there is no sense of aftermath in the performance, and what should be a shattering account is merely a blank sort of witnessing.
In the same vein, "The Interpreter of Horror" by Kelly Stuart, author of the smashing "Demonology," a dark comedy of office politics that had a brief but successful run at Playwrights Horizons two years ago, is something of a disappointment. Set in a diner in which a new waitress, June (Laura Kirk), is menaced by everyone from a hard-boiled veteran server (Alice Bergmann) to the rigid manager (Michael LaFetra) to a perverted patron (Peter Ackerman), "The Interpreter of Horror" is at this stage a satire divided against itself. The nightmare sequences of June's fantasies are not successfully integrated into the story. The play, at the Kraine Theater, is a bit of a muddle.
Still, an embryonic theater piece can reveal something valuable, as demonstrated by "Queen Esther: Unemployed Superstar," a monologue by a talented young actress who goes by the name Queen Esther. The work itself is not particularly noteworthy. It is several rewrites and one strong central idea away from being stageworthy. But Queen Esther is a charismatic presence, and her notion of growing up, a black girl in Texas, and dreaming of singing "I Gotta Be Me" on "The Mike Douglas Show" is a funny one.
Watching her show is like viewing a career in a chrysalis. You can sense that she's yet to spread her wings. But hey. That's Fringe.

Comp anies are increasingly seeking to identify their products with music, both old and new.

BYLINE: By Andrea Adelson 

 BODY:
TELEVISION advertisers today, more than ever, are seeking to make their commercials music to the ear -- building brand identity both with replays of classic rock tunes and with original scores they have commissioned.
Auto makers seem especially fond of trying to grab attention with "underscores," as they are called. Consider Toyota's "Everyday People" ad, borrowing its hook from the Sly and the Family Stone tune. Or General Motors' Chevrolet, scoring points about durability with the Bob Seeger standard "Like a Rock." 
 But car makers are not alone in sounding like a classic rock station. The Rolling Stones' hit "Start Me Up" provided the perfect word play for Microsoft's Windows 95 campaign.
Also, a handful of traditional retailers have discovered the brand-building potential of music. The Limited's Victoria's Secret, Spiegel's Eddie Bauer, the Gap's Banana Republic and Starbucks are extending their merchandising reach with name brand CD's, an unexpected outcome of selecting soundtracks to shape their stores' environment. The compilations of previously produced work has proved so popular with customers that Starbucks, for instance, has issued 20 CD's since 1995.
But some advertisers, sensing that the use of well-known rock hits is growing tired, are putting a renewed effort into hiring composers to create original scores that are as important to brand building as imagery. Campaigns by Chrysler, BMW and Conseco Insurance are recent examples.
And Intel and Sears, Roebuck have adopted recognizable aural icons to sign off each of their television commercials. "It makes them original and identifiable," said Anthony Marinelli, a Los Angeles composer, who has rearranged music for Sears into a variety of musical styles, including an urban rendition.
Also in demand are John Trivers and Liz Myers, a husband-wife composing team from Manhattan Beach, Calif., who got their start writing tunes for the Blue Oyster Cult. When unemployed, they turned to commercial composing for Apple Computer. More recently, they composed an Italian-style opera for the Ford Motor Company, which began using the spot in June but masked the aria with a voice-over.
"Advertisers recognize that the sound of music can trigger recognition of their product," Miss Myers said.
"It's more memorable than a tag line," Mr. Trivers added.
On a recent morning an agency creative director called the couple's ocean-view recording studio, describing what was wanted for a soap commercial. "Not sugary, not sappy; celebratory, spiritual, breezier, extremely fluid," he said.
Miss Myers, her eyes shifting between a television monitor and the keys of a baby grand piano, improvised 15 bars or so. Within an hour of the conference call, she picked three tracks from among seven to get a full orchestral treatment, but left the decisive cut to the soap maker's agency.
Mr. Trivers, choosing from a dozen or more bass guitars, added a filling riff. From a keyboard-synthesizer, his wife overlaid a breezy tinkling of bells and symphonic strings. A sound engineer minded the tracks.
Conseco got a similar Trivers-Myers treatment for its first television spots, a $25 million campaign that began in February by Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis. "It was very important for us to be distinctive; there's a lot of sameness in the advertising of competitors," said James W. Rosensteele, a spokesman for the insurance company, which is based in Carmel, Ind. "We were trying to break away in both sound and image. We wanted to engage people intellectually and not rely on pure emotional appeal."
Instead of the warm and fuzzy images typically associated with insurers, Conseco's vignettes show life's unexpected turns. The music also takes unexpected turns.
Paul L. Saylor, a partner at Bozell Worldwide, a unit of True North Communications, produced six spots for Chrysler, relying on one musical theme with slight variations. He said buying music rights was effective when a campaign idea lent itself to the tune, citing "Like a Rock" for Chevy trucks.
But "what's great about creating new stuff is that it remains fresh because it's not overplayed," he said, adding that longevity is crucial for an auto campaign that lasts a year.
Seeking to develop an edgy style for BMW's campaign last year, Fallon McElligott commissioned a pulsating techno-pop soundtrack, filmed black and white footage from the driver's point of view and used text titles instead of a voice-over.
"We wanted the music to cut through," said Bruce Bildsten, the agency's group creative director.
BMW's new spots, which are to start Sept. 14, extend the same visual and musical theme. The arrangement came from Johannes Hammers and Rico Conning, commercial composers in Santa Monica, Calif.
"We feel like we have a musical signature," Mr. Bildsten said. "Extending that signature is important to the brand's success."

Politics aside, census sampling still raises questions of accuracy.

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein 

 BODY:
A PANEL of three Federal judges delivered a blow to Democrats this week when it ruled that sampling techniques planned for the 2000 census violated Federal law. The issue is far from dead, though, as the Administration now plans to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Democrats embrace sampling -- data derived from a small set of households -- to supplement census information gathered door to door and through the mail. They believe it would add millions of blacks, Hispanic people and poor to the census rolls. That would lead to billions of dollars of additional Federal spending in Democrat-controlled districts and perhaps a dozen or more additional Democratic seats after Congressional districts are redrawn. The Republicans loathe sampling for the same reasons. 
 But the debate is about something more difficult, and less partisan, than politics. The handful of statisticians who have mastered the ferocious mathematical and practical complexities are split over the usefulness of sampling. William Kruskal, former chairman of the statistics department at the University of Chicago, speaks for many of his colleagues when he admits that "no one really knows."
A middle ground, using sampling techniques for parts of the census and not for others, makes perhaps the most sense.
The bureau proposes three separate uses of sampling. One sample would focus on a small group of households that fail to mail in their census forms or to respond to repeated visits by census takers, and then use statistical techniques to reach a description of all nonresponding households. Most experts appear to agree that this use of sampling is a sensible way to cut the soaring costs of conducting the census without sacrificing accuracy.
The second proposed use, to correct for the undercount of minorities and poor people, draws more criticism.
The 1990 census underestimated the population by less than 2 percent. But it underestimated the number of blacks by more than 4 percent and the number of Hispanic people by about 5 percent. Likewise, it missed more renters than homeowners and more poor families than rich.
The bureau proposes to fix this problem by conducting a follow-up survey of 750,000 households. The bureau would compare the two surveys to determine, for example, how many urban blacks appeared in the follow-up survey but not the first -- an indication of how many were missed in the initial census. The bureau would then use a complicated series of calculations to estimate what portions of several dozen demographic groups were initially missed.
Critics, like Prof. David Freedman of the University of California at Berkeley, say the sampling procedure is fraught with problems. What if someone moves, shows up on the rolls of the second survey but appears nowhere in the country in the initial census? Was he one of the millions of uncounted Americans? Perhaps not. He might have been accounted for by the proposed statistical correction for nonresponding households (the first use of sampling) even without his ever having filled out a form.
Here's an even trickier problem. Sampling could improve the census count for every state, yet damage the overall value of the census. That's because the important census figures, in terms of funding and Congressional representation, are not the absolute numbers for each state and county, but rather their respective shares of the national population. After all, there will be 435 House seats no matter how many people are counted. If sampling does a better job locating missing households in one state than in another, the distribution of House seats and Federal spending could be made less fair.
Imagine that the initial census misses 1,000 black households in Harlem and 100 black households in Phoenix because of evasive households and less-than-diligent census takers. The follow-up sample will be plagued by similar problems. What if it turns up, say, only 50 of the missing black households in Harlem but 75 of the missing households in Phoenix. Then each state's population count will improve, but Arizona's share of the total population will be overstated.
The bureau says its elaborate models can handle these problems. Besides, none of the critics have shown that sampling would do more harm than good, the bureau says.
Most statisticians agree that sampling can improve the counting of minorities and poor in areas as large as Congressional districts and states. But many are unwilling to conclude the small follow-up sample can yield accurate estimates for small areas, say the size of census blocks (about 30 households). One intriguing option would be to use sampling to correct estimates for states and Congressional districts, but not for smaller areas. After all, no important policy depends on accurate counts of small areas.
Politics may scuttle any such middle-ground resolution. The bureau fears how Congress would respond to census data that show state population totals higher than the sum of population figures for each census block in the state. Call this the Lotus 1-2-3 dilemma: the bureau's rows and columns would not add up -- and Republicans on Capitol Hill would no doubt scream that the bureau was counting fictitious people. And if the bureau goes the other route, applying corrections to small areas, it will be prey to a court challenge, most likely by Republicans, that could throw out all statistical attempts to account for missing minorities.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Up On Worries Over Equities

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities edged up yesterday, amid fresh concerns about Russia's economic crisis and the raised anxiety level of world equity markets.
"The market appeared a bit wobbly today, even as it partially ignored the release of July durable goods orders due to the problems in both Russia and Latin America," said Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist for Banc One Investment Advisers in Columbus, Ohio. Durable goods unexpectedly rose 2.4 percent last month, their biggest monthly gain in almost a year. 
 By late in the day, the Treasury's 30-year bond was up 4/32, to a price of 101 7/32, pushing down its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, to 5.42 percent, from 5.43 percent on Tuesday. Bond yields are at their lowest levels in three decades.
Mr. Chan said the greatest fear among bond investors was whether they could justify paying more for bonds -- and pushing yields below 5.50 percent -- without an indication that the Federal Reserve was close to easing short-term interest rates.
Yesterday the Fed was in the bond market to satisfy its seasonal needs. In the process, known as a coupon pass, the Fed bought $1.521 billion in securities, adding funds to the banking system and providing some support to the longer maturities.
The report on July durable goods orders, which was released early in the session, surprised investors because the aircraft and electrical order components were so strong that they more than offset the weakness in autos caused by the General Motors strike.
The market also had to deal with supply yesterday, as the Treasury sold $15 billion of new two-year notes at an auction, which went a little better than expected. The notes were sold at a yield of 5.125 percent.
Following are the results of that auction:

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Orders Grew 2.4% in July

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Orders placed with the nation's manufacturers for durable goods unexpectedly rose in July as demand for aircraft and electronics offset a decline in auto orders that was linked to the General Motors Corporation strikes. Excluding transportation goods, orders recorded the biggest gain in almost a year.
The Commerce Department said today that total durable goods orders rose 2.4 percent last month. The department also revised June's data to show an increase of two-tenths of 1 percent; in an earlier revision, the Government had said June's orders fell one-tenth of 1 percent. 
 Excluding transportation equipment, orders for which often fluctuate sharply from month to month, durable goods orders rose 3 percent during July.
"Despite the weakness in Asia and other parts of the world, orders have remained at a fairly healthy pace," Rick MacDonald, an economist at Standard & Poor's MMS in Belmont, Calif., said.
The Federal Reserve Board uses the durable goods report to gauge the nation's factory conditions and to monitor consumers' appetite for more expensive items.
July's increase in total orders was the third in the last four months and was the largest gain since a 4.4 percent rise in November. The increase in orders excluding the transportation category was the seventh in the last eight months and was the largest gain since a 3.2 percent rise in August 1997.
Orders for electronic equipment, including semiconductors, telephones and televisions, grew 12 percent last month. Orders for transportation equipment increased three-tenths of 1 percent as demand for aircraft offset declines in automobiles, trucks and ships.

Dow Falls 79.30 as Investors Fret About Trouble Abroad

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday as a plunge in Russian markets deepened fears that slumping economies around the world would cut corporate profits.
Shares of United Technologies, J. P. Morgan, Chevron and other companies with international businesses led the drop. Banks fell on concern that a Russian debt restructuring disclosed Tuesday would lead to losses on overseas bond holdings. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 79.30, or nine-tenths of a percent, to 8,523.35. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 8.66, or eight-tenths of a percent, to 1,084.19, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 30.04, or 1.7 percent, to 1,768.13.
The Russell 2000 index of small stocks dropped 9.34, or 2.4 percent, to 380.42.
Stocks pared losses after Stanley Druckenmiller, the chief investment officer of George Soros's $22 billion group of funds, told CNBC that the United States stock market was the most attractive in the world, and predicted that money would pour into domestic assets because of the turmoil in other countries' markets.
Investors were willing to pay record-high valuations for stocks for the last three years because interest rates around the world were falling, inflation was under control and most countries' economies were growing. Now, emerging markets are stumbling, raising concern about stability and undermining growth in developed nations.
Still, optimistic investors say lowinterest rates and a growing domestic economy will support earnings and share prices.
United Technologies, which gets more than 40 percent of its sales abroad, fell 3 3/16, to 82 7/8.
While United States banks have less exposure to Russia's economic problems than their European counterparts, some of the biggest, including Morgan and Citicorp, stand to lose money.
Morgan fell 2 15/16, to 117 15/16; Citicorp lost 2 1/4, to 133 7/8, and Bankers Trust dropped 4 3/4, to 92 1/8. Travelers Group, which is merging with Citicorp, fell 1/2, to 54 1/8.
Oil stocks slumped after three large oil-exporting countries canceled a meeting to discuss prices, reducing hopes for production cuts. Amoco fell 1, to 49, and Chevron dropped 1 11/16, to 76 1/2.

HEADLINE: Harold W. Ezell Is Dead at 61; Immigration Official in West

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Harold W. Ezell, who as a Federal immigration official supported amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants only to become a decade later the co-author of a state initiative denying them public benefits, died on Tuesday at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach, Calif. He was 61 and lived in Newport Beach.
The cause was liver cancer, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
 After working as an executive for Wienerschnitzel International, a hot dog franchise company, Mr. Ezell was commissioner for the Immigration and Naturalization Service's western region under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. He supported the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which granted legal residency to about three million illegal immigrants, more than half of them in California.
In promoting that amnesty offer, Mr. Ezell donned a sombrero and appeared as part of a group called Trio Amnestia, with his deputy and an Hispanic radio personality called El Tigre. At the same time, he crusaded to stop illegal immigrants from entering the United States, organizing night tours to the Mexican border to show illegal immigrants coming into the country and conducting raids on factories and restaurants.
In the early 1990's, after leaving the immigration agency, Mr. Ezell found a niche as a go-between for foreign millionaires seeking United States citizenship.
"I believe we've done a great job with boat people, and I think that a few yacht people are not going to hurt America," he told The New York Times in 1991.
As California's economy remained in the doldrums into the mid-1990's and public sentiment against illegal immigration grew, Mr. Ezell helped write Proposition 187, which would have denied public benefits, including health care and education, to illegal immigrants. Though the measure was approved by Californians in 1994, a Federal judge in Los Angeles ruled it unconstitutional and it has not been enforced, but many of its provisions were embodied in the Federal welfare reform act.
"He believed people should be welcome in this country, but they should come in in a legal manner, and that illegal activity of any kind should not be rewarded," said State Senator Dick Mountjoy, a Republican from suburban Los Angeles who supported Proposition 187.
But Mr. Ezell often raised the ire of immigrant and civil liberties advocates with comments that critics said made it impossible to have a dispassionate discussion of the issue.
Mr. Ezell is survived by his wife, Lee; two daughters, Pamela Ezell of Los Angeles, and Sandi Bushnell of New Jersey; his mother, Edna of Wilmington, Calif., and his brother, Donald, of Wilmington.

HEADLINE: Possible Strike By Pilots Seen As a Rarity

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
If the pilots at Northwest Airlines go on strike this weekend, it will be the first time a major airline has been shut down in the age of so-called fortress hubs -- the big metropolitan airports that are dominated by a single carrier.
In the last five years, the major domestic carriers have largely retreated from competition with one another, focusing instead on routing passengers through a handful of hub airports that they all but control. 
 Thus, Continental Airlines dominates Houston and Cleveland, while Delta Air Lines dominates Atlanta and Cincinnati, and United Airlines dominates Denver. But no major carrier has a tighter stranglehold on its hub airports than Northwest.
In Detroit, Minneapolis and Memphis, Northwest controls 75 to 82 percent of all airplane seats, according to a study by Lehman Brothers released earlier this year. That dominance makes Northwest's role so crucial to the regions it serves that the prospect of a strike to many state and local officials is practically unthinkable.
"Obviously, the more and more communities become dependent exclusively on a single provider," said Alfred E. Kahn, the Carter Administration official who presided over the airline industry's deregulation in 1978 and is now a professor emeritus at Cornell University, "the more the public interest cannot become indifferent to a strike."
This raises the question of whether the Government would permit a lengthy airline strike, or any strike at all.
Both Northwest executives and the Air Line Pilots Association say they hope no one has to find out. Indeed, the chances of a strike seemed to fade slightly yesterday as one person who was briefed on the negotiations said the two sides had made significant progress, with the key issue of pay remaining unresolved.
But Northwest announced yesterday that it was canceling 400 flights tomorrow and Saturday in preparation for a strike if a settlement is not reached by 12:01 A.M. Saturday, the deadline set by the pilots. Northwest also said that it might be forced to lay off some workers temporarily if a strike dragged on.
"Layoffs are the last option we consider in any strike situation," said Jon Austin, a Northwest spokesman.
Last year, President Clinton stepped in minutes after 9,300 pilots at American Airlines walked out, invoking his authority under the 1926 Railway Labor Act to force the pilots back to work for 60 days while a special Presidential emergency board tried to broker a settlement.
Under the act, the President has the power to create an emergency board if a labor dispute threatens "to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive any section of the country of essential transportation service."
This was the first time a President had halted an airline strike since 1966. Many people now believe that it will be difficult for Mr. Clinton not to intervene if Northwest stops flying because the economic repercussions, particularly for the upper Midwest, would be as bad or worse than those faced when American, a unit of the AMR Corporation, went on strike.
So far, the White House is being coy about its plans in an attempt to force both sides to settle. Administration officials have even told Northwest executives, who they believed were a little too confident that the President would ride to their rescue, not to count on intervention.
"It would be a mistake for anybody to negotiate assuming that the President will appoint a board," a White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
But if the pilots do strike, Mr. Clinton may be forced to act. Though Northwest, which is the country's fourth-largest airline, is much smaller than American Airlines, the No. 2 airline, it has a tighter grip on its hubs. American's bases in Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth are among the handful of major airports where there is still competition among major carriers, said Philip Baggaley, the chief airline bond analyst at Standard & Poor's.
The Clinton Administration estimated last year that the American strike would strand about 43,000 passengers a day at a cost of $200 million to the economy, a figure that was subsequently challenged by several economists. Northwest said that 67,200 passengers a day would be affected if its pilots walked out and that a strike would cost $737 million in its first 10 days.
The pilots' union dismisses those estimates, saying that other airlines will move in to pick up Northwest's passengers. But Northwest's virtual monopoly means that there are few alternatives.
Trans World Airlines said yesterday that it would fly larger planes between Minneapolis and its hub in St. Louis beginning this weekend to pick up the slack. But the extra capacity amounts to just 85 seats a day, a fraction of what would be lost if Northwest stopped flying.
Pro Air, a year-old carrier based at Detroit City Airport, said its two 146-seat 737 jets were already flying more than 12 hours a day, making it hard for it to add flights. And United Airlines, a unit of the UAL Corporation, said it was unlikely to add more flights between Minneapolis and Detroit and its hub in Chicago.
Charles Braswell, the corporate travel manager for the Chrysler Corporation, which has its headquarters outside Detroit, believes that Northwest's dominance increases the likelihood of a strike.
"If there were competition in the market, it would preclude either side from being out for any length of time," he said. "They may lose customers when they go out, but they know they will end up winning them back again once they come back because there are so few choices."

Russia Delivers a Blow to Global Capitalism

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Russia's huge default on its debts, and the harsh terms it is offering to those foreigners who made the mistake of lending money to it, have petrified investors and are making capital much harder to get for other countries around the world. For that reason, the default is also increasing the risk of global recession.
Economically, Russia has never been as important as it was politically. Investors had assumed that the West would do whatever was necessary to prop up the Russians, if only to keep nuclear weapons from falling into the wrong hands. In fact, there seemed to be an assumption that private loans to nearly any government carried an implicit Western guarantee, although none had been promised. 
 "I would not give one nickel to help any creditor or investor," said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. Nevertheless, in previous bailouts engineered by Mr. Rubin, whether in Mexico in 1995 or Korea last year, investors in government bonds did well because that seemed necessary to avoid economic collapse.
It was not news that Russia had big economic problems, or that the Government had been unable to solve them. But until last week investors still thought default was all but impossible. In June Russia was unable to borrow all the rubles it needed, even at extraordinarily high interest rates. But it was able to borrow $1.25 billion in dollars from foreign investors, who were promised about 12 percent a year for five years.
An investor who bought one of those bonds in June, and tried to sell it now, would lose nearly two-thirds of the money invested. And naive investors are not the only ones who have suffered. Funds managed by the international financier George Soros lost a lot of money, as did Credit Suisse First Boston, the big investment bank.
What went wrong? The International Monetary Fund package assembled this summer proved to be far too small, given the chaos in the Russian Government. The I.M.F. lacked the money to put together the much larger package of aid that would have been necessary to avert default, and major Western governments, including the United States, refused to put up their own money. In an interview with a German newspaper, Stanley Fischer, the deputy director of the I.M.F., blamed Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany for the West's failure to act.
Now, with the safety net withdrawn, the ruble appears to be in free fall. Those who lent money to Russia are being forced to trade in their old securities -- which promised extraordinarily high returns for lending money for only a few months -- for securities yielding lower interest rates over a longer time. The risk is that, even assuming Russia is able to honor its latest promises, the rubles it pays back will be worth far less than the ones it borrowed.
It is not clear now who is really in charge in Moscow. President Yeltsin's choice of Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister needs parliamentary ratification, which may not be forthcoming unless he can reach agreement with the Communist leadership of the Duma. And even if that happens, there is no guarantee the Government will be able to collect taxes and actually administer the country. The outlook for the Russian people is grim.
So too may be the outlook for countries far away from Russia, with economies and governments in far better shape. Investors, having awakened to the reality of risk, now are pulling money out of emerging markets from Hong Kong to Brazil. At best, many governments will have to pay higher interest rates to borrow, putting a damper on growth. At worst, they will find new capital unavailable at reasonable costs, and will have to strain to repay loans as they come due. Russia's direct importance to the world economy may turn out to be far smaller than its impact on investor psychology.
Perhaps the damage can be limited, and investors will decide that Russia's problems should not affect their views of, say, Argentina. But if not, economic incompetence in post-Soviet Russia could prove to be a bigger threat to world capitalism than Stalin ever was.

HEADLINE: The Royal Treatment;
Ruling FamilyFeuds as Oil Income Drops in Brunei

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei

 BODY:
Beneath a canopy of crystal chandeliers in a dazzling throne room here earlier this month, a gentle-looking young prince in a golden tunic was handed a jewel-encrusted dagger and proclaimed heir to the Islamic Sultanate of Brunei.
Royal succession is a serious business in this secluded, oil-rich country on the northern coast of Borneo, where Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah has ruled with absolute authority since Brunei gained independence from Britain in 1984. And never more so than now, when the Sultan is battling both a bitter family feud and a free fall in oil prices, which has thrown the fief into a financial bind. 
 The crowning of the Sultan's eldest son, the 24-year-old Prince al-Muhtadee Billah, was a suitably solemn affair -- steeped in six centuries of Malay tradition that gave it an almost otherworldly aura.
"We have been praying for this day," a young woman said after the ceremony on Aug. 10 as the Prince was drawn through the capital in a gold-and-white chariot. Like most of Brunei's 305,000 people, she regards the royal family with a reverence verging on awe. Thanks to the richest oil reserves in Southeast Asia, the Sultan has transformed his country into an enclave of docile affluence.
But the investiture of Prince Billah comes at a time of rising turmoil in this normally peaceful country, although it is still relatively unscathed by the Asian economic crisis swirling around it. The Sultan recently stripped his younger brother, Prince Jefri Bolkiah, of his posts as head of Brunei's state investment agency and its largest conglomerate, reflecting allegations that the Prince squandered billions on bad investments and a profligate life style.
Even the Sultan has come under scrutiny for living like Croesus while a decline in oil prices drains Brunei's economy. Building a 1,788-room palace with air-conditioned stables and hiring Michael Jackson to perform at his 50th birthday party was fine as long as oil sales were pumping nearly $2 billion a year into Brunei's coffers. But with oil prices down one-third since January, Brunei has already lost about $400 million, or 20 percent of its revenue last year.
Brunei Shell Petroleum, a unit of the Royal/Dutch Shell Group and the dominant oil producer, is sending home expatriate workers, while local merchants are feeling the pinch as shoppers flock to neighboring Malaysia to buy cheaper goods. Analysts say Brunei is experiencing something new in its well-lubricated history: a cash-flow squeeze.
That squeeze may force the country to cut back on entitlement programs that earned it the nickname "Shellfare state." At $25,200, Brunei's citizens already have the highest per capita income in Southeast Asia. But the Government still doles out free health care and education -- not to mention subsidized rent and interest-free loans for civil servants to buy houses.
"We've been fortunate in our history because we've never had to prioritize," said Selamat Munap, the Deputy Finance Minister. "We've been able to take care of our children, our sick, our elderly. Perhaps we will have to be more rigorous in our standards for Government spending."
Mr. Selamat delicately avoids mentioning the royal family, which has taken care of itself best of all. But diplomats here say the Sultan now recognizes that his relatives must curb their lavish ways. The Sultan, they say, is particularly angry with Prince Jefri, who set off on an epic spending spree in the early 1990's, buying luxury hotels from Paris and London to New York and Los Angeles.
"There was a dawning appreciation that they were getting ahead of their earnings," said one Western diplomat, who, like almost everybody here, insisted on anonymity out of fear of offending the Sultan.
The extent of the rift in the royal family became clear when Prince Jefri stayed away from Prince Billah's investiture, the most important ceremony since the Sultan's coronation in 1967. Prince Jefri, who is in self-imposed exile in the United States, issued a statement that he could not return to Brunei because "there is little I can do to oppose the destructive action of reactionary forces, which are becoming increasingly entrenched at all levels of government."
A spokesman for Prince Jefri said Islamic fundamentalists from Libya and Iran were playing an influential role in Brunei's Government -- a contention that the Government dismisses as preposterous.
Still, with the Government starting a global investigation of the Prince, and the Prince hurling brickbats in response, Brunei is being dragged out of its velvet-lined obscurity. Before independence, it had been a British protectorate, with origins that date back to the 13th century, when a prince from western Borneo became the first sultan of this lush, heavily wooded land.
To some extent, Brunei's troubles are rooted in its most fortunate event: the 1929 discovery of oil off the coast. By 1996, Brunei was pumping 160,000 barrels a day, mostly for export to Japan. Oil and natural gas now generate 90 percent of the Government's income.
Even to people who could not find his country on a map, the Sultan of Brunei became famous as the richest man in the world. It is a title he only recently ceded to William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft; like other oil barons, the Sultan's net worth declines as fast as the price of crude.
With an estimated fortune that reached $35 billion in the early 1990's, the royal family has enjoyed life on a grand scale. Prince Jefri, 44, savored it with particular gusto, buying playthings like a sleek yacht, an Airbus jet, a Sikorsky helicopter and five-star hotels including the Plaza Athenee in Paris, the New York Palace and the Bel Air in Los Angeles.
Prince Jefri's ambitions extended beyond shopping. As Finance Minister from 1984 to 1996, he built, among other projects, a giant amusement park, free to visitors. Prince Jefri pursued his ventures through a web of private companies and Government agencies. The Amedeo Development Corporation, a private company owned by the Prince, built the amusement park and other projects in Brunei. Amedeo Crown, a Prince Jefri-owned company listed on the British island of Jersey, acquired Asprey, the London jeweler, while Prince Jefri family trusts own the American hotels.
The Brunei Investment Agency, a Government operation that the Prince led as chairman, manages investments and owns more hotels, including the Dorchester in London and the Beverly Hills Hotel in California.
Reconstructing what happened at these companies is difficult because their operations are cloaked in secrecy. The reputed advisers will not even confirm whether they work for Prince Jefri, the royal family or the Government.
Executives with ties to Prince Jefri said that Amedeo and the Brunei Investment Agency were both audited by the accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick. Citibank is said to be their main adviser. Given the blurry line between the interests of the royal family and those of the state, these executives said it would be hard for any outsider to impose strict financial controls.
Last month, reports began to arise of huge, undisclosed losses at both Amedeo and the Brunei Investment Agency. Financial analysts said the investment agency's assets might have been pledged to buy hotels. The losses came as an acute embarrassment to the Sultan, who had offered loans to help his ailing neighbors, Thailand and Indonesia, only to discover that Brunei could not afford them.
So the Sultan abruptly stripped Prince Jefri of his jobs at both organizations and ordered the Government to seize Amedeo's assets in Brunei. The Sultan hired auditors from Arthur Andersen in London to calculate the losses, which some analysts say could reach billions of dollars.
Mr. Selamat, the Deputy Finance Minister, declined to comment on Amedeo's collapse but acknowledged that "any major corporate failure is going to have some impact on the economy of Brunei."
Prince Jefri's financial troubles came after another embarrassing episode, in which Shannon Marketic, a former Miss U.S.A., accused him and the Sultan of trying to turn her into a sex slave. The lawsuit is pending, though the Sultan has sovereign immunity and Prince Jefri has immunity as a potential heir to the throne.
Prince Jefri would seem to have a bleak future in Brunei. But he contends that because his overseas properties are owned by separate companies and trusts, he still owns those assets and intends to keep them.
"I do not seek a fight and prefer to be left alone," he said in a statement. "I shall, however, vigorously defend my position and interests of my family."
An adviser to Prince Jefri, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the Government was exaggerating the losses at Amedeo to discredit the Prince and destroy his power base within the country. The Government also recently seized three oil concessions that gave Prince Jefri a steady stream of income.
Now the Prince and his advisers are plotting a strategy to hold on to the remaining properties. Brunei's investigation has set off alarm bells in Europe and the United States, and Prince Jefri's lieutenants have had to reassure employees and suppliers that the hotels and other properties are not about to be seized.
Prince Jefri may be finally tightening his belt, too. At Asprey Group, the venerable but money-losing luxury-goods company he bought for $388 million in 1995, the Prince is merging the flagship Asprey with its sister company, Garrard, and selling off unprofitable businesses.
"The idea that because we have a principal who is a prince, we can spend whatever our hearts desire, is not true," said Ian Dahl, the chief executive of Asprey in London. "We run a very tightfisted company."
Prince Jefri's adviser said he was being hounded by Islamic militants, including another of the Sultan's brothers, Prince Mohamed. "This is a classic power struggle between those who favor a more conservative, religious approach and those who favor a more open, tolerant approach," the adviser said.
Brunei has become more straitlaced in recent years. Alcohol is no longer served in bars or restaurants. But other facts of life here may have less to do with religion than money. Several observers said the Sultan's largess had created a politically satisfied, even sedated, populace. Even people who live in houses on stilts in Brunei's 500-year-old water village own satellite dishes.
"The people feel they've gotten a good deal from the Sultan," said Rex DeSilva, the editor of The Borneo Bulletin, which calls itself an independent newspaper even though it is controlled by Prince Mohamed. "If a ruler can't be popular with all that, who can?"
Indeed, the Sultan's biggest challenge may be economic rather than political. For years, he has promised to wean Brunei from its reliance on oil by diversifying its economy. Yet the Government's efforts to become a trade and tourism center have come to naught. Given that Brunei has about 23 years of oil reserves left, that problem may fall to the Sultan's son.
For now, Prince Billah may help overcome some of Brunei's current ills. Unlike his playboy uncle, Prince Jefri, or even his father at a younger age, Prince Billah projects a less frivolous image. Educated at Oxford, Prince Billah is said to be a sober young man. His idea of indulgence, according to royal propaganda, is a game of snooker and the tame saxophone music of Kenny G.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
1998: AYear Emerging Markets Seem Synonymous With Anguish

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The collapse in the world's emerging stock markets -- the Thailands, Polands and Russias -- has been breathtaking. Not since these markets began to attract strong investor interest at the end of the 1980's have they had such a sharp decline, one that wiped out so many years of gains.
Their plunge over the last year, worldwide, now outranks that during the Mexican peso crisis of 1994-95 and that during the Persian Gulf war of 1990-91. 
 Without a quick rally, August will be the worst month for stock markets in developing economies since 1988, when their performance began to be tracked in index form. So far this month, these markets have lost 20 percent of their value. Since Asian financial crises began in July 1997, they have erased all their gains back to December 1991, according to the Morgan Stanley Capital International emerging markets index.
A second index, that of the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group, has thee markets declining to where they were in February 1992.
"Anyone who has tried to pick the bottom has been destroyed," said Ron Chapman, head of international equities at the Dreyfus Corporation, who has had his own fingers burned.
Near-panic selling in disregard of a country's economic fundamentals is causing many investors and stock analysts to reconsider whether these markets are sensible for even the hardy long-term investor, the kind who has accepted volatility in exchange for large potential gains.
And the risks seem to be growing, with Russia's deepening economic crisis pulling the far healthier Latin American stock markets down with it.
The latest phase of the Russian crisis is also exposing another, possibly more damaging, fault line: a collapse in the prices of emerging- market bonds. It is in the global capital markets that emerging-market countries in Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin American borrow to meet government financial needs.
If that borrowing becomes very expensive, investors will worry about the ability of Latin American countries to pay off their debts and to cover their trade deficits, which are already at worrisome levels. That, in turn, will put more pressure on the currencies, forcing countries to raise their interest rates to defend their exchange value. Such developments could rapidly undermine a country's otherwise stable economic fundamentals.
Emerging nations are already paying a lot to get investors to buy their securities. The difference, or spread, between the yield on emerging-market debt and United States Treasury securities has jumped by nearly six percentage points, to 13 percentage points, according to the J. P. Morgan emerging-market bond index. Only after the Mexican peso crisis erupted in December 1994 has the spread widened that fast. At the peak of that crisis in 1995, emerging markets were paying on average 19 percentage points more than the United States did on its Treasury securities.
Mexico, of course, did not default on its debt, with considerable aid from the United States and other industrial nations.
But the refusal of the International Monetary Fund, the United States and its economic partners to rescue Russia before it essentially devalued the ruble two weeks ago and defaulted on some debt has caused a serious reassessment of the risks in all emerging markets.
"Does the system now have a lender of last resort?" asked Desmond Lachman, head of emerging markets economic research at Salomon Smith Barney and a former official of the International Monetary Fund. "Bulgaria didn't fail, Thailand didn't fail, Indonesia didn't fail. But now Russia fails." For troubled economies, he said, "the I.M.F. and the Group of Seven are no longer there as a backstop."
As this view takes hold, emerging-market bonds may come under even more intense pressure.
For now, investors still interested in these markets must wait until the frantic selling ceases. And this will not happen until hedge funds and other money managers who have big losses in places like Russia stop selling to raise cash. Having borrowed to make many of their bets even bigger, they need cash to pay off their loans. In some cases, that means selling stocks in Latin America, where markets have more liquidity, as well as in other regions.
The disclosure yesterday that George Soros, the legendary hedge fund operator, lost $2 billion in Russia in the last year shows how great the damage may be.
"Emerging markets have become more a game for speculators and traders -- and a nightmare for dedicated long-term investors," said Robert J. Pelosky Jr., global emerging markets strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "In the short run, fundamentals don't seem to matter."
But even after the dust clears, many investors are likely to balk at plunging back into emerging markets despite analysts' estimates of great opportunities at such prices.
"There has to be some new management system for these crises," said Gary Kleiman, senior partner at Kleiman International Consultants, a research and advisory firm in Washington. Without a new international system for containing currency crises and the fallout that often follows, Mr. Kleiman said, it will be hard to persuade his institutional clients to bet on emerging markets.
"There is little upside and too much downside risk for those who can't afford to leave their money there for 5 years to 10 years," he said. "It is probably better just to leave."
Mr. Pelosky of Morgan Stanley said he thought that emerging-market investors would shift from selecting specific countries to picking specific companies. "The game is going to be very different," he continued, "in the next two to three years." In the past, investors have jumped in on economic potential, betting, for example, that the rapid growth and low inflation in Asia in the early 90's would guarantee great returns.
But in the future, he said, investing would be based more on "what this company does and how does it compare to its competition."
This nitty-gritty approach fits with the long-term hope for emerging markets: that economic fundamentals will again determine the winners and losers.

HEADLINE: SHAKE-UP IN RUSSIA: THE MONEY;
Acting Premier Tries to Hang on to Credits

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 26

 BODY:
As Russia confronts its worst financial crisis since the collapse of the Soviet Union, with the ruble poised for a free fall, the Acting Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, made a sudden trip to Ukraine to persuade the head of the International Monetary Fund not to cut off its next installment of credits.
Alarmed by the ruble's 9 percent drop yesterday, anxious Russians rushed to their banks this morning only to be given mixed signals on when, and how, they can retrieve their savings. An early round of dollar trading on the Moscow currency exchange was voided today for the first time in the history of the exchange, while the value of the ruble dropped 40 percent against the German mark in a single transaction. 
 The Central Bank of Russia, under bitter attack at home and abroad for its handling of the crisis, said today that it could no longer afford to protect the ruble, reporting that it had already spent $8.8 billion doing so in the last two months. Later in the day, the bank said it would not slap limits on currency transactions. Such a move, it said, would be a step back to "another economic model."
As the banking crisis threatens to engulf Russia's entire financial system, the Central Bank took its first tough action today by withdrawing the license of Bank AB Imperial, Russia's 13th-largest bank, which had reportedly defaulted on payments on foreign loans earlier this month.
Yesterday three major Russian banks announced plans to merge, while six Moscow banks today said they would pool their resources to end the deadlock of nonpayments that has crippled Russian banking transactions.
Mr. Chernomyrdin's quick trip to the Crimean resort of Simferapol, where Michel Camdessus, managing director of the I.M.F., was to meet this afternoon with the President of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma, was seen as a sign of Russia's growing concern that the monetary fund will refuse to issue its next installment of $4.8 billion in credits, due to be reviewed by the fund's board in September.
Delivery of the funds is now Russia's only hope for a new injection of foreign aid, as Western leaders warned today that it would be up to the Russian Government to pull the country out of its looming financial nightmare. "There are no shortcuts in restoring market confidence, and the next steps are up to the Russia," Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, told reporters in Edgartown, Mass., where President Clinton was on vacation.
That nightmare was already on the horizon for thousands of Russian companies, caught between the ruble's downward spiral and a gridlock in the Russing banking system. Several companies today reported that their banks had not forwarded payments made by customers. "They take money out of your account, and it may or may not leave your bank, you don't know," said a director at a Russian food processing plant. Another Russian businessman who also asked not to be identified said: "As a client of the bank, I don't care what they are waiting for. After one week of this, they are killing me."
President Boris N. Yeltsin has made no further comment on the crisis since a televised appearance Monday, when he gave a brief explanation of his reappointment of Mr. Chernomyrdin, the man he had dismissed as Prime Minister five months ago.
"Financial and economic policy is a question to which I am giving my attention minute by minute," Mr. Chernomyrdin told the Itar-Tass news agency. "I am extremely dissatisfied with the work of the Central Bank over the last two days."
As Mr. Chernomyrdin flew to Ukraine today, leaders in Russia's Parliament continued their public bargaining over the future of his Government and its policies. At a news conference today, the Parliament Speaker, Gennadi Seleznyov, a Communist, said Parliament was still working on its own anti-crisis plan, which he said Mr. Chernomyrdin must endorse before his appointment can be confirmed at a session now scheduled for Sept. 2.
"We might be ready by next Monday afternoon," said Mr. Seleznyov, referring to the anti-crisis document, "but we would not want to rush things since we are speaking about a very serious document." In a television interview tonight, Mr. Seleznyov again appealed for Mr. Yeltsin's resignation, a possibility that a Kremlin spokesman today dismissed as "stupid."
Mr. Chernomyrdin yesterday told parliamentary leaders he was open to a coalition government that would include members of the Communist opposition, but Mr. Seleznyov has insisted that negotiations over ministerial appointments come after adoption of a joint strategy to handle the current crisis.
Asked today at a news conference if the Communist Party, which holds the largest bloc in the Parliament, will join the new government, Mr. Seleznyov said that the question had not yet been resolved.
While the political haggling over the new government continues, financial analysts said Russia's financial situation was worsening by the hour, with no clear policy from the Central Bank or the Government in sight.
"Some banks are really bankrupt," said Nikolai Gusev, a trader at Regent European Securities, an investment company, "and the population is going to start withdrawing their money."
Only 20 percent of Russian savings accounts are held in commercial banks -- with the rest in the giant government-controlled Sberbank -- but much of these are held in several of the largest banks now reported to be in trouble.
"There is no clear scheme for an operation transferring deposits to Sberbank," Mr. Gusev said. "There have been only words, and no concrete words."
Some Russian banks were putting their walk-in customers today on waiting lists, others were returning money in dribs and drabs. "You can call and check your place on the list, and they don't allow people to cut the line as far as I can see," said Pavel Mirovc, a 29-year-old sales consultant who was waiting in line at a downtown branch office of Most Bank. "But of course I am worried. They are giving out very little money."
"We've been coming every day," said a middle-aged woman, as she and her husband were leaving the same bank early this evening. "They give us our money little by little. But at least they are giving something. But we've become part-time guards of the bank."
Most analysts attributed the heaving trading on Moscow currency exchange yesterday to the Central Bank's continued supply of credits to Russia's troubled banks, and by its decision last week to lower the banks' minimum capital requirements, which freed up ruble reserves that the bankers then exchanged for dollars.
An anti-crisis program, announced on Aug. 17 by Mr. Chernomyrdin's predecessor, Sergei Kiriyenko, included a 90-day moratorium on payments of debts owed by Russia's commercial banks to foreign lenders. Some Russian banks this week have said they will ignore the moratorium and pay their debts, but with the fall in the ruble, many foreign creditors have been left wondering where the other banks will find the money to meet their debt payments when the moratorium ends in mid-November.
The Government's plan to swap $40 million held in Russian short-term Treasury bills for new longer term securities has also left foreign investors with a bitter taste. But its main effect is on Russian holders of the Treasury bills -- major banks, but also pension and other investment funds -- which are now stuck with assets that are worth less than their original value, and are less accessible.
Mr. Chernomyrdin today tried to distance himself from the debt restructuring plan, which was originally announced by the Kiriyenko Government. "I would like people to understand us correctly: this decision was predetermined," he said. "In actual fact, our task was only to formulate it, and we could not do otherwise."
According to most analysts, the Central Bank has to take decisive action to restore credibility to the financial system. "What they have to do is limit rubles reserves, and start to close down banks," said Holger Mueller, banking analyst at Fleming UCB, an investment firm. "They have to do it right now, and do it as fast possible, because there is still value in these banks, and they have to make sure there is no asset stripping."

HEADLINE: Russian Derivatives May Burn Investors

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Trading in the rapidly devaluing ruble came to a screeching halt yesterday, renewing concerns about Russia's ability to manage $40 billion in ruble-denominated debt, roughly 25 percent of which is held by foreign investors.
But Western investors and banks could face greater losses from the complex financial instruments known as derivatives. Indeed, the amount of Russian derivatives at risk for foreign investors may be sharply higher than that of bonds and loans. While the lack of public disclosure make estimates difficult, some currency traders and emerging-market specialists have set the value of derivatives at risk in Russia as high as $100 billion. Many analysts, however, think the figure is probably much lower than that. 
 Derivatives, among the most innovative and volatile products born of a new era in computer-generated financial alchemy, have been a boon to companies trying to limit risks and have also proved seductive to speculators trying to make a fast buck.
The value of derivatives is pegged to that of underlying assets, like stocks, bonds and currencies. They are typically used by savvy financial players to lessen the pain of unforeseen economic shifts, such as the swift ruble devaluation that has stung so many investors in Russia.
Most buyers of ruble-denominated bonds entered into a variety of derivatives contracts requiring rubles to be exchanged for dollars or German marks at set rates in the future to cushion tumbles in the ruble's value, in much the same way as homeowners purchase insurance to protect themselves in case their houses burn down. And the ruble's drastic drop has already burned a broad range of investors in Russia.
Credit Suisse First Boston said yesterday that its profits for the first six months of the year would be reduced to $500 million, from $254 million, largely because of heavy losses in Russia. Funds managed by George Soros, the globe-trotting investor and currency speculator, lost about $2 billion in Russia in the last year, according to an announcement his group of funds made yesterday.
Many Western investors described the debt restructuring announced by the Russian Government on Tuesday as punitive, but some were also willing to acknowledge that the losses they suffered had as much to do with the risky nature of the markets they were playing.
"Frankly, all of us made a bet on the ability of the Government to get its fiscal house in order," said Andrew Ipkendanz, head of global emerging markets for Credit Suisse First Boston in Moscow. "They didn't; we lost money, and so you move on."
It is still unclear what kind of damage American banks may suffer in Russia. Large American banks have relatively little exposure in Russia given their size -- about $7.68 billion, according to Brown Brothers Harriman & Company. Derivatives make up part of that amount, but other undisclosed positions could add to the banks' derivatives worries.
Fears about mounting losses in emerging markets in Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America sent the stocks of most major American banks -- principal players in the derivatives market -- sharply lower yesterday.
Bankers Trust's shares plunged 4.9 percent, to $92.125; J. P. Morgan's shares sank 2.43 percent, to $117.9375; BankAmerica's shares fell 1.9 percent, to $77.625, and Citicorp's stock dropped 1.65 percent, to $133.875. Chase Manhattan, however, edged up two-tenths of 1 percent, to $64.25.
Still, trying to determine the total value of currency derivatives in Russia, and who may wind up on the winning and losing sides of the deals, is a guessing game. Although the global derivatives market is huge and lucrative, the contracts are privately negotiated and the value of the deals are not disclosed on public exchanges like the stock market. Relatively little disclosure about derivatives is required of American banks, although accounting rules were recently changed to remedy that situation.
"It's incredibly difficult to quantify because the disclosure just isn't there," said Elisabeth Jackson-Moore, manager of Moody's Investors Service's office in Nicosia, Cyprus, who analyzes Russian banks. "We're certainly concerned that there could be a chain reaction because Western investors may have hedged their position with Russian banks, and Russian banks may have hedged their positions with other banks, and so forth."
Capital Markets Risk Advisers, a New York consulting firm specializing in derivatives, estimates the Russian foreign exchange contracts and currency derivatives of one form or another currently total about $65 billion. Mr. Ipkendanz of Credit Suisse First Boston said that Russian central bankers told creditors this week that $10 billion in currency contracts with Russian banks were maturing by the end of the year, a figure that does not include contracts with offshore hedge funds.
How well these contracts are honored, Mr. Ipkendanz added, will be the "next chapter" of Russia's financial saga. When two parties agree to take opposite sides in a derivatives deal, the prospects that the loser will pay the winner is only as good as the paper on which their contract is written and the integrity of the participants. J. P. Morgan was forced to designate $587 million in currency swaps in Asia as nonperforming earlier this year, largely because of disputes with Asian counterparties about the deals.
Russian banks are currently operating under the protection of a 90-day debt moratorium. It is unclear what their financial health will be when the moratorium ends.
"Technically, it's only a 90-day moratorium," said Charles Peabody, an analyst with Mitchell Securities Inc. in New York. "But if the banks are bankrupt at the end of the period they won't make good on any of the currency swaps."
If that proves to be the case, Western investors can expect to swallow further losses in Russia.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Japanese Stocks Are Sharply Lower

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, Aug. 27

 BODY:
The benchmark Japanese stock index plunged early today after markets dropped across Europe and the United States.
The broad international losses on Wednesday followed a statement by the Russian central bank that it could no longer afford to prop up the ruble, sending Moscow financial markets into a tailspin and rekindling fears about economic instability. 
 Here this morning, big banks like the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and exporters like Honda paced the fall in Japanese share prices.
Ken Okamura, strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, said, "The Russian ruble jitters have hurt markets everywhere and the effects of that have hit Japan." In addition, he said, "the financial crisis is reaching a crescendo -- it may not be the last crescendo, but it's pretty loud."
At the midday trading recess, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was down 405.99 points, or 2.73 percent, at 14,460.04. It fell as low as 14,446.20. On Wednesday, the average dropped 206.90 points, or 1.37 percent.
On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 143.82 yen, down 0.85 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was up 3.43 points -- less than one-tenth a percent -- at 7,837.83 in the first half-hour of trading.

Crisis in Russia Worsens As Defense of Ruble Wanes
The Central Bank of Russia said it could no longer afford to protect the ruble after spending $8.8 billion doing so in the last two months. With the ruble poised for a free fall, the Acting Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, went to Ukraine to try to persuade the head of the International Monetary Fund not to cut off its next installment of $4.8 billion in credits.
A trader at the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, left, had little to do after trading in the ruble was suspended. Page A10. 

The market turmoil in Russia, the plunge of the ruble, the increase in prices and the banking crisis led that country's financial barons to reassert themselves and install an Acting Prime Minister who will accede to their concerns. A1.
 
The crisis in Russia has caused turmoil in Latin America. It has pummeled the region's markets, caused currencies to drop and forced interest rates so high that some bankers are urging customers not to borrow. Analysts are lowering what have been healthy growth estimates for Latin America for next year and perhaps beyond. D4.
 
Stocks Decline on Profit Concerns
Stocks fell as the Russian crisis deepened fears that slumping economies around the world would cut corporate profits. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 79.30 points, to 8,523.35. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 8.66, to 1,084.19, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 30.04, to 1,768.13. In Tokyo early today the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues was down 405.99 points, or 2.73 percent, to 14,460.04. D5.
 
Judge Halts the Sale of Credit Data
A Federal administrative law judge ordered one of the nation's largest credit bureaus, Trans Union Corporation, to stop selling detailed credit information from consumers to advertisers and marketers without the consumers' permission. Trans Union said it would appeal. The company maintains financial records on as many as 200 million Americans. A14.
 
Merck in Accord With F.T.C.
Merck & Company and its Merck-Medco Managed Care unit have agreed with the Federal Trade Commission to bar Medco from discriminating against drugs made by Merck's competitors or exploiting private marketing information about other drug makers that Medco receives. D3.
 
Starwood Set to Change Structure
Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide is expected to announce today that it will convert to a standard corporate structure. Starwood recently lost a battle with Congress and the White House to extend the tax advantages of its corporate structure as a "paired share" real estate investment trust. D23.
 
Durable Goods Orders Rose in July
Orders placed with the nation's manufacturers for durable goods unexpectedly rose 2.4 percent in July as demand for aircraft and electronics offset a fall in auto orders linked to the General Motors strikes. Excluding transportation goods, durable goods orders rose 3 percent in July. D2.
 
Harnischfeger to Cut 3,100 Jobs
Harnischfeger Industries said it would cut about 3,100 jobs, or 20 percent of its work force, because a glut of paper was reducing demand for its products. The company also reported a quarterly loss that was wider than analysts had expected. D23.
 
Con Ed Selling Generating Plants
Consolidated Edison plans to sell virtually all of its electric generation stations in New York City. Its investment adviser, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, has sent information to more than 100 potential buyers. Winners are expected to be announced next year. B1.
