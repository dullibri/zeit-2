HEADLINE: CONCLUDING THE U.P.S. STRIKE: THE CUSTOMERS;
Strained Loyalties Are Likely To Endure

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
For many small businesses, going back to United Parcel Service is a bit like jump-starting a romance. There is a mutual need that never went away, even during the separation, but things may never be quite the same again.
"This was a great relationship, but definitely there are some open wounds that need to be healed," Norman Toline, head of a business in the Manhattan garment district, said today. "They've helped open our eyes to other shipping methods." 
 Intentionally or not, Mr. Toline chose words befitting a man who makes his living by romance, which he does as the president of Betty Wales Bridal Veils. But when he spoke of "a new dawning" with the end of the strike, he was talking like a cold-eyed businessman. Having said he lost $25,000 in the strike, he said he would never again rely exclusively on U.P.S..
Neither will many other small businesses across the country, said executives who had turned to other shipping companies and the United States Postal Service in the past two weeks. Direct-mail and catalogue merchants, especially, have learned the danger of overdependence, said Connie Heatley, senior vice president of the Direct Marketing Association, a trade group based in New York.
But some big companies said they would continue to depend heavily, if not exclusively, on U.P.S. Some are so big that only U.P.S., the world's largest package-delivery company, can fill their needs economically and efficiently.
Lands' End Inc., the mail-order clothing merchant, welcomed the end of the strike, even though it lauded the service provided by the postal system during the walkout.
"We will switch back to U.P.S., absolutely," Charlotte LaComb, a spokeswoman for Lands' End said today. "There is not a replacement that can offer the same kind of service U.P.S. does at the cost that they do."
Ms. LaComb cited U.P.S.'s tracking system and ubiquitous brown trucks, but she acknowledged that Lands' End would continue to evaluate its shipping options.
And the J. Crew Group, the New York merchant of upscale clothing, will "gradually fade back into U.P.S. over the next week," said Arthur Cinader Jr., the operations manager. Mr. Cinader said J. Crew was undecided about whether to diversify its shipping.
A smaller clothing company hundreds of miles away made that decision long ago, and was thankful for it during the walkout. Jim Eastham, the vice president of Faith Mountain Company in Sperryville, Va., said his company began diversifying its shipping a couple of years ago.
Mr. Eastham said the strike illustrated the danger of all-or-nothing relationships.
"If there is any lesson to be learned, that is it" -- and that his company had been able to switch fairly easily to the Postal Service's Priority Mail during the strike because U.P.S. has accounted for only about 60 percent of its shipments.
But other small companies, purveyors of anything a person can think of and some things he never would, depend almost solely on U.P.S. and greeted the strike's end as deliverance. Some of these are too small to have much leverage with other shippers. Others deal in goods that the post office cannot handle: liquor, for example, or packages weighing more than 70 pounds or measuring more than 108 inches combined length and girth.
National shipments of gourmet smoked catfish pate from the Crown Restaurant in Indianola, Miss., were almost at a standstill during the last two weeks, said the restaurateur, Evelyn Roughton. Her establishment sells 1,400 pounds of the delicacy a week, a quarter of it by mail order to individual buyers.
Ms. Roughton did make other arrangements, but she said she wanted to resume the U.P.S. habit.
"We have a perishable product, so shipping schedules matter a lot," she said.
"Hooray!" was how Robert Alcala, owner of a Western-wear shop in Chicago, reacted to the strike's end. He turned to Federal Express and the Postal Service for two weeks, but said he needed U.P.S.
So does Albert Karoll, owner of a custom clothing shop in Chicago. He used the Postal Service during the strike and said he was "pleasantly surprised." But he said he liked U.P.S.'s service and would rely on the company again. Still, he conceded that the strike made him realize how vulnerable his company was in its dependence on one shipping company.
John Hart Wines, a small retail company in Chicago, never had the choice of switching from U.P.S. to the post office because alcoholic beverages cannot be legally mailed. And other shippers gave first priority to their bigger clients, said John Hart's shipping director, Rick Nelson, explaining his relief at the end of the walkout.
The strike affected hospitals and health-care companies. VHA Inc., a Texas company that acts as a group buyer for 1,500 health-care organizations across the country, said some hospitals had to cancel elective surgeries and were having trouble getting shipments of supplies and sending out surgical instruments for repair and replacement.
Some VHA sales workers served as "pack mules," delivering supplies to hospitals in their own cars, said Lynn Gentry, a company spokesman.
Some medical supplies are difficult to send through the mail. The Postal Service has stringent packing regulations for equipment like needles and vials, said Lou Eberhardt, a Postal Service spokesman in Chicago.
Alliance Medical, a $10 million-a-year company that ships medical supplies to ambulance services and fire departments across the country from its base in Russellville, Mo., had sent about 90 percent of its 300 packages a day by U.P.S. and successfully rerouted them during the strike, said its marketing manager, Larry Dahl Jr.
The strike taught Alliance a lesson, Mr. Dahl said, and U.P.S. will not get as much of his company's business in the future.
"We could not have grown like we have without a company like U.P.S.,' he said. "But when something like this happens, it hurts us and everybody else."

Rockets Land in Northern Israel
Islamic guerrillas fired dozens of rockets into northern Israel to avenge a deadly attack Monday by militiamen aligned with Israel. The attack caused only minor damage and injuries, but the barrages were by far the heaviest since clashes between Hezbollah guerrillas and Israeli forces in southern Lebanon erupted into full-scale battle in April 1996.

Cambodian Skirmish Continues
Cambodian forces loyal to an ousted leader, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, fought to defend their last stronghold against troops backing the nation's strongman, Hun Sen. Forces loyal to Prince Ranariddh, who lost power to Hun Sen in a coup this summer, dug in along a ridge two miles south of O Smach, but military analysts said it was only a matter of time before they were routed by Hun Sen's superior numbers and fire-power.

A panel of independent experts criticized a major river-widening project proposed by Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia, saying that official studies have minimized possibly catastrophic environmental consequences. Convened by pressure groups from the United States and Brazil, the environmental experts said the studies into the Hidrovia Paraguay-Parana were flawed. They challenged the view that there would be little impact on one of the world's richest ecosystems. The Hidrovia works involve dredging a deeper channel between Brazil and Uruguay. (Reuters)

Specter of Further Losses Prodded U.P.S. to Settle
As 185,000 teamsters prepared to return to work at the United Parcel Service after a 15-day strike, company officials acknowledged that fears of hundreds of millions of dollars in additional losses led them to back away from a long-held demand on pensions and to make other concessions on pay and part-time workers. Company officials also said that as many as 15,000 workers might be laid off to compensate for losses resulting from the strike. A1
 
Ron Carey, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said what all of organized labor was waiting to hear: the union's settlement with United Parcel Service will be as much of a boon to labor as the failed air traffic controllers' strike of 1981 was a bust. A1

HEADLINE: Settlement at U.P.S.

 BODY:
Labor leaders exulted yesterday in the settlement of the 15-day strike at United Parcel Service, for understandable reasons. The teamsters won most of their demands -- for wage increases, pension protections and especially for upgrading thousands of jobs from part time to full time. More than that, the union dramatized what it sees as a pernicious trend, the growing reliance of companies on two-tiered work forces in which significant numbers of employees receive lower wages or benefits. It was far from clear, however, that the labor movement will be able to build on its victory to help workers elsewhere who have felt left out by the extraordinary economic boom of recent years.
President Clinton and Labor Secretary Alexis Herman played a constructive role in pushing for a settlement of a strike that had begun to hurt many businesses. But one of the most remarkable facts about the walkout at the world's largest package delivery company was the extent of public support generated by the 185,000 strikers. Some surveys showed that Americans supported them by a margin of 2 to 1. Mr. Clinton was probably correct in warning that public approval might soon reach its limits, but news of widespread sympathy for the strikers galvanized people on the picket lines and no doubt contributed to United Parcel's decision to make significant concessions. 
 Some of that sympathy turned on unusual aspects of this particular strike. An enormous number of Americans come into contact with United Parcel Service, and their esteem for the company turns out to be connected directly to the employees themselves. Ron Carey, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, skillfully advanced the most sympathetic spokesmen for the cause -- hard-working part-time employees who said they simply wanted to be paid at the same rate as their full-time colleagues. It was a genuine feat for a union plagued by a reputation for corruption. The image of the workers in this case was in marked contrast to what the public felt was sullen behavior by the air traffic controllers in 1981 and the high-paid baseball players of more recent vintage.
More broadly, the issue of part-time employment touched a nerve among people worried about job security and lagging wages. Despite recent small improvements in wage levels for middle- and lower-level workers, the corporate downsizing of the 1990's has undeniably made Americans more doubtful about their employers and more sympathetic to those whose wages have not kept up. That was one reason portable health insurance and the minimum wage won bipartisan support in Congress last year. Politicians and companies would do well not to ignore this larger trend.
It will be tempting for many analysts to say that the labor movement is on the mend after decades of decline. Labor's legislative victories, including its battles against steep cuts in Medicare, have certainly been impressive. But the country's current sympathy for the problems of some workers does not necessarily open a new chapter in industrial relations. It will still be difficult to reconcile the age-old conflict between union pressure for higher wages and the fear of inflation in financial markets and corporate boardrooms. Strikes, of course, involve issues of economics and issues of perception. This strike's most lasting benefit might well be in persuading corporate employers that the public judges them by the treatment of their lower-paid and most vulnerable workers.

HEADLINE: CONCLUDING THE U.P.S. STRIKE: THE OVERVIEW;
U.P.S. SAYS FEARS OF BIGGER LOSSES MADE IT CUT DEAL

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
As 185,000 teamsters prepared to return to work at the United Parcel Service, company officials acknowledged today that fears of hundreds of millions of dollars in additional losses pushed them to back off a long-held demand on pensions during marathon talks on Monday, helping end the 15-day strike.
Though company officials said that 15,000 workers may be laid off because of business lost from the strike, they acknowledged that they had made concessions on pay, pensions and part-time workers, which the teamsters asserted were a major victory. 
 At a news conference at U.P.S. headquarters in Atlanta, James P. Kelly, the company's chairman, said, "The bottom line is that we have a contract that is good for our people, gets us back in business, and will keep us competitive in the coming years."
Millions of American consumers and companies welcomed the end to the strike, which paralyzed the world's largest parcel delivery company. The strike prevented many shop owners from restocking their shelves, hospitals from receiving supplies, and grandparents from shipping gifts to grandchildren.
The 50-person bargaining committee of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and officials from more than 200 teamsters locals ratified the tentative agreement tonight after Ron Carey, the union's president, said it gave the union most of what it sought during the nation's largest strike in more than a decade.
In the agreement, the teamsters persuaded U.P.S. to convert thousands of part-time jobs to full time, to raise part-timers' starting wage for the first time since 1982 and to let U.P.S. workers remain in the union's multi-employer pension plans while raising retirement benefits.
"This fight with U.P.S. shows what working people can accomplish when they all stick together," Mr. Carey said at a news conference at the union's headquarters in Washington.
The agreement is unusual because it awards lower-paid part-time workers a larger raise than full-timers. The part-time workers receive a 37 percent raise over five years, the full-timers, 15 percent.
Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, said, "It sounds to me that the union got most of what it wanted and that U.P.S. did not get most of what it wanted, which most of all was to withdrawal from the teamster pensions funds."
While teamsters around the nation applauded the settlement, U.P.S. officials dampened the celebration by warning of layoffs.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Kelly said he feared that the company might lose 5 percent of its market share, at least temporarily, as a result of the strike. He said that could force the layoff of 5 percent of the company's domestic work force of about 300,000.
Ken Sternad, the company's spokesman, said in an interview, "We're taking the attitude that no one wins in a strike."
After two weeks of clashing bitterly, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Carey vowed today to work together to win back business from competitors like Federal Express and the Postal Service.
Giving his blessing to the settlement, President Clinton said, "I would say it is a victory for the proposition that you can have good strong labor relations and treat your employees well and make money in this economy of ours."
If there was an indisputable victor in the strike, it was Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, who steadfastly urged the two sides to stay at the bargaining table during more than 80 hours of intense talks from Thursday to Monday.
But union officials also had kind words for the White House for prodding the two sides to negotiate and for resisting the company's pleas to seek a back-to-work injunction under the Taft-Hartley Act.
"The Secretary of Labor has gotten a lot of well-deserved praise and attention, but this was really a team effort by the Administration," said Gerry Shea, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s assistant to the president for governmental affairs.
Several labor leaders said U.P.S. miscalculated by bargaining hard in the belief that it could easily defeat the teamsters in a strike because the union was badly divided and its strike fund was depleted. That fund received a much-needed infusion of cash when the nation's labor unions pledged to lend the teamsters $10 million a week.
U.P.S. executives asserted, however, that Mr. Carey was dead set on calling a strike to unite the union behind him and distract people from an investigation into the financing of his re-election campaign.
In claiming victory, Mr. Carey noted that U.P.S. agreed to convert 10,000 part-time jobs into full-time ones over the next five years, after U.P.S. had originally offered to convert 1,000 such jobs over that period. The union's demand was to transform 10,000 part-time jobs to full-time ones over four years.
During the strike, the union put U.P.S. on the defensive by arguing that the main issue was U.P.S.'s large-scale creation of part-time jobs that did not pay enough to support a family. This focus was one reason that the American public, according to public polls, backed the strikers by a 2-to-1 margin.
Today, even after the settlement, Mr. Kelly bristled at the union's charges that the company did not treat its workers well. "If you talk about downsizing and throw-away jobs and temporary jobs, that doesn't exist at U.P.S.," he said. "We've created tens of thousands of jobs. We were set up to serve as an example of what's wrong with America, but you wonder why they chose us because we're one of the few companies that doesn't fit into that category."
In the settlement, the company agreed to raise the wages of full-time drivers, who average $19.95 an hour, by $3.10 an hour over five years. For part-time workers, who average $11 an hour, pay is to rise $4.10 an hour over five years. For loaders, whose starting pay has not changed since 1982, the starting wage will rise to $8.50 an hour, from $8.
Teamster officials said they also emerged victorious by getting the company to forswear most contracting out and by persuading it to drop its demand that U.P.S. drivers lose their right to honor other unions' picket lines. Mr. Carey said the biggest concession the union made was agreeing to a five-year contract -- the union had originally call for a three-year deal, but began pushing for a four-year contract shortly before the strike began on Aug. 4.
According to Mr. Kelly, the company's largest concession was withdrawing its demand to pull out of the union's multi-employer pension plans and set up a U.P.S.-only plan for all the unionized workers. The company said it would increase pensions by an average of 50 percent in a U.P.S.-only pension plan, but the union bitterly fought on this matter, contending that the company's withdrawal could weaken the multi-employer plans.
"The pension issue," Mr. Kelly said, "got the most press, and that was the one where we compromised the most."
Mr. Kelly said the company decided to back off the demand to reach a settlement after seeing that it would not persuade the union to have the rank and file vote on what the company called its "last, best and final offer."
Ken Hall, the teamsters' chief negotiator, said the company's negotiators surprised him and Mr. Carey on Sunday when they asked, hypothetically, what the union would trade if the company dropped its demand to withdraw from the multi-employer plans.
For much of Sunday, Mr. Hall said, the two sides talked hypothetically about which demands they would trade if the other side gave up some of its demands. It was an interlocking puzzle with dozens of pieces and demands flying around the table, the negotiators said.
Mr. Hall, who is the director of the teamsters' parcel and small package department, said that finally, around 3 P.M. Monday, after talking nearly nonstop for three days, the two sides began making serious trades and an overall package emerged.
"I was relieved -- and exhausted," Mr. Hall said.
At his second news conference of the day, Mr. Carey presented himself as one of the nation's most successful labor leaders, one who planned to use this agreement to persuade workers ranging from apple pickers in Washington to Federal Express employees to join the teamsters.
Even some of Mr. Carey's many opponents in the often-fractious union acknowledged today that he would emerge stronger from the U.P.S. battle. Mr. Carey's opponents have sought to overturn his election last December as president, after Federal prosecutors charged two campaign aides with illegally diverting union money into his campaign coffers. Nancy Stella, a Carey spokeswoman, said he had no knowledge of such machinations.
Among the workers, there was widespread relief that the strike was over and general support for the agreement.
Charlie Mosiman, a full-time U.P.S. driver in Seattle, said, "I want to go back to work, but I'm no fan of U.P.S. The real issue is how we get treated right here. But from everything we've heard, the offer is a lot better than U.P.S.'s first 'last, best offer."'
Sam Figueroa, a full-time driver in Manhattan, said he was elated with the agreement but weary after standing on the picket line every day for eight hours.
"I feel like we achieved what we were after," he said. "All the men and women across America who are teamsters stood tall."

For the Mets, A Melting Pot Celebration

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH 

 BODY:
WHEN the Mets started promoting their current homestand as a celebration of various ethnic groups, calling it International Week, it underscored that team's recognition of its residence in America's most diverse urban melting pot.
At first glance, two impressions leap out. What fun, what with the costumes, the music, the pageantry, the pride, starting last evening with Italian night as the ethnically diverse Mets met the equally diverse Dodgers. 
 Alas, the second immediate impression was -- given baseball's fine-tuned sensitivity in this, the year of Jackie Robinson -- how is it that the Mets could not find room to celebrate African-American culture during a homestand on which the Irish, Italian, German, Hispanic and Asian communities will be honored?
This is the sport that has focused keenly on its relationship with African-Americans and other minority groups who have turned away from the game because of benign neglect and lack of interest on the part of the sport. Baseball has vowed to revive such relationships because it makes economic sense and solidifies a claim to truly be the national pastime.
So a call was put in to Mark Bingham, the Mets' vice president in charge of marketing and broadcasting, to ask how the team, in making its choices, opted not to include African-Americans.
Questioning the Mets about their selections was not a unique idea, it turns out.
"The first three calls were from Jewish groups," Bingham said.
It's not easy being a baseball executive commanded not only to grow new fans, but also to do so on the front lines of a tart ethnic pie chart.
"We knew when we created this, there would be people who felt left out, which is why the last day is a multinational day, for groups that might feel left out," Bingham said.
Bingham, knowing a potential for growth when he sees one, said this is a roster that is by no means set. A gate of 40,000 might make Hispanic night a happy necessity for 1998 and beyond. But Polish-Americans might get the call next year. Black Americans, too. It's all about marketing, after all, and in that sense, the only color that really counts is green.
Still, Bingham said: "I hate to be so fearful that by having an Hispanic night that you're going to tick off Poles or Jews or any group. The whole purpose of the whole week is to talk about New York as a melting pot. And hopefully that's what people think about, how when you go from one street corner to another, you hear African rhythms, Irish rhythms, Spanish rhythms. That's what it's all about."
That said, there was the matter of making the cutdown. And, again, it was all about group sales and the relations the Mets have with Irish groups, Asian groups, etc.
"And where we had focused our efforts with the African-American community was for Jackie Robinson Day," Bingham said, recalling Shea's 50th-anniversary celebrations of Robinson's breaking the color barrier.
"Really, we very much thought about the issue," Bingham said. "And we thought if we were going to put our efforts into a day, we were going to put it into Jackie Robinson Day. And in a group-sale effort, we felt to go back a month and a half later would be going to the well too many times."
As for the Jewish community, Bingham said deliberations were made. "And the question was, how do we do it?" he said. "Is it a religion, an ethnic group?"
Bingham added: "It's one of those you can't win. But while honesty and sincerity may not always win the day, may not always win people over, I know in my heart what I said about why and how we came up with this week."
Does it need polishing? "I'm not sure that it is a smart thing to say, about Jackie Robinson night, and our decision there, because I thought Jackie Robinson Day was for all Americans and all New Yorkers," Bingham acknowledged. "But we knew from a group-sale perspective to focus on the African-American groups for that day."
So the Mets farm for new fans, in fits and starts, just like all of baseball. But at least they try. And their two celebrations of Robinson are two more than New York's other major league baseball team has held. So the Mets have celebrated African-American contributions to the game. A wider celebration of the contributions to American culture would be nice, too. But again, fits and starts are better than nothing. So let the celebrations begin.

HEADLINE: New Bank Fraud Wrinkle in Antigua: Russians on the Internet

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: ST. JOHN'S, Antigua and Barbuda

 BODY:
When it opened for business here three years ago, the European Union Bank marketed itself as the first offshore bank on the Internet and claimed to be the wave of the future. But now the bank has collapsed, two of its Russian directors and depositors' money have disappeared, and the Government of Antigua has belatedly issued a fraud alert.
The scandal comes as little surprise to regulators in North America and Europe who have long warned that the Russian mafia, Colombian drug traffickers and other international criminals have been laundering money through Antigua's flourishing banking sector. More than 50 offshore banks are chartered here, many consisting of little more than a telephone and a computer behind a brass plate on an office door. 
 Dominated politically and economically by the Bird family since the mid-1940's, this former British colony 300 miles southeast of Puerto Rico has a reputation as a haven for intrigue and dubious businesses, notwithstanding the passage of money-laundering legislation last year. A recent State Department report describes Antigua, an island nation of 65,000 people, as "a weak link in efforts to combat drug trafficking and money laundering" and notes "a surge in questionable banking operations."
European Union Bank was founded in June 1994 as the East European International Bank by two Russians, Aleksandr P. Konanikhin and Mikhail B. Khodorovsky. In bank documents on file here, both described themselves as brokers of oil, metals and construction supplies and officers of the Menatep Bank of Moscow, which American and British officials have said is linked to Russian organized crime.
American officials said Mr. Konanikhin was arrested in the United States on visa violation charges and is accused of having embezzled more than $8 million from a Moscow bank. Both severed their formal connections with the European Union Bank, and two other Russians, Sergei Ushakov and Vitali Papsouev, who have disappeared, were listed as the bank's directors when it collapsed.
At the bank's office above a dentist's office and Nio's Bar and Restaurant, a notice on the locked door said, "European Union Bank Inc. has been placed in receivership effective this 8th day of August 1997."
On its now-dormant Internet site, www.eubank.ag, the bank had emphasized the benefits of the lax regulatory climate here. "Since there are no government withholding or reporting requirements on accounts, the burdensome and expensive accounting requirements are reduced for you," the web page said.
Through the Internet, the bank allowed clients anywhere in the world to open accounts, transfer money, write checks by computer and obtain credit cards around the clock.
Citing confidentiality laws, Government officials here declined to say how many depositors the bank had had or how much money it had reported in accounts.
John E. St. Luce, the Minister of Finance, said he did not get directly involved "in this sort of thing," and Keith Hurst, Financial Secretary, declined to discuss the collapse.
Bank records here, however, make it clear that the bank ran afoul of the rules almost from the beginning, but was allowed to stay in business until depositors began complaining recently that they no longer had access to their accounts. An official letter sent by the Ministry of Finance in October 1995 noted that the bank had failed to file an audited financial statement for 1994.
Those initial indications were followed by other, more public warnings. Last year, the Bank of England reportedly issued a statement cautioning investors "to be careful about putting any money into the EUB," and in May the Idaho Department of Finance declared the bank to be operating illegally and ordered it to stop soliciting deposits from Idaho residents over the Internet.
"There was a lack of disclosure, a lack of information on the principals, a lack of any of the licenses or charters that would have allowed this bank to conduct business legally in this state or this country," Gavin Gee, director of the department in Idaho, said in a telephone interview from Boise. "While the Internet is a wonderful means of obtaining information and doing business, it is also a means for fraud, and to the extent we have jurisdiction, we have a duty to protect our residents," he said.
In an interview here, Agnes James, permanent secretary of the Ministry of Finance, said the Government of Antigua had taken several steps to prevent similar cases, including "a stricter watch on quarterly reports." She said there were also plans for the ministry's two bank inspectors to get additional help so "they can go in on a monthly basis" to "check on the banks indicated for this type of treatment."
Earlier this year, responding to pressure from Washington, Prime Minister Lester Bird said a thorough investigation would be made of about a half-dozen banks identified as being linked to Russian crime groups. But the inquiry remains incomplete.
As a result of the European Union Bank case, Mrs. James said, "there will be some changes, some tighter sanctions as far as due diligence is concerned" when applications to charter a bank here are made.
Mr. St. Luce, the Finance Minister, said: "All that is needed has been set in motion. We have just passed very, very strong legislation, vetted by the Americans and the British, on money laundering. We have a committee looking into these things, and are getting everything that is needed operating."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 13, 1998, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article last Aug. 20 described the operations of the European Union Bank, an offshore institution based in Antigua. The article said two of the bank's original directors, Aleksandr P. Konanikhin and Mikhail B. Khodorovsky, were officers of the Menatep Bank of Moscow. It quoted unidentified British and American officials who said Menatep had links to Russian organized crime.
In fairness, The Times should have sought a response from Menatep, Mr. Khodorovsky and Mr. Ko nanikhin.
Mr. Khodorovsky has since said the allegations about Menatep were "baseless" and "entirely false." He said last fall that Menatep had earned a B+ rating from Thomson Bank Watch, an international rating service, and had recently gained approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell stock in the United States. He added that the bank had ties to the World Bank and was a "respected, reputable financial institution."
Mr. Khodorovsky said he withdrew as a director of the European Union Bank in 1994, a week after its registration, and played no role in its operations before then.
Mr. Konanikhin said the allegations against him, including an arrest in the United States, visa violations and Russian charges of having embezzled $8 million, resulted from "disinformation" by Russian intelligence, which influenced or duped officials at the United States Department of Justice.
This editors' note was delayed pending the outcome of a lawsuit in London against The International Herald Tribune over the article. The Times was not sued, and the suit has now been settled.

HEADLINE: A Song Sails Forth From Cuba;
Despite Restrictions, the Island's Arts Find a Growing U.S. Audience

BYLINE: By PETER WATROUS 

 BODY:
Cubans call it "Cubanitis," a cultural virus that affects outsiders. The signs are obvious: foreigners, Europeans, or, sometimes, United States citizens, get lost in the culture and try to become Cuban, wearing beads from the Santeria religion, learning the newest dances, even marrying a Cuban. (There are towns in Spain where a growing portion of the female population is Cuban: first the barber went and found a wife, then the butcher . . .)
But Cubanitis does not just affect individuals. In the United States today, interest in Cuban culture, while a far cry from the days when the mambo ruled and Desi Arnaz sang "Babalu," is beginning to grow. The old romance between the United States and Cuba, changed by the cold war, is stirring, ahead of any political rapprochement. (Although the Clinton Administration said it was considering an easing of the ban on travel to Cuba during the Pope's visit there in January, no permanent reduction was expected in the restrictions.) 
 The growing interest in Cuban culture may be due in part to a sense among some people that political change may be coming to the island and with it an opening up to the world. Meanwhile, for many Americans, it still is a forbidden zone that puts on a spectacular party with powerful indigenous music. Because the United States Government's loosening of visa restrictions on traveling Cuban musicians, more Americans are experiencing the music firsthand.
This new interest is still far from the mainstream; it is limited to people who are open to influences from abroad and who seem to be tapping into a longstanding cultural relationship between the two countries. It can be counted in record sales in the thousands, not millions, and in in a growing number of concerts and club dates in a few major cities.
This summer the United States has welcomed some of the best of Havana's performers -- including NG La Banda, Pablo Milanes and Issac Delgado -- tour the country, drawing large audiences. And because of a loophole in the Helms-Burton Act, which prohibits trade between the United States and Cuba, American record companies have been able to license recordings by Cuban musicians, circumventing the embargo, and much of the best contemporary Cuban music is available in this country or soon will be.
On a smaller scale, too, interest in Cuban culture is expanding quickly. At Caribbean Music and Dance, a San Francisco-based organization that specializes in educational tours of Cuba, business has flowered.
"We did one workshop in Cuban folklore six years ago when we started; now we do 11 events," said Melissa Daar, the company's president. "The first one had 30 people from the Bay Area, and now we have 300 people a year from all over the country. The kinds of people have also changed. The interest is broader, and people want to go to all the major cultural centers, like Matanzas and Santiago. They're getting more sophisticated."
At Descarga, a mail-order company in Brooklyn that specializes in recordings from the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, business has tripled over the last three years.
"I sell as much as I can get," said Bruce Polin, the owner. "But I can't get enough stock. I'm always sold out of Cuban material, and I could sell, for example, 2,000 copies immediately of a new Los Van Van if I had it. And I'm just a mail-order company."
Intellectuals and celebrities are making the pilgrimage to Havana, flying first to Cancun or the Bahamas to evade the United States restrictions on travel to Cuba and using the annual Havana Film Festival, which features work from across Latin America, as an excuse for going, or the Havana Biennial, an art show whose reputation is steadily rising.
"When I lived in Havana, between the years of 1993 and 1995, I saw a huge increase in Americans coming to Havana, writing pieces and researching books," said Jon Lee Anderson, an American who lives in Spain. He is the author of "Che" (Grove Press), the recent biography of Che Guevara, the Argentine radical who helped propel the Cuban revolution. "Tourism tripled while I was there, but there was this ever-growing river of journalists and academics pounding on our doors to get at the story."
This is happening against a backdrop of political efforts by anti-Castro Cuban exiles in the United States to shape American public policy on Cuba. In Miami and Houston, where there are large and vocal Cuban communities, concerts by Cuban artists are regular targets of demonstrations. Many Cuban artists no longer bother to perform in Miami.
What this all signals is the resurgence of the long, complicated relationship between the two countries, one formed in part by contentious politics going back to the Spanish-American War of 1898, after which the United States recognized Cuba's independence from Spain but exerted a dominant economic interest of its own there.
From cigars to literature, Havana and New York were long regular trading partners. The Cuban poet and patriot Jose Marti spent time early in this century in New York City. And Cuba was a fabled spot for Americans like Ernest Hemingway. The Mafia moved in; gambling and prostitution gave Havana one form of notoriety, while the constant revolutions in Cuban music made their way north.
Even the breakdown of relations after the revolution, with the Cuban missile crisis and the Bay of Pigs operation, paradoxically joined the countries together. Not only do the two countries share some of the more intense moments of the cold war, but the subsequent attempts by the United States Government to sever cultural ties has made Cuba a forbidden place that inspires more than curiosity; discovering it is like coming across a long-lost relative.
For all the political oppression, the country still fascinates, and that's because Cuba and the United States share more than a few things. In some senses, President Fidel Castro has been a romantic figure to some Americans, who first saw him as a David fighting a Goliath.
And in Cuba's racial mix, its cosmopolitanism, its dual respect for both its European tradition and its native identity, the country seems remarkably similar to the United States, only 90 miles away.
"I think Cuba is part of our psyche, our own historical landscape, and it inhabits part of our imagination as no other place does," said Mr. Anderson. "Cuba was to parents of the baby-boomer generation where they'd go for dirty weekends or a honeymoon. The recently ended cold war imprinted Cuba in the public imagination in another way."
 
Wandering Into A Parallel Universe
American visitors to Havana often find themselves wandering into what seems like a parallel universe with a highly intelligent population, but one oddly untouched by modernity. There is a sense that, for all of its problems, the place has some sort of prelapsarian innocence, one that could vanish with the fall of Mr. Castro.
"There's a sense there of something we've lost," said Mr. Anderson. "It's so undeveloped, it has avoided the Latin shantytown syndrome, the American cultural death due to monoculturalism, the spread of the subdivisions and the rampant overdevelopment of coasts, all the things that have devastated our own country."
But the growing interest in the country also comes from what is seen as a cultural flowering there. Wandering around Havana, some visitors feel a change in the air, an excitement that is immediately recognizable, even if political oppression abounds, along with a feeling of despair and stagnation generated by a society where social mobility is equal to exile.
"There's a tremendous interest in Cuban art now, and it's building," said Jeffry Keough, the director of exhibitions at the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston, which has had several exhibits of Cuban works. Although many young artists have had to leave Cuba to work freely, "the ones that are still there are being watched carefully, by both the Government and by galleries outside the country," he said. "They're the most exotic of the exotics."
Ned Sublette, the owner of Qbadisc, a company in Manhattan that specializes in Cuban music, spends a portion of each year in Cuba doing business. "The creativity of the street is incredible," he said.
 
A Land Rich In Culture
Cubans "have an education, but they don't have much information," he said. "The information they do have is about themselves. But if you're going to go inward, it's hard to think of a better place, because it is so rich culturally. And right now there is no better expression of the Cuban commitment to the arts than in music."
An exemplar of that music, NG La Banda, the group that revolutionized Cuban popular music in the early 90's, played at Lincoln Center last month. Pablo Milanes, the political singer-songwriter and one of Cuba's most famous musicians, will be performing there, too. Los Van Van, which played New York City last year, toured the West Coast this summer, drawing large crowds. The American trumpeter Roy Hargrove spent the summer touring with a partially Cuban band and used the musicians on an album. In Havana, musicians from the United States spend weeks studying the music and soaking up the new sounds.
David Bither, a vice president of Nonesuch Records in New York, licensed three Cuban albums from a company in England; one is a collaboration between the American guitarist Ry Cooder and a group of Cuban musicians.
"I haven't felt this sort of interest in a project in years," said Mr. Bither. "I sent a few promotional copies out recently, and we had an overwhelming response. It feels primed to explode."
And that sort of interest translates into politics.
 
A Warming Based on Music
"If the barriers between the two countries come down, it'll in part be because of the musicians," said Mr. Sublette. "The history of the opening will be in part the history of the desire of audiences here to experience all this music from there."
Bill Martinez, a lawyer in San Francisco who, with his company, Latino Entertainment Partners, specializes in Cuban music, sees the change. "There's a lot more accommodation by the State Department about letting Cuban artists and bands into the United States now," he said. "I actually haven't heard of one request that has been refused.
"I think, speculating a bit, that the State Department feels that it's stupid to shut the door on musicians. To be a bit paranoid, by letting the musicians in here, we're probably fomenting change in Cuba, because the musicians have seen how the other side lives, and they take the story back with them. We may be used by the Government, but we're also giving the people what they want."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Strength in Mexican Economy Bolsters Peso Against Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar dropped to a 10-month low against the Mexican peso yesterday on signs of an economic rebound in Mexico.
It also fell against the yen amid fears of escalating trade friction between the United States and Japan. 
 Traders said foreign investors were encouraged by a report of unexpected economic growth in Mexico and by higher interest rates in Mexico's bond market.
In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 7.7450 pesos, down from 7.750 on Tuesday and its lowest level since 7.7410 on Oct. 21.
On Monday, Mexico's Government reported that growth in gross domestic product exceeded expectations in the second quarter, putting the economy on pace to surpass the Government's projections for the year.
Also in New York, the dollar was quoted at 117.75 yen, down from 118.21 late on Tuesday. It rose to 1.8567 marks from 1.8388 on Tuesday, as investors expected the Bundesbank, the German central bank, to remain reluctant to raise interest rates.
The dollar weakened early against the yen after the Clinton Administration publicly criticized Japan for a delay in the opening of its auto parts market.
The dollar reached an intraday low of 117.53 yen before rebounding slightly later in the day, even after the Commerce Department reported that the United States trade deficit with Japan rose sharply in June.
Commerce Secretary William M. Daley and Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, complained in a letter to Japan's transportation minister about the slow pace in reducing red tape that impedes the access of foreign companies to Japan's auto parts market.
Mr. Daley said the United States would seek faster deregulation when officials of both countries meet in September to review a 1995 agreement that was aimed at increasing sales of American-made cars and parts in Japan.
Against the mark, the dollar was again buoyed by the German central bank's decision to leave a key short-term interest rate unchanged on Tuesday. Traders said they expected the Bundesbank to do the same at another meeting today.

HEADLINE: Two Colombian Cabinet Ministers Forced Out in New Scandal

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Aug. 20

 BODY:
Two Cabinet ministers have been forced to resign after they were secretly recorded discussing awarding radio frequencies to friends of the administration of President Ernest Samper. The frequencies were supposed to be up for public auction.
The two, Saulo Arboleda, the Communications Minister, and Rodrigo Villamizar, the Minister of Mining and Energy, stepped down Tuesday night after a part of their 12-minute conversation was published in the newsweekly magazine Semana. Congress prepared a motion of censure, while Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the Nobel Prize-winning author, withdrew a bid that he and a group of friends had jointly submitted to renew their license for a television news program. 
 The Attorney General's office pledged to investigate the process by which the Government awarded 85 FM radio frequencies on July 24. Mr. Arboleda came under widespread criticism for his handling of the bidding after he voided the results twice. He rebuffed accusations of favoritism by insisting he was upholding the fairness of the auction.
On the tape, however, Mr. Arboleda is heard discussing a "50-50 split," presumably of the total number of licences, between the station owners and "friends of the President." Mr. Villamizar is heard to agree: "We'll see how we'll distribute it."
The magazine said the tape was made a few days before the awarding of the bids -- at the same time as Mr. Arboleda was publicly protesting his innocence. The tape was broadcast on television news programs on Tuesday night.
At one point in the conversation, the two men say they do not understand why President Samper favors Mauricio Guzman, the Mayor of Cali, to win one of the frequencies. Mayor Guzman is under investigation for illicit enrichment, the usual charge for accepting money from drug dealers.
The resignations were the latest blow for a beleaguered administration. In addition to the President's long-standing conflict with Washington, which has never hidden its belief that Cali drug barons bankrolled his election, the country is engulfed in violence and the economy has ground to a virtual halt. So far, 12 of Mr. Samper's top officials have had to resign amid scandal.
This week's revelations came after the Government had already faced criticism for using its control over television stations to retaliate for aggressive reporting on the investigation into Mr. Samper's campaign finances. In the spring, the Government announced it would withdraw some broadcast news programs and subject future ones to twice yearly reviews for objectivity and public service.
After the scandal broke, the President ordered the state intelligence service and the Defense Ministry to track down whoever made the recording and determine how it reached the press. As the criticisms grew throughout Tuesday, some in Congress called for the President's resignation, and even allies of Mr. Samper, like his former Interior Minister, Horacio Serpa, demanded that the ministers resign.
Criticizing an apparent lack of impartiality, Mr. Garcia Marquez told a local radio station that he had withdrawn his bid to renew the QAP television news program's license.
"If this was the official behavior with radio, it can't be any different when it comes to television news programs," Mr. Garcia Marquez said. "They can't have one set of morals for radio and another for television."

HEADLINE: Merril Eisenbud, 82, Safety Expert Known for Work on Atomic Energy

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Merril Eisenbud, an environmental scientist who was the first health and safety chief of the United States Atomic Energy Commission and the first head of New York City's Environmental Protection Agency, died on Friday at the Carolina Meadows retirement community in Chapel Hill, N.C. He was 82 and a former resident of Sterling Forest, N.Y.
The cause was leukemia, his family said. 
 In a career lasting six decades, he also taught and worked for 25 years at New York University Medical Center and the university's Institute of Environmental Medicine upstate, retiring in 1984.
Professor Eisenbud, the author of books, book chapters and about 200 scientific articles, had continued to write and teach.
He was a practical man who sought to balance ideals and realities in environmental matters -- an attitude that did not always sit well with partisans on either side. His arguments were laid out most recently in "How Clean Is Clean? How Safe Is Safe?: A Review of Environmental Priorities" (Cogito Books, 1993).
In his view, pristine conditions, even if they could be regained, were no practical choice. Rather he looked for the best possible solutions in terms of economic and political feasibility in an overpopulated world.
His focus professionally, governmentally and academically was on the effects of chemical and radioactive pollution on human health, a field that was largely unstudied when he began his career.
A native of Manhattan, he graduated in electrical engineering from N.Y.U. in 1936. He spent the next 10 years as an industrial hygienist for the Liberty Mutual Life Insurance Company. War came and so did atomic weapons tests, and with the mushroom clouds arose environmental concerns. His work took him to the field, to factories and mines, to rivers and lakes marred by industrial pollutants, and to places near where atomic explosions had spread their deadly rays.
In 1947, the Atomic Energy Commission recruited him to direct its health and safety laboratory. The topics of his papers then turned from purely industrial safety to concerns about radioactive dust from nuclear detonations and related subjects. He contributed significantly to scientific methods of measuring such fallout and its effects.
The commission reassigned him in 1957 to New York to manage its operations in the Northeast. In 1959, he joined the staff at N.Y.U. as a professor and director of the laboratory for environmental studies at its Institute of Environmental Medicine.
Professor Eisenbud took a leave of absence in 1968, when Mayor John V. Lindsay put him in charge of the city's newly formed Environmental Protection Agency. It was one of Mr. Lindsay's superagencies, bringing the Departments of Sanitation, Water Resources and Air Resources under a single administrator. He stayed in that post until 1970.
His books included "An Environmental Odyssey: People, Pollution, and Politics in the Life of a Practical Scientist" (1990), "Environmental Radioactivity: From Natural, Industrial and Military Sources" (3d edition, 1987), and "The Human Environment Past, Present, and Future" (1983). All remain in print.
He was an adviser on radiation hazards to the World Health Organization from 1956 to 1980, and a past member of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, and the New York State Health Advisory Council.
He is survived by his wife of 58 years, Irma Onish Eisenbud; their three sons, Elliott, of Sacramento, Calif., Michael, of Stamford, Conn., and Frederick, of Fort Salonga, N.Y.; his brother, Leon, of Naples, Fla.; a sister, Elsa LaPook of Manhattan; and eight grandchildren.

HEADLINE: First Part of Thai Bailout Is Authorized by the I.M.F.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund today approved the first part of a $16 billion international rescue package for Thailand, and the Clinton Administration announced that it would help provide short-term loans, if needed, to help Thailand stem a currency crisis that has threatened other nations in Southeast Asia.
The action taken by the I.M.F today, which was expected, authorized up to $4 billion in loans to the Thai Government following the devaluation of its currency last month. Japan and other Asian nations said last week that they would take the primary responsibility for bailing out Thailand, without American or European help, in return for a commitment from the Thai Government to enact strict financial controls. 
 But it appears increasingly likely that Thailand may need a "bridge loan" of roughly $1 billion dollars before aid from the I.M.F., the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank is available. Late today, the Bank for International Settlements, the Swiss-based coordinator of the world's central banks, said it was prepared to provide that financing.
About a quarter of that sum, or roughly $250 million, could come from the Treasury Department's Exchange Stabilization Fund, the same fund that was used to finance the bailout of Mexico two years ago. By comparison to the Mexican case, however, the United States participation in the Thai rescue package is minuscule; Mexico borrowed more than $12 billion from Washington. All of those funds have since been paid back.
American officials have said repeatedly that they wanted Japan to bear the brunt of the Thai bailout, because Japanese banks are major creditors in Thailand and Japanese companies have a large stake there. But in a statement issued today, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said that "the United States is prepared to participate in a short-term, multilateral bridging facility, if needed and under appropriate conditions, to provide liquidity in support of Thailand's program."
Mr. Rubin, who is on vacation, approved the move last week, Administration officials said. The short-term loans would be repaid, officials said, by funds from the international aid package.
The relatively small American participation in the Thai bailout is partly intended to avoid the political firestorm that accompanied the loans to Mexico in early 1995. When Congress refused to approve the use of taxpayer funds for direct loans, President Clinton acted on his own, authorizing the use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, which is primarily intended to protect the value of the United States dollar.
In return for the $16 billion loan package, Thailand has agreed to a series of fiscal changes, including higher taxes and the closings of scores of financial institutions that made unsound loans or investments in the Thai economy, one of the fastest growing in the world until a few years ago. Last month, the country abandoned its efforts to defend its currency, which had been linked to the value of the United States dollar. The currency, the baht, has since dropped in value by more than 20 percent.
The program the I.M.F. approved today will make a loan of $1.6 billion available immediately. The second phase of the loan will be approved in late November, if Thailand meets the economic targets it has committed to in recent weeks.
In a statement, the I.M.F. said that its credits would only be used to "help finance the balance of payments gap and to rebuild the official reserves of the Bank of Thailand," which were depleted in the failed effort to defend the baht. But that will free money for Thailand to help some of its reeling private banks.
That is the part of the program that makes American officials nervous. Since the Mexican bailout, Mr. Rubin and his staff have talked often of the "moral hazard" created by rescue plans, because they often save large creditors and investors from huge losses. They have urged those investors and creditors be forced to suffer large losses, as a warning that they cannot depend on being bailed out by the I.M.F. and other international institutions.
"If you say you are going to have more market discipline, you have to make sure someone takes a hit," said Morris Goldstein, a former I.M.F. official who now studies international financial rescue plans for the Institute for International Economics in Washington.

Trade Data Cause a Dip In Bond Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities turned lower in light trading yesterday, after a strong trade report suggested that the economy might be expanding quickly enough to accelerate inflation and thus increase chances that the Federal Reserve might raise short-term rates this year.
Talk that an Asian central bank was selling bills also weighed on the market, especially the long end. 
 By late in the day the 30-year bond dropped 13/32 to a price of 97 27/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 6.54 percent, from 6.51 percent on Tuesday.
The trade deficit for June narrowed by 14.5 percent, to a smaller-than-expected $8.2 billion from a revised $9.5 billion in May. Exports jumped nine-tenths of 1 percent to a record, as imports declined seven-tenths of 1 percent, thanks to moderating domestic demand. Some market participants saw the jump in exports as suggesting that robust demand for American-made goods could bolster manufacturing and speed up the economy.
Some economists have already begun revising upward their estimates for second-quarter growth, based on yesterday's trade numbers. Analysts said that the appearance of a resurgence in economic growth could change the Fed's view of the economy and lead it to raise rates in an effort to avert inflation. On Tuesday, the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee left short-term interest rates unchanged. Its next meeting is scheduled for Sept. 30.
"The combined impact of the lower trade gap and higher inventories than the Commerce Department estimated initially will cause second-quarter G.D.P. growth to be revised upward to 3 to 3.5 percent," Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities, said. Growth in the gross domestic product had been initally projected at a 2.2 percent rate for the second quarter.
The narrower trade deficit will add about 1 percentage point to the second-quarter G.D.P. revision, said Cheryl R. Katz, senior economist at Merrill Lynch & Company. "It now looks like G.D.P. grew about 4 percent, given a smaller trade deficit and higher inventory accumulation than previously assumed."
Patricia DeBlank Klink, president of Advisors Capital Management, which specializes in fixed-income portfolio management, said that even though the trade number had raised third-quarter estimates for G.D.P. to slightly more than 3 percent, from 2 percent several months ago, she expected that the fourth quarter might slip a bit. "There seems to be a self-correcting mechanism taking place," she said.
"No one can argue that bonds are expensive now in relation to current calendar rates of inflation," Ms. Klink added.
Bill Gamba, senior vice president and head of government bond trading at Cowen & Company, said that early talk of an Asian central bank selling in the front end of the curve dragged down the market, "while the Treasury's announcement today on the size of next week's note auctions gave market participants something else to worry about."
The Treasury said it would auction $15.5 billion of two-year notes on Tuesday and $11.5 billion of five-year notes on Wednesday. In when-issued trading ahead of those auctions, the two-year maturity was being offered at a price to yield 5.87 percent, and the 5-year at a price to yield 6.11 percent.
The notion of increased supply added some downward pressure in the market yesterday, as dealers and traders sought a yield level that would encourage distribution of the securities next week.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The greatest good for the greatest number? Try Lojack.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
IF you wire your home and put a warning decal on the window, you're less likely to be burglarized. But frustrated thieves are more likely to break into the house next door. What would happen, though, if you carefully concealed a silent alarm linked to a security service?
Burglars wouldn't be deterred from entering your house but they would be more likely to be caught in the act. And you'd be doing your neighbors a favor by reducing the number of bad guys on the street. In the language of Econ 101, there would be a "positive externality" to your choice of alarms. 
 In fact, deterrence is most of the point of having a house alarm: nobody wants to confront a thief in the kitchen. But auto theft is another matter. And a company based in Massachusetts, called Lojack, is trying to revolutionize protection against car thefts with its own version of the silent alarm.
It apparently works better than anyone anticipated. Two researchers, Ian Ayes of Yale and Steven Levitt of the University of Chicago, estimate that adding the Lojack system to three cars in a high-crime area reduces auto theft by one car a year. The only catch: individual car owners must pay for the installation, even though the biggest share of the benefits go to others.
Lojack retrieval is built around a small homing beacon. Hidden in the car, the beacon waits passively until the vehicle is reported stolen and is remotely activated from a radio signal tower. Then, police cruisers equipped with tracking receivers can identify the stolen vehicle by a five-digit code.
Since the company was founded in 1986, it has marketed the system in 12 metropolitan areas with serious auto theft problems -- Boston; Miami; Newark; Los Angeles; Chicago; Atlanta; Detroit; New York; Washington; Providence, R.I.; Tampa, Fla., and Norfolk, Va. The company would not disclose how many cars had been protected in each city. But it did provide the data to the two researchers for the year 1994, and they used it to isolate Lojack's impact from other statistical factors influencing rates of car theft.
The results, published by the National Bureau of Research, were remarkable. Boston experienced a 50 percent decline in thefts, transforming it from an auto-theft capital to a city with a theft rate only slightly higher than average. According to Mr. Ayres and Mr. Levitt's estimates, going from no hidden protection to Lojack in 2 percent of cars -- roughly the company's average market penetration -- reduces theft losses by 40 percent in central cities and about 13 percent within the range of Lojack's metropolitan coverage.
These numbers sound too good to be true, and in one sense they are. For while Lojack installation triples the probability of arresting a thief, it isn't much of a direct deterrent because relatively few cars are protected even in the high-penetration areas. Indeed, in Boston, the city with the most cars equipped with Lojack systems, the chance of being caught in a randomly selected stolen car has risen by less than one percentage point.
What the Lojack beacon apparently does do very effectively, though, is to disrupt recidivism. Career criminals account for a disproportionate share of auto thefts, stealing dozens or even hundreds of cars a year. So even a small rise in the probability of getting caught during each theft can have a large impact on the number of professionals in prison.
More important, most cars are stolen for their parts rather than resold intact. Theft rings typically operate centralized stripping centers. Hence, putting a "chop shop" out of business can lead to the recovery of dozens of cars, along with arrests of professional thieves.
According to the company, Lojack has led to raids on 53 chop shops in the Los Angeles area alone. That helps to explain why auto thefts fell 20 percent there in the four years after the company entered that market in 1990.
If Lojack is such a blessing, what is stopping people from buying its system? According to the researchers, 90 percent of the benefits go to non-buyers in the form of lower community-wide theft rates.
Having a Lojack system in your own car does increase the probability of it being recovered quickly, reducing the average loss from about $5,000 to $1,000. But since insurance usually covers all but a small deductible, paying $595 for Lojack amounts to an act of good citizenship rather than self-interest.
The key to making the market for Lojack work efficiently, the researchers suggest, is to require insurers to pass on the benefits in the form of premium discounts. Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Rhode Island do mandate discounts, but they are only loosely linked to the neighborhood benefits. And until 1996, Illinois actually banned insurance discounts, a fact that likely explains Lojack's poor sales in Chicago.

HEADLINE: A Free-Speech Senator Fights Limits on Donations

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
"To Common Cause, I'm Darth Vader," says Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who indeed radiates a certain pride and cunning in his eagerness to stand up once more against efforts to rein in the current system of financing political campaigns.
"But to the American Civil Liberties Union, I'm Luke Skywalker," he adds, smiling mischievously at having assembled a most motley political cadre to lead next month in the name of protecting unfettered political speech. 
 Reformers plan to test whether their call to limit big-money campaigning has taken on any life from the Senate's hearings this summer into campaign abuses. Senator McConnell and his backers -- from anti-abortion lobbyists to civil libertarians -- plan to demonstrate that it has not.
"I'm very confident this bill is not going to pass," he said, taking aim at the McCain-Feingold bill after a decade of combatting campaign spending restrictions. The 55-year-old master of Kentucky politics has become the dominant figure and closet hero on the issue in Congress, where most members dare not speak up so forthrightly for the incumbent-friendly fund-raising system that helps keep them here.
Far from being defensive, the Senator argues that current spending on campaigns is hardly scandalous but, rather, "minuscule." It amounts to perhaps 1 percent of all television advertising, he says, averaging $3.89 per eligible Congressional voter last year -- the price of a fast-food "value meal," as he likes to put it.
As a political combatant, he does not shrink from Darth Vader comparisons, having directed the ethics inquiry into former Senator Bob Packwood's women-groping scandal with an unapologetic rejection of the public hearings demanded by critics. On the Skywalker ledger of libertarians, Mr. McConnell's appreciation of the First Amendment free-speech guarantee has seen him come out in opposition to Congress's perennial attempts to overturn the Supreme Court's protection of flag burning.
Braced by the Supreme Court's firm ruling that equates uncrimped campaign spending and free speech, Senator McConnell argues tenaciously that the political spending should not be curtailed.
"I don't think it's a scandal at all," the Senator said of modern political spending, which reached an estimated $2 billion last year for the Presidential and Congressional races, nearly double the spending of 1992. "I think it ought to be applauded and encouraged. For Americans to contribute to the party they believe in and the candidate of their choice, bearing in mind these contributions are limited and fully disclosed, I think is something that is healthy for democracy."
Through the Senate hearings on campaign abuses last month, Senator McConnell could hear the reformers' drumbeat growing, intended to galvanize support for the McCain-Feingold bill, which would impose spending limits. Newspaper editorials acid with moralizing denunciations of the current system were distributed daily at the hearings alongside exhibits on the Clinton re-election campaign's return of funds improperly raised abroad.
The hearings have come up with nothing sensational enough to seize the public imagination and certainly nothing to impress the vast majority of Republican lawmakers opposed to the McCain-Feingold bill. The measure tries a carrot-and-stick approach around First Amendment obstacles, inviting candidates to accept voluntary spending limits in return for limited but free television time and reduced-rate campaign mailings.
Thus far, the hearings by the Governmental Affairs Committee have laid bare some of the frenzied searches by both parties for large sums donated to general party coffers as "soft money," unregulated money supposedly generic -- that is, for parties, not specific candidates -- but used increasingly for candidate strategems.
"There's been an explosion in soft money because of the restrictions on hard money," Mr. McConnell contended, referring to regulated money donated directly to candidates. "What we need to do is dramatically free up the parties to operate in hard money." He says the contribution limits set two decades ago should be tripled to allow for inflation.
"I'm open to some restrictions on soft money," he said, providing hard money is liberalized.
"You can't dam up speech," said the Senator, noting that the Supreme Court found in its 1976 decision in Buckley v. Valeo that "the First Amendment denies Government the power to determine that spending to promote one's political views is wasteful, excessive or unwise."
In Mr. McConnell's view, the last Presidential campaign was most remarkable for its great chase after soft money as a loophole strategy to circumvent the reforms of public financing and voluntary spending limits already in place -- strictures that reformers now want to apply to Congress.
"So what happened?" Mr. McConnell asked of the Presidential race. "Candidates took the public money, agreed not to speak too much and then used every trick in the book to get around it."
A total of $250 million in Presidential soft money, triple that of the 1992 race, was spent in addition to the $62 million that the two major Presidential candidates each received in hard money from taxpayers.
Political speech, the Senator insists, "has gone in the soft money direction and that has produced these mega-contributions which tend to get everybody's attention and which I don't particularly like either."
But, far from seeing the rise in political spending as proof of the buying and selling of influence, Mr. McConnell is preparing to argue before his fellow politicians and the nation that money is the root of popular, not special, interest.
"The numbers go up when there's healthy competition," he said, "And we have much healthier political competition than we had five or six years ago."

HEADLINE: NATO TROOPS RAID SERB HARD-LINERS IN A BOSNIAN CITY

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Aug. 20

 BODY:
British soldiers backed by armored vehicles seized six police sites in this city today, effectively wiping out the local power base of Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader who is wanted on war-crimes charges.
The move by the NATO-led force openly pits the 31,000 peacekeepers against the wartime leaders, based in Pale, who still command loyalty among thousands of police officers and wield near-total control of the economy in the Serbian-controlled portion of Bosnia. 
 NATO officials did not say whether they planned any action against the stronghold in Pale. And some expressed concern that today's raid in Banja Luka would incite Dr. Karadzic's supporters to violence.
Bosnia, which seceded from Serbian-dominated Yugoslavia in 1992, consists of a Bosnian Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat federation. The raid, at dawn, split the Bosnian Serb sector into areas controlled by Dr. Karadzic and by his successor as the sector's president, Biljana Plavsic.
Some 350 heavily armed British troops, with American Apache helicopter gunships hovering overhead, burst unannounced into the boxy Banja Luka police headquarters, the police academy, a special police barracks and three district police stations.
The troops swiftly herded unarmed Bosnian Serb policemen in blue uniforms from the buildings. There was no resistance.
The decision to take over police installations, confiscate truckloads of weapons from Karadzic supporters and build a police force loyal to Mrs. Plavsic adds up to a far more muscular, interventionist role for the NATO-led forces.
"It's a gamble," said a senior United Nations official, "and a very risky one. We have cut the enclave into two factions, and we don't yet know how all this will play out. We cannot rule out violence."
The outside world has expressed support for Mrs. Plavsic in her campaign against Dr. Karadzic, whom she accuses of rampant corruption and mismanagement, including pocketing tens of millions of dollars from the sale of cigarettes and gasoline.
Despite having formally relinquished power, Dr. Karadzic retains an iron grip on the Bosnian Serb republic. Western officials agree that as long as he wields influence behind the scenes, there is little chance for progress toward fulfilling the requirements of the Dayton peace accords, which ended the war in Bosnia in late 1995.
Under the agreement, Bosnia was to become a loose federation with joint institutions that would permit refugees to return to their homes and would bring war criminals to justice.
Instead, Bosnia remains partitioned into hostile Serbian, Croatian and Muslim enclaves. In the Serbian enclave, refugees have been almost entirely prevented from returning, and war criminals move freely.
Among the NATO-led force -- including about 8,000 Americans -- which is to withdraw from Bosnia next spring, there is a growing sense of urgency to make the peace work. The peacekeeping troops, although they arrested a Bosnian Serb war-crimes suspect in July and shot another who resisted arrest, have largely taken a passive role until today.
They were accompanied on their sweep by about 50 unarmed United Nations international police monitors, who spent the day hauling away rocket launchers, boxes of new sniper rifles, 800 hand grenades and dozens of assault rifles that had been delivered to the police stations in the last two days, the monitors said.
Capt. Bob McConnachie, a British explosives expert, was unloading the confiscated ordnance this afternoon at the main British base outside Banja Luka. On the asphalt in front of him lay rocket-propelled grenades, hand grenades, booby-trapped books and clocks, heavy machine guns and anti-personnel mines.
"This is enough for about 2,000 heavily equipped troops," he said. "We were all stunned by the enormity of the weapons being stockpiled. It looks like they had started a small explosives factory, and there were boxes of new sniper rifles and assault rifles. This isn't the kind of stuff used in normal police duties."
The weapons, Mrs. Plavsic said tonight, "were meant to be used against us, against all who opposed the Pale leadership. These people in Pale wanted bloodshed."
Disarming the police by no means ends the threat they pose. Bosnia is awash with weapons, and the forces loyal to Dr. Karadzic have ample arsenals at their disposal.
The decision to move against the police stations was made late Tuesday night by Mrs. Plavsic and Robert Gelbard, the United States envoy to the region, in a meeting in Banja Luka.
Although Mrs. Plavsic has been little more than a figurehead President, she now appears able to secure a real power base in Banja Luka with NATO assistance.
The Karadzic-controlled state television in Pale tonight led its news broadcast with a blistering attack against Mrs. Plavsic, saying she had staged a coup. It called the NATO-led peacekeeping troops "an occupation force."
The Bosnian Serb cabinet, dominated by Dr. Karadzic's supporters, compared Mrs. Plavsic to Mussolini.
"These events can be considered a state coup," the broadcast said. "They are much more than that actually, because now it is obvious that what is at work is an attempt at foreign occupation with the help of domestic collaborators."
American officials say they are ready to hand Mrs. Plavsic some $9 million in aid for the area around Banja Luka that she now controls. By backing her in the current power struggle, international officials hope to push Dr. Karadzic to the margins and carry out the Dayton accords. They have hinted that he may soon be captured and turned over for trial in the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague.
But Mrs. Plavsic is an odd ally of the West. She was a zealous supporter of the war and the effort to annihilate the Muslims in Sarajevo, Bosnia's capital, arguing that they belonged to an inferior civilization that should be eradicated.
She is a deeply religious woman who has strong backing from the Serbian Orthodox Church, one of the institutions that championed the Serbian campaign that left more than 200,000 dead and more than a million Muslims homeless. When she was appointed to run for President by Dr. Karadzic, she was described by a senior United States official as a "stooge."
She says that she only wants to "protect the Serb republic" and that a wealthy clique of warlords in Pale is destroying the enclave by taking money that should be used to pay teachers, hospital employees and government officials.
She does not speak to her Bosnian Serb followers about letting Muslim and Croat refugees return or carrying out other controversial aspects of the Dayton agreement.
Mrs. Plavsic called earlier this month for elections in an attempt to replace the Karadzic-controlled Bosnian Serb assembly, which refused to endorse her call to dismiss the hard-line Interior Minister, Dragan Kijac, a close ally of Dr. Karadzic.
The assembly ignored her demand, and on Friday the Bosnian Serb Constitutional Court ruled against her call for new elections.
The decision to take over the police stations started out Sunday as an effort to curb the excesses of Mrs. Plavsic and her supporters.
On Sunday a well-equipped special police unit loyal to Mrs. Plavsic occupied the main Banja Luka police headquarers, saying there was evidence that the police were tapping the President's phones and had intimidated the members of the Constitutional Court. This was later confirmed by NATO officials who said they had found hundreds of audio and video surveillance tapes.
NATO forces moved in on Sunday afternoon, stripped the police unit of its weapons and expelled it from the building.
International officials said more than 100 pro-Karadzic police officers quickly arrived in Banja Luka and seized control of the main police station, which tonight was in the hands of NATO troops and a few police officers loyal to Mrs. Plavsic.

HEADLINE: Cambodian Ruler Demands Ouster of U.N. Rights Team

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 20

 BODY:
After promising that international groups could work freely in his country, the Cambodian leader, Hun Sen, struck a decidedly more confrontational tone today and asked the United Nations to replace its human rights team in Phnom Penh.
In a radio broadcast in Cambodia, Mr. Hun Sen demanded an apology from the United Nations for reporting that his forces had executed at least 40 supporters of Prince Norodom Ranariddh, whom Mr. Hun Sen unseated as his co-Prime Minister in a violent coup in July. 
 In his address, he went on to criticize the United States for calling the ouster of Prince Ranariddh undemocratic, and reached back to the Vietnam War years to taunt Washington.
"Don't be proud of yourself that you are a democracy and have human rights and freedom when you dropped bombs on our heads," he said, according to a translation of his speech by Reuters.
And he also criticized Asian leaders for meeting with Prince Ranariddh, and said that he was not prepared to wait until after an election in Cambodia next year to join the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a group that deferred action on Cambodia's membership after the coup.
Earlier, in the days immediately after the coup when he was trying to win outside support for his actions, Mr. Hun Sen had promised diplomats and foreign governments that human rights groups would be free to work in Cambodia.
Today at the United Nations, Juan Carlos Brandt, a spokesman for Secretary General Kofi Annan, said that the organization's human rights monitor for Cambodia hoped to meet with Mr. Hun Sen in Phnom Penh in the next few days to discuss the issue. The monitor, Thomas Hammarberg of Sweden, has condemned the coup and accused Mr. Hun Sen of ruling by "fear and intimidation."
Mr. Hammarberg is in the process of compiling a report on the human rights situation in Cambodia for the next session of the General Assembly, which opens in mid-September.
Mr. Hun Sen's more belligerent tone follows a visit to Beijing last week, where he failed to win the approval of Cambodia's monarch, Norodom Sinhanouk, for the appointment of Ung Huot, the former Foreign Minister, to replace Prince Ranariddh, the King's son, as First Prime Minister.
In a statement circulated Tuesday to Cambodians abroad, the King, who has been under medical treatment in China since the beginning of the year, announced that he planned to return to Cambodia by the end of August to take up residence at Siem Reap, near the ancient temples of Angkor and "far from the politicians in Phnom Penh."
The King has traditionally been a unifying and influential, if powerless, figure in Cambodia. Diplomats say that it is hard to predict at this point what effect his return will have.
In recent weeks, Mr. Hun Sen has been trying to shore up support in diplomatic missions abroad by staffing them with supporters. At the United Nations, an important mission for the Cambodians, who are dependent on foreign aid for half their national budget, a standoff continues between the head of the mission, Ambassador Sisowath Sirirath, also a prince but from a different branch of the royal family, and Ouch Borith, formerly his deputy and a Hun Sen supporter, who is attempting to unseat him.
The case is an unusual one for the General Assembly credentials committee, which may be asked to decide which faction can claim recognition.
Until the events of July, Mr. Hun Sen and the Prince shared power as co-Prime Ministers in an arrangement worked out with the help of the United Nations. The dispute, then, is neither a peaceful transfer of power, after which ambassadors are often routinely replaced, nor the complete overthrow, when a new government simply claims the seat.
The challenge from Cambodia on human rights comes on the heels of similar confrontations with Congo, formerly named Zaire, and Burundi over the presence of international monitoring teams.
Human rights groups and some diplomats are critical of Secretary General Annan for allowing the new leader of Congo, Laurent Kabila to veto the choice of the monitor for a United Nations team assembled to investigate reports of massacres by Mr. Kabila's troops during the war that brought him power.
Soon after, Pierre Buyoya, who seized power a year ago in Burundi, which borders Congo, also began criticizing the United Nations human rights team there.
Today, the United Nations announced in Geneva that a new team, composed of Atsu-Koffi Amega, a former Supreme Court judge from Togo; Andrew Chigovera, Deputy Attorney General of Zimbabwe, and Reed Brody, an American with experience on other United Nations missions, would go to Congo on Aug. 23.
In Cambodia, there were problems two years ago after the United Nations Center for Human Rights was established in Phnom Penh, the first of its kind anywhere. Some Cambodian politicians wanted it closed, but the dispute was resolved and the center has gained considerable authority, most recently as the main channel for the reporting of abuses after the July coup.
Officials at the center have also compiled information on the high-ranking Khmer Rouge officials who have defected to Mr. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party, a left-wing organization formed by former Khmer Rouge members in the 1970's. Mr. Hun Sen justified his overthrow of Prince Ranariddh by asserting that the Prince's royalist party was making deals with the Khmer Rouge.

HEADLINE: Adapting to Fees for Enjoying Public Lands

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: GOOSE PRAIRIE, Wash.

 BODY:
It still costs more to catch the latest action film at the local octoplex than to launch a boat under a volcano in Northern California, watch brown bears paw at salmon in Alaska or stroll along the Trail of the Ancients at the Anasazi Heritage Center in Colorado. But for the first time, most of America's natural wonders are no longer free.
From the White Mountains of New Hampshire to the William O. Douglas Wilderness area here in the Cascade Mountains, the backpacker trails, wildlife refuges and historic sites on more than 500 million acres of American public land now come with an admission price. 
 As of this summer, it costs $6 a car to catch the view from 14,000 feet on the highest paved road in North America in the Arapaho National Forest of Colorado, $8 a head to visit Mount St. Helens in this state and $3 a day to hike in the Sandia Mountains east of Albuquerque, N.M.
But while some people complain about an admission charge to enjoy land where logging, grazing and mining are still heavily subsidized by the Federal Government, most recreational users seem willing to pay something for using public land, according to preliminary surveys across the country.
In national parks, most of which have long charged admission fees, there has been a 5 percent increase in visitors thus far this year over last, despite a doubling of fees at some of the most popular sites and the introduction of fees at some areas that were previously free.
It is on Forest Service land, wildlife refuges and the arid country managed by the Bureau of Land Management -- the big open land that was always free to visitors -- that Federal officials most feared a backlash to the new pay-per-see policy that is being tried out for the next three years.
The idea of charging $4 a head to watch buffalo chew grass in the National Bison Range in Montana, for example, struck some people as a violation of the home-on-the-range spirit of public land.
Free use of public land is the essence of the American West, some critics of the new policy have said.
As Bill Hall, a popular columnist for The Tribune of Lewiston, Idaho, wrote recently: "A river that belongs to everyone should not have an admission charge. That's like charging people a fee to use their own homes."
Most of the money from the new fees goes into funds to maintain the sites where the fees are being collected, and for that reason, random interviews indicate, people seem not to mind having to pay.
There have been some protests, mainly by local people who are used to treating the public land in their backyards as an extension of their own property. The word "tax" has been scrawled onto posted notices of the new fees.
It costs $14 a night to camp at Russell Pond in the White Mountain National Forest in New Hampshire, and $5 to use the pond, a source of some complaints. "In a state with a slogan like 'Live Free or Die,' we have had some trouble," said Greg Super, a recreation economist with the Forest Service.
The Government decided to charge for using public land after millions of people discovered what a bargain such lands were -- the last best free place -- straining the maintenance budgets supposed to maintain them. With little hope of receiving an increase in their financing, the agencies embraced the idea of having the people who use the lands most pay for their upkeep, an idea backed both by the Clinton Administration and Congress.
Though the land agencies still devote the bigger portions of their budgets to subsidizing logging, grazing and mining, recreational users are the biggest users of public land.
Last year, for example, the Forest Service recorded 829 million visits to the 191 million acres run by the agency, an all time high. The Park Service, Bureau of Land Management and Fish and Wildlife -- the three other agencies that are part of the fee experiment -- also registered a record volume of visitors.
Human-powered outdoor recreation is a $40 billion business. The Forest Service now claims its land is used for 75 percent of the gross domestic product of that industry, providing the destination for skiing, hunting, fishing, hiking, mountain-biking, bird watching and camping.
"We have suffered from a public perception that all we're really about is timber-cutting," said Jim Lyons, the Under Secretary for natural resources at the Agriculture Department, which runs the Forest Service. "Timber is not the agenda of the future. Recreation is."
Still, many outdoor users chafe at paying user fees when Congress has authorized spending another $200 million for subsidized road-building into national forests on behalf of the timber industry.
"People accept these new user fees, but that vote to continue building new roads for loggers really ticked off a lot of our members," said Dan Nelson, a spokesman for the Washington Trails Association, which represents 4,000 backpackers.
But the Government agencies say their future is with the users of public land, despite Congressional loyalty to timber and grazing interests. The Bureau of Land Management, for example, has just begun to charge for use of such areas as the slick-rock canyons around Moab, Utah, known as the mountain-biking mecca of the world.
In this, the first full year of the fee experiment, the bureau expects to take in $3.8 million from recreational users -- on just a handful of sites -- compared with the $13.9 million it collects from ranchers who graze livestock on nearly 150 million acres of the agency's land. The Forest Service expects to collect about $13 million in user fees this year, and the Fish and Wildlife Service projects taking in $2.5 million.
At the end of the three years, Congress will decide where to go with the program. It could be ended, expanded or modified. The money is a drop in the bucket in the overall budget of all the public land agencies. But because a full 100 percent of the fees collected by the Bureau of Land Management and 80 percent of those collected by the Forest Service and Fish and Wildlife are supposed to go back into the sites where they were collected, the money can have a big impact in certain overused areas. In some places, a working toilet is a sea change.
"When we first announced this, there was a very strong reaction against it," Mr. Lyons said. "At Flaming Gorge near the Wyoming border, for example, they nearly tarred and feathered the rangers and ran them out on a rail. But after the docks there were fixed up, people really came around."
Most of the fees are no more than $5. In the Northwest, the Forest Service sells a season pass, good for all national forests in the region, that costs $30. It can be bought at outdoor stores like Recreational Equipment Inc. in Seattle, where the Forest Service and National Park Service now have employees amid the backpacks and espresso machines.
One of the higher entry fees is for the main Forest Service road to Mount St. Helens, where it costs $8 a head to enter the visitor center near the volcano, which blew up in 1980. For a family of four, that is a $32 Sunday drive for what used to be free. In other places, the new fee structure can be somewhat confusing. A hiker entering Olympic National Park from an adjacent Forest Service road, for example, has to pay $3 to one agency for use of the parking lot and then $2 for a back-country permit, $10 for entering the park and $5 for a processing fee.
"Olympic National Park seems to be going out of its way to make people mad at them," Mr. Nelson said.
Still, a review of the major recreation sites around the country shows that visitor use is increasing, rather than decreasing, in most of the new fee areas. The exceptions are Yellowstone, Yosemite and Grand Canyon National Parks, where the carload fee has doubled to $20. Park officials attribute the decline to a drop in foreign visitors, kept away by the high dollar.
"Over all, the whole experiment is a home run," Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said. "It has exceeded our best expectations."
Beyond the criticism of some people who believe that their taxes already pay for public land, there is also some concern that Forest Service rangers, trained in biology and land management, have taken on more duties as fee collectors, spending their hours as Smokey the Cop in pursuit of scofflaws.
"The only time people see our green now is when we put a ticket on their cars," said a Forest Service ranger in New Hampshire.
As fee enforcers, though, rangers and wildlife agents have proved to be a soft touch so far this year. Here at the trailhead of the William O. Douglas Wilderness, where it costs $5 to park at the base of a trail that climbs to stunning views of Mount Rainier, every single car in the dusty lot one weekend was given a yellow ticket for failure to display a stub showing that the fee had been paid. The notice, a warning only, reminded hikers that it now costs to enter the place where Mr. Douglas, a Supreme Court Justice, roamed as boy. Repeat violators can be fined $100.
"We're not into being law enforcers," said Mr. Super of the Forest Service. "Mostly, we're just giving out warning tickets. We tell people it's still free to fish, hunt and hike in the woods, but the parking lot will cost you."

HEADLINE: State Plan for Con Ed Deal Would Cut Rates More

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 20

 BODY:
State utility regulators signaled today that they intend to lower electric rates for residences and small businesses in New York City and Westchester County by as much as 6 to 7 percent, or about double the savings included in a proposed agreement with the Consolidated Edison Company.
Members of the State Public Service Commission, which governs the utility industry and has the power to set rates, said they wanted to make a number of changes in the proposed agreement for a sweeping restructuring of the state's largest power supplier. 
 The deal would, over five years, open to competition the region that Con Ed has held as a monopoly, much as long-distance telephone companies compete for customers. Commission members said they wanted the pact revised to allow for competition more quickly, saying it will produce much lower rates in the long run.
The proposed agreement would divide Con Ed into separate companies -- one for power generation, one to own and maintain the system of wires and one as a retail power provider -- though they would be owned by a single holding company.
States across the country are breaking down the traditional utility monopolies, allowing wholesale electric and gas companies to enter the retail market and for neighboring retail companies to compete in each other's markets.
The proposed agreement, reached in March between the commission's staff and Con Ed, came under fierce attack from consumer and environmental groups. The commission's proposals today were meant in part to blunt the charge that the deal did not do enough for consumers, but the commissioners said little about the environmental concerns, leaving it unclear how they will be resolved.
"I think it's clear that there are specific concerns that the commissioners have," said the chairman, John F. O'Mara, as he directed the commission staff to renegotiate aspects of the deal with Con Ed. He said a new proposed agreement should be ready by Aug. 29, to be voted on by the commission on Sept. 10.
Joan S. Freilich, a senior vice president of Con Ed, said she was confident an agreement could be reached that would satisfy the commission.
The March pact called for an immediate 25 percent electric rate reduction for large industrial customers. Large commercial users like office buildings and hospitals would get a 10 percent reduction, phased in over five years, and residents and small businesses would get a 3.3 percent drop, also phased in over five years.
Commission members said favoring large businesses was necessary to promote economic development and protect jobs, but consumer groups, like the American Association of Retired Persons and the New York Public Interest Group, objected.
While the four members of the commission all said today that they wanted to narrow the disparity, they did not say by how much.
But they did discuss taking about $350 million that Con Ed had hoped to gain through accounting maneuvers and committing that to consumer savings, a figure that industry analysts said would translate to about an additional 3 percent residential and small business reduction, for a total of 6 to 7 percent.
But consumer advocates, who had said the agreement should provide at least a 10 percent reduction for ordinary consumers, said they were still dissatisfied.
Environmental groups attacked the earlier agreement in part because it greatly reduced the amount of money Con Ed would have to spend on energy efficiency programs, like advising businesses how to use less power and providing rebates for buying energy-efficient appliances. The state has already allowed the program to be cut by about half, from a high of $125 million in 1993, and the proposed deal would have dropped it to $6 million in 1999.
The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, has negotiated a deal with Con Ed to increase that commitment to an average of $37 million a year over the next three years, which could mean a somewhat smaller rate reduction, and the plan requires commission approval. The commissioners said little about the efficiency programs today, and nothing about the proposed deal with the Defense Council.
"We remain very concerned that there's not the support for energy efficiency that we would like from the commission," said Ashok Gupta, an economist with the group.
Other environmental groups did not approve the agreement with Con Ed, because they did not think it went far enough. They noted that several other states that are going through the restructuring process, including New Jersey, Massachusetts and California, have required much larger investments in energy efficiency.

HEADLINE: Defying Israel, Arafat Embraces Islamic Militants

BYLINE: By JOEL GREENBERG 

DATELINE: GAZA, Aug. 20

 BODY:
Defying Israeli and American demands that he crack down on Islamic militants, Yasir Arafat kissed and applauded leaders of the Hamas and Islamic Holy War movements today and warned that Palestinians were prepared to resume their violent revolt against Israel.
At a conference of Palestinian factions here, Mr. Arafat returned to the combative language of the seven-year uprising against Israeli occupation, which ended in 1994 with the beginning of Palestinian self rule. 
 "There was an uprising for seven years," Mr. Arafat told the conference, which he called to protest the policies of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. "Who did it? The lion cubs, our children -- this glorious uprising. Seven years. We can erase and do it again from the beginning. There is nothing far from us. All options are open to us."
As he has many times in his career, Mr. Arafat was fighting on several fronts at once.
His remarks came just days after Dennis B. Ross, the American mediator, prodded him to renew security cooperation with the Israelis and take action against Hamas and other hard-line Islamic groups that have carried out terrorist bombings in Israel. Mr. Arafat met Tuesday with the head of Shin Bet, the Israeli domestic security agency, as he began to comply with that request.
But at today's session in Gaza, called the National Unity Conference to Confront the Challenges, Mr. Arafat was lining up support from a broad array of factions, including the militant Islamic groups who favor a more confrontational stance toward the Israelis. The Islamic groups said they saw the meeting as a means of resisting the crackdown by the Palestinian Authority that Israel and the United States are demanding.
[In Washington, senior American officials were dismayed by Mr. Arafat's remarks. "It simply makes an already difficult situation more difficult," one official said. "We have a crisis of confidence, so no party should do or say things that undermine confidence about a peaceful resolution of their differences."
[James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said the United States remained convinced that Mr. Arafat's would carry out his pledge to cooperate with the Israelis against terrorism. "We are going to judge, in the area of security cooperation and anti-terrorist cooperation, Chairman Arafat by deeds," he said. "Deeds are the coin of the realm when it comes to fighting terrorism."]
Today's conference in Gaza was significant because it marked the first time Islamic Holy War, a militant group that operates primarily in Gaza, had joined a meeting of Palestinian factions under Mr. Arafat's leadership. Unlike Hamas, which has both social programs and a military wing, Islamic Holy War has devoted itself almost exclusively to attacks on Israel.
At the conference, representatives of Hamas and Islamic Holy War, who are political leaders of their organizations, not members of their clandestine military wings, exchanged customary kisses with Mr. Arafat after their speeches.
They said later that their participation in Mr. Arafat's conference did not mean they were renouncing violence, as the Palestinian leader did in reaching an accord with the Israelis. The delegates said they remain implacably opposed to the agreement reached in Oslo in 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
"This is not a conference to support Oslo, but to support the stance of our people against the American and Israeli pressures on the Palestinian Authority to arrest and crack down on the Islamic movements," said Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi, a Hamas leader.
The relationship between Mr. Arafat and the Israeli Government, which had been strained, worsened considerably last month after a suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market on July 30 in which 14 people and the two attackers were killed.
Israel demanded that Mr. Arafat take action against Hamas and Islamic Holy War and it imposed economic sanctions and other punitive measures that the Palestinian leader condemned as a declaration of war against his people.
The measures included closing borders, demolishing houses of Palestinians on the grounds that they were built without permits, and freezing payments of taxes and other money to the Palestinian Authority.
Israel's moves united Palestinians of all political stripes behind Mr. Arafat. Many perceive him as standing up to heavy Israeli and American pressures to suppress the militants.
United States officials have backed the Israeli demands, but they have also urged Israel to rescind economic sanctions that are not directly linked to its security. To ease the economic pressure, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt pledged Tuesday to give the Palestinian Authority $10 million.
Israeli officials criticized Mr. Arafat for inviting Hamas and Islamic Holy War to the Gaza conference, asserting that his invitation of groups responsible for bombings that killed scores of Israelis contradicted his commitment to fight terrorism. Mr. Arafat is "giving the terrorist organizations a stamp of approval," said David Bar-Illan, communications director for Prime Minister Netanyahu.
Mr. Arafat and his aides might think that "appeasing, pacifying and placating these organizations will do the trick," Mr. Bar-Illan added, "but they already tried that, and we found that all this dialogue does is give these organizations the respectability and legitimacy which makes it easier for them to continue their terrorist activity with impunity."
But Tayeb Abdel Rahim, a close aide of Mr. Arafat who was chairman of the conference, rejected the Israeli criticism. "None of the speakers advocated explosions or terrorism," he said. "They all protested the Israeli policy that disregards the peace process. They agreed on a common denominator of rejecting the policy of dictation."
The speakers, apparently following rules agreed upon in advance, did not call explicitly for violence against Israel, but instead urged "resistance," "confrontation" and "struggle" against the Israeli "enemy."
Many called on Mr. Arafat to stop security cooperation and negotiations with the Israelis, and urged a boycott of Israeli products in response to the Israeli border closures. They criticized American officials for what they described as a stance that favors Israel, and they urged Mr. Arafat to resist Israeli "dictates" backed by the Americans to crack down on militant groups.
Mr. Arafat has recently renewed security contacts at the urging of the Americans, and he met on Tuesday with Ami Ayalon, the head of Shin Bet, the Israeli security service. But before the conference delegates he vowed never to submit to Israeli economic and political pressures.
"In the name of our children," he said, "the children of the uprising, I say: No one can humiliate the Palestinian people, no one can defeat the Palestinian people, no one can make our Palestinian people bow!"

New York City Jobs Up by 9,100 in July

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
New York City employment surged higher in July, with 9,100 more jobs than in June. It was the biggest monthly gain since January, and it reversed a short-term trend in which city residents were passed over for jobs in favor of people from the suburbs, according to a report by Alan G. Hevesi, the New York City Comptroller.
In a separate employment report a week ago, Mr. Hevesi said that employment among city residents had fallen by more than 20,000 during the first half of the year, even though 21,900 jobs had been created in that period. The earlier report said that suburban residents were filling most of the new jobs in finance, data processing and other fields that require special skills. 
 Advisers to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said the Comptroller's earlier study was flawed. The Mayor said in a statement that the new data showed that the city "is experiencing sustained and steady job growth."
John Marlin, the Comptroller's chief economist, said about 12,000 more city residents were employed at jobs in the city than in June, meaning that they had not only gained more of the new jobs than suburban applicants but had displaced many suburban workers who had been employed in the city. But he said the July increase reflected a sudden improvement, rather than steady job growth for city residents. THOMAS J. LUECK

Hudson Park's Beginning

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
Construction of the first section of a five-mile-long park along the Hudson River from the Battery to 59th Street will begin in April, state officials said yesterday, as they hired a landscape architect to prepare final drawings for the park's first segment.
The Hudson River Park Conservancy, a subsidiary of the New York State Urban Development Corporation, awarded a $4.4 million contract to Abel Bainnson Butz Landscape Architects, of Manhattan, to prepare blueprints for construction of a 3,300-foot esplanade between Clarkson and Horatio streets in Greenwich Village. Building that segment is expected to cost $46 million, more than half of which will pay for rebuilding three to five rotting piers and shoring up bulkheads. 
 Work will begin once the state has finished construction of the adjacent section of Route 9A.
Of the three companies named as finalists for the contract, Abel Bainnson Butz gave the highest bid, but a conservancy spokeswoman said that the company's experience on Riverbank State Park in Manhattan and on several other New York City parks made it the most qualified. DAVID M. HALBFINGER

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Fell in June, but Not With Asians

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit narrowed markedly in June as exports rebounded to a new record and imports subsided for the first time this year, the Commerce Department reported today.
The decline in the deficit, to $8.2 billion from $9.54 billion in May, followed two sizable increases and reflected what analysts said was the faster growth of the American economy in the spring than had initially been estimated. Stocks rose and the dollar advanced against most leading currencies. Yields on Treasury bonds increased. 
 "This shows a lot of strength," said James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at J. P. Morgan & Company. "The trend in exports is booming," he added, despite the dollar's strength and the lackluster performance of various trading partners whose economies have only begun to revive.
Despite the decline in June, the most recent month for which figures are available, the trade deficit for the first half of 1997 was still about 6 percent larger than in the corresponding period of 1996, though below the level of the first half of 1995.
And while the deficits narrowed with Canada and Mexico, two of the country's biggest trade partners, imbalances with China and Japan increased significantly, prompting fresh expressions of displeasure by the Clinton Administration.
The trend toward widening deficits with Asian countries could increase, economists said, because of economic difficulty accompanying currency crises in several South and South Asian nations.
Nonetheless, the report provided further evidence of the American economy's recent strength, showing that demand for goods and services from overseas was helping to keep growth rolling along.
Indeed, combining the latest trade data with figures showing a larger buildup in inventories than had been thought, analysts now say that the economy probably grew at a rate upward of 3.5 percent in the April-June quarter, perhaps by as much as 4 percent.
That would be considerably above the 2.2 percent pace the Commerce Department estimated at the end of July. If borne out, it could undermine a widely held view that the economy had slowed substantially, as policy makers desired, from a first-quarter growth rate of 4.9 percent, which raised concerns about resurgent inflation.
And if consumer spending revives, as it shows signs of doing, analysts said the Federal Reserve could decide to cool the economy by raising interest rates. On Tuesday, the Fed made no change in rates, apparently preferring to sit tight without clearer evidence of inflation. The next policy meeting is scheduled for Sept. 30.
Today's trade report showed a June deficit nearly $2 billion smaller than had been expected. In addition, the May deficit was revised downward by $700 million from an initial figure of more than $10 billion.
But despite the overall decline, the Clinton Administration continues to be stymied in its efforts to reduce the trade deficits with big Asian nations. "Our trade with China is problematic," Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley said at a briefing. He noted that exports so far this year had risen 3 percent while imports from China jumped 26 percent.
"There is no reason why our products cannot have a higher presence in the Chinese market, as they do in ours," said Mr. Daley, who plans to visit China in October.
June was only the fourth time that the American deficit with China surpassed the deficit with Japan. Major contributors to the China deficit, which was up $500 million to $4.3 billion, were imports of clothing, shoes and toys, the Commerce Department said.
With Japan, the American deficit swelled $500 million to $4.1 billion -- with the imbalance in auto trade, now about $2.5 billion, and in office machines accounting for much of the increase.
Mr. Daley urged Japan to be "more aggressive" in opening its economy and not rely on exports for growth. On Friday, the Administration sent a letter to the Japanese complaining about slow application of an agreement to open the Japanese market to American automotive products.
In contrast to the imbalances with Asians, the United States sold record exports to Mexico, reducing that deficit by $500 million in June, to $1.2 billion. The deficit with Canada, the other partner in the North American Free Trade Agreement, eased $100 million, to $1.4 billion.
Over all, exports climbed nine-tenths of 1 percent, to $78.4 billion, while imports eased seven-tenths of 1 percent from May's record, to $86.6 billion, the report showed.
Analysts were surprised by the lower imports because an earlier report showed a big jump in inventories held by wholesalers for the month. Imported goods tend to enter the country through these middlemen.
About two-thirds of the revision in the May deficit, to $9.5 billion from $10.2 billion, reflected stronger exports, the department's report also showed.
As usual, the June deficit would have been far bigger without surpluses in services and in advanced technology products, of $6.8 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Something Constant in a Procession of Styles

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

DATELINE: WOODSTOCK, N.Y.

 BODY:
DURING his long career, Philip Guston passed through many artistic phases, some better than others. He veered from figuration to abstraction and, in the last 15 years of his life, back to figuration, charting a course that is by now well known. Yet throughout these twists and turns Guston displayed an often startling thematic and artistic consistency.
His consistency is crystal clear in two small but intriguing exhibitions at the Woodstock Artists Association here. One show features a recently rediscovered cache of Gustoniana: a series of illustrations of troops in naval training and workers in a wartime factory commissioned by the United States Navy and Fortune magazine in 1943 (several of the images were published in Fortune in late 1943 and early 1944). Presumed lost, the drawings were discovered four years ago in an old portfolio in an abandoned studio that Guston used when he moved to Woodstock in the late 1940's. 
 These 25 gouaches and drawings are exhibited with a selection of lithographs that Guston made with Gemini G.E.L., a print publisher in Los Angeles, in 1979 and '80, the year he died. The combined effect of these two shows is quite powerful. Formally and psychologically, the late prints echo the earlier drawings to a surprising degree, confirming that although Guston changed, he never really left anything behind; he just kept transforming his lifelong subject, which was life's tensions and conflicts, and increasing the physical immediacy of his style.
Except for the serene rosy-fingered abstractions of the early 1950's -- a crucial hiatus during which Guston gave himself over as never before to the physical pleasures of paint and color -- he depicted these tensions in one form or another nearly all the time. They are visible in monumental figurative works from the late 1930's that borrow from Michelanglo and de Chirico to give his depictions of Ku Klux Klansmen a sinister grandeur. They are also present in the more introspective images of the early 1940's: paintings like "Gladiators" and "Martial Memory," which show children staging mock battles, and "Sancutary," with its anxious, wide-eyed insomniac lying on a rumpled bed.
Similar tensions are present in the commissioned illustrations of 1943. They straightforwardly depict young draftees engaged in the business of becoming soldiers: floating in water while inflating their knotted clothes into makeshift life preservers, jumping overboard in abandon-ship drills, lining up at the open door of a paratrooper plane, or climbing into cockpits with rounds of ammunition slung over their shoulders.
These works are executed in an assured, rather conventional figurative style in keeping with the socially aware realism of the 1930's and 40's (Ben Shahn's, for example). But their main attraction lies in Guston's emotional empathy.
His subjects are grave, brawny men training to kill and keep from being killed, and he captures the quiet, sweaty-palmed terror of their task. For example, an image of G.I.'s wedged together as if on a troop transport shows one soldier looking around while his companions nervously offset their anxieties by smoking, eating or drinking. Of course, these activities would figure repeatedly in Guston's late paintings, which often depict the artist himself chain-smoking and staring at plates of food or bottles of wine.
Formally, the naval-training illustrations seem important to Guston's later work in their frequent repetition of the human figure. Guston's image of the dozen or so trainees floating on their backs during the clothes-inflation drill evokes the piles of heads, clustered on the horizon or drifting among ocean waves, that recur in his works from the 1970's, even before the late lithographs confirm the connection.
In the prints, the repeating bodies of the earlier images -- trainees jumping, showering, sitting or standing in line -- rise to the surface again, not only as heads, but also as piles of shoes or legs. The violent, amputated nature of these images is of course softened by the artist's bumptious, cartoon-flavored style -- a style, like Goya's or Daumier's, that seems implicitly optimistic in its formal power, despite the black humor.
Guston's stylistic peregrinations sometimes earned him the unflattering adjective "opportunistic," especially after his late conversion to Abstract Expressionism. There's something of that in these illustrations, as Guston, the social critic of the 1930's, becomes an unquestioning patriot, enthusiastically depicting the war effort. But it could be argued that most ambition, certainly artistic ambition, is opportunistic. Artists take what they need wherever they find it. With luck and diligence, it leads them to what lies within.
As Guston matured, his themes of social conflict became increasingly internal and specific, turning first psychological and then artistic. Finally his tensions centered on himself, and the existential doubt that was, for him, exemplified by the very act of painting. His war drawings forced him briefly off this track, into the world, where he depicted not children playing at war, but young men preparing for the real thing. But characteristically, he found something to use, and, working in a relatively reportorial, documentary style, continued to lay the foundations for his last, and most lasting statement.

HEADLINE: Keynes the Optimist? Wait, There's a Catch

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Dr. Doom Becomes Dr. Pangloss," Michael M. Weinstein's Aug. 18 Editorial Notebook on the current optimism of economists, brings to mind a passage from John Maynard Keynes.
It was 1932. Things had never been worse. Yet, in a preface to "Essays in Persuasion," Keynes declared that "the Economic Problem, as one may call it for short, the problem of want and poverty and the economic struggle between classes and nations, is nothing but a frightful muddle. . . . For the Western World already has the resources and the technique, if we could create the organization to use them, capable of reducing the Economic Problem which now absorbs our moral and material energies, to a position of secondary importance." 
 Keynes reckoned that "the Economic Problem may be solved, or be at least within sight of solution, within a hundred years."
It is one-half century since enactment of the Keynesian Employment Act of 1946. We have had ups and downs, but never a serious recession. As Mr. Weinstein notes, unemployment is at a seven-year low and inflation at a 30-year low. It begins to look as if Keynes, even if revised, may have been right!
Quite unintentionally, however, the master offered a warning that "the day is not far off when the Economic Problem will take the back seat where it belongs, and that the arena of the heart and head will be occupied, or re-occupied, by our real problems -- the problems of life and of human relations, of creation and behaviour and religion."
Life. Creation. Religion. Hmm? Looking about the world, the thought occurs that we may one day long for the age of the General Strike.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Off as German Bank Reinforces Its Mark Defenses

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the mark yesterday after the German central bank modified its practice on a key money-market rate, giving itself more flexibility to defend the lagging currency. It suffered, too, from slumping American securities markets.
The German bank said it would now set the benchmark securities-repurchase rate on a weekly basis, rather than every two weeks as it has done for the last three years. 
 While the change was not a surprise, it worried currency traders because it meant that the bank could change the rate on shorter notice.
"If the dollar pops up, this is a mechanism to keep people from selling" the mark, said Tom Hoge, a corporate currency trader at the Bank of New York. "They're wringing this out for all they can get."
Concern over higher German rates also intensified after the Ifo Institute of Munich, an influential research center, forecast that the central bank was likely to raise the repurchase rate half a percentage point by early next year.
"The Ifo's report took a little cream off the dollar," said Karl Halligan, chief currency trader at CIC Bank in New York.
Higher interest rates would prop up the mark by making mark-denominated assets more appealing. German central bankers have hinted that they might raise rates to keep the dollar from extending its 20 percent climb against the mark this year.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.8382 marks, down from 1.8567 on Wednesday. The British pound eased to $1.5935 from $1.5940.
The dollar extended its losses as American bonds fell and stocks reversed three days of gains. "The dollar's trading off the back of weak asset markets," Mr. Halligan said.
It also fell against the Japanese yen, settling yesterday at 117.20 yen, compared with 117.75 late Wednesday, dragged down by concern over the American trade deficit with Japan. The Commerce Department reported on Wednesday that the monthly deficit with Tokyo increased 12 percent in June from May.
"The widening trade deficit made people afraid of pushing the dollar to the 120-yen level," said Ben Strauss of Bank Julius Baer.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Confront The Gangsters

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS; A.M. Rosenthal's column will resume shortly.

 BODY:
Late, but far better than never, the United States and its friends are getting serious about the Dayton agreements on Bosnia. They are acting against the Serbian gangsters who waged the genocidal war and have obstructed the peace.
That is the significance of the seizure by NATO-led forces of six police buildings in Banja Luka, the largest city in the Bosnian Serb republic. The soldiers found thousands of weapons stockpiled by police under the control of Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb President charged with genocide and crimes against humanity. 
 The Dayton agreements went into effect in December 1995. For a year and a half after that the peacekeeping forces did nothing to carry out such terms as the right of refugees to return to their homes and the obligation to surrender accused war criminals. Dr. Karadzic, though required by Dayton to leave public life, built up a 3,000-man paramilitary police force and acted more and more openly to block the peace process.
Then, starting last month, came a series of moves that reflected a sharp change in NATO policy. British soldiers arrested one war crimes suspect and killed another who shot at them. Peacekeepers began protecting refugees who returned to their homes, so they would not be driven out by terrorist mobs.
The move against the Karadzic police in Banja Luka was the most dramatic sign of the newly interventionist policy. It put NATO squarely on the side of Biljana Plavsic, the elected President of the Bosnian Serb republic, in her struggle with Dr. Karadzic.
Peacekeeping officials had already endorsed one daring move by Mrs. Plavsic. When the Karadzic-controlled assembly planned to remove her from office, she dismissed the assembly and called new elections for October. Under pressure from Dr. Karadzic -- including a brutal assault on one judge -- the entity's Constitutional Court held the dismissal unconstitutional. But Mrs. Plavsic, with Western support, ignored that ruling.
The logic of the new NATO policy, and of the situation in Bosnia, requires two further steps. The first is to shut down the Karadzic propaganda machine. The second is to arrest Dr. Karadzic.
Television was a crucial instrument in arousing Bosnian Serbs to attack Muslim and Croat neighbors with whom they had lived in peace, many intermarrying. And television from Pale, the Bosnian Serb capital, is one of Dr. Karadzic's main instruments of power today, pouring out messages of hate. Through relay stations across the Serbian entity, it dominates the media audience.
The time has come for the NATO-led force to shut down those relay stations. That is a hard thing for a believer in the First Amendment to say. But we have no more obligation there than we would have had in postwar Germany to let Goebbels stay on the air.
The need for action on the Karadzic propaganda machine is acute because of the assembly election called by Mrs. Plavsic. If the election campaign is dominated by hate messages on Pale television, Mrs. Plavsic -- and NATO -- may lose their gamble.
Because Dr. Karadzic is protected by his paramilitary policemen, his arrest is the hardest challenge for the peacekeeping force. It is also the most important -- and not just because it would make the author of so much evil face justice.
If Radovan Karadzic is at large, Dayton will be at risk: That is the short of it. He has a corrupt economic empire, profiting from control of gasoline and cigarette imports. He controls a mafia. He keeps alive the extreme nationalist dream that led to so much horror in Bosnia.
We speak of a NATO decision on whether to move on Dr. Karadzic. But it is really President Clinton's decision, and it is one of the toughest he has faced. The Pentagon has been planning a possible operation, but hardly with enthusiasm. If the operation goes wrong, military figures will no doubt leak the word that they advised against it.
But a failure to act would exact a heavy price, probably including in time a renewal of the Bosnian war. We have to stay the course, and that means strong action under American leadership. The Economist of London said last month: "If there is a lesson of the past five years, it is that half-hearted, or timorous, Western intervention in Bosnia achieves little."

HEADLINE: AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Collecting;
Strutting Vintage Stuff And Selling It, Too

BYLINE: By KEITH MARTIN 

DATELINE: MONTEREY, Calif.

 BODY:
One weekend each August, this beautiful coastal area can lay claim to some of the most desirable and expensive automobiles in the world. Like a three-day summer camp for car fanatics, the Monterey Historic Weekend, held Aug. 15-17 this year, encompasses many types of classic-car activities, from vintage racing at the Laguna Seca race track to wallet racing at the auctions put on by Christie's auction house and the Rick Cole Auction Company.
"I come to Monterey each year because it has a little bit of everything," said Bruce Russell, a resource coordinator for the Vancouver, Wash., school district and a collector of Italian cars. "I sold some old Ferrari parts on Friday at Concours Italiano, watched the Cobras race on Saturday, tried to buy a Ferrari Testarossa at the Cole auction Saturday night, drooled over the hot rods at Pebble Beach on Sunday morning and eyeballed a couple of cars on Sunday at Christie's." 
 The oldest event of the weekend is the Concours d'Elegance held at the Lodge at Pebble Beach in nearby Carmel. An automotive concours is a beauty pageant for cars; the prize-winners' cars have usually been completely disassembled, made perfect, then painstakingly reassembled to a condition far better than when they were originally built. The Concours d'Elegance, founded in 1951, is acknowledged as one of the world's premier events of its kind.
It is not unusual to see judges wearing white cotton gloves, running their hands along the inside of an engine compartment looking for grime. (Better not try that on your 10-year-old Toyota Camry.) The car judged Best of Show was a 1937 Talbot-Lago T150C Figone et Falaschi Coupe, owned by William E. Connor 2d, of Kowloon, Hong Kong. New this year was a category called Historic Hot Rods: the winner was a classic Ford Highboy roadster built by Doane Spencer in the late 1940's. It is owned by Bruce Meyer of Beverly Hills.
The cars of Carroll Shelby were featured at the 24th annual Monterey Historic Races. Shelby, the former race driver who gained his car-manufacturing fame by putting large, high-output American engines into English chassis and calling the resultant hybrid a Cobra, was there to autograph souvenir programs, hats, tires, dashboards -- nearly anything with a flat surface.
While the daytime competition is on the track, at night the collectors wage war with checkbooks. Rick Cole's annual Monterey Auction of Sports and Classic Cars gave evidence that consumer confidence in the collector-car market is returning. Cole sold 120 of the 163 cars he offered for a rate of nearly 74 percent, for a total take of $5.13 million.
Christie's auction house did even better. Of the 66 cars Christie's offered, 56 sold, or 84 percent, and sales totaled $8.8 million. At both the Cole and Christie's auctions, the cars that captured attention weren't shiny, tarted-up vehicles. Rather, each auction featured an unrestored, original racing car from the 50's.
The Cole auction offered a 1956 Ferrari 500 TR sports racer, discovered by Cole in a suburban Los Angeles garage. Despite its faded paint, crooked grille and dents and dings, the crowd broke into spontaneous applause when the four-cylinder engine was coaxed to life after nearly 40 years in storage. It sold for $455,800 to an American collector.
At Christie's, an unrestored racing 1956 D-Type Jaguar captured the attention of the audience. Purchased by Paul Ketty, of Kent, Conn., in 1967 for $6,500, it had not run for 16 years. The Jaguar's engine bay still had broken hazelnut shells in it, evidence that the local squirrels had taken a liking to this high-performance English racing car. Showing a healthy increase in value since the 1967 purchase, the D-Type brought $1,014,500.
But you didn't have to spend millions to show off your car. I served as master of ceremonies for the Concours Italiano, held at Quail Lodge in Carmel, where anyone could display a beloved Italian car after paying a $25 entry fee. Fantastic $500,000 Ferraris sat side by side with pedestrian $5,000 Fiats.
With more than 450 cars shown, a gate attendance of over 10,000, plus numerous vendor booths selling everything from old car parts to the latest in Italian clothes, Concours Italiano provided the egalitarian moment of the weekend.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Drop as Inflation Fears Revive

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities declined for the second consecutive day yesterday after the release of the minutes of a Federal Reserve meeting in July failed to calm concerns about inflation and the weekly jobless claims report, which still suggested a tight labor market.
The reports did little to ease investors' concerns about inflation and raised fears that the central bank might make a pre-emptory move to raise rates sooner rather than later. In fact, the minutes from last month's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee showed policy makers were slanted toward tightening, said Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, a perception that also weighed on prices. 
 The 30-year bond dropped one full point, to 96 29/32, to yield 6.62 percent, up from 6.54 percent at the close of the New York market on Wednesday; the latest yield is the highest in a week. The price decline means bondholders lost $10 for every $1,000 of face value.
"These last two weeks in August tend to be rather slow -- with many people on vacation -- so market moves are often exaggerated by a lack of liquidity," said Stuart Rinschler, senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data of Boston. "This is probably why today's price movement was generated on such little volume."
He added that several factors gave investors an excuse to sell, including a threat of a strike against Amtrak and disappointment that the Fed had not made a coupon pass. In a pass, the Fed buys various maturities to add money to the banking system.
"Furthermore," Mr. Chan said, "investors received additional confirmation today that the watershed agreement between United Parcel Service and the teamsters' union was not an aberration but rather the beginning of a trend toward higher wages.
"Investors have to realize," he added, "that even though overall wages haven't flared up yet, the risk moving forward is clearly in favor of higher wages."
The bond market came under great selling pressure in the early afternoon as a rumor circulated about an increase in hiring, which would produce an increase in wages.
Among the data released yesterday were the Philadephia Fed's index of regional business activity, which slipped to a reading of 24.3 this month, from 28.1 in July. But that was higher than the 20.9 that had been forecast, suggesting the economy was still moving at a strong clip. The only thing that has prevented the Fed from raising interest rates thus far has been the absence of inflation. This report may have surprised the markets on the amount of business activity and the lack of wholesale and retail price increases.
The last time the Fed adjusted its monetary base and raised short-term rates was on March 25, when it increased the Federal funds rate, the rate banks charge one another for overnight loans, a quarter point, to 5.50 percent.
The Fed released the minutes of its July 1-2 Federal Open Market Committee meeting yesterday, revealing that although it had not raised interest rates, it would do so if inflation appeared to heat up.
Mr. Chan said, "The minutes kept some investors nervous because they suggest that if the Fed remained nervous in July -- when the economy had just completed a period of slower growth -- it would sure be a lot more nervous and anxious to execute a small dose of insurance if the economy reverted again toward a 3 percent-plus growth path."
In the jobless claims report, released yesterday morning, first-time claims increased 20,000, to 337,000, in the week ended Saturday. It was the third gain in as many weeks, but the increase might have been influenced by claims filed by some of the nearly 200,000 workers then on strike against U.P.S.
 Elsewhere, in when-issued trading of new two-year and five-year notes that will be auctioned next week, dealers were offering the two-year maturity at a price to yield 5.91 percent and the five-year at a price to yield 6.15 percent.

HEADLINE: 62 Are Charged in Violence Linked to Kenya's Politics

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MOMBASA, Kenya, Aug. 21

 BODY:
A Kenyan court charged 62 suspects today with robbery and violence during a raid on a police station that began a week of attacks around this port city that some observers said were politically motivated.
Despite the political turmoil, the International Monetary Fund said it was sending a team to Kenya for talks on resuming aid. "To show our goodwill in this respect, I have asked a mission to leave immediately for Nairobi," the Fund's managing director, Michel Camdessus, told reporters in Washington. He said the decision followed a personal appeal from President Daniel arap Moi. 
 The I.M.F. suspended a $205 million, three-year loan to Kenya on July 31 citing concerns over corruption. The World Bank followed suit and delayed disbursements.
Mr. Moi, 73 and in power since 1978, faces elections later this year for which no date has been set. He had accused the I.M.F. of acting on political grounds.
The 62 suspects in Mombasa court were accused of robbing the police station at Likoni on Aug. 13, killing a policeman, stealing weapons including 40 rifles and damaging property.
They were also charged with arson and taking an unlawful oath binding them to kill if called on to do so. The maximum penalty for robbery with violence is death.
The accused included Amir Hamisi Ali Banda, prayer leader of a mosque south of Mombasa, and Ali Said Chidzondo, chairman of the unregistered National African Democratic Union. All denied the charges and were scheduled to appear again in two weeks.
Security forces beat the opposition leader Raila Odinga and damaged his car today when he tried to visit the Likoni police station with other opposition activists, local journalists said.
"One of them hit me with the butt of his gun on the side of my head," Mr. Odinga told reporters."This confirms our fears that the Government has something to hide."
A police spokesman, Peter Kimanthi, said he was unaware of the incident. But he confirmed that the police had shot and killed a man at Tiwi village south of Mombasa on Wednesday. This took the toll from nine days of violence to 40 dead.
Six policemen and seven civilians including five attackers were killed on Aug. 13 in the well-organized attack on the Likoni police station, just south of Mombasa.
Mr. Kimanthi said the police recovered a rifle today and 50 rounds of ammunition and arrested 101 people, taking the number of arrests since Aug. 13 to at least 410.
President Moi and the opposition have blamed each other for fueling tribal tensions on the coast.
Missions of 10 European countries, the United States and Japan welcomed an agreement in principle by Government and opposition to start talks before elections.
"We urge both sides to enter into dialogue in the spirit of compromise and with the commitment to agree on reforms necessary to ensure free and fair elections," they said in a statement.
The attacks on the coast, the center of Kenya's tourism and its top foreign currency earner, have shaken the industry and tour operators say cancellations have increased.
Tourism earned $465 million in 1996 and is Kenya's top employer. About 60 percent of last year's 770,000 tourists went to beaches to the north and south of Mombasa.

HEADLINE: U.S. TELLING RUSSIA TO BAR AID TO IRAN BY ARMS EXPERTS

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 21

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has been quietly pressing Russia for most of this year to stop Russian scientists and military institutes from helping Iran develop a new ballistic missile that could reach Israel, Saudi Arabia and American troops in the Persian Gulf, senior Administration officials say.
The Russian scientists' assistance has continued, officials said, even though President Clinton raised the matter with President Boris N. Yeltsin in private meetings in June at the Denver economic summit. 
 American officials said they have become increasingly frustrated with Russia's inaction, and they note that Vice President Al Gore complained about the Russians' role in the Iranian project as early as February.
Last month Mr. Clinton assigned Frank G. Wisner to be his special envoy for the problem. Mr. Wisner, who had retired from government service after being Ambassador to India, returned last week from a visit to Russia, Israel, Egypt and Britain.He received new assurances from senior Russian Government officials that "it is not Russian policy to support Iran's development of a ballistic-missile capacity," a senior White House official said.
According to the American officials, the assistance to Iran is being provided by institutes and companies that were an integral part of the state-owned military complex of the Soviet Union, which controlled the design, construction and deployment of all missiles, nuclear or otherwise.
Since the breakup of the Soviet Union and the introduction of Russia's semi-market economy, military spending has plummeted, and many of these institutes have sought private contracts and income.
American officials have long been concerned that Russian scientists would sell their specialized knowledge to countries like Iraq and Iran, and have tried to develop cooperative programs to keep such scientists at work, with salaries.
The fact of assistance by Russian scientists to Iran's missile program has been reported before, but the American officials are only now disclosing how persistently, and unsuccessfully, the United States Government has tried to get Russia to stop it.
Deployment of the kind of mid-range ballistic missile the Americans are concerned about could be between two years and five years or more away, depending on how much help Iran gets from Russia and other countries, like China and North Korea, officials and experts said. One major concern is that Iran is also trying to develop nuclear, biological and chemical weapons that can be carried by such a missile.
Russian officials deny that there is any Government policy or program to help Iran develop a ballistic missile or to transfer missile technology to Teheran. They say the Russian Government has adhered to Mr. Yeltsin's 1994 pledge to avoid any further arms sales to Iran. But the Russians have not responded in detail to the American evidence that Russian scientists and institutes are helping Iran anyway.
The United States, by providing detailed material about what help is coming from which institute, wants Moscow to put an end to the assistance by making sure that contracts are canceled and that scientists with special knowledge do not travel to Iran, the officials said.
The Iran missile program was the single biggest issue in Mr. Clinton's meeting with Mr. Yeltsin in late June, the officials say. Mr. Gore raised the matter with Russian Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin in February, and it was also a major topic between Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and the Russian Foreign Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, when they met late last month in Malaysia.
"But despite a range of assurances, the assistance continues," a senior official said. He described it as aid from "a range of institutes and organizations of various types with the necessary expertise," including important help on navigation, guidance and rocket motors dating from the old Russian SS-4 liquid-fuel missile. That missile was developed in the 1950's, deployed in Cuba and finally dismantled under the 1987 American-Soviet treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
Mr. Wisner is expected to return to Moscow in a few weeks for further discussions, leading to another Gore-Chernomyrdin meeting in Moscow in late September. Mr. Gore is deeply involved in the issue as the main proponent of cooperation with Russia on space and commercial missile launches.
The Americans have given the Russians detailed intelligence about what help is being provided "to show them the reasons for our concerns," the senior White House official said. "They're digesting it."
"This is undeniably one of the most important issues we face," the official said.
"The Russians understand our concerns and share them and our interest in restraining this development," he said, pointing out that Russia and could itself be a target.
In 1994, with Mr. Chernomyrdin, Mr. Gore helped broker a deal for Russia to cut back on its sale of rocket engines and technology to India and join the Missile Technology Control Regime, which limits missile exports, in return for American help in winning contracts for commercial launches and for American government money and partnership in space.
That help includes the international space station project and some $400 million in American assistance over four years to the Russian Space Agency for training on Mir, the Russian space station. The larger importance of American-Russian cooperation is one reason that Washington has encouraged the trouble-plagued Mir project, American officials acknowledge.
American companies like Lockheed Martin, which is in a joint venture with a Russian company to market Proton rockets for satellite launches, not only benefit from Russian technology but would also be hurt by a cutoff of the partnership, American officials say.
"But if the Russians aren't keeping to their side of the bargain on missile exports, why should we keep ours?" a Congressional staff member said.
The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, confirming the Wisner trip, said, "We think it's important that the Russians continue to assure us that they are committed to the highest possible nonproliferation standards." He said the talks were "off to a serious start."
Some experts on the issue, like Henry D. Sokolski, executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center and a former Pentagon official in the Bush Administration, say that given the military background of the institutes and companies providing the help, the Russian Government is being disingenuous about its lack of knowledge.
"The 'I'm O.K., you're O.K.' diplomacy has run its course here," he said. "It makes very little sense to argue that the Russian Government doesn't know what's going on."
But another official said: "Are there Russian officials who probably know more than what they're saying, and who are trying to profit from some of these activities? Probably. But the point is that the Russians have made commitments to us, and in the new Russia the export-control system is not perfect. And sometimes timely interventions can make a difference. So we're trying to ascertain what they know and help them to stop it."
Iran already has some shorter-range missiles like the Scud B and an extended-range Scud, sometimes known as the Scud C. But the issue the Americans are concerned about is a large ballistic missile with a range of between 683 miles and 1,243 miles with a capacity of about 3085 pounds, large enough for a crude nuclear warhead or, a much cheaper alternative, a biological or chemical one. The missile being developed is so inaccurate that it can be aimed only at a large target like a city, the officials say, and so can only serve as a "terror weapon."
Iran is working to develop nuclear weapons, but "there is no need to exaggerate the nuclear threat here," said Anthony H. Cordesman, an Iran expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "The throwweight is big enough for biological weapons with the same lethality, and it's not clear a nation has to go the most difficult and expensive route."
Israel has pressed the Clinton Administration on the issue since early this year, providing intelligence that American intelligence agencies easily verified and expanded upon, the officials say. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee has also pushed the issue in a Congress already concerned about China's exports of nuclear and missile technology to Pakistan and Iran.
Howard Kohr, executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, said: "This issue, which Aipac has discussed with Congress and the Administration, has an even greater sense of urgency now and requires top-priority U.S. attention."
Congress is debating an amendment to the foreign operations appropriation bill that would cut off all aid to Russia unless the President can certify that Russia has ceased all nuclear and missile cooperation with Iran. Moreover, Russia continues to honor a contract to help Iran finish a German-begun nuclear power plant at Bushehr, despite American pressure to cancel the work, preventing Mr. Clinton from making that certification, officials acknowledge.
The Senate version, passed this month, would not allow the President to waive the cutoff on national-security grounds. The House version, which is scheduled for the floor in September, would let the President continue half the aid. Senior State Department officials say they will continue to argue to Congress that "rigid legislation will not improve this situation," and that "cooperation with Russia will work a lot better than noise, drama and confrontation."
The Iranians are being very sophisticated, the White House official said. "They're trying to work all the problems, including navigation, propulsion and engines," and they are identifying key institutes, scientists and companies that have what they need and might be willing to sell it.

HEADLINE: Cable Reveals a Combative Serb Leader

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: VIENNA, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Slobodan Milosevic is known in the Balkans for his dismissive manner, and the Serbian leader was in rare form in recent meetings with an American envoy, according to a confidential cable written by a Western diplomat and other accounts of the sessions.
The cable said that Mr. Milosevic showed "absolutely no give" on turning over war-crimes suspects to the international tribunal in The Hague, a key issue for the Clinton Administration. 
 Asked whether he would allow the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe to help keep an eye on elections next month in Serbia, Mr. Milosevic is reported to have replied: "No way. What has the OSCE done for me?"
Mr. Milosevic's dialogue -- held in English with Richard C. Holbrooke, the American architect of the December 1995 Dayton peace accords, and scattered with four-letter words -- gave the impression that he was reverting to his former belligerent stance toward the West, American and other Western officials said. The two major protagonists of the peace accords met for the first time in a year at Mr. Milosevic's ornate villa in Belgrade 10 days ago.
Mr. Holbrooke was dispatched by President Clinton for a four-day tour of Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia to revitalize the sagging accords.
Mr. Holbrooke, who took issue with some of the material in the cable, said that he had won some successes in Bosnia by convincing the authorities there to agree to a common telephone code and by getting them to agree to ambassadors.
Mr. Holbrooke said he was gratified that the Muslim leaders of Bosnia had agreed to an ethnic Serb's being posted to Washington as Bosnia's envoy.
But in Belgrade, Mr. Holbrooke was confronted with an unyielding Mr. Milosevic, who, according to several American officials close to the talks, appeared willing to tough it out.
"He was bidding his price up," said a Clinton Administration official. "He was taking the approach that we need him more than he needs us."
The cable, written after the top American diplomat in Belgrade, Richard C. Miles, briefed Western envoys there, described a one-way atmosphere at the talks, with Mr. Milosevic stonewalling at every turn. The Administration official described the cable as "accurate."
For example, on the subject of Kosovo, the Serbian province where the Clinton Administration has asked Mr. Milosevic to halt abuses against the majority Albanian population, Mr. Milosevic replied, according to the cable: "It is only of interest to a few American Congressmen. We will solve it in our own way."
On the implementation of the peace accords, Mr. Milosevic said the West had to be more "balanced."
Of Biljana Plavsic, the Bosnian Serb leader the Administration is supporting, Mr. Milosevic said, "She is very difficult," and added that she deserved the trouble she was in with other Bosnian Serb officials.
The Administration official said that Serbia's economy is in desperate straits, and that Mr. Milosevic dressed down Mr. Holbrooke over Washington's preventing Serbian access to international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund.
But Mr. Milosevic, formerly the President of Serbia, who recently engineered for himself the title of President of Yugoslavia, did not feel he was so politically threatened at home by the weak economy that he needed to make any concessions on war criminals, several Washington officials said.
In drawing the line on handing over war criminals to the tribunal, Mr. Milosevic told Mr. Holbrooke that the arrest last month of a Bosnian Serb war-crimes suspect in Bosnia and the killing of another had had "negative consequences," one Washington official said.
One of Mr. Holbrooke's priorities was to find a way to get the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, who has been indicted on war-crimes charges, out of Bosnia and, preferably, to The Hague. Mr. Milosevic has considerable control over Dr. Karadzic, Washington officials believe, and pledged a year ago to insure that he disappeared from public life in the Serbian-governed portion of Bosnia.
Mr. Holbrooke, reached at his vacation home in the Hamptons on Long Island in New York, took issue with the reports of Mr. Milosevic's words, saying, "This is ridiculous stuff." He said that Mr. Miles, the American diplomat in Belgrade who had briefed other envoys, had not been at all the meetings and that he would get Mr. Miles "on the carpet" for the way he conducted the briefing, but he did not single out points for dispute.
The cable writer noted that Mr. Miles was piqued that Mr. Holbrooke had excluded him from some of the talks with Mr. Milosevic, which took place one evening and one morning.
On the question of the war-crimes suspects, Mr. Holbrooke said: "There was a very long discussion. Miles wasn't present."
On the implementation of the Dayton accords, Mr. Holbrooke said Mr. Milosevic's "rhetoric" had been the usual, and that his words were no different than in the past.
On Kosovo, Mr. Holbrooke said the cable writer "got it right" but that Mr. Milosevic "always says that stuff" regarding Kosovo. He said that 90 percent of the discussion about Ms. Plavsic was "out of Miles's hearing."

HEADLINE: Clinton Met Campaign Donor To Discuss a Trade Dispute

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 21

 BODY:
The White House acknowledged today that President Clinton met last summer with the chairman of the Federal Express Corporation, whose company was a major donor to Democrats and Republicans in last year's campaign and who was seeking a far tougher stance against Japan in a long-running trade dispute involving air cargo.
But officials said Mr. Clinton declined the chairman's request for immediate sanctions, which the Administration's economic advisers had decided would be counterproductive in a complex negotiation involving a number of civil aviation issues. 
 The meeting between the President and the executive, Frederick W. Smith, reported in The Washington Post today, occurred at Mr. Smith's request, Administration officials said. He was angry because the Clinton Administration was reluctant to retaliate after several years of inconclusive negotiations.
A year after that meeting, the Administration is still negotiating, and, while it has periodically threatened sanctions, it has never invoked them.
The meeting is likely to draw the scrutiny of Congressional committees investigating campaign finance issues because Mr. Smith's name appears on a list of executives, prepared by the Democratic National Committee in the spring of 1996, whom Mr. Clinton was asked to call seeking donations. Mr. Clinton apparently tried to reach Mr. Smith by telephone in April, four months before the meeting, but did not succeed.
In August, however, Mr. Smith succeeded in arranging a meeting with the President. The meeting occurred despite the fact that Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairman of the National Economic Council, had argued earlier that direct contact between the President and Mr. Smith on the Japan dispute would be a waste of the President's time.
"We all knew that Fred wanted to take his case up with the President directly," Ms. Tyson said in a telephone interview today. "And while we thought he had a legitimate trade complaint, most of us did not agree with the tactics he advocated."
"In the end," Ms. Tyson said, "Fred got his meeting, and the President followed the advice of his policy advisers, not Federal Express." Ms. Tyson said she had not been present at the meeting and had not known of it in advance.
Lanny J. Davis, special White House counsel, said: "We regard the meeting with Mr. Smith as entirely appropriate on an issue that was of longstanding interest and concern to this and prior Administrations. Any suggestion that the President's interest in this issue has anything to do with a campaign contribution is utterly baseless."
Federal Express officials said today that the company's donations to the Democrats last year totaled $506,000. Its donations to the Republican Party, they said, were $540,000. Mr. Smith endorsed President George Bush in the 1992 campaign and was harshly critical of Mr. Clinton then.
A company spokesman, Bill Margaritas, said that Federal Express "makes balanced allocations to Democrats and Republicans" and that it "uses all available channels to make known its views on trade and other subjects."
"But there is no connection between contributions and the meeting," he said.
The issue that prompted the meeting between Mr. Smith and Mr. Clinton dates from 1993 and has been a source of tension and high-level discussions with Tokyo. At issue are the cargo company's rights to fly packages from Japan to other Asian nations, often through the company's relatively new hub at Subic Bay in the Philippines. It is a place Mr. Clinton knows well: just after the election was over in November, the President attended a summit meeting of Asian leaders that was held at Subic Bay, site of a huge American military base that was closed in 1992.
Federal Express argues that under a 1952 aviation agreement with Japan, it has a right to compete in cargo transportation throughout Asia, shipping goods through Japanese airports. Japanese officials have interpreted the treaty differently, and insisted on more landing rights for Japanese passenger flights to the United States and a scrapping of the 1952 accord, reached as Japan was emerging from the shadow of American occupation.
Long before the Presidential campaign geared up, the issue was at the top of Washington's trade agenda. It was one of the first issues that Mr. Clinton raised with Japan's Prime Minister at a 1995 meeting in Halifax, Nova Scotia. At various times over the last three years, including a month before the Oval Office meeting, the Department of Transportation has publicly threatened to retaliate against Japanese airlines unless restrictions on Federal Express are relaxed. But the State Department has opposed such a step -- arguing that there are broader interests in relations with Japan -- and so far its view has prevailed.
Ten weeks ago Japan approved several new routes for Federal Express, but refused to relax the overall restrictions on flights between Tokyo and the rest of Asia. Negotiations are scheduled to resume next week in Washington over further openings in the air market.
But as Mr. Clinton almost certainly knew when he met Mr. Smith in the Oval Office, the issue of how to help Federal Express is a complicated one. If sanctions resulted in countersanctions, the first victims would likely be United Airlines, American Airlines and Northwest Airlines, all of which have passenger routes between the United States and Japan.

HEADLINE: Fed Unanimous on Steady Rates in July

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 21

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers were unanimous in holding the overnight bank lending rate steady at their midyear review July 1-2, minutes of the session that were released today showed.
At its latest meeting on Tuesday, the Federal Open Market Committee also refrained from altering monetary policy. Minutes of that session will be released Oct. 2, after the committee's Sept. 30 session. 
 The committee, which sets the Fed's interest rate policy, meets eight times a year. Deliberations are held in secret. Minutes are released several weeks later.
The committee voted 10 to 0 in July to leave the Federal funds target -- what banks can charge each other for overnight loans -- at 5.5 percent, amid signs the economy was cooling after growing rapidly in the first quarter.
The minutes showed that the panel also maintained a bias in favor of raising the interest rate target, if need be, to guard against inflation.
The committee last raised the target a quarter-point on March 25, expressing concern that the economy's rapid growth could translate into accelerated inflation. Since then, the economy has grown at a more subdued pace, while producer prices have fallen for seven consecutive months and consumer prices are rising at the slowest pace in more than a decade.

HEADLINE: In Hospital, Immigrant Gives Views On Brutality

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
His name has been invoked by street protesters and mayoral candidates. He has been the focus of outraged editorials and national news coverage. For many immigrant and minority New Yorkers, he is the latest victim of a criminal-justice system that is too often a foe, not a protector.
But at the center of this storm, Abner Louima's main concerns are more immediate, and more ordinary. When will his body stop hurting, and when can he leave the hospital? When will he be able to go to the bathroom normally? When will his wife stop crying? 
 "When I see my family in pain, I have to stay strong," Mr. Louima said yesterday as he lay with tubes stuck on his side.
Not that Mr. Louima, the 30-year-old Haitian immigrant who prosecutors say was brutalized by police officers from the 70th Precinct in Flatbush, Brooklyn, is unaware of the larger issues his plight has raised.
"What keeps me going is that even if I don't get anything out of this, that my children can grow up in a new society -- a society where no one else is victimized like I was," he said, speaking in Creole. "I believe there are other victims who are either ashamed to come out or did not know how to speak out for themselves."
The nature of the charges -- prosecutors say police officers who arrested Mr. Louima in a scuffle outside a nightclub beat him and then, in the station bathroom, shoved the handle of a toilet plunger into his rectum and his mouth -- has stirred widespread anger. But Mr. Louima's voice, soft and weak, seemed to reflect more pain and weariness than anger.
"The best way to apply anger is to go to the march," Mr. Louima said, referring to a protest planned for Aug. 29 by the Haitian-American Alliance and a coalition of other community organizations. "It will send a strong signal to people in charge that we deplore police brutality. Hopefully that will not happen again."
"It's intolerable," Mr. Louima said quietly. "I think everyone should be an advocate against police brutality."
A quiet and unassuming man, Mr. Louima is an unlikely candidate for political symbolism. He is the oldest of four children who grew up in Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, where their father was a tailor. In the early 1980's other family members left Haiti for New York, uprooted by the political trouble of the Caribbean nation.
But Mr. Louima stayed to complete his education, receiving a degree in electrical engineering from the Ecole Nationale des Arts Metiers.
He rejoined his family in Brooklyn in 1990, married in 1994 and settled into a typical immigrant's life: working nights and weekends as a security guard, and helping raise his 1-year-old son, Abner Jr. (His 7-year-old daughter remained in Haiti with her mother when he emigrated.)
Even before the events of recent days, he said, he had also endured an immigrant's hardships. "Haitians have to come to the United States to really appreciate their country," said Mr. Louima, who said he hopes to write a book about his ordeals. "When you come here you have to endure humiliation and other indignities, like people calling you all kind of racist names. In Haiti, with all of the troubles, you are respected as a human being."
Still, he said, the lack of economic opportunities back in Haiti makes it difficult or impossible for most people like him to think of returning.
Mr. Louima spoke in an hourlong interview at his bedside at Brooklyn Hospital Center, where he is protected by two plainclothes officers. A Bible sat on a lamp table surrounded by flowers sent by friends and strangers.
But on the advice of his lawyers and family members, Mr. Louima would not discuss details of the events outside the Rendez-Vous nightclub, where he was arrested after a melee, nor what happened inside the precinct station house.
He did not address some politically charged aspects of the case, including his assertion, stated by his lawyers, that one of his police attackers said, "This is Giuliani time, not Dinkins time" as they assaulted him.
The criminal investigation continues and Mr. Louima's lawyer, Sanford A. Rubinstein, has said he will file a civil lawsuit against the city.
While Mr. Louima said he would forgive the men accused of torturing him, he said he was not so sure what he would tell them if they were to meet. He said he would not ask them why they beat him so savagely or what he did to deserve it. To him, it does not matter.
"It's been done," said Mr. Louima, who has undergone surgery twice for a torn bladder and other injuries and will probably be hospitalized another month or more. "Right now that's not important." Doctors say it is still unclear when or if he will regain normal bowel function.
Mr. Louima, like most Haitian immigrants who came here fleeing political turmoil or economic hardship, said he had always wanted to stay as far away as possible from the police and other authorities. And for more than six years, he had done just that.
But early on Saturday, Aug. 9, Mr. Louima found himself in a swirling crowd outside Club Rendez-Vous on Flatbush Avenue as the police arrived to break up a fight. According to witnesses, Mr. Louima was arrested after a man in the crowd knocked Officer Justin A. Volpe flat in a fistfight in front of other officers; some witnesses said that Mr. Louima had struck Officer Volpe. (The charges against Mr. Louima, including assaulting an officer, were dropped.) Investigators are now looking into the possibility that another man hit Officer Volpe.
Prosecutors have charged two officers with beating Mr. Louima en route to the station, and two others with attacking him in the bathroom.
As the blows rained down, Mr. Louima said, he winced, braced himself for the beating and prayed for it to end. Every hit, every racial slur and every indignity was somehow softened by the hope that at least he would see his wife and son again. And when it was all over, his prayers were answered, Mr. Louima said, because he had survived.
"I kept saying, Please, God, don't let me die," he said yesterday. "I was praying to protect my life because if I died, I did not know who would take care of my children."

HEADLINE: Texas Jail Video Puts Transfer Programs in Doubt

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 21

 BODY:
It started out a few years ago as an unlikely economic development program: parlaying an excess of jail cells into out-of-state payments. Inmates were sent from states as far away as Hawaii and Massachusetts, and 5,500 of them are now lodged in county jails across Texas.
While the transfer policy was already tangled in numerous court disputes over its constitutionality, it is now the subject of a mushrooming controversy after a videotape became public this week depicting guards in a Houston-area jail kicking inmates from Missouri, coaxing dogs to bite them and shocking at least one prisoner with a stun gun. 
 The nearly year-old videotape, which was originally shot to be part of a training film for jail guards, has led Missouri to cancel its contract to house 415 inmates at the Texas jail.
"As soon as we saw that, our only recourse was to bring them back," John Fougere, a spokesman for the Missouri Department of Corrections, said today in referring to the taped beatings. "We're not going to stand for something like that."
The tape has also prompted the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Houston to announce an inquiry into the possible violations of the inmates' civil rights at the privately run jail, the Brazoria County Detention Center in Angleton.
The incident has grown even more controversial with disclosures that two of the guards who were reported to be involved in the abuse had been hired despite having convictions for beating inmates in their previous jobs as guards in the Texas prison system.
It prompted Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to place a personal call this week to Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri in which a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush said the Governor assured his Missouri counterpart that the abuse shown on the videotape was not condoned by Texas officials and would be thoroughly investigated and dealt with.
And the tape has provoked denunciations from many other quarters, including State Representative Ron Wilson of Houston, a Democrat, who said: "If those old boys were acting the way they were on videotape, no telling what they're doing when they're not on tape. That is the scary part. They knew they were on tape."
Many questions raised by disclosure of the videotape -- including whether the guards were provoked or how seriously the inmates were injured -- have yet to be answered because all those involved have declined to respond to inquiries.
Officials in the Brazoria County sheriff's office initially said that they did not think the tape depicted wanton abuse, but they have since declined to make any comment.
The sheriff's office day referred all questions about the tape to Otto Hewitt, a lawyer in Alvin, Tex., who is representing Capital Correctional Resources Inc. of Jackson, Miss., the company that runs the jail.
"This matter is currently in litigation and therefore neither I nor my staff are at liberty to discuss it with you," an assistant to Mr. Hewitt said today, reading from a prepared statement of his. "We expect defendants to be fully vindicated in the court's final judgment; no civil rights violations having occurred or being established."
The videotape apparently came to light in the course of proceedings in a lawsuit by the Missouri inmates and was first reported in The Brazosport Facts, a local newspaper.
While the videotape has become a flashpoint, it is far from the first time that out-of-state inmates have complained about the treatment they have received in Texas jails, or even that out-of-state prison officials have expressed concerns about conditions at the jails.
Several months ago, Oklahoma officials began taking back their inmates from the Limestone County Detention Facility in Groesebeck, Tex., after they were reported to be bothered by how often their prisoners were being controlled with pepper spray.
And just this week, Federal authorities announced an investigation into conditions at a privately run county jail in northwest Texas, which houses hundreds of inmates from Montana and Hawaii. Prisoners there have complained about strip searches and the guards' use of warning shots in giving them orders. And an audit by Montana's Corrections Department concluded that there was inadequate food, medical care and counseling services at the prison.
In addition, a Montana inmate was killed in May in a fight between factions from the two states.
The basic policy of transferring state prisoners to Texas has already provoked legal challenges in the home states of many of the prisoners. The inmates complain that being moved severely limits their ability to have visits from family members, meet with their lawyers or arrange for work and a place to live upon their release.
But a group of inmates from Colorado has already gone one step further, arguing that their transfer violates their constitutional rights because, they say, conditions in Texas jails are much worse than at those in Colorado prisons.
And underlying the whole dispute here is the question of whether there is more abuse or poorer living conditions at the Texas jails than at those of other states. Such a contention is staunchly denied by Texas corrections officials, although they also point out that by definition, jails are typically designed for shorter stays than prisons and thus typically have less in the way of services and recreational offerings.
County officials in Texas, which has far more out-of-state inmates than any other state, have welcomed the prisoners, for whom they receive an average of $40 a day. That has amounted to about $80 million for Texas counties that run their own jails and the private companies that run many jails in Texas.
In general, courts have upheld the constitutionality of the transfer of prisoners to other states, although there have been exceptions, said Jenni Gainsborough, public policy administrator of the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union. A judge in New Mexico, she said, found that the transfers violated terms of a consent decree between that state and a group of prisoners shipped to Texas, and they were brought home.
A judge hearing the Colorado inmates' claim had clearly expressed sympathy for the inmates' assertions that conditions at a northeast Texas jail fell below state standards. But that case was essentially sent back to square one when the inmates were shipped to other jails in Texas and were required to prove that their new quarters also failed to meet the state standards.
Ms. Gainsborough described the tape from Brazoria County as shocking. "I think there can be no two opinions about that," she said. "It's O.K. now to treat prisoners worse than we treat animals and we find that very disturbing."
At least one Missouri inmate, a convicted burglar, has filed a civil lawsuit seeking $100,000 in damages for being kicked by guards and bitten by a jail dog.

Charge in Internet Sex Case

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
A 39-year-old unemployed computer engineer from Long Branch was charged yesterday by Federal prosecutors with taking sexually explicit photographs of a 14-year-old girl whom he had met in an Internet chat room in June.
The man, Richard C. Crandon, drove to the girl's home in Coon Rapids, Minn., on Monday to bring her to New Jersey, but left her at a bus stop in State College, Pa., the next day after learning that her mother had reported her missing, said Lieut. Patrick M. Joyce of the Long Branch police. 
 When the police arrested Mr. Crandon at his home Wednesday, they found photographs of the girl partly nude and charged him with endangering the welfare of a minor, Lieutenant Joyce said.

Market Volatility Continues With 127-Point Fall in Dow
The Dow industrials again moved by 100 points, but for the first time this week, the direction was downward.
 
 Stocks fell despite a dearth of disappointing financial reports and without indications of a change in the backdrop of moderate growth and low inflation. [Page D3.]
 
One of the big decliners was Wells Fargo, which fell sharply on reports -- erroneous, as it turned out, but drawn from a misunderstood filing with the S.E.C. -- that the company run by Warren Buffett had sold its big holding of Wells Fargo's stock. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [A1.]
 
Like stocks, bond prices fell sharply, as concerns about interest rates and inflation persisted. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.62 percent from 6.54. [D13.]
 
Disappointing Results at Novell
Novell, the troubled provider of computer networking software, reported a sharp decline in revenues as it tried to reduce excess inventory among resellers. That contributed to a substantially bigger quarterly loss than analysts had estimated. [D2.]
 
Amgen Sees Hope for New Drugs
Amgen agreed to pay $48.5 million to Guilford Pharmaceuticals to acquire the rights to a new compounds that could serve as the basis of drugs to treat nervous-system disorders. [D2.]
 
The A.M.A. Changes Its Mind
As expected, the American Medical Association abandoned its plan to endorse health care products made by Sunbeam. [D2.]
 
Saatchi and Bell Atlantic Split Up
Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising agreed to part ways with Bell Atlantic after the agency failed to win the full account of the telecommunications company. The newly expanded Bell Atlantic -- after its merger with Nynex -- wants to work with many agencies. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D5.]
 
Meat Plant to Shut for a While
A Nebraska meat-processing plant owned by Hudson Foods is closing temporarily and expanding its recall of ground beef after investigators found evidence that far more meat might be contaminated by hazardous bacteria than originally suspected. [A1.]
 
Not a Complete Win for Teamsters
The teamsters' agreement with the United Parcel Service, hailed by many as an unqualified breakthrough victory for organized labor, includes a number of unpublicized concessions by the union that will help the company hold down the cost of the five-year contract. [A21.]
 
A U.P.S. competitor, Federal Express, told nearly 90,000 nonunion workers -- the bulk of its work force -- that they would receive special bonuses for their efforts during the strike. The teamsters have mounted a big organizing drive at Federal Express. [A21.]
 
President Clinton acted to postpone for 60 days a possible nationwide strike against Amtrak, invoking the Railway Labor Act, which was not applicable in the U.P.S. strike. [A21.]
 
Venerable Imprint Changes Hands
Basic Books, a bastion of scholarly publishing whose roster of distinctive authors includes Freud, is being sold by HarperCollins to a venture capital firm, Perseus Capital. [D2.]
 
Deal to Create Big Title Insurer
Lawyers Title of Richmond said that it was buying the title insurance companies of Reliance Group Holdings for $478 million in cash and stock. [D2.]
 
Dollar Slips Against Mark
The dollar fell against the mark after the Bundesbank modified its practice on a key money-market rate. [D4.]
 
California Measure Advances
A Federal appeals court reaffirmed California's right to do away with racial and sex-based preferences, clearing a major hurdle for the 1996 ballot measure to end state-run affirmative action programs. [A16.]

CORRECTION-DATE: August 23, 1997, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An entry in the Business Digest yesterday referred erroneously to a report about special bonuses given to nearly 90,000 Federal Express workers. The article was delayed, and appears today, on page 38.

HEADLINE: Film Festival Plans Almodovar Premiere

 BODY:
The New York Film Festival, which opens Sept. 26 at Avery Fisher Hall with Ang Lee's "Ice Storm," has announced that it will end its 35th annual presentation on Oct. 12 with the world premiere of Pedro Almodovar's "Live Flesh." A thriller set in Madrid, the film involves the police, a diplomat's daughter and the ghosts of Franco's rule.
The festival, organized by the Film Society of Lincoln Center, will offer 28 films from 18 countries and will have as its centerpiece "The Sweet Hereafter," directed by Atom Egoyan. The film stars Ian Holm as a lawyer investigating a schoolbus crash in British Columbia that results in the death of children. "The Sweet Hereafter" won the Grand Prize at the Cannes International Film Festival in May. It will be shown Oct. 4 and 5 in Alice Tully Hall. 
 In what it calls a "special sidebar event" at Avery Fisher Hall on Sept. 29, the festival will present the world premiere of the Museum of Modern Art's restoration of D. W. Griffith's "Orphans of the Storm," including the original score by William Frederick Peters and Louis F. Gottschalk. The score will be performed by the Brooklyn Philharmonic under Gillian Anderson. "Marcello Mastroianni, I Remember, Yes I Remember," a documentary by Anna Maria Tato, his longtime companion, will be shown at Avery Fisher Hall on Sept. 29. The actor died in December at the age of 72.
Jim Jarmusch's documentary on Neil Young, "Year of the Horse," and Lars von Trier's "Kingdom Part II" will be shown on Oct. 4 and 12, respectively, at the Walter Reade Theater as part of the special-event program.
Among the countries represented by festival offerings are Iran, Egypt, Russia, Mexico, Japan and France. "Taste of Cherry," by the Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, won the Palme d'Or at Cannes this year and focuses on a man contemplating suicide as he drives around the outskirts of Teheran. From Egypt, "Destiny," directed by Youssef Chahine, takes place in the 12th century and concerns the conflict between intellectual exploration and religious orthodoxy.
Russia's Aleksandr Sokurov paints a picture of abandonment and grief in "Mother and Son." The Mexican entry, "Deep Crimson," directed by Arturo Ripstein, is a psychological drama about a seducer and his victims. In "Hana-Bi," the multi-talented Japanese performer and writer Takeshi Kitano stars in his own film about a former detective who embarks on a wild scheme to make amends for a crippling injury to his partner. Bruno Dumont's "Vie de Jesus," which won the Jean Vigo Prize for best first film, follows the fortunes of unemployed youths in northern France.
The American contingent includes "Telling Lies in America," directed by Gus Ferland, written by Joe Eszterhas and starring Kevin Bacon, Brad Renfro, Maximilian Schell and Calista Flockhart in a story about an immigrant teen-ager learning the ropes from dubious sources in 1960's Cleveland. Paul Thomas Anderson's "Boogie Nights" concerns sexual and other excesses among teen-agers in Southern California during the 1970's and early 80's. Mark Wahlberg stars. "The Apostle," written, directed and financed by Robert Duvall, also stars Mr. Duvall as a preacher on the run from the law. The cast includes Farrah Fawcett, Miranda Richardson and Billy Bob Thornton.
A new adaptation of Henry James's "Washington Square," directed by Agnieszka Holland, stars Albert Finney as the unbending patriarch of James's stifling household and Jennifer Jason Leigh as the daughter whose bleak victory ends the story.
A documentary entry is "Public Housing," Frederick Wiseman's portrait of life in a housing development in Chicago.
The box office for the festival, which is being sponsored for the second year by Grand Marnier, will open on Sept. 7 at noon at Alice Tully Hall. Information: (212) 875-5050.

HEADLINE: New York's Waterways

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Aug. 18 editorial "A Reborn Erie Canal" overlooked Gov. George E. Pataki's strong commitment to New York's waterways as both environmental and economic assets.
In the past two years Mr. Pataki has earmarked more than $150 million for the revitalization of the Erie Canal, a sum that belies your argument that he is unenthusiastic about the project. Additionally, the development of the Hudson River Park, along with Mr. Pataki's $100 million commitment, continues apace, and three miles of bicycle paths are open this summer. 
 Finally, the suggestion that Mr. Pataki revisit the idea of moving the elevated West Side Highway over the old Penn Central railroad yards is aimed in the wrong direction. No one has questioned the desirability of plac ing a park there. What is in question is the extraordinary public expense of relocating the highway. We agree with the Giuliani administration that tearing down a stretch of road that has just been rebuilt at a cost of $70 million is a waste of taxpayers' money at this time.

HEADLINE: British Slice $5 Billion From MCI Bid

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Saying that a gloomier business outlook makes the MCI Communications Corporation worth 22 percent less than it was just nine months ago, British Telecommunications P.L.C. announced yesterday that it had renegotiated its agreement to acquire the American company.
The revised deal is subject to another round of voting by shareholders of each company late this year. And while many analysts said they expected investors to approve the new pact, the support by MCI shareholders will probably be much weaker than the 3-to-1 margin by which they approved the original merger last spring. 
 Several MCI shareholders had already filed suit, contending that MCI's management could have negotiated a better deal. The new, lower price for MCI seems likely to bring even louder complaints from investors.
British Telecom, concerned by eroding profits in MCI's core long-distance telephone business and by mounting losses in MCI's nascent local-service operation, said it would pay about $19 billion for the 80 percent of MCI it did not already own rather than stick with the $24 billion deal the companies announced last November.
"I didn't want to look at the screen today I was so upset," said Salvatore Muoio, an analyst with the financial research firm S. Muoio & Company. "If you own MCI stock, my opinion is this is not a good transaction for you."
The announcement, which came a day after the Federal Communications Commission gave final regulatory approval to the merger, capped weeks of speculation that British Telecom, under pressure from skeptical shareholders, would push MCI to accept a lower price. MCI steadfastly denied that the two companies were renegotiating the deal -- only to issue a terse statement on Wednesday night confirming the talks.
In London yesterday, executives from the two companies said there had been no change in the global strategy behind the purchase by Britain's dominant telecommunications company of the No. 2 American long-distance carrier. But British Telecom executives said MCI's troubles within the United States had forced them to shave about $5 billion from the price.
Most other big telecommunications providers are also lining up international partners these days as they try to offer their customers seamless global service. The Sprint Corporation, for instance, is partly owned by Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom. And the AT&T Corporation has loose ties to more than a dozen overseas telecommunications companies under the rubric of its World Partners alliance.
If the British Telecom-MCI deal is approved by shareholders, it will create a $43 billion giant called Concert with 43 million customers in 72 countries. But Concert would still be smaller than AT&T, which recorded $52.2 billion in worldwide revenue last year.
"There is a global revolution in telecoms which offers a huge opportunity for the merged company," Sir Peter L. Bonfield, the chief executive of British Telecommunications, said at a news conference yesterday in London. "The changes in the United States and the U.K. markets have prompted a new agreement that fairly reflects the current market realities."
Under the new terms, MCI's stock owners would receive 0.375 of a British Telecommunications American depository receipt and $7.75 in cash for each share of MCI.
British Telecom's American depository receipts closed yesterday at $68.1875, up $1.8125, on the New York Stock Exchange, making the deal worth about $33.32 per share of MCI.
Under the deal's previous terms, holders of MCI's stock would have received 0.54 of a British Telecom A.D.R. and $6 in cash for each share of MCI. So, under the old terms the takeover was worth about $42.82 per share of MCI.
MCI's shares lost 62.5 cents yesterday, closing at $29.9375 in Nasdaq trading.
In renegotiating the merger, British Telecom executives not only reduced the total amount their company will pay for MCI. By shifting the proportions of stock and cash in the deal, they also reduced the amount of the new company that will be owned by former MCI shareholders, to about 25 percent from around 34 percent.
That was important to the British company because its stockholders were worried that their stakes would become highly diluted as the company issued millions of new shares.
"From the B.T. shareholders' point of view, the change in the terms is more advantageous than I could have expected," said James Golob, an analyst in London for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. "And I think that reflects the reality of the market, which is that if the deal fell through B.T. shares would actually have gone up and MCI shares would have dropped."
Even now, though, conservative British investors might have reservations about the deal.
"A lot of U.K. fund managers are skeptical of anything global, which they think leads to dilution," Mr. Golob added. "They don't like acquisitions, and they don't like U.S. acquisitions. They don't like U.S. anything."
The companies said that the merger would lead to lower earnings for this year and next year but that it would add to their profits starting in 1999. They estimated that by the fifth year after the acquisition, Concert would earn $800 million a year more than the two companies would have earned separately.
The general reaction from many analysts in the United States, like Daniel Reingold at Merrill Lynch, was that MCI had done as well for itself as could be expected. But that was probably little solace for the many hedge fund managers who made big bets that the original deal would go through and ended up big losers this week.
"On the economics you'd rather just continue to own the stock," Mr. Muoio said.
The economics have not often been on MCI's side recently. The joint review of MCI's finances that ended in yesterday's announcement began after MCI announced last month that it could lose as much as $800 million this year -- twice the loss the company had previously forecast -- in its unit that is trying to break into the $100 billion local telephone market.
MCI said yesterday that it remained committed to offering local service, but that in the future the company would be "targeting investment on those local markets that we expect will be opening most quickly to true competition." MCI began offering local telephone service in the New York City area earlier this month.
Perhaps even more alarming to British Telecom executives was MCI's disclosure last month that its long-distance business was not growing as quickly as it had. That trend was reflected in the company's financial results for the second quarter, when its profits fell 6 percent from the corresponding 1996 period.
"I'm sure that the erosion of profitability in the core business was of the most concern to B.T.," said William Deatherage, an analyst for Bear, Stearns & Company. "There is no question that over the last year the intensity of competition in the long-distance market has gone to a new level."
After MCI disclosed its weaknesses last month, Mr. Deatherage lowered his estimate for MCI's earnings this year to $1.15 a share, from $1.65.
"I think it was a fair adjustment in the acquisition price, given the reduced earnings forecast for MCI," he said. "Frankly, this is as good as the MCI management can do under the circumstances."

HEADLINE: The Private Sector Life of a Government Lab;
Drumming Up Business to Survive in a World Without Cold War

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company wanted to predict, without weeks of test drives, how its tires would perform under various conditions. So it went to the Energy Department's Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., for help. "Their computer models show how a nuclear weapon will react to different conditions, so why shouldn't they show how a tire will react?" asked William Sharp, president of Goodyear's global support operations.
A Federal weapons laboratory might seem an unlikely partner for a tire maker, but with the cold war over and military spending shrinking, Sandia is putting out the welcome mat to private industry. And American corporations, which have emerged in this era after downsizing as far more willing to turn to outside sources, are lining up to tap into its technology storehouse. 
 They are using Sandia to develop new manufacturing processes, to run what-if simulations on new products, to solve environmental problems. In the process, they are helping Sandia move beyond its once single-minded focus on the arms race.
For example, a consortium of 17 casting and forging companies, recognizing that few young engineers were joining the industry, asked Sandia to help it simplify software so that employees who were not engineers could create and test new casting equipment. "None of us have the time or money to do this ourselves," said Robert B. Kervick, chief executive of Komtek, a casting company in Worcester, Mass.
And Motorola asked Sandia to run reliability tests on computer chips without using the standard chemical cleaning agents -- the chlorofluorocarbons that destroy the atmosphere's ozone layer. "Customers feel more comfortable buying a product whose reliability is verified by a Government lab," said James F. Landers, a manager in the Space and Systems Technology Group of Motorola.
For Sandia, the money pouring in from its corporate partners helps keep many of its 7,642 employees -- about 800 fewer than two years ago -- gainfully employed. But the real winner, Sandia insists, is the American economy. "National security starts with economic security, and that means helping our industries compete," said C. Paul Robinson, Sandia's president.
Sandia (pronounced san-DEE-uh), which has operations in Livermore, Calif., as well as in Albuquerque, is not the only Energy Department lab sounding that theme. Although documents emerged last week indicating that some of the labs, including Sandia, are still hard at work on new or modified designs for nuclear arms, private-sector projects are nonetheless occupying an ever-larger share of their time.
Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, Lawrence Livermore -- the heart, lungs and brain of the Manhattan Project's atomic bomb and its progeny -- all have been accelerating their industrial endeavors since 1989. That was when Congress removed many of the legal impediments that had kept them from transferring intellectual property or licensing technologies to private industry. Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, which is grappling with environmental problems caused by the leak of radioactive tritium from a research reactor's storage tank, is looking to commercialize its medical and environmental technologies.
In the last eight years, the labs have written more than 3,000 Cradas -- the acronym for cooperative research and development agreements -- that spell out who pays for what, and how the results can be used. Some call for companies to foot the entire bill in return for proprietary rights to anything that is developed. But more typically, the labs chip in some cash, retain the rights to the resulting technology and give the corporations that contributed several years of free, exclusive use.
The Federal labs, even when shrouded in secrecy, have always intermingled with industry. Many of them have been managed by private corporations -- under contract to the Energy Department and its predecessors -- for several decades. Sandia, for one, was run by AT&T for nearly 44 years and is now managed by Lockheed Martin.
But while all of the labs are devoting more time and resources to projects in the private sector, the effort seems most crucial at Sandia. Unlike Oak Ridge, which has always been a multipurpose energy lab, Sandia's raison d'etre has always been the arms race. And Sandia, which designs the nonnuclear components of nuclear weapons, also is responsible for stockpiling spare parts, and for maintaining the existing supply of nuclear weapons. So, unlike Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos, which design and develop nuclear warheads, its duties have not lessened much with the end of the cold war.
Even so, Sandia's operating budget is slowly being whittled away. It was down almost $50 million this year, to about $1.28 billion, and Sandia expects it will drop to $1.1 billion in 1999. And a lot of those cuts have come out of the money available for use as matching funds for industrial projects. In 1995, Sandia got about $100 million from the Government for those purposes; it received $56 million last year and $20 million this year. Warren Siemens, Sandia's director of technology partnerships, doubts it will rise above that again.
"Apparently, Congress has said, 'Oops, this is corporate welfare,' " Mr. Siemens said.
So, while most of the laboratories are looking for ways to apply their existing technologies to corporate use, Sandia is the most willing to develop new processes for industry, with the hope that the companies will cover most of the costs.
Right now, for example, Sandia is working with a consortium of electronics companies on a project to miniaturize certain types of semiconductor chips to handle 30 times the functions they typically do now. It is collaborating with numerous manufacturers on ways to cast tools directly from powdered metals. And it is encouraging industry to tap into its supercomputer -- a machine that Sandia says is 300 times as powerful as Deep Blue, I.B.M.'s chess playing champion -- not only to answer questions about products and processes, but also to suggest what questions should be asked.
"We hold the record for speed of computing," Mr. Siemens said. "We have great strength in microelectronics, and these are exactly the areas companies look to for help in making products more reliable."
Progress in persuading industry to chip in has been slow. Five years ago, about $9 million of Sandia's funds came from industry. Last year corporations provided $27 million. But Mr. Siemens thinks private financing will hit $35 million this year, and soar to $100 million by 2000.
And Sandia wants more from industry than simply money. Since it can no longer afford to hire many new researchers, it must rely on industry to keep abreast of new technologies.
Moreover, industrial projects often have implications for the military. "It's a lot cheaper to maintain an air force whose planes need less rebuilding or repairing," said Gernant E. Maurer, vice president of technology for the Special Metals Corporation, a maker of nickel-based superalloys that is part of a consortium working with Sandia to develop defect-free alloys for engine aircraft.
Similarly, weapons and satellites are loaded with semiconductor chips. "Our nation's defense systems rely on semiconductors, and it would not be great if they had to buy all those chips from overseas," said Chris Daverse, manager of national resources for Sematech Inc., a nonprofit research consortium of semiconductor makers and equipment suppliers, which has signed on for numerous projects to develop lower-cost production methods and contamination-free chips.
Sandia's new reliance on industry comes at an opportune time. Companies have grown more comfortable with the idea of outsourcing all kinds of tasks, so letting outsiders work on their research is not as radical as it would have been in the do-it-yourself 80's. Moreover, many have formed strategic alliances with suppliers and competitors, making companies less averse to sharing their technologies with others.
"The thinking is, it is better to get half the rights to a product that is first to market, than all the rights to one that comes in late," said Mary L. Good, a former Under Secretary of Commerce who helped set up a project among the auto industry and several national laboratories to develop a fuel-efficient car.
If repeat business is a sign of satisfaction, the corporations that have tried it clearly believe they have received their money's worth. Goodyear, which has completed four cooperative projects in which it used computer modeling to predict how different tread designs and materials would perform, just signed on for its fifth Sandia project. It is aimed at analyzing and improving rubber processing technology.
A deal between Delphi Saginaw Steering Systems, an arm of the General Motors Corporation, and Sandia to develop better finishing processes for auto parts has metamorphosed into a Detroit-wide project to develop electronic controls for industrial heating and hardening processes.
"We'll save tens of millions just by eliminating destructive testing," said James M. Farago, Delphi's supervisor of controls engineering. "And we're going to get better insights into the materials we use."

Many of the country's national laboratories were set up during or just after World War II as part of the nuclear weapons program. Fifty years later, the labs are still involved in weapons research, but many are also teaming up with companies in the private sector to do research with direct commercial applications.

"The Cost of Cutting-Edge Research"
The Federal Government spends billions of dollars a year on the national laboratories. With the cold war over, though, some of the labs have lost support, while others have managed to justify increased spending.

HEADLINE: Colleges Beyond Reach

 BODY:
A forthcoming report from two university economists asserts that students from affluent families are attending public colleges and universities in ever larger numbers. The report has already commanded considerable media attention and has raised fears that wealthier students may be grabbing places in lower-cost institutions that would normally be occupied by poorer students. It has also inspired some interest in the notion of means-testing public education -- charging higher fees for wealthier students.
Means-testing is a misplaced idea that would discard the venerable principle of equal access to public facilities and possibly undermine taxpayer support for public education. But the report underscores some underlying realities of modern higher education. Chief among these is the fact that rising tuitions at private universities have increased the competition for spaces in public institutions. The report's findings also suggest that educators need to do some imaginative thinking about how to keep those same institutions accessible for bright, low-income students. 
 In their forthcoming book, Michael McPherson of Macalaster College in St. Paul and Morton Schapiro of the University of Southern California estimate that 38 percent of college freshmen from families earning more than $200,000 a year enrolled in public universities in 1994, compared with 31 percent in 1980 -- a slow but steady increase. This has not, so far, greatly altered the demographic balance in public institutions. Though more wealthy students may be attending public colleges, they are still a fraction of the enrollment. In 1995, less than 2 percent of entrants to public four-year colleges came from families earning $200,000 or more.
Nevertheless, as private school tuitions skyrocket and wealthier families decide that the qualitative differences between an Ivy League school and a state university are not worth the huge price differential, the pressures on public institutions are sure to grow -- raising costs and tuitions to a point where they may well be out of reach for many low-income families. Even now, many poorer students are not even applying to public four-year colleges.
Increased demand also raises the academic bar for admission. Applicants for elite public schools like the University of Michigan come equipped with ever higher S.A.T. scores and higher grade point averages. Since those measures are closely tied to family income, low-income students find themselves increasingly disadvantaged.
The broad demographics are also daunting. The fact that a college education, now more than ever, is seen as the ticket to higher paying jobs has elevated enrollment rates of 18- to 24-year-olds from 26.7 percent in 1980 to 34.3 percent in 1995.
An overall drop in the college-age population during that time made the numbers manageable. That is sure to change during the next 15 years, when demographers predict a 20 percent increase in the college-age population.
The central policy question, therefore, is how to keep low-income families from being squeezed out. There are innovative ideas buzzing about. New York's Tuition Assistance Program, for example, gives grants to students based on a sliding income scale. Thomas Kane, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and Politics, proposes that loans to students from low-income families might be forgiven unless they later join the ranks of the affluent.
Another possibility is to focus the Federal Pell grant program on the first two years of college -- a period when many poor students drop out because they decide they cannot make it financially or academically. The states and the Federal Government need to explore these and other ideas. The old dream of broadly affordable public education keeps receding.

HEADLINE: U.S. Envoy to Kenya Warns Both Sides to Restore Peace

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Aug. 22

 BODY:
In a hard-hitting speech aimed at slowing the spiraling violence here, the United States Ambassador to Kenya strongly criticized both the Government and opposition leaders today for heading down a path toward more confrontation and suggested that Kenya's foreign aid may hang in the balance if peace is not restored.
The Ambassador, Prudence Bushnell, also made it clear that the Government led by President Daniel arap Moi must push through several political reforms if it expects the world to judge elections to be held later this year as free and fair. 
 "We hear commitments to free and fair elections, but the political playing field remains decidedly uneven," Ms. Bushnell said.
Her comments appeared intended to break a deadly political stalemate between Mr. Moi's ruling party and opposition politicians seeking to revamp what they see as an unfair electoral system. Thirteen protesters and two police officers have been killed in riots this summer.
A loose coalition of opposition leaders, clergy and civil rights advocates has been staging the protests to persuade Mr. Moi's Government to change the electoral rules and repeal several laws giving him the power to control the media, jail opponents and break up political rallies. Opposition politicians have vowed to boycott and disrupt the elections if their demands are not met.
To appease his critics at home and abroad, Mr. Moi, who is 73 and has been in office since 1978, has proposed his own slate of watered-down reforms in the Parliament, which his party controls. So far, however, he has refused to negotiate with the protest organizers and has maintained there is not enough time to rewrite the Constitution before elections are held.
Ms. Bushnell's words carry weight in Kenya, where the United States has wielded considerable influence since the East African nation gained independence from Britain in 1963. During the cold war, Mr. Moi was a staunch American ally and received millions in Western aid in return.
In the early 1990's, however, the United States Ambassador at the time, Smith Hempstone, became one of Mr. Moi's most vocal critics. He led an international charge that eventually forced Kenya to liberalize its economy and move from a one-party system to open elections.
Last week, Kenya's political crisis took a nastier turn. Beginning Aug. 13, well-organized gangs of thugs drawn from coastal tribes began mounting raids along the Indian Ocean coast around Mombasa, lynching people from inland tribes and razing their homes and kiosks. At least 42 people, including 9 police officers, have been killed.
Mr. Moi has blamed the violence on the opposition, saying leaders had stirred up tribal hatreds. The opposition has charged Mr. Moi's aides with orchestrating the attacks to provide an excuse for forestalling political reforms.
In her speech to the Law Society of Kenya, which has joined the pro-reform coalition, Ms. Bushnell strongly implied -- without naming names -- that both sides bore some responsibility for the violence. She said the United States "does not condone violence as a tool of political change, whatever the objective, whoever the perpetrator."
The Ambassador also delivered a veiled threat to the Moi administration.
"Some leaders in Kenya may anticipate that the current state of affairs, however unhealthy, is only temporary," she said. "Once the Government is back in power, they may believe, political tension will die down and Kenya will return to the fold of multilateral lending institutions with new commitments to old promises."
"It may not necessarily work that way," she went on. "Many within and outside Kenya could decide that, in the words of a popular American expression, they have 'been there, done that,' and don't want to do it again."
Referring to opposition politicians, Ms. Bushnell was equally critical, saying their plans to disrupt the elections "could lead to tragedy."
"Violence and unrest are easy to provoke," she said. "But they are extraordinarily difficult to stop."
Other diplomats, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said there is a growing fear that Mr. Moi will push his less extensive version of political reforms through Parliament and then call the elections immediately for mid-October or early November.
That would set the Government on a collision course with opposition leaders, who have threatened to interfere with the polling if their reforms are scrapped. Since most of the opposition parties are tribally based and each has a youth wing, the result could be bloodshed.
But Kenya's Foreign Minister, Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka, said that giving in to the opposition demands before the polls would lead to tribal clashes. He said some of the electoral changes the opposition leaders are seeking -- a rule requiring a President to win a majority of votes cast, for instance -- would divide the country along tribal lines, giving more voting power to the large tribes and taking away protections now enjoyed by smaller ethnic groups.

HEADLINE: New Model and New Ads As Saab Aims for Revival

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 22

 BODY:
Think of it as a midlife crisis. At age 50, Saab finds itself at a crossroads: After years of struggling, it has a new management team, a new advertising agency and perhaps most important, a new car on the way.
Next month, in the most visible of all the internal shifts at the company, Saab embarks on a new advertising campaign as it struggles to jettison its murky image. 
 "For them, image is going to be critical," said Christopher W. Cedergren, managing director of Nextrend, an auto research group in Thousand Oaks, Calif. "Because the Saab image is so nebulous right now, it is really going to be difficult for them to compete against Mercedes and BMW."
Saab has a plan. The campaign, created by Saab's new advertising agency, the Martin Agency of Richmond, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, aims to reposition the cars as safe, high-performance autos that are fun to drive.
"We're presenting Saab as a car that offers the safety of a Volvo without the boredom, and the performance of a BMW without the pretense," John B. Adams Jr., Martin's chairman and chief executive, said.
The campaign consists of four print advertisements that will appear in the October issues of magazines like Forbes, Food and Wine and Vanity Fair and two 30-second television ads that will be shown, starting Sept. 8, on shows like "Seinfeld," "Tonight" and "20/20."
The print ads have dark backgrounds with quirky, diagonal photographs of the car to convey a sense of motion. One carries a headline reading, "Safety marries performance. They elope." The text describes how driving a Saab feels safe because of the car's turbocharged engine and tight handling. A television ad shows a couple riding down the highway in a convertible as an ominous shadow cast by the setting sun nearly overtakes the car. The driver accelerates, sending the car speeding into the sunshine on the road ahead.
While the new ads showcase the Saab 900, the smaller of Saab's two models, Mr. Adams said the advertisements would reposition the whole Saab brand, which has been struggling. Saab doubled its annual ad budget in 1996 to $62 million, according to Competitive Media Reporting, which tracks advertising spending. With the new ad campaign and the new car, Saab plans to increase its ad spending next year to about $70 million.
Saab's larger car, the 9000 model, will be replaced in April with a sedan called the 9-5, followed with a station wagon in late 1998.
Saab executives have pinned their hopes on the new sedan because it has been so long since the company has introduced a new model. The Saab 9000 has changed little since its debut in 1986. Even the Saab 900 has been around since 1978, although it was substantially redesigned in 1993.
Saab's popularity reached its peak in the mid-1980's, but sales then began to slide, bottoming out in 1993. Profits fell, too. In this decade, Saab has lost money every year except 1994 and 1995. Executives have said they expect Saab to return to profitability in 1999.
For all those years, Saab's owners have been bailing it out while wondering whether they were throwing good money after bad. Saab Automobile A.B. is a joint venture between Investor A.B., an investment group controlled by the Wallenberg family of Sweden, and the General Motors Corporation.
Last summer, Investor seemed to lose patience. It reached a deal with G.M. that gives Investor the right to force G.M. to take an additional 25 percent stake in the company in 2000 and gives G.M. the option of buying Investor's entire stake then. Saab executives have said they hope to improve the company enough by then to make it worth arguing over.
The next 12 to 18 months are "the most important in the last decade" for Saab, said David M. Garrity, an analyst at Smith Barney. "The clock is ticking between now and the year 2000."
Fixing Saab has been harder than executives thought, with sales goals slipping again and again, only to be reset at lower levels. In 1990, when Saab sold 93,224 cars worldwide, its goal was to sell 180,000 by the year 2000. By last year, when it sold 98,036 worldwide, it hoped to sell 150,000 cars by 2000, with 40,000 of them in the United States. This year, it expects sales in this country to top 30,000.
As G.M. has increased its investment in Saab, it has devoted more management attention to it. Last summer, it named Robert W. Hendry, 51, a G.M. executive close to John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman, as chief executive of Saab. It also brought two executives from G.M.'s highly regarded Saturn division to Saab's American arm.
John J. Orth, a former Saturn executive who serves as Saab Cars USA Inc.'s vice president for sales and marketing, said Saab planned to improve its sales and customer service while quietly taking advantage of economies of scale available through its link to G.M.
Since 62 percent of Saab's sales are in the Northeast, Mr. Orth wants to persuade buyers in other parts of the country to choose Saabs. In addition, he is bringing to Saab dealers some lessons learned at Saturn, which has a reputation for strong customer relations.
A handful of Saab dealers are likely to sign up soon to try the no-haggle pricing used by Saturn dealers, and Mr. Orth said he hoped more would try it.
While Saab plans to continue to keep its distance from G.M. when it comes to designing cars, Mr. Orth said the ties to the giant company had already helped it keep costs down.
For instance, the Saab 9-5 shares its underpinnings with G.M.'s Opel cars in Europe, cutting development costs. Also, by using G.M.'s corporate might, Saab was able to get more bang for its buck in advertising. "We've basically gotten 25 to 30 percent more ads than we would have gotten if we'd run the campaigns by ourselves," he said.
But all the changes ride on the shoulders of the Saab 9-5. "Saab is going to put a full-court press on" with the new advertising, Mr. Cedergren, the auto consultant, said. "They really view that car as being the primary catalyst for the rebirth."

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
The American economy may be defying the laws of the business cycle, but American churches are falling on financial hard times, with no relief in sight.
At least that is the judgment of Robert Wuthnow, the prolific Princeton sociologist of religion. Although Professor Wuthnow's latest book, published this year by Oxford University Press, carries an all-purpose title -- "The Crisis in the Churches" -- the subtitle gets to the point: "Spiritual Malaise, Fiscal Woe." 
 "What makes the present crisis more serious is that it is also a spiritual crisis," Professor Wuthnow writes. "The problem lies less in parishioners' pocketbooks than in their hearts and less in churches' budgets than in clergy's understanding of the needs and desires of their members' lives."
"The Crisis in the Churches" lacks the focus and rigor of "Money Matters" (Westminster John Knox Press, 1997), the study of church members' contributions discussed here a month ago. That effort examined over 600 churches; Professor Wuthnow looks just at 60.
Nor does he clearly demonstrate that church finances are as desperate as he suggests. And indeed Americans who attend religious services remain the most generous part of the population in donating both their money and their time to charitable activities.
Nonetheless, as several studies have found, church contributions, while continuing to rise in actual inflation-adjusted dollars, have been dropping since the late 1960's as a percentage of after-tax income.
And in his book, Professor Wuthnow mixes that finding with anecdotal evidence, garnered in his research, about freezes and cuts in local and national church budgets. The pinch is coming on the heels of disappearing government programs and new demands on churches to maintain shelters, soup kitchens and child-care programs.
Professor Wuthnow even imagines a future when religious institutions, like other nonprofit groups, must rely on corporate sponsorship. "The next step," he suggests, "may be the Pepsi Nativity Pageant or the Chevrolet Church of Our Savior."
His ideas spring from a larger study that he has been conducting of Americans' attitudes toward work, money, faith and morals, ideas that Professor Wuthnow has discussed in earlier books.
Americans, he has found, say they are repelled by materialism yet admit to being caught up in it. They say they feel under constant pressure, working too much and neglecting family life, yet they are ready to work even longer hours for more money. They say they are troubled by widespread poverty yet esteem wealth.
In sum, they need, and want, some moral compass to guide their choice of careers, attitudes toward work and patterns of spending. The culture no longer supports the old ethic of diligence and thrift, and religion is providing neither a moral language nor a supportive community for making these decisions.
That is where Professor Wuthnow sees a link to the churches' current financial worries. Most church members are middle-class: Almost 80 percent have annual family incomes of $20,000 to $100,000.
Middle-class church members are much more concerned about jobs, stress and how to use time and money, Professor Wuthnow believes, "than they are about the propriety or impropriety of a Robert Mapplethorpe photograph." And as long as the clergy fails to address such middle-class preoccupations, he argues, lackluster giving will continue.
Why is the clergy so reluctant to take up these matters?
Professor Wuthnow's interviews indicate that, for many of the clergy, the economic realm is simply alien. Members of the clergy are impressed by that realm's power over their congregants' lives but are intimidated by its claims to follow complicated, inexorable laws. Pastors prefer to stay on turf where they feel possessed of expertise and authority: their church's own financial needs.
The clergy also bows to the middle-class taboo against discussing personal finances; most pastors are likely to know more about church members' sex lives, addictions and marital squabbles than about their incomes or debts.
And when religious leaders do comment on questions of work and money, they usually couch their advice in terms of personal fulfillment and happiness, Professor Wuthnow found, and skirt direct statements about right and wrong.
In other words, rather than drawing on Scripture, tradition or theological learning, they give church members the same kind of common-sense, psychological advice that could be obtained almost anywhere else.
Professor Wuthnow recommends that instead the clergy should offer preaching and counseling on career choices for young people; organize small groups where people can discuss their jobs, personal finances and patterns of spending, and integrate church members' concerns about work and money into worship services. He emphasizes stewardship, the responsible use of one's talents and resources, "in a way that features its theological significance rather than depicting it simply as common-sense, middle-class virtue."
Finally, he recommends sending a tough message about middle-class churchgoers' responsibility for helping the poor and seeking social justice.
Would these recommendations, however worthy, really remedy the churches' financial woes?
His own interviews suggest that many middle-class church members, although they complain that the church never speaks to their problems, would be unhappy if it did: They see the church as an other-worldly haven from such daily troubles.
Even with that major question mark, his analysis remains provocative. At most, he says, members of the clergy "have preached tithing -- more likely meaning 1 percent than 10 percent -- but they have forgotten to say anything about the remaining 90 percent of their parishioners' financial burdens."

 BODY:
The gubernatorial candidates must address the plight of New Jersey cities if they hope to attract black voters, the executive director of the New Jersey Black Ministries Council said yesterday.
The Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, whose organization represents 600 ministers, said that members would seek specific answers to such problems as failing public schools, decrepit housing and widespread unemployment when they meet separately with Governor Whitman and her Democratic challenger, State Senator James E. McGreevey, on Sept. 30. 
 The ministers' council, based in Orange, will not make an endorsement, but it will issue report cards on the candidates in early October, Mr. Jackson said.

HEADLINE: Richard Friedman, Psychiatry Professor, 49

BYLINE: By PHILIP HILTS

 BODY:
Richard Friedman, a professor of psychiatry at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and a pioneer in the study of the mind's effects on physical health, died Tuesday of heart failure after giving a talk at the American Psychological Association meeting in Chicago. He was 49.
Dr. Friedman had devoted most of his career to studies of how mind and behavior can affect physical health, and when he died he had just gone to take a nap after giving a talk on the economic benefits of taking behavior and belief into account in medical treatment. He had an underlying coronary condition that became fatal when a sudden arrhythmia developed, said Dr. Herbert Benson, a colleague. 
 Attending the University of Connecticut on a baseball scholarship, Dr. Friedman turned his attention to experimental psychology, though he never stopped loving the Yankees, said a colleague at Stony Brook. His work in what is now called "behavioral medicine" began when he was a graduate student.
He did graduate work at Stony Brook under Dr. Lewis K. Dahl. Dr. Dahl had bred a strain of mice prone to hypertension, and performed experiments in which he delivered random electric shocks to mice to see if over time they developed stress-related hypertension.
They did not, and Dr. Dahl in one talk on the results said that stress was apparently not important in the creation of high blood pressure. But at the talk, Dr. Benson said that the experiment did not prove any such thing and that it had been done wrong.
Dr. Dahl soon enlisted one of his top graduate students to redesign and reconduct the experiment. The student was Richard Friedman, who theorized that the rats, and human beings as well, do not get worked up over random stress as much as over stress related to the important parts of their lives, like eating for the rats and work, family or money for humans.
In his version of the experiment, he first waited until the mice pressed a lever before he gave them food. Then he occasionally administered electric shocks. When the rats began to associate eating with the possibility of pain, they soon developed seriously high blood pressure.
In the 20 years since that study, Dr. Friedman continued to do laboratory work, compiling more than 100 published articles delineating the links between behavior and health in both animals and humans. He helped organize a committee at the National Institutes of Health that brought together prominent scientists to study links between the mind and physical health. The committee concluded that there is indeed a link, and that it will be important to consider it in the design of future health-care systems.
Dr. Friedman worked with Dr. Benson beginning in 1981, became director of research at the Mind/ Body Medical Institute at Harvard Medical School and was co-founder with Dr. Benson of Mind/Body Medicine, amedical journal.
"One of his most significant achievements was that he helped guide mind-body medicine into the mainstream of medical practice in the United States," Dr. Benson said.
Taking his own medicine, Dr. Friedman practiced meditation daily.
Dr. Friedman lived in Setauket, Long Island. He is survived by his wife, Madelon; a son, Jeffrey, and a daughter, Danielle; a sister, Harriet Boyko of Canton, Conn., and a brother, Phillip, of Vienna, Va.
In a conference at Harvard in 1996, Dr. Friedman was pressed by reporters on whether mainstream medicine, having started to acknowledge the importance of attitudes and beliefs in the treatment of physical illness, would integrate those considerations into day-to-day practice.
Dr. Friedman replied, "Of course, the medical establishment is conservative," then he quoted an old saw from medical school: "As a doctor you don't want to be either the first or the last to try something new."
He then added: "But it is now catching on fast. Let me make a prediction. Ten years from now, in many managed-care settings, doctors will not only be asking for a medical history when you come in, but will routinely ask about your belief system as well."

THE JUDAS ECONOMY
 The Triumph of Capital
 and the Betrayal of Work.
 By William Wolman and Anne Colamosca.
 240 pp. Reading, Mass.:
 Addison-Wesley Publishing Company. $25. 
 The villains of this book are familiar: overpaid corporate executives, soulless bond traders, inflation-phobic central bankers, clueless politicians. So are the victims: members of the late, great American middle class who must work ever harder to put Junior through college and tuna casserole on the table.
But the plot does have a twist: The worldwide capitalist revolution of the 1990's, led by a new elite of business school graduates and technologists, will betray its own. Indeed, the authors argue that global market forces are already chiseling away at the earnings of highly skilled workers, assuring that the only real winners in "The Judas Economy" will be the owners of capital.
William Wolman, the chief economist at Business Week, and Anna Colamosca, a former Business Week staff writer, spin a provocative neo-Marxist tale -- one that adds a touch of analytic discipline to the apocalyptic vision of their fellow market basher William Greider, the author of the popular book "One World, Ready or Not." But while they are right that capitalism hardly guarantees that good things will come to those who work hard and study harder, the case for what they call "the triumph of capital and the betrayal of work" is overblown.
Back in the 1960's there was every reason to believe that workers and capitalists belonged to the same happy family. Postwar growth had brought with it both rising profits and fatter pay envelopes. But the benign logic of trickle-down economics failed in the 1980's. The earnings of unskilled labor fell, even as the economy enjoyed years of prosperity.
What went wrong? Economists point to three factors: stiff competition from Asia, a flood of immigrants, automation in manufacturing. But most argued that efforts to turn back the clock on globalization were futile. The only practical long-term remedy, they suggested, was a combination of heavy investment in education and border controls that reduced the supply of unskilled labor.
There are loose ends here. James Heckman, an economist at the University of Chicago, has pointed out that it would take at least a half-trillion dollars' worth of productivity-enhancing training to give today's workers the share of national income that they enjoyed in the 1960's. And even an effort of that magnitude would leave behind workers who lacked the brains or the motivation to acquire marketable skills. But the story of what had happened and what a deeply committed Government might do to repair the damage more or less held together.
Enter skeptics Wolman and Colamosca, stage left. Global competition helps to explain the plight of the unskilled, they agree. But they insist that a generous dose of skills won't solve their problem because educated workers also face rising competition from foreigners. After all, software engineers in Bangalore are as competent as their counterparts in Silicon Valley and are willing to write computer programs for a lot less money.
The converging fortunes of skilled workers around the world is great news for Indians (and Chinese and Malaysians). But, Wolman and Colamosca argue, white-collar workers in the West are living well on borrowed time -- much as handloom weavers rode the crest of mechanization in textile manufacturing in the 18th century before they too were displaced. The only enduring winners in the already industrialized countries, they assert, are the owners of capital and the tiny superelite composed of senior corporate executives, investment bankers and exceptionally talented entrepreneurs.
There is enough substance to this disquieting argument to make economists sit up and listen. The technological gap between the developed and less-developed worlds is shrinking; capital is pouring into Asian factories that can match the productivity of their Western counterparts. But there is a major flaw in this case against globalization: the anecdotal evidence that the wages of skilled workers are under pressure is just not reflected in the numbers.
Start with the fact that the percentage of total income going into wages has hardly budged in the past few decades. While skilled workers have certainly gained at the expense of unskilled, there is no clear trend toward rising returns to capital at the expense of labor in general. Nor is there any good reason to believe that projected gains in the productivity of skilled workers in emerging markets will undermine American prosperity -- that the worldwide growth in the supply of skills will exceed the growth in demand.
By the same token, capital and technology are indeed flowing from rich countries as multinational corporations take advantage of lower production costs. But the magnitude of these outward flows is very small compared with continuing rates of productivity-enhancing investment within the industrialized economies. Hence global economic integration is at least consistent with a future in which skilled workers in the third world get rich while those in the first world get richer.
Consistent, yes; inevitable, no. Wouldn't it be worth buying a little insurance against the Wolman-Colamosca scenario? Maybe. But the authors don't offer a credible policy for protecting the prosperity of the American labor force.
Wolman is too good an economist to buy into Perot-style trade protectionism or the supply-side fantasies that have made tax cuts Priority 1 for Congressional Republicans. Yet the authors' support for more aggressive investment in education and physical infrastructure is weak tea.
Wolman and Colamosca do devote considerable energy to denouncing central bankers who sacrifice growth in the name of fighting inflation. But it's hard to see how this applies to the United States, where capital spending has been strong through the 1990's and the Federal Reserve has allowed unemployment to dip to the lowest point in a quarter-century.
By definition, free markets dance to no one's tune. For all we really know, 10 years from now the world will have entered an intractable depression and Bill Gates will be living on food stamps. But "The Judas Economy" isn't much help in sorting through the risks of global economic integration or what might be done about it.

HEADLINE: On Language;
Shocked!

BYLINE: By Jack Rosenthal; Jack Rosenthal is the editor of the Magazine. For the past 16 years, he has written a guest column when William Safire has gone on vacation, which he has.

 BODY:
You may remember the scene in "Casablanca" when Claude Rains as Captain Renault blows his police whistle and announces that Rick's Cafe must be closed. "On what grounds?" asks Humphrey Bogart as Rick. Because "I'm shocked, shocked to discover that gambling is going on here!" If you don't remember it, not to worry. Legions of writers are eager to recall it for you. The film came out in 1942; in the 90's, the scene is cited so often that it has turned into a mock shock wave -- and a case study in cliches.
In February 1990 at a Congressional hearing, Les Aspin, then chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, took on Dick Cheney, then Secretary of Defense: "Cheney is shocked -- shocked! -- to discover that there is politics going on in this House." Within weeks, the same shocked, shocked analogy was applied to James Baker, Clark Clifford and Richard Darman. Since then, its use has been accelerating; a Nexis search produces 989 citations since the beginning of 1990. In recent weeks, it has appeared in The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times and The Seattle Times, in The Orange County Register, The Columbus Dispatch and in a front-page story in The Washington Post. Here's how the lead letter to The New Yorker began on June 16: "Jane Mayer is shocked -- shocked -- to find that Henry Regnery is a publisher with a political agenda."
A flock of other maturing cliches now flutters through public prose, usages that often are as overheated as they are overused. Consider firestorm. Once, it meant the intense conflagration created by a nuclear explosion. When the term was applied figuratively in 1973 to the Saturday Night Massacre that magnified Watergate, no one could quarrel. Since then, it has been progressively cheapened according to a kind of Gresham's Law of Language. When Anthony Lake was nominated to be Director of Central Intelligence last March, Senator Richard Shelby, the Alabama Republican, warned that unless the nomination were withdrawn, the Republicans would turn his confirmation hearings into a -- guess what? The episode was a trauma for Lake, an embarrassment for the President and a frustration for a leaderless C.I.A. But a firestorm?
Another nuclear usage, ground zero, is now as often misused as overused. It is frequently offered as a supposedly emphatic way of describing the starting point: square one. The term truly describes an ending point: the place under or above a nuclear bomb explosion. The bottom line, one might say.
Some other cliches that have spread like graffiti:
Hel-LO!, meaning wake up to the inconsistency.
Wake-up call, meaning a warning.
Poster child, or poster boy, meaning exemplar or model, as in a poster child for artistic freedom (Salman Rushdie), for campaign finance reform (John McCain) and even for economic constipation (Leon Panetta).
The clanking cliche: Why do writers grab so quickly for usages that make them look so careless or derivative? One explanation is ignorance; the writer is not consciously aware of the overuse. Another is that the writer is aware but thinks, patronizingly, that the reader is not. Sometimes, a cliche is so euphonious or so exactly fits what the writer is trying to say that it's impossible to resist: nature or nurture ... feast or famine ... mend it, don't end it.
One redeeming quality of cliches is that their meaning is perfectly clear, so clear, in fact, that they are understood even when mangled. In an article last March, I had occasion to recall how my immigrant mother expressed impatience, saying she was "sitting on pins and noodles." Deborah Tannen, the Georgetown University scholar, calls my attention to a whole catalogue of prefabricated expressions that are misconstructed but not misconstrued, like up against the wire or something along those veins.
What probably underlies every explanation of cliche use is a fundamental of communication: the desire to be heard; the hope that the more colorful one's language, the more effective. Even when overuse of an expression drains away all color and effectiveness, that hope seems to, ah, spring eternal.
 That's true, at least, of American English, but shrinking from overused forms is not universal. Tannen has written about how in some societies things are quite the reverse, where people do not stigmatize the same old same old. They prize it. What's grating is novelty.
Americans, in difficult social situations like funerals, often apologize, saying, "I know this is a cliche, but ..." or "Everyone must say this, but. ..." Turkish and modern Greek have fixed formulas in such circumstances. At a death, the Greek visitor will uniformly say, Syllypitiria, "Condolences." The response will uniformly be, Zoi se sas, "Life to you." Likewise, the Turkish visitor will say, Basin sagolsun, "May your head be alive," and the response will be, Sen sagol, "You be alive." Such fixed forms are standard in set circumstances; not to use them would be rude.
Familiar formulations have other uses in other languages. Tannen quotes Chinua Achebe, the Nigerian novelist: "Having spoken plainly so far, Okoye said the next half- dozen sentences in proverbs. Among the Ibo the art of conversation is regarded very highly, and proverbs are the palm-oil with which words are eaten."
Even so, in English, eating one's words has a different meaning altogether. In this country, if you do have to eat your words, better that they not be stale.

HEADLINE: Getting Opal Caples to Work

BYLINE: By Jason DeParle; Jason DeParle is a staff writer for the Magazine.

 BODY:
'Ooooh, I was mad!" Opal Caples says, recalling the notice from the welfare office. "They said we had to start working for our welfare check! I said, 'How could they do this to us?' I didn't feel it was right, to take our money -- that's for our children." And as a black woman living in Milwaukee's sprawling black ghetto, Caples detected a hidden agenda. No one talked about work rules in the 1930's, when "welfare was made for middle-class white women," she says. "They're really just targeting the black women."
A bright, animated, street-smart woman who punctuates her speech with knowing glances -- you know what I'm talking about, her look insists -- Caples is telling her story on the No. 12 bus one July afternoon as it shakes and wheezes down Teutonia Avenue, past the check-cashing counters, liquor stores and lounges. She has dropped her three young daughters with her cousin, Jewel (actually with Jewel's 13-year-old nephew, Little Chuck, since Jewel wasn't around), and before long she'll be toting trash and swabbing toilets in the gastrointestinal lab of a downtown hospital. It's second-shift work and she's unhappy that her girls are asleep by the time the No. 12 shakes home. "They don't even see me at night," she complains. 
 As the hours wear on, Caples never surrenders her contention that with the strict new work rules pushing people from the rolls, something dangerous and unfair is under way -- crime, drugs and prostitution will rise, since "women gonna do what they gotta do." Yet it turns out she enjoys her work. "I like this job," she says that evening, mopping the lab with the radio loud. "Every job I had, you always had somebody gawking over you. This job ain't like that." She also likes the money, which is "more than welfare was giving you anyway." At times she even sounds as if she's campaigning for the work rules she distrusts. "You ain't dealing with the system," she says. "You ain't waiting on no man. You're doing for yourself." Then just as she seems half-convinced, Caples mocks herself with a laugh. "Now if I could take a break and come back in a month!"
The program behind this tentative, conflicted handshake with work is by far the most daring to emerge since President Clinton signed last year's watershed law, imposing time limits on welfare recipients and devolving vast new authority to the states. Indeed, Wisconsin's effort represents the most complete rethinking of public assistance in the 62 years since women and children first began receiving Federal aid. For more than a year, the state has imposed the nation's most stringent work requirements. But a week from now, on Sept. 1, cash assistance in Wisconsin will essentially end. The system that will take its place goes to unprecedented lengths to construct a safety net not around a check but around a job.
It is tougher than anything that has come before: virtually no one is exempt. It is also more generous than anything that has come before: the state is offering child care and health care not just to welfare recipients but to all low-income working families, and it is creating thousands of community-service jobs. It puts new power in private hands: the entire Milwaukee system has been put out to bid, to private job-placement agencies. It is a serious, risky, expensive attempt to offer taxpayers what they claim they want and what, until now, politicians have failed to provide: a system that makes work work.
And it leaves Caples, like 40,000 other Wisconsin recipients, crossing uncertain ground. Falling somewhere between easy cases and the hardest ones, she seems to operate with a kind of dual citizenship, fluent in the language of the streets and of the working world above. She is a high-school graduate of obvious intelligence whom employers like to hire. "I have a personality that attracts people to me -- I do," she says accurately. But she loses jobs as fast as she finds them, and a few months after joining the hospital, she has supervisors fretting over her absences. That is to say she's the kind of woman -- with untapped talents and unpredictable troubles -- that the state, the nation, is seeking to transform.
A year ago, as President Clinton fulfilled his "end welfare" pledge, there was ample reason to worry. What had started four years earlier as a thoughtful plan to fix a broken system had dissolved into an election-year hazing of the poor. The long-term prospects of the new, state-controlled system remain unknown. No state has faced the economic downturn that will test its safety-net commitments. Only a handful of recipients have hit time limits.The competition among states to chase recipients away by withdrawing services and support -- the feared race to the bottom -- may still ensue.
But whether by luck or by design, the early returns offer three sources of modest reassurance -- and all are on magnified display in Wisconsin, where a robust economy and a history of progressive state government may offer a best-case glimpse of what devolution can become. Nationwide, the rolls have dropped 26 percent from their historic high three years ago, and nearly a dozen states have seen declines of 40 percent or more. But none rival Wisconsin, where the rolls have plunged more than 60 percent since their peak a decade ago. While some of those leaving the rolls have fallen into a more abject form of poverty, early evidence suggests the vast majority have not. Like Caples, so far they appear more resourceful than some people feared.
The second welcome development is the cash. Under the logic of block grants -- fixed payments pegged to the higher caseloads of a few years ago -- the falling rolls have produced a windfall even larger than expected. States will receive about $2.6 billion more from the Federal Government this year than they would have under the old entitlement system, a 16 percent increase. While some of the money is being siphoned into tax cuts and roads, most states are spending at least part of it on new services for the poor. Michigan is investing in caseworkers. Illinois is spending on child care. If Wisconsin's ambitious gamble succeeds, no one should forget the price tag. Last year, the state spent about $9,700 for every family on welfare; this year, after converting to the new, work-based program, it will spend about $15,700. That's an increase of 62 percent, and it gives women like Caples new access to child care, health care and last-resort jobs.
A third hopeful sign -- on uneven display elsewhere but unmistakable in Wisconsin -- concerns what might be thought of as a new civic energy. Legislation alone cannot move four million welfare families into the work force. The effort will require the attention of governors, bureaucrats, employers, advocates and especially the front-line workers who have major new responsibilities. For years, the welfare office has languished in torpor. But now, across the country, it is becoming a focus of creativity, a locus of hot lines, van pools, clothing closets, resume classes -- a place of policy chic.
Not all the news has been good. California and New York have just emerged from rancorous and immobilizing legislative battles that affect nearly a third of the nation's caseload. Texas has squandered its energy on a fight to hire private food stamp and Medicaid workers -- peripheral players with no role in the central challenge of putting recipients to work. No major municipal bureaucracy has shown it can overcome the vast problems that take hold when caseloads are counted by the hundreds of thousands. If the race to the bottom is one danger, so is running in place. With the economy alone driving much of the caseload reduction, even a do-little system can look good.
But Wisconsin, the policy petri dish that produced unemployment insurance, might again be on to something big. Having stumbled into a vow to abolish welfare three years before the new Federal law, the state has had to confront, more than any other, the question of what should take its place. The effort to answer has brought a civic transformation along strange-bedfellow lines. The old program was chased away by a Democratic legislator, Antonio Riley, who was once on welfare himself. The new system is being generously financed by a Republican Governor, Tommy G. Thompson, who came to office pushing a welfare cut. It is being implemented in Milwaukee with the support of a Democratic Mayor, John Norquist, who is among Thompson's main rivals.
It doesn't take a crystal ball to picture all that could still go wrong. With her attendance problems, Caples has shown she can get a job -- not that she can keep one. There are few opportunities for education and training. There may not be enough jobs to go around, and the jobs women find may not offer a route from poverty. Work may well be its own reward, but will it prove a broader elixir? It's possible that putting women to work will do nothing to shore up the prospects of men, and the absence of fathers may be the more corrosive force in the ghetto. To the extent the new system leads women to work, it also leads them away from their kids, who will be left in arrangements of varying quality. The effect on children is anyone's guess.
The economy could go bad.
Support services could erode.
Some people will surely fall through the cracks.
But these are simply the perennial concerns, and they have paralyzed policy for a generation. What's new, in Wisconsin at least, is that an unlikely constellation of characters has begun the work of addressing them.
 
The Legislator: He Knew Welfare Up Close
When Antonio Riley says that "67 percent of the people in my district are on some sort of public assistance," he is advertising his dismay and his bona fides. He makes the introduction as he drives west from downtown toward the low-rise ghetto whose 50,000 residents he represents in the state assembly. At 33, Riley has a crisp manner and New Democrat instincts. His shirt is starched. His district is not.
Once a settlement of prospering factory workers, the cityscape is marked by empty lots and hand-lettered signs on corner groceries that invite the use of food stamps. Riley's tour mixes in glimpses of an autobiography that once followed the same downward spiral. There's the house where the family lived before divorce and a stay on welfare; there's the house where Riley himself drew general relief. The tour is capped with a favorite line: "It's sort of ironic that someone like myself, someone who grew up at one point on welfare, was the one to blow up the system."
The plot began at a backyard picnic. In September 1993, Riley attended a party given by his former boss, Mayor John Norquist. Like most Democrats, they were exasperated with the state's welfare politics. Tommy Thompson, the Republican Governor, had fashioned a national reputation out of minor but well-publicized programs, and now he was at it again. Trying to beat Clinton in the race to "end welfare," Thompson was pushing a strict two-year limit -- but only in two rural counties. "He was taking credit without doing anything," Riley says. The Democrats could go along as Thompson's popularity soared or continue to be cast as the defenders of a discredited system.
As the party progressed, Riley vented his frustration to an important behind-the-scenes player. Officially, David R. Riemer served as the Mayor's chief of staff. But for years his life had been consumed by an offbeat quest to kill off the welfare system and substitute a program of community-service jobs, like the New Deal's Works Progress Administration; he had even helped start a public-jobs experiment in Milwaukee called New Hope. Hearing out Riley, Riemer threw down a dare: end it. Respond to the Governor's two-county demo by repealing welfare statewide. Riley was stunned and then intrigued -- he considered welfare "a jailer of people." With the Mayor's blessing, he and Riemer met the following week and drafted a daring one-page bill. It would repeal Aid to Families With Dependent Children, then the main Federal welfare program, and replace it with minimum-wage work.
A plan to end welfare would seem to have unlimited appeal. In reality, it raised immobilizing questions about what should take its place. It's one thing to say that women like Caples should work. It's another to explain who will hire them, care for their children and insure they have health care.
Oddly enough it was the Democrats in Wisconsin who had contemplated bolder change, most notably Norquist, who had called for the repeal of A.F.D.C. as early as 1990. But by the fall of 1993, the legislature's Democrats were still deadlocked on the underlying issues. That's when Riley floated his stripped-down idea -- end welfare by a specific date and work out the jobs program later. In a surprise move, the Democratic Speaker of the Assembly, Walter Kunicki, embraced the idea (he recalls conceiving it on his own), and it passed without a Republican vote.
Now, in a bizarre inversion of welfare politics, it was the Republicans' turn to squirm. The Democrats had become the welfare repealers. And the man out front was a black official who represented more recipients than anyone in the Assembly. The Republicans complained it wasn't a serious plan, and in a sense they were right. Half the Democrats voted for it just to put Thompson in a bind. Gerald Whitburn, the Secretary of Health and Social Services, denounced the move and all but promised the Governor's veto.
Then Whitburn had breakfast the next morning with the Governor himself. Thompson said he had no intention of a veto, and laid into him for suggesting it. By letting him end welfare without having to spell out the details, the Democrats had given him more of an opening than he ever could have won by himself. A few weeks later he signed the bill, pledging to end welfare no later than 1999.
No one had more than the vaguest idea of what would take its place.
 
The Program Director: He Hasn't Met a Recipient Unsuited for Work
The 91st Street headquarters of Milwaukee's Goodwill Industries is a 215,000-square-foot monument to the organization's motto: "We Believe in the Power of Work." Washing machines the size of freight cars fill one side of the factory, and a packing business turns the other into a shrink-wrapped cornucopia of soap, furniture polish, calendars and car locks. But the striking thing about the industrial tableau is the sight of some of the workers. There are people crossing the factory floor in wheelchairs. There are men and women with Down syndrome sorting parts through inch-thick glasses. It is the visual embodiment of Goodwill's quasireligious belief that labor is a gift everyone can give. And it is a scene that implicitly challenges the assumptions of the old welfare system, which offered cash to the able-bodied like Caples while expecting nothing in return.
The rethinking of the safety net that began four years ago has led to Goodwill's door. In designing the new program, Wisconsin Works, known locally as W-2, the state tried to make Milwaukee's 25,000 cases more manageable by dividing the city into six districts and inviting bids. Having won the contracts for two districts, Goodwill has become Wisconsin's largest welfare office, with 20 percent of the state's caseload. The $119 million contract brings the group new money to pursue its central mission of reducing the barriers to work. "We believe everyone can give something back," says William Martin, the earnest young executive in charge.
W-2 operates on the same assumption, conceiving a four-rung ladder of "work opportunities" meant to accommodate all recipients, no matter what their background or skills. At the top is a regular unsubsidized job. For those it deems "job ready," Goodwill will provide coaching, job leads and child-care subsidies, but not cash. For those a step behind, the W-2 agencies can create subsidized jobs with private employers. On the next rung down, there are "community-service jobs" -- workfare slots that demand 30 hours a week for a grant of $555 a month. And those at the bottom of the ladder, often with addictions or mental illness, will find themselves in something called Transitions. The "work" might consist partly of drug treatment or physical therapy, but it should fill 28 hours a week for a grant of $518. (Thompson is pushing to raise the grants by 20 percent.) The point is that no one should be doing nothing.
In putting the system up for bid, the state hoped to attract new energy and ideas -- to attract people like William Martin. Though Martin, 30, spent most of his earlier career in state and local government, he sometimes talks like a business student on No-Doz. He likes to talk about "getting to yes" and finding "win-win opportunities" for his clients. Welfare programs used to define their mission as "income maintenance." Martin's is called Workforce Solutions. He hopes to make Goodwill the city's pre-eminent staffing agency, the place where labor-starved employers can turn for a pool of prescreened, qualified workers. And he is offering bonuses to caseworkers with the best placement rates. "We start from a moral premise that it is simply unconscionable to leave somebody on welfare," he says. "If the goal is to get somebody out of poverty, the only way to do it is to get them a job that pays better."
W-2 pays better (for all but the largest families). Under A.F.D.C., a mother with two children received $9,456 a year in cash and food stamps. Under Thompson's plan, even Transitions would pay $10,668. A community-service job would pay $11,168. That's still 16 percent below the poverty line of $13,330 a flaw worthy of note. But the calculation changes significantly with the move to unsubsidized work. After food stamps and tax credits are added in and co-payments for child care and health insurance are taken out, even a minimum-wage job nets $16,524. (The plan to offer health care, on a sliding scale, to all low-wage workers is still being negotiated with Federal Medicaid officials.)
In theory all the supports should be in place next week when W-2 takes hold. But no one can be sure how it will work. One worry is that the contractors' financial incentives will backfire, and that they will deprive poor women of support. The W-2 agencies are being paid much like health-maintenance organizations -- they get a fixed payment to serve a pool of families. The faster they whisk them off the rolls and into unsubsidized work, the more money they make. The longer they leave clients on the bottom rungs, drawing grants and expensive services, the less money they make.
To break even, Goodwill estimates it must cut its caseload in half over a 28-month period. That has never happened, and there's not much, besides good intentions and some vague contract language, to keep a W-2 agency from declaring the most hapless clients "job ready" and withdrawing support. When I assume in passing that someone with a third-grade education would start on the third rung, in community service, Martin interrupts. "That won't keep them from getting a job in this market." Who does he have in mind for Transitions? "An individual with two broken arms and two broken legs, or severe mental illness that has not been stabilized."
That's a long way from income maintenance.
"Look at the people who go to our corporate headquarters," Martin says. "They may have command of only one muscle. And they show up. And work. Every day! All these families can succeed."
 
The Employment Counselor: She's Looking to Change Attitudes
The Opportunities Industrialization Center, or O.I.C., lies across town from Goodwill in literal and metaphoric terms. It operates from a converted theater on a down-in-the-mouth stretch of Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. A table of bow-tied Black Muslims provides the security, and pictures of black nationalists adorn the yellowed theater walls. It's not what most people have in mind when they envision a Republican work program. Like many of the group's employment counselors, Darlene Haines has much in common with her clients. A black woman raised by a single mother in Decatur, Ill., Haines had so many siblings (an even dozen) that the family ran out of names; two of her brothers are named Robert. Two siblings have been murdered and most have received public assistance. Indeed, when Haines turns to Case 2101689928, the computer screen flashes her name. Laid off a few years ago, she too applied for welfare, but her unemployment benefits left her ineligible.
W-2 leaves vast new authority with front-line workers like Haines, the $25,000-a-year gatekeepers to the new system. Their attitudes are surprisingly tough. "Some people are so lazy they don't want to do a damn thing -- hate to say it like that," Haines says. "If the system had cracked down like this years ago, it wouldn't have gotten as bad as it is." Some of the clients in turn call the caseworkers " 'hood rats," self-impressed women who recently left the rolls. "I get a lot of that, especially when I come in with a nice suit and pumps," Haines says.
But attitudes tell only part of the story; across the new system, abilities are an open question. The five agencies running W-2 in Milwaukee have widely varying cultures. Maximus is a Virginia-based, for-profit corporation. Goodwill and the Y.W.C.A. are nonprofits, but with sturdy corporate structures. United Migrant Opportunity Services, like O.I.C., is a smaller, grass-roots agency. And all are operating under contracts that, in David Riemer's view, don't do enough to distinguish between agencies that find people jobs and those that simply chase them from the rolls. "There's a danger that some providers may prove as bureaucratically dysfunctional as the welfare agencies they replace," he warns.
I watched a caseworker at one agency spend an hour just reading a list of job titles to a class of recipients. Had they awakened, this is what they would have heard: "Mathematics -- reading graphs and stuff like that -- it gets real deep when it comes to mathematics....Agriculture, that thing with cows, gets real deep -- giving them those hormones....Forestry. Why don't we see any more wolves? Somebody eating them?"
Haines has nine years of the Army behind her, but it may take that and more to reach some of the women arriving for orientation. Two bring typeset resumes, and with the Milwaukee unemployment rate at 5.9 percent (statewide it is 3.8 percent), that alone virtually guarantees a placement. Choosing from a list of immediate openings, one opts for a teller's job at an Indian bingo parlor; the other picks clerical work at an insurance company. They depart for interviews and get hired.
The rest are another story. One is crunching potato chips. Another has shown up drunk. As Haines briefly leaves the room, operatic warnings break out. "They're fixing to start a war!" one woman says. "They're building orphanages and prisons. It's going to be like in Mississippi!" Haines returns to say she has more bingo jobs for anyone who can pass a drug test. One woman wants to know if marijuana is a drug. The class heads downhill from there. "I can tell this isn't working," Haines sighs.
There is a bright spot of sorts. Needing a body for a practice interview, Haines calls on a woman wearing a blue sweatsuit and a bored look -- Opal Caples. "I know how to get a job," she says. "I just don't know how to keep a job."
After dragging herself to the front of the room, Caples more than makes her point: she knows how to get a job. Her posture straightens and the g's stop falling from the end of her sentences. "I am a courteous person," she announces to her imaginary employer. "I am hard-working. I am dependable." Passing through an invisible screen, she leaves her street persona behind.
"What motivates you to work?" Haines asks. "Being around smiling faces," Caples says, smiling.
"What are your greatest achievements?"
"Well, I graduated from high school, and back in '96, I completed a 13-week nurturing course."
"If I asked you, when could you start?"
"It would be next Monday, so I could arrange my baby-sitting situation."
"That won't be an issue?"
"No, I won't let it affect my job performance."
By now the class is roaring. "Girlfriend!" the woman with the potato chips shouts. "And you said you wasn't motivated!"
Then as soon as she returns to her seat, Caples goes back to being Caples. "I'm one of them women who don't want to work!" she says, sounding worried that no one will believe her. "I liked that welfare check."
Haines is delighted. "The sister's going to make it," she says.
 
The Architect of Reform: He Wants to Make Welfare History
Ruddy, round, rumpled and balding, and smoking a cheap cigar, Jason Turner might sooner pass for a beer distributor than a welfare intellectual. But at 44, he has been puzzling over the subject for nearly three decades. He was still in junior high school in Darien, Conn., when an article on "welfare queens" jolted him. "It hadn't occurred to me that there were whole classes of people who didn't work and who basically existed on Government charity," he says. He wondered what would happen if everyone tried that. While other students scribbled football plays, Turner began sketching plans to replace welfare with work. He was still sketching decades later when Thompson asked him to design W-2.
With the program about to begin in Milwaukee, he took off recently to check on the two sites where it has been running since March. The first stop was Pierce County, a picturesque stretch of farms and factories on the Minnesota border -- no one's idea of a welfare zone. Still, even Turner can't believe how much the rolls have fallen. A decade ago, the caseload peaked at 387. By March, when W-2 began, it had fallen to 43. It was reasonable, then, to suspect that those who remained would pose a formidable challenge.
Reasonable but wrong. Now as Turner arrives, there are only eight people still getting cash, and three just haven't been placed in W-2 yet. Two others are briefly exempt because they have infants under 12 weeks old. That essentially leaves a caseload of three, all in Transitions: one applying for disability benefits, one recovering from a car wreck and one on bed rest for a troubled pregnancy.
The rest simply made other plans after being classified "job ready." While some may have slid toward tragedy, the Pierce social workers don't think so. They found that 64 percent were employed and that 19 percent had other income from family or friends. There was no information on the remaining 17 percent, but none wound up in the child welfare system, and none have called for help.
Driving out of town, Turner says he's seeing welfare history in the making. In the past, analysts have warned that the bottom third or so of the caseload may well be unreachable, and with that in mind, most work programs have included sizable exemptions. By contrast, in designing W-2, Turner pushed the principle of immediate, universal work -- no exemptions, exceptions or delays. The real test won't occur until next month, when W-2 takes hold in Milwaukee, but the vanishing Pierce caseload deepens his conviction. "We're finding that everyone can work," Turner says.
Not much in his early life would have pointed him toward the poor. His father was an advertising executive who marketed Zest and Crest. But by high school, Turner was planning factories where welfare recipients could assemble Christmas ornaments and reap "the dignity" of work. He joined the 1980 Reagan campaign and spent five years as a Federal housing official. Getting nowhere with his welfare ideas, he left to make his millions as a landlord -- only to lose his shirt when the 25 apartments he bought in a poor Washington neighborhood were overrun with crack addicts. Still, he returned to government, as a senior welfare official in the Bush Administration, more street-smart than the average bureaucrat. "I got a ringside view for three years," he says.
Out of a job after the 1992 elections, Turner took a welfare job in Wisconsin state government. He arrived just before the Democrats killed off welfare, and the chance to design its replacement was literally an adolescent dream come true.
What's the hold of welfare policy? Turner, who has just left state government to start a consulting firm, the Center for Self-Sufficiency in Milwaukee, answers in near-religious terms. "It's plumbing the soul -- figuring out why people do the things they do."
Arriving in Fond du Lac, the other experimental site, he finds more reasons to be buoyed. The caseloads have crashed -- from 791 three years ago to 187 now. And the caseworkers seem, if anything, even tougher than Turner himself. Even a visit with Dick Schlimm, one of the town's leading advocates for the poor, produces only quibbles. If he were to design a system of his own, he says, it might pay higher wages, but "it probably wouldn't look too much different than W-2." An untouched Arch Deluxe graces the dashboard for hours, but Turner is off in the clouds. "Down to the very last line worker, they had taken to heart and acted on the conceptual framework of the reforms," he says.
 
The Shelter Operator: She Sees No Apocalypse Yet
When Barbara Vanderburgh was 13, her father gave his life to Christ -- or more precisely, to the block-long building with the sign that proclaims, "Christ Died for Our Sins." Vanderburgh was sufficiently ambivalent about her father's decision to leave the phone company and run the Milwaukee Rescue Mission that she used to duck when riding in the family station wagon, which had "Rescue Mission" written on the side. "I didn't want people to think I was living there," she says.
Now the question is, how many others will be living there, too? Across the city, soothsayers are predicting disaster. Talk of "Nazism," "slavery" and orphanages abounds, and it brings to mind the more learned warnings offered last year by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. "Just how many millions of infants we will put to the sword is not yet clear," he said, denouncing the new Federal law. "We will have children sleeping on the grates."
Events may still prove Moynihan right, but the apocalypse isn't now. Hunger and homelessness are on the rise: a system that supports families only if they work is bound to leave some more destitute. The question is whether to judge the casualties large or small -- alarming or reassuring -- in light of the vast changes under way. So far the evidence, while early and mixed, falls more on the reassuring side. "To be honest, we were braced for worse," says Vanderburgh, who now runs Joy House, the mission's family shelter.
The run-up to W-2 began in March 1996 when the city switched to a precursor system, known as "pay for performance." About half the city's recipients were placed in the program, including Caples, who greeted the development with such fury. The rules required her and others to spend 20 hours a week in a community-service job and another 12 hours looking for private work. Over the ensuing months, nearly 30 percent of the city's welfare families vanished from the rolls. Since the state refused to track them, no one can be sure where they've gone. But the evidence doesn't point toward catastrophe.
While homelessness is notoriously hard to measure, Joe Volk, the chairman of the Milwaukee Shelter Task Force, estimates that the number of families in shelters rose by about 25 percent last winter. On a given night that translates into about 41 additional families, or about 120 women and children. It's a lot when measured in human terms, but still a tiny minority of the 10,000 families who have left welfare.
The other available data hint at a similar story, of rising but manageable need. Requests for food assistance are up: the Hunger Task Force of Milwaukee saw activity at its food pantries rise by 14 percent last year. But the increase seems to be leveling off. Reports of child abuse and neglect are up. But they've risen for 12 of the last 14 years, and they are still lower than the 1994 peak. Crime, meanwhile, has declined.
One wouldn't expect the full impact to show up at once, and these numbers can be expected to rise. Inside the shelters themselves, two kinds of stories can be heard. For some women, the loss of a check merely punctuates a life of defeat. With the shelters full during a snowstorm last winter, I found myself driving a woman across town so she could sleep on a church floor. She had known that she would lose her check as soon as her work notice arrived; she was just too despondent to comply. "I stay depressed all the time," she said. It was an indescribably sad night, and one that mocks the word "reform."
But some women insist that the loss of a check can mark a turn for the better. Many of the women who have flooded Joy House are addicts, too distracted by their habits to meet the work requirements. "I'm here because I need to be here," one woman explained. "I was really jacked up." Homelessness isn't a drug treatment plan, but neither, Vanderburgh argues, was a no-strings-attached check. "People are afraid and they're looking for help," she says.
 
The Governor: He Has Become More Than a Budget Cutter
For years, Tommy Thompson's detractors waved him off as a welfare charlatan --a man grabbing big headlines with small programs while ignoring (or attacking) his critics. A centerpiece of his first governor's campaign was a modest benefit cut, with the savings shifted to job training. He moved on to Learnfare, whose chief virtue was its catchy name. Then came Bridefare and Work Not Welfare, the time-limited experiment he insisted on restricting to two rural counties. Meanwhile, he often addressed the issue with a belligerence that seemed nakedly political. When I spoke with him in 1994, just before he won a record third term, he was boasting that his programs made liberals feel like "their hearts had been cut out." Welfare, he said, was a "fantastic campaign issue."
Now the conventional wisdom about Thompson has changed: whatever W-2 may be, it is not tinkering. Antonio Riley's theory is that abolishing welfare has transformed Thompson, who understands his national reputation will be linked to the program taking its place. "He's come very far," he says. Mayor Norquist also tips his cap. "The Governor should be proud," he says, calling W-2 "perhaps the best welfare reform program in the country." Even Thompson embraces the theory of a New Thompson. "I'm a lot smarter now than I was 10 years ago," he recently told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. "I'm much more even tempered."
Curious about the change, I traveled to Madison late last month to join him for lunch. I caught him on a Thursday, the day he opens the residence grounds to the public, and our meal was interrupted by a crowd of women, staring through the dining-room windows with their noses pressed to the glass. Had they been able to listen in, they would not have heard an exercise in modesty. "Welfare reform in America would not have happened without me," he said.
At least Thompson has something to boast about now. To his credit, his theme throughout lunch concerned the need to invest. "I have debated conservatives who think that welfare reform is going to save money," he said. "And I have told them that changing a system from dependence to independence is going to cost more, because you have to put money into child care and into job training and medical care and transportation. The liberals have complimented me on that."
And after years of being accused of tinkering, Thompson chose an interesting word to describe his concerns about others. "I think other states are going to tinker with it too much," he said. "I'm somewhat fearful that they're going to have difficulty making the giant leap like we are in Wisconsin."
These are the right worries. Running a work program is costly and consuming -- it involves endless skirmishes with legislatures, bureaucrats, advocates and unions of public employees, who fear being displaced. "You have to have a lot of stamina," Thompson warns. Reports from the biggest states are not reassuring. In New York and California, the rhetoric of work has far outpaced the needed bureaucratic change, and the heavy lifting is essentially being left to the counties. (So far, the work program in New York City, while impressive in size, is mostly for single adults.)
Awash for now in Federal money, other states are investing, especially in child care. But many are also pocketing a good part of the Federal windfall. Wisconsin has reinvested the whole Federal increase, raising its spending this year from $451 million to $645 million -- a 43 percent jump in the overall budget even as caseloads fall. Thompson is spending large sums on child care, health care and caseworkers.
But his most intriguing move, and perhaps his most revealing, is his push to increase the grant levels themselves. This is, after all, the same Governor who cut benefits within months of taking office, and then froze them for the ensuing decade -- spearheading an erosion, in real terms, of about 40 percent.
Now, as a signature move under the new, work-based system, Thompson is pushing for a 20 percent increase in grants. (Community-service jobs would rise to $673 from $555, and Transitions, the work program for the most disadvantaged, would rise to $628 from $518.) In advocating the raise, Thompson overrode his closest welfare aides, and he is battling his own party in the legislature. "We had the dollars to do it and I thought that we ought to do anything we can to make this program successful," he said. "It's brought in a lot of opponents and advocates to help make the system work, instead of standing outside the tent and throwing stones at it."
The hope is that the new support is a sign of things to come, here and elsewhere. In political terms, there are two ways to view last year's epochal debate. The fear, of course, is that killing the Federal entitlement simply insures the erosion of the safety net: that politicians can always find more appealing targets than poor people to spend money on. The counter hope, perhaps a wispy one, is that converting welfare recipients to workers, even in community-service jobs, will transform their political standing. Welfare benefits have dwindled for decades, but support for the "working poor" has recently flourished.
Extending the thought, a few analysts (most prominently, Mickey Kaus) have argued that by signing the law, President Clinton has set the stage for a broader resurgence of activist government. (And a jobs program for the underclass is certainly that.) Welfare wasn't just a political yoke on the Democratic Party; its failures were an impediment to the very idea that government can help the poor.
So far, both sides in the debate -- the supporters of the new law and the critics -- can claim vindication: the safety net is growing in some places and growing holes in others. But oddly enough, Wisconsin's experiment, in the hands of a Republican Governor, has emerged as the leading hope for what government -- more government -- might accomplish in the postwelfare era.
Not surprisingly, there are still important battles being fought along those very lines. Perhaps the most significant centers on the community jobs. To truly insure that women like Caples have work when they need it, the state may have to make the jobs an open-ended offer -- a safety net of last resort. But Thompson, spooked by worries about "make work" jobs, has defined them only as short-term training. With rare exceptions, a W-2 participant can spend no more than six months in a single community-service job, and no more than two years in community service in a lifetime.
It's a view that, among other things, refuses to acknowledge the realities of recession. And so, when pressed, does Thompson. "We think a good share of the welfare people will not necessarily be the first ones laid off," he said.
What happens if W-2 gets caught in the vice of rising need and falling revenues is impossible to predict. But for now, Thompson has embraced an outline -- of jobs, child care and health care for the broad working class -- that would have been unthinkable even a few years ago. "I never dreamed we'd be at this point," he says.
 
The Recipient: Will She Learn to Live With Work?
Lumbering to a halt, the No. 12 bus leaves Opal Caples a half block from Sinai Samaritan Hospital, where she spends her evenings with a cleaning cart. Scrubbing and dusting for the next six hours, she offers a spirited monologue on the changes sweeping the city, but some of her bluntest criticisms are saved for herself. "I've always been able to work," Caples says. "I just don't always want to work."
But work runs in the family. "My mother was never on public assistance -- she always worked," Caples says proudly. Indeed, her mother spent 22 years at a Zenith factory, often holding a second job while raising five children on her own. But when Caples is asked what she was like in her youth in Chicago, she breaks out in laughter. "Bad!" she says. "I was smart, but I was out of control. I hung around the gangs." Caples eventually conformed with the conventions of responsible behavior. She graduated from high school and got a job at Wendy's. She waited until she was 22 to marry, then waited a year longer to have children, to be sure the marriage would work. It didn't. Her husband quit his factory job for the flash of a drug hustler's life. He moved in with his pregnant girlfriend and left Caples living on welfare. As for their children -- Sierra, 7; Kierra, 5, and Tierra, 4 -- "he don't call them, he don't see them, he don't buy them nothing. "
As her life unraveled four years ago, her cousin Jewel invited her to Wisconsin. A week later, she was stepping off the bus, with five suitcases and three young children to her name. Though some academics dispute it, most people in Milwaukee are convinced that their generous benefits attract women from the immense Chicago ghettos 90 miles south. Caples says nothing to dispel the theory. Her monthly benefits shot up 50 percent (from $411 to $617), while her rent correspondingly fell. "It was easier to survive," she says.
And it was easy to find work on the side. Caples can list seven jobs she has held in the past four years, and there may well be ones she has forgotten. The usual problems arose -- child-care emergencies, a terminally ill car -- but they aren't what Caples emphasizes. "I knew I always had that welfare check!" she says. But the check got harder and harder to keep. There were "all kinds of goofy classes" and endless job-search regimens. Weary of the hassles, and seeing the W-2 deadline on the way, Caples found the hospital job in February. "With this W-2, you have to work -- have to, know what I mean?" she says. "I think it's different for me now."
Is it? On the one hand, she seems to like the job. At $7.69 an hour, it pays more than she has ever made. It offers benefits -- medical, dental and life insurance. And it also offers the chance to train for other hospital jobs, which could pay up to $10 an hour. Though it involves emptying trash and cleaning toilets, she seems to feel it offers a certain status. She talks with delight about being invited to a company picnic and having doctors know her name. On the other hand, she hates working second shift, and like many inner-city women, she distrusts center-based child care, worrying about the reports of molestation that travel the ghetto grapevine. She remains convinced that W-2 is racially biased, and she even quotes Malcolm X, to warn what women without welfare may do. "Any means necessary to take care of your kids," she says. "If I don't have a job, who's to say I wouldn't prostitute myself? I pray to God it don't happen, but to some people it will."
It wasn't a complete surprise to discover, earlier this month, that Caples was missing from work. She hadn't called in for three days, and under hospital policy that probably meant she was fired. She doesn't have a phone, so I left a message with her boyfriend's mother, and the next day she placed a collect call back. The verve in her voice was gone. She and her boyfriend had had a fight, and he had moved out. She said she was too distraught the night of the breakup to bother calling work. Then figuring she was fired anyway, she simply didn't go back. Plus she now had day-care problems: Jewel had found a job, and Caples, suddenly single, had no place for her girls. "I don't know what I'm going to do," she said.
But her boss had asked me to pass on a message, and Caples sounded surprised that he wanted to see her. She summoned the courage to give him a call, and a few hours later she was in his office, describing her hapless week. When it comes to supervisors, Caples couldn't have drawn better luck. Having served on the board of a homeless shelter, Charles Lee wasn't looking to see another family on the streets. And it couldn't have hurt that he was taking a master's-degree course called Social Influences on Business Management -- and that he had written his term paper on W-2. "I know how tough it can be," he said. "I'm going to do everything I can."
Sitting in his office that afternoon, Caples wrote out a three-page plea for mercy that impressed Lee with its eloquence. She explained what had happened. She pledged to do better. She said she had arranged for child care. Lee passed it on to the hospital vice president. The appeal is pending.
It's a disappointing moment, but the architects of W-2 would call it progress. Caples may still save her job, or she may quickly find another. She may return to Darlene Haines's class and get packed off to Indian bingo. If things really fall apart, she could find herself doubled up with Jewel -- or suddenly out on the streets. The one route no longer open to her is to simply return to the rolls. She's striking off, on shaky legs, into an uncharted, postwelfare world.

An Airport With a Sauna And a Supermarket

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS 

DATELINE: AMSTERDAM

 BODY:
SCHIPHOL Airport is a curious place. For one thing, it lies at one of the lowest points of the Netherlands, at almost 15 feet below sea level. Its name literally means Ship's Hole, and until the 19th century, when the site was drained, it was indeed a large lake notorious for treacherous currents and winds. The airport's promoters, instead of lauding it as a place travelers can pass through quickly, advertise the vast complex as a shopping mall, a sightseeing spot and an art gallery.
Schiphol is all that and more. It is also a casino and a railroad station. There is a sauna on the premises. And it is consistently ranked in surveys as one of the world's best airports. 
 Schiphol's managers have now taken on the task of overhauling what surveys call one of the world's worst airports, Kennedy International in New York. Over the next five years, a Dutch-American consortium plans to give the cramped, chaotic and gloomy International Arrivals Building at Kennedy a large dose of Schiphol's sleek airiness. And last month, a group including Schiphol and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia took over operation of the outmoded Brisbane International Airport.
What is it that makes Schiphol a model of airport design? Among its virtues is its sense of light and space. The Dutch, living in one of the most densely populated countries, have been forced to think hard about the economical and comfortable use of space and how to move people through it. Although Schiphol handled 28 million passengers in 1996, its travelers could do everything in one terminal -- change planes, eat, sleep, shower, shop and fax under one roof. All the piers sprout from one central building complex.
These features have helped Schiphol please transit passengers, who make up some 40 percent of people landing here, according to Marianne de Bie, an airport spokeswoman. Ms. de Bie said surveys have shown that people also like the broad corridors with long stretches of glass walls, because they provide views and light and forestall claustrophobia.
Piers can feel long, though, and a walk from the check-in counter to the plane door can take more than 10 minutes over a distance of 600 to 700 yards. To provide visual and physical relief, each pier has a small bar and a sprinkling of carts with soft drinks and snacks as well as lounges. Rules have been set to combat frustration: maximum check-in time is 15 minutes, and maximum waiting time in immigration six minutes. Except for holiday peaks, officials believe targets are generally met.
A railroad station is beneath the terminal. Once you have picked up your luggage, you keep your cart while buying train tickets in the station hall and moving down a rolling carpet onto the platform. From here trains leave for the major Dutch cities and for Germany, Belgium and France.
Eating and drinking places are prominent. There is more than fast food to be had among the 11 restaurants and snack and salad bars. The Indonesian Far Horizons offers a Javanese buffet. The Nautilus seafood bar has smoked salmon, herring and lobster, served with Champagne or vodka.
Schiphol is also proud of its art. In fact, for its most recent expansion, it named a former museum director as the head of an art committee. Its mission: to search for "counter sculptures" to compete with "the visual violence of all the commercialism" at the airport, as the art brochure put it. The result is an array of more than 35 foreign and Dutch sculptures, ranging from works in neon to giant clogs made of stone.
"All this is to help people feel comfortable," said Ms. de Bie. Adding to the comfort of parents in particular is a children's playroom and, next to it, a baby room with cradles and playpens. Nearby is a prayer room with holy books in many languages.
Then there are the airport's more-frankly commercial aspects. The casino draws an estimated 600 people a day with roulette and blackjack tables and 70 slot machines. The unabashed heart of Schiphol, though, is its shopping center. There are two shopping centers, in fact. One is a large tax-free area, selling not only predictable souvenirs like cheeses, herrings and tulip bulbs, but also porcelain, diamonds and even medical instruments. Outside the Customs area awaits Schiphol Plaza, another arcade selling clothing, books and food and including a supermarket, all catering to ordinary shoppers, the 1,600 airport workers and the 43,000 people whose jobs involve airlines, cargo and other airport-related activities.
To soften the views, the airport has recently planted 150,000 birch trees along access roads and is about to get a park with benches and a lily pond. And for purists -- or those who need a reminder why they are here in the first place -- there is the Dutch National Aviation Museum. Its collection of about 50 planes includes Anthony Fokker's first, designed in 1910, and a C5 from 1925 -- the only Dutch military aircraft not destroyed by Germany in World War II, because it had been taken apart by students at a technical university.

HEADLINE: FILM;
A Grim Reality Check In Russia

BYLINE: By NANCY RAMSEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
"OF ALL THE ARTS, THE most important for us is the cinema," Lenin reportedly said not long after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. With a population that outside the cities was largely made up of people who couldn't read, cinema would become a "powerful media of enlightenment for the masses," he said. But today Russian film directors hesitate to tell people their profession.
"There's no prestige; it means you're very poor," says Aleksandr Baranov. 
 "People either think I'm sleeping with someone powerful or that I'm a bandita, a criminal," says Natalya Pyankova.
Six years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, filmmakers in Russia and the former republics are in crisis, much like their counterparts in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. The once powerful Mosfilm and Lenfilm Studios, which regularly produced more than 60 films a year during the Soviet era, today turn out no more than a handful. A distribution system that insured that films would play across the Soviet Union has been undermined by videotapes (many pirated), rundown theaters, audiences' inability to afford theater tickets and the popularity of Grade B American action movies.
Gone are the good old days of censors and state subsidies, when filmmakers used an Aesopian language to tell their stories, when irony, indirection, satire, humor, metaphorical language and surrealism were the esthetic. Gone too are the heady days of perestroika, when state censorship was lifted yet there was still a strong ideology to resist.
All of this is a serious jolt both to artists and to an industry that once held an exalted position, giving the world Sergei Eisenstein ("Potemkin") and Vsevolod Pudovkin ("Mother") as far back as the 1920's and, more recently, Andrei Tarkovsky ("Andrei Rublev") and Nikita Mikhalkov ("Burnt by the Sun"). The problems faced by filmmakers all over Eastern Europe are writ large in Russia, a vast, chaotic land with little tradition of democracy or market economy but a great one of holding its artists in special regard.
"In Russia, artists were always considered to be prophets," said Naum Kleiman, the director of Moscow's Film Museum. "Now artists no longer have a function in society. For us, cinema was a liberating language; we had very good and honest artists trying to bring us the truth. We had people who used to go to the cinema 40, 50 times a year. Now that audience is destroyed."
In a country where a long talk in a cramped kitchen -- over vodka, salty fish and dark bread -- would once have brought on rambling discourses on the Russian soul, talk with filmmakers today, over Turkish coffee, is about markets, distribution. Audiences were once a given, after a film was approved by censors; now, who the audience is for a particular film is open to question. And this uncertainty is affecting story lines and esthetics in general.
"For the last several years, filmmakers in Russia have been making films not for their audiences but for international festivals, boards of five to seven people," said Daniil Dondurey, editor of Film Art. "And what are those seven people expecting? They want to see that Russia is a horrible country, that a killer will never be punished, that there are no happy endings, that moral values will never win. And the director wants to show that he is a courageous boy who shows this to the world."
Such dark themes are not new. During perestroika, when it became permissible to criticize the system directly, most filmmakers found it hard to resist doing anything else. Chernukha, or blackness, became the order of the day. Vasily Pichul's "Little Vera" (1988), for instance, showed the life of a provincial working class teen-age girl in all its loneliness and uncertainty. Chernukha still holds many in its sway: Aleksei Balabanov's new film, "Brother," is about a rootless young soldier who returns to civilian life and becomes a professional killer (acclaimed at festivals, the film has yet to find a distributor in Russia).
But stories that portray the motherland as a safe house for criminals are ones that Russian audiences no longer want to see, and that filmmakers are moving away from telling.
"I got tired of so many killers and prostitutes," Mr. Baranov said of his most recent film, "Shanghai." Named after a neighborhood in Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan, the film follows seven days in the lives of several people, including a boy and his grandfather, an artist and a couple who talk of moving to Moscow. "I looked around to see how we live now," continued Mr. Baranov. "People came up to me after they saw it and said, 'It's been a long time since we've seen something that was about our own lives.' "
LAST MONTH, "SHANGHAI" was one of more than two dozen films from Russia and the former republics shown as part of the 20th Moscow International Film Festival, a biennial event. Once a grand celebration, the festival was plagued throughout its 11-day run this year by questions of whether it was appropriate to spend a reported $6 million on a festival when the industry here is near collapse. The film director Aleksandr Sokurov held up permission to allow his "Mother and Son," a meditative film with little dialogue, to be Russia's entry in the international competition, until he felt assured that the $6 million could not have been redirected to filmmaking itself. ("Mother and Son," which attracted much acclaim when it had its premiere at the Berlin festival earlier this year, will be included in the New York Film Festival, which starts next month.)
Foreign visitors viewing the Moscow festival's Russian film series at Dom Kino, the filmmakers' union headquarters, were often asked -- by Russian critics, and even promoters -- why they were not going to see the films in the international competition instead. Adding insult to injury, Dom Kino is not open to the public, and the native films scheduled to run in commercial theaters as a sideline to the festival were often canceled. One evening, at a newly renovated theater minutes from Red Square, advance tickets to one failed to sell, so a French thriller was substituted.
Nevertheless, audiences say they want to see more Russian films, or at least that's how they answered a market survey recently conducted by the new head of Gorky Studios, Sergei Livnev. Production will start next month on an ambitious project that many believe is the best hope to revive Russian film. Gorky will release 12 movies a year, filmed for approximately $200,000 apiece, with private and public financing: comedy, romance, thrillers, horrors, mysteries, all with happy endings. In a strategy to beat pirates at their own game, these movies will be released on video immediately; the best films will have a simultaneous theatrical release. "We want to create a new old habit," said Mr. Livnev. "Each month, when you leave work on, say, the 15th, you pick up the latest video in your local metro station kiosk."
Mr. Livnev, also a screenwriter and director, is new to producing; the son of a well-known documentary maker, Marina Goldovskaya, he is only 33 years old and is therefore someone who is not linked to the old state-subsidies system. His most recent film, "Hammer and Sickle," is set in 1937 and centers on a fictional sex change; it is a surrealistic, metaphorical journey into the heart of Stalinism.
Unfortunately, "Hammer and Sickle" was not on the schedule at Dom Kino, because it was held up in litigation. On the calendar were films with an assortment of themes: war, death, first love, loss of innocence, preserving one's humanity against historical currents. Few of these films lived up to the standards set by Russian cinema of years past; all were worth watching, however, for how they reflected current society.
"Cinema is a medium between myth and social reality," said Sergei Dobrotvorsky, a critic who headed the festival's jury for Russian films. "We lost our reality, the symbols of everyday being. In a Soviet film, you had recognizable symbols: a Soviet apartment, specific books, a portrait of a Russian poet and one of Ernest Hemingway on the wall. That reality is now gone, and we are waiting for a new one."
If Mr. Livnev, as a producer, is trying to create a new audience for Russian films, filmmakers are searching for that point where myth and social reality meet on the screen. The dominant esthetic that worked during Soviet days, with metaphor and irony, is no longer viable, and critics agree that a new one has yet to be created. But that does not mean that filmmakers are not working energetically in a world they did not anticipate. Aside from bringing to light wounds both old (pogroms) and new (ethnic conflict, on which "The Graveyard of Daydreams," by the Georgian director Georgi Khaindrava, stood out), here are four directions suggested by filmmakers who had movies at the festival:
* Make films with, for and about your friends. This is a deeply rooted Russian tradition: you could not count on the state, but you could count on your friends. Ms. Pyankova's "Strange Times" focuses on the lives and loves of three characters in Moscow. Critics immediately understood its title and enjoyed its playfulness as men and women couple and uncouple.
* Focus on chernukha's antithesis: svetlukha, or lightness. "I want people to laugh when they see my film," said Murad Ibragimbekov, the director of "A Man for a Younger Woman." This film is based on a story by Mr. Ibragimbekov's father, a well-known Azerbaijani writer: A middle-aged businessman visits an alchemist for a youth potion so that the young actress he's in love with will not leave him. He's sent to scrape off bits of a rhinoceros's horn, which lands him in jail. The moral? Accept your fate.
* Stick to the tried and true, but give it more form. "Form is important, content is not," said Abai Kharpikov, director of the stylized thriller "The More Tender One." Mr. Kharpikov, along with Baranov, is one of several filmmakers who came to be known as the Kazakh New Wave in the late 1980's. They hailed from Kazakhstan, a republic settled by Khrushchev, which had in effect lost its history and gained a Soviet one. And they reveled in making "easterns," taking their lead from American westerns, French New Wave and the directors' own sense of filmmaking as a game. Set in the vast open spaces of their beautiful and desolate native land, the films offered a metaphor for the vacuum left when the walls of the state collapsed.
* Be experimental and don't apologize for it. (Grants from the West are easier to come by if you call yourself experimental.)
One sideline to the festival was a program run by the Parallel Cinema group, who began life in the Leningrad underground in the 1980's. (This work was intended to run parallel to, or coexist with, official state cinema.) Their films and videos included older work by the Necrorealists, who substituted metaphors for a dying society for the socialist realism canon; one critic described their work as "a harsh tragicomic vision suffused with traces of black humor, surrealism, slapstick and a punk industrial style."
GLEB ALEINIKOV IS ONE of the more talented of the Parallel Cinema group. Mr. Aleinikov, along with his brother Igor, made "Tractors" in 1987, satirizing and eroticizing that most sacred of socialist realist symbols. After Igor died in a 1994 Aeroflot crash, Gleb ceased being productive for a while, but he recently began working again and just completed a road movie begun in 1990.
"We got used to the new," said Mr. Aleinikov of both his generation and the last 10 years in Russian society. "During perestroika, there was always something new. Then after the putsch, until 1995, people were waiting for something to happen. Now we know what our situation is, and that we have to act within this new world."
Russia has always had an uneasy relationship with the present. "It's an old Russian tradition, going back to Peter the Great," said Mr. Kleiman of Moscow's Film Museum. "We're in a constant war with the past, we're looking ahead with hope to the future, and we don't pay attention to the present. But the situation today is completely new. Imagine being asleep for 70 years, waking up, and the first place you're standing is on the edge of a roof. It's a little hard to keep your balance."

HEADLINE: Sales-Tax Waiver Leads to a Debate

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
WESTCHESTER County sales-tax revenue is pouring in at record rates, making some officials eager to eliminate the sales tax permanently on some clothing purchases, and others nervous that such an exemption will create a large hole in the budget.
Last week, the Board of Legislators voted to take part in a state program that waives the collection of sales tax on clothing purchases of less than $100 during the week of Sept. 1. Under state enabling legislation, local governments that collect sales taxes may permanently eliminate the sales tax on those clothing purchases beginning in 1999. 
 Westchester levies a 1.5 to 2 percent tax on sales, with some of the funds shared with local school districts. In addition, the state collects a 4 percent tax, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority a 0.25 percent tax and White Plains, Yonkers, Mount Vernon and New Rochelle impose their own sales taxes.
Joseph E. Phelan, the county's Budget Director, estimated that the county government would lose about $500,000 just from the one-week moratorium and about $20 million a year from a permanent exemption, although he said precise figures could not be provided.
The decision by the Board of Legislators to take part in the one-week exemption was unanimous. "Eliminating the sales tax on clothing will give an added boost to Westchester's economy, and everyone will benefit," said Paul J. Noto, a Republican from Mamaroneck, in a news release before the vote. "I am hopeful that this trial period will pave the way to the eventual elimination of the sales tax on clothing."
But a fellow Legislator, Richard G. Wishnie, a Democrat from Briarcliff, said he was concerned about the county's making the exemption permanent. "When you talk about losing $20 million from the revenue stream, you have to understand that that is equal to about a 5.7 percent increase in property taxes," he said. "Who's going to pay? People should understand that what the government gives with one hand, it takes away with the other."
Mr. Wishnie said he was resigned to the fact that for competitive reasons Westchester would have to join in the permanent-exemption program in 1999 if New York City and Nassau did. But he said he hoped to persuade his colleagues to ask the State Legislature to eliminate the exemption entirely. Mr. Phelan of the Budget Office said sales tax revenue is flowing in at a record rate. From 1992 through 1995, it grew an average 3.6 percent a year, but in 1995 and 1996 the growth was 8.5 percent each year, or $15.6 million more than the year before.
He said 1997 collections were also going strong, with the county already at least $3 million ahead of a projected $204 million for 1997. He attributed this to a good economy, the soaring stock market and the 1995 opening of The Westchester mall.
The total state, M.T.A., county and local sales tax collected in Westchester is 6.75 percent in towns, villages and the cities of Rye and Peekskill; 7.75 percent in White Plains, and 8.25 percent in Mount Vernon, Yonkers and New Rochelle.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
Economy Prods Hotel Construction

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
WITH a strengthening economy business and leisure travelers have taken to the road, pushing up hotel occupancy and room rates and, in turn, prompting developers to bring new rooms to the market across New Jersey.
Evidence of that is in the number of lodgings recently opened, under way or planned in the state, including some in the Secaucus Meadowlands, Princeton and along the Hudson River in Jersey City. 
 All told, the projects could produce more than 2,000 new rooms to add to the state's current supply of 94,000, according to the New Jersey Hotel and Motel Association in Trenton.
Joseph A. Simonetta, the group's executive vice president, said that there was "more than enough demand to fill whatever supply is coming on board."
Tourism, the second largest industry in the state after the pharmaceutical industry, generated $24.6 billion in 1996, up $1 billion from 1995, according to the latest figures from New Jersey's Division of Travel and Tourism.
As of the first half of this year Cushman & Wakefield, the national brokerage, reported the vacancy rate for the 11-county northern New Jersey office market at 15.1 percent, down from 17.9 percent the same time last year. Moreover, speculative office construction is under way for the first time in a decade in some of the state's tightest markets.
John A. Fox, senior vice president of PKF, a hotel and real estate consulting firm based in Manhattan, said areas of the state close to New York City were benefiting from a spillover from the city's strong hotel market.
In the first six months of this year New Jersey's hotel occupancy rate was 67.5 percent, up from 66.5 percent the same time in 1996, according to Smith Travel Research in Hendersonville, Tenn., which reports on the market for hotel companies nationwide. The national rate was 64.9 percent. And average room rates in New Jersey hotels rose 6.5 percent to $82.35; in the nation it rose 6.6 percent to $74.50.
"The numbers are improving to the point to justify new construction," said Mr. Fox, noting that activity was expected to continue through the end of the decade.
Hotel construction, and planning for new hotels, are being stoked by the availability of financing, analysts said. For the first six months of this year 59 permits were issued or updated for all types of lodgings, most of them hotels -- up from 38 the same time last year, according to state figures.
In New Jersey, as in the nation, most of the new hotels are moderate-priced, limited service and all-suite. Typically, they lack the abundance of meeting rooms, large restaurants and shops found in traditional full-service hotels.
Their appeal to developers is plain: They are smaller, easier and less expensive to build and, in turn, easier to finance, said Mark V. Lommanno, executive vice president of Smith Travel Research.
LENDERS still require 20 to 25 percent equity participation from builders, which will help keep supply in balance with demand, added Patrick Ford Sr., president of National Hotel Realty, a research firm in Portsmouth, N.H. Developers say New Jersey's long approval process, strict zoning and high land costs will also temper the pace of construction.
The key market for limited-service and all-suite hotels is the corporate traveler. "What that means," said Mr. Ford, "is that they are going up in developed areas and into and around office developments."
Indicative of that is the cluster of hotels that recently opened or are planned in Morris County, among the more active office markets in the state.
Summerfield Hotel Corporation of Wichita, Kan., has opened two hotels in the same Morris County town. One is a 136-suite hotel on Route 10 in Hanover on that town's side of the 1.5-million-square foot Prudential Business Campus, which straddles the Parsippany border. The other is a 133-suite hotel on Columbia Turnpike on the Hanover/Morristown line.
"There may be some overlap, but generally speaking the office market in the county can support both because it is so large," said Dennis S. Meikleham, vice president of real estate and development at Summerfield.
Others agree. G. Holdings Corporation of Manhattan is seeking approvals to build a 150-room Courtyard by Marriott on a site in the Morristown Airport complex, also in Hanover. It is one of five Marriott Courtyard hotels planned or under way in the state.
The other four hotels -- in South Brunswick, West Orange, Princeton and East Rutherford, totaling 550 rooms -- are to open by the fall of 1998, said Geary Campbell, a spokesman for the chain, a division of Marriott International Corporation in Bethesda, Md.
As for the Hanover site, Ronnie Gross, executive vice president of development at G. Holdings, said that beyond the area's office buildings "business travelers use the airport and as the last site inside the airport it is suited, and zoned, for a hotel." He added that "demand is high and there is room for expansion."
Farther west in the county a 141-room Wyndham Garden Hotel opened last June at the International Trade Center in Mount Olive. It the first hotel in the 670-acre business park off Exit 25 of Interstate 80 and among the few new full-service hotels to go up in the state. The business park is home to companies with 6,000 employees.
THE hotel was built by the center's developers -- The Rockefeller Center Development Corporation, part of the Rockefeller Group, and Leslie E. Smith Jr., a builder and the center's executive director. It is being managed by Wyndham Hotels & Resorts in Dallas. The corporate room rate is $105 a night.
Mr. Meikleham said Summerfield was "very positive about New Jersey because it has a tremendous number of areas with a concentration of offices." To that end it is also building a 128-suite hotel on Route 22 in Bridgewater in Somerset County, another active office market. And in Piscataway, not far from Rutgers University, it will start construction on a 113-room Sierra Suite, the company's more moderate-priced product.
Mr. Meikleham would not disclose room rates at Summerfield's four new hotels but said they would be higher than the average nightly corporate rate for its chain nationwide, which is $116. He added that the average for Sierra Suite hotels was about $55. Mr. Meikleham said his company hoped to build four to six more hotels in the state.
Prime Hospitality Corporation of Fairfield is building two AmerSuites hotels near office hubs. One, with 124 rooms, is in Princeton along the Route 1 business corridor. The other, with 159 rooms, is in the more than 2-million-square foot Harmon Meadow mixed-used development in the Secaucus Meadowlands. The average room rate is $80 at the Princeton hotel and $90 for the one in the Meadowlands.
David Simon, president of Prime, said the fundamentals of the New Jersey hotel market supported new ventures, but "they need to be hotels that fit the right product to the right market niche." He said Prime was "bullish" on areas near strong office and retail centers and intended to open up to eight more hotels in the state in the next three years.
IN Jersey City ground was broken last June for a 13-story, 200-room Club Hotel by Doubletree one block from the Hudson River waterfront, where 8.6 million square feet of offices line the river's edge. It will be the first hotel in the city in decades and the only one on its riverfront.
"Jersey City is already an important business center, now that there is a hotel to accommodate that community," said Emanuel Stern, president of the real estate division of Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus. Hartz is developing the hotel with the local Garden State Development Inc. It is expected to open in the summer of 1998. The average room rate will be $120, said Mr. Stern.
In Atlantic City, the 502-room Sheraton Atlantic City Convention Center Hotel is scheduled to open in November next to the $318-million new Atlantic City Convention Center. While it will not have a casino, it will have a skywalk to the exhibit hall level of the convention center.
By the end of 1999, the number of casino hotel rooms in Atlantic City will triple from the present number to more than 27,000, according to the Atlantic City Convention and Visitors Authority.

A Waterfront Awash in Reclamation Projects

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

DATELINE: GLEN COVE

 BODY:
THE 214-acre area bordering both sides of Glen Cove Creek and fronting on Hempstead Harbor has some of this North Shore Nassau community's most spectacular water views. It also contains some of its worst blight.
A smokestack towers over decayed buildings that cover a 26-acre tract once occupied by Li Tungsten, a metal smelting and refining company. A 1.9-acre section once housed the Mattiace petrochemical plant. Both properties are federally designated Superfund sites now undergoing a $20 million cleanup by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency. The cleanup is expected to take to the end of the century to complete. 
 Along Garvies Point Road, a 23-acre meadow of wildflowers blooms deceptively. It covers a former city landfill that has been designated a hazardous-waste area by New York State. Over it loom the skeletons of apartment buildings that were never completed because of the contaminated ground.
A junkyard, an asphalt plant and the former city incinerator, now a garbage transfer station, are other neighborhood eyesores. "We have 10 miles of waterfront, of which nine miles are beautiful and one mile is environmentally blighted," said Mayor Thomas R. Suozzi. But if a five-year waterfront revitalization plan that he is spearheading materializes, all that would change, he said.
The proposal outlined in a master plan prepared by Jambhekar Strauss, architects and land planners in Manhattan, divides the 214-acre area into seven distinct sectors. It calls on private owners and investors to work with the city in building a bustling maritime center containing, among other things, hotel and conference facilities, restaurants, marine-related stores and a museum.
Glen Cove is not alone in working to revitalize its waterfront. Encouraged by the availability of state and Federal funds for such projects, Port Jefferson, Greenport, Patchogue and Long Beach, among others, are also implementing plans to reclaim dormant and often blighted waterfront.
But Glen Cove's proposal, needing an estimated $280 million investment over five years, is the most ambitious.
"Our objective is to transform the 214 acres into a regional tourist attraction that would capitalize on the city's Gold Coast history and on the natural beauty of the area," Mayor Suozzi said, adding that he envisions creating a destination point equal in appeal to Newport, R.I., and Mystic Seaport in Connecticut.
Upgrading three existing marinas, adding more boatyards, a fish market, and a ferry terminal with high-speed commuter service to Manhattan and conventional ferry service to Connecticut and Westchester are also envisioned.
To help create jobs, the development of offices and light industry would be encouraged to supplement the existing small industrial operations.
Pedestrian walks and bikeways would link the various attractions and businesses. A new access road would bring Glen Cove's downtown within easier reach and hikers would be given better access to the adjoining 68-acre Garvies Point Preserve, owned by Nassau County.
Some pieces of the plan other than the Superfund cleanup are already falling into place. The Army Corps of Engineers has dredged one-third of the mile-long Glen Cove Creek. And the city has received more than $1 million in New York State grants, including a $570,000 Department of Transportation grant for the restoration of Mill Pond at the head of the creek.
An agreement has been worked out under which the city, with the aid of state funds, will clean up the 23-acre Garvies Point Road site, which the Maryland Deposit Insurance Fund in Baltimore took over as receiver of assets belonging to the failed Old Court Savings & Loan of Baltimore and its subsidiary, Village Green Realty at Garvies Point.
Bids on the property, which is valued at around $16 million, are now being solicited by the receiver. In return for the cleanup, the insurance fund has agreed to pay the state up to 12 percent of the net proceeds from the sale. Glen Cove will either receive a portion of the property or a payment equal to 25 percent of net proceeds.
Some of the area's property owners are already making investments based on expectations of a better future.
"I see this plan as a great opportunity," said Joseph Weiser, owner of the 180-slip Jude Thaddeus Glen Cove Marina. He said he had invested $1 million in new bulkheading and also intended to invest $5.5 million in building a 250-seat restaurant, a 24-unit boatel, retail outlets, and other facilities on the 17-acre site and to expand the number of boat slips to 240.
In Port Jefferson, voters will be asked in an October referendum to approve a proposed $1.7 million acquisition by the village of a 5.1-acre waterfront site on East Broadway owned by the Mobil Corporation. The property, once used for oil storage, and an eyesore for years, would become the only village-owned parcel on the waterfront.
UNDER a plan developed for the village by Martin R. Cantor of Melville, a planning consultant, and Cashin Associates, a Hauppauge engineering and architectural firm, the site would become a park with a bandshell, a marina, and a museum focusing on the village's maritime history.
"This would take a very important piece of Port Jefferson, and make it a focal point as you come in by water, as well as a tourist attraction," said Robert L. Strong, the village's mayor.
A similar plan is being developed by the Village of Greenport, which last September acquired a 3.1-acre parcel on Front Street for $1.2 million.
Dilapidated buildings have been cleared for a complex that will include an enclosure for the village-owned carousel, a berth for the Regina Maris, a 100-year-old sailing ship, and a village green. A pedestrian walkway along the waterfront will lead to the Long Island Rail Road train station.
Largely as a result of village ownership of the property, a trial weekend high-speed ferry run from Manhattan was begun by New York Fast Ferry Services of Staten Island on Aug. 15. If the demand warrants, it will resumenext summer. Dock space was provided by the village.
"We have made an investment in ourselves by turning around a site that economically and physically has been a problem for the last 20 years," said Mayor David E. Kapell. "And by doing so we have sent a message to the outside world that Greenport is an interesting place to be."
The Village of Patchogue is also moving forward with plans to redevelop land along the Patchogue River as a tourist area with a new Fire Island ferry terminal. A startup awaits completion of a sewer extension and a possible land swap with the Federal Government.
And in Long Beach, the city has issued requests for proposals, due Saturday, for hotel and retail development on a six-acre oceanfront site between Long Beach and Riverside Boulevards. The property has several private owners, but the city intends to acquire it "through condemnation if need be," said City Manager Edwin L. Eaton.
The request for proposals developed for the city by Hospitality Consulting Services, of Mineola, calls for a $35 million project that would include a 150-suite, extended-stay hotel with conference and banquet facilities and a 125-seat restaurant.
"Right now there is no hotel in Long Beach and we are the only waterfront community on Long Island with no waterfront restaurant," Mr. Eaton said. "This would give a completeness to the revitalization efforts that have been going on here for 15 years."
State financing for waterfront revitalization projects is being made available through, among other sources, the $1.75-billion Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act approved by voters last November, and from the Environmental Protection Fund created in 1993, which provides $100 million annually statewide in grants to environmental projects.
"We are trying to help local governments to understand the importance and value of their waterfronts and to articulate a vision of what they would like their waterfronts to be," said George R. Stafford, director of the coastal resources division at the New York State Department of State, which serves as the liaison with local governments.
Municipalities will have a chance to discuss state grant opportunties with officials of several state agencies at a meeting to be held at the State University of New York at Stony Brook on Sept. 15.

HEADLINE: The Taming Of the 'Wild West'

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
IMPROBABLE as it sounds, the sun may finally be rising in the west -- that is, the farthest western reaches of mid-Manhattan. A combination of forces could induce some of the development in the West 30's and 40's that has been anticipated, with little result, since the foundations were laid 16 years ago for the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.
A necklace of economic activity now rings the district, with the boom in Times Square, residential construction in Clinton, major property transactions in the Garment Center and the growing vibrancy of Chelsea. One would expect that development must inevitably spill over. 
 Of course, that has been expected before. Yet the area, where the sky stretches high and wide, still has a touch of frontier to it. The newest local landmark is a covered wagon at the Gold Rush Bar and Grill on 10th Avenue. Hooves clip-clop along 11th Avenue, where horse-drawn carriages are stabled. There is even an occasional shoot-'em-up, as when Federal agents and drug dealers traded gunfire in broad daylight at 10th Avenue and 34th Street earlier this month.
But the "wild west" days may be nearing an end.
More than $175 million in public financing has been cobbled together toward the $315 million cost of creating a new Penn Station in the neo-classical shell of the General Post Office, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues.
For rivergoing commuters, N.Y. Waterway is proposing to build a glass-walled West Midtown Union Ferry Terminal, at a cost of $8 million to $10 million, at the foot of 39th Street.
The Javits Center is to spend $12 million to $15 million on a renovation that will carry it through the near term, while it lays out long-term plans for a major expansion northward.
Four blocks north, Silverstein Properties and the Equitable Life Assurance Society are prepared to begin a $190 million, 40-story, 921-apartment tower at 42d Street and 12th Avenue, to be followed by a near-twin on 11th Avenue.
"The neighborhood is a lot better than the image people had," said Mortimer B. Zuckerman, chairman and co-publisher of The Daily News, who faced "a lot of nervousness" among employees two years ago when he moved the newspaper to 450 West 33d Street. But it worked out "very, very well," he said -- so well that he has just leased another 100,000 square feet in the building -- a giant, sloping-sided structure that spans the rail yards for two blocks along 10th Avenue. There Mr. Zuckerman will move the business staff of U.S. News & World Report, from Washington, and the headquarters of Applied Graphics Technologies, a digital prepress service company now at 28 West 23d Street.
Three years ago, 450 West 33d Street stood almost half empty and prospective tenants were leery, said Richard G. Karson, senior managing director of the Insignia/ Edward S. Gordon Company, which manages the building. (It is owned by the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company.) "The biggest problem we had to overcome was fear," Mr. Karson said. "We were in the 'wild west.' Now we're almost in the core of what's being redeveloped."
Standing on the roof with Mr. Karson, it is not hard to understand his view of geography. To the west are the Long Island Rail Road's John D. Caemmerer yards, where a new Yankee Stadium has been envisioned.
To the east is the James A. Farley Building, which serves as the General Post Office. Within this structure is a 36,000-square-foot courtyard that would be covered with a glass roof to serve as the Amtrak concourse, reclaiming for intercity railroad passengers some of the grandeur that was lost when the first Penn Station was demolished in the early 1960's. Both buildings were designed by McKim, Mead & White.
Most of the underground train platforms extend as far west as the Farley building, meaning that they would be directly under foot and easily reachable. Passengers and visitors would enter at sidewalk level from 31st or 33d Streets -- no need to lug suitcases up that imposing flight of steps.
IN the last two months alone, the Penn Station project has secured commitments of $35 million from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, $25 million from the New York City Economic Development Corporation, $20 million in the New York State budget and $14 million from the Federal Railroad Administration.
"It's become real," said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, which manages the project through a subsidiary, the Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment Corporation.
Across from the Farley Building, at Ninth Avenue and 33d Street, is the site of an office building proposed in the 1980's and designed by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates, whose office is nearby. The tower was to have had 32 stories and 1 million square feet of space but it foundered with the rest of the market.
Plans are now being dusted off by Harvey Schulweis of Schulweis Realty, who controls the property. A tenant whom he declined to identify is interested in a new headquarters. "They feel that the location has come of age," Mr. Schulweis said. "In addition, it's one of the few sites around that has all the necessary approvals to proceed."
Intriguing as all the talk is, however, for the moment it is only that. Shovels have yet to turn over a spadeful of earth.
"Believe me, if it was viable to build there, we'd be the first people in," said Jeffrey Katz of Sherwood Equities, who owns eight properties along West 34th Street and 10th Avenue.
Mr. Katz said the area had the advantage of being contiguous to the commercial core of midtown while requiring relatively little displacement. But he does not think the Penn Station and Javits Center projects alone will spark redevelopment. That will not happen, Mr. Katz said, until Times Square is more fully built out and the real estate market is expanding; certainly not in the next two years or in this cycle.
Barry Gosin, vice chairman and chief executive of Newmark & Company Real Estate, added another necessary ingredient: "It will have to be gentrified first. You've got to get residential. You've got to get retail. You've got to get a life."
Enter Larry A. Silverstein, who thinks the time is right for two apartment towers on a full-block site between 11th and 12th Avenues, 41st and 42d Streets. "What makes it feasible now is a very attractive rental market where the demand is clearly in excess of supply," he said.
The first tower, River Place 1, will include a 34,000-square-foot sports club with a pool and tennis and basketball courts; a 30,000-square-foot restaurant; 10,000 square feet of convenience shops and 200 parking spaces for tenants. A half-acre park will run through the middle of the block. Mr. Silverstein said he expected to begin construction this year. Lehrer McGovern Bovis is the general contractor.
Most apartments will be studio or one-bedroom units, for single tenants, young couples and roommates pooling rent. "My sense is that the people who will work in and around Times Square will be the people who will be renting from us," Mr. Silverstein said. "It's the walk-to-work group.
Once this tower is substantially rented, Mr. Silverstein said, work will begin on River Place 2, a virtual twin. There will also be 500 transient parking spaces.
River Place was designed by Costas Kondylis & Associates in an undulating form to take advantage of the many vistas. Each floor is an unbroken ribbon of glass.
Eighty percent of the apartments will be rented at market rates, currently about $1,350 a month for a studio, and 20 percent will be subsidized and made available to tenants whose income is less than half the median income for New York City.
As an "80-20" project, River Place will be financed in part through the sale of $138 million in bonds by the New York State Housing Finance Agency. An "80-20" project is also eligible for 20 years of real-estate tax abatements.
What is not known yet is whether the Silverstein towers will prove to be unmovable objects in the face of the irresistible force known as the Javits Center.
The center has embarked on an interim renovation, designed by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, to freshen and brighten the Galleria, River Pavilion, meeting rooms, conference rooms and restrooms.
But even 6,000 yards of carpet cannot obscure the larger issue. The Javits Center has 760,000 square feet of exhibition space, putting it behind Chicago, Las Vegas and Atlanta. Bookings at Javits increased 19 percent in the last year, as measured by square footage for each show. And a report by the consulting firm of Coopers & Lybrand said trade shows -- by far the largest users -- would keep expanding. "Numerous events currently require or will soon require additional space," the report said.
The Javits Center "could achieve maximum occupancy" by doubling its exhibition space to 1.5 million square feet, Coopers & Lybrand concluded. Gerald T. McQueen, president of the center, said last month that the likeliest expansion route would involve the three blocks from 39th to 42d Street.
Were the center to expand north, the first property it would encounter would be the former Yale Express System truck garage on 12th Avenue, between 39th and 40th Streets. This is owned by Mr. Silverstein, who said he would entertain the idea of swapping it for development rights on the 11th Avenue end of the block -- a perfect spot for a convention-related hotel.
The developer believes his 42d Street site is protected by an intermediate property: the M.T.A.'s West Side Bus Depot, between 40th and 41st Streets. This structure, with its drum-like facade, was built by Greyhound and refurbished by the authority at a cost of more than $35 million. "It serves as a major impediment to any convention center expansion," Mr. Silverstein said.
And Jo Ann Macy, co-chairwoman of the Clinton land-use and zoning committee of Community Board 4, said that while neighbors expect the Javits Center to grow, "their concern is having a megastructure that isn't sensitive to people's access to and views of the waterfront."
BUT Mr. Gargano, a board member of the Convention Center Development Corporation, said the first phase of the expansion would stop short of the depot, "and then we would look at alternatives."
Whatever happens at the depot, the area's complex infrastructure of roads, rails and piers will play a major role in shaping its future. "Anything that would encourage any new use or development would have to be looked at in terms of transportation," said Joseph B. Rose, director of the City Planning Department, which is now preparing a transportation study of the area.
The most ambitious of the transportation projects involves the creation of a new Penn Station, taking as much as half of the 1.4 million-square-foot Farley Building. As envisioned by state officials, the new station would have 200,000 square feet of retail space, 200,000 square feet of public space, up to 200,000 square feet of office space and 75,000 square feet for Amtrak operations.
"It will be almost like a shopping mall combined with a transportation facility," Mr. Gargano said. "Retail is a necessary part of this project, to create the revenue stream that we need to support it."
Speaking of the city's recent $25 million contribution, Charles Millard, president of the Economic Development Corporation, said the project was closely allied with efforts to retain and attract companies.
"If you think of Penn Station as a hassle-filled, gray, dirty, grimy place," Mr. Millard said, "you might think you can do business just as well in Jersey City."
The city, state and Federal governments are expected to cover $200 million of the total cost, with a private developer providing the other $115 million, 20 percent of which would be eligible for a historic preservation tax credit. Each level of government has two representatives on the board of the redevelopment corporation. The president is Alexandros E. Washburn, an architect who was formerly public works adviser to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
The next step is to negotiate with the Postal Service, Mr. Gargano said. Once it is known how much space Penn Station will occupy, a request for design proposals can be issued, perhaps by the end of the year. And once the design is completed, a request for development proposals will follow.
On the nearer horizon is N.Y. Waterway's plan for a 40,000-square-foot ferry terminal, replacing a city-owned garage on Pier 79. The company now serves 9,100 passengers a day at Pier 78. It expects daily ridership to reach 21,000 in the next six years.
The new terminal, designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, would have six slips, for use by N.Y. Waterway and other operators. There would be small strips of convenience shops on the north and south ends. On the waterfront side, the structure would be girdled by a 37-foot-wide mezzanine walkway.
"It is intended not only to enhance mass transportation options but to hasten redevelopment and facilitate enjoyment of waterfront," said Arthur E. Imperatore Jr., president of both N.Y. Waterway and Arcorp Properties.
Mr. Millard agreed that the terminal had such potential. "It is the kind of transportation service that does open new areas to development," he said.
Even as they pursue one plan on the west side, the Imperatores are abandoning another one: a multi-use complex along 11th Avenue, from 36th to 38th Streets, that was to have included a 34-story apartment building, 17-story hotel and 6-story garage.
The site is for sale, Mr. Imperatore said, because it no longer fits the corporate strategy, which is concentrated on planning and developing property in New Jersey and on the burgeoning ferry business.
On a smaller scale, residential redevelopment is tentatively planned for the former Hobb Electric Supply Company building, a six-story, Romanesque structure at 541 West 34th Street. Ron Cohen, senior managing director of Insignia/Edward S. Gordon, who represents the owners, said a buyer would convert the 74,000-square-building to loft apartments and might even build an addition. "That will be a pioneer for the neighborhood," Mr. Cohen said.
It is worth recalling that other pioneers have perished in this terrain. Thirty years ago, Lazard Freres bought the air rights over the railroad tracks west of Penn Station, planning a high-rise apartment complex called Chelsea Place, designed by Philip Johnson, and a distribution center for the garment industry called Westyard.
Nothing came of the housing, although the Westyard Building, now 450 West 33d Street, was finished in 1970 to designs by Davis, Brody & Associates (now Davis Brody Bond). "A confident giant standing astride a broad valley," as The Architectural Record put it, this 1.6 million-square-foot behemoth spans the 220-foot-wide railroad cut.
Today, tenants include the Chase Manhattan Bank, Lerner New York, the New York City Financial Information Services Agency and the Daily News, with Mr. Zuckerman's other companies to arrive this fall.
"It's certainly not as convenient as East 42d Street," Mr. Zuckerman conceded. "But my theory is that reporters should be out of the building anyhow. The same thing is true of advertising people."
The most noteworthy space for rent is the 16th floor, which used to be Sky Rink skating arena. Its centerpiece is a column-free space, 200 by 100 feet. The room is 22 feet high and lined by clerestory windows.
Fred C. Trump 3d, director of the Gordon Property Group, played hockey at Sky Rink in his youth. Running his shoe over the dry bed in which the rink sat, he said, "I joke that this is the best the ice surface has ever been." Now he is showing the space to foreign banks for use as a trading floor.
THE expansive floors and high ceilings at 450 West 33d Street have also attracted the attention of Channel 13/ WNET, which is exploring the possibility of moving to new quarters. Mr. Millard said there is a "surprising amount of interest" generally in television or movie studio space in the area.
The neighborhood is already home to the studios of major architects and designers. There is an entire colony of them in the former Hill Building, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street: Gwathmey Siegel & Associates, Richard Meier & Partners, Vignelli Associates and Buttrick White & Burtis.
One of the few architectural gems in the area, 475 10th Avenue is a gleaming white 14-story structure, built in 1914 to designs by Starrett & Van Vleck. It originally housed the Hill Publishing Company, at a time when the competing McGraw Publishing Company was at 239 West 39th Street. After the two merged, McGraw moved into the Hill Building, where it remained until 1931.
At the initiative of Robert Siegel, the Gwathmey Siegel firm moved to the building 15 years ago. "We're very happy," said his partner, Charles Gwathmey. As well they might be, paying $7.50 a square foot for space with 14-foot ceilings that is minutes from Penn Station, the Port Authority Bus Terminal and the Lincoln Tunnel.
Surveying the surroundings, Mr. Gwathmey said: "Slowly, the housing fabric is being renovated. The adjacent loft buildings have been upgraded. And you get a sense that there's more density, more people."
"I didn't realize how residential this neighborhood is," said Keith Liles, one of the managers of the Gold Rush, which opened last month at 10th Avenue and 38th Street. Designed by RAM Innovations of Manhattan, it was aimed at the crowd coming and going from Javits. But many other patrons have materialized.
"We have a lot of neighborhood people," Ms. Liles said. "And we get a late-night hit from the buggy drivers. They all drink here from 2 A.M. to 4 A.M. every night."
Perhaps there's some frontier spirit yet.

HEADLINE: The View From: Redding;
Fields of Flowers for Everyone to Pick

BYLINE: By ANDREA ZIMMERMANN 

 BODY:
IF you have the urge to snip a snapdragon or sniff sweet Annie, your instincts might very well lead you to Warrups Farm in Redding, one of the few in the state that grows flowers as a pick-your-own crop. There you can create a bouquet from an acre of annuals, a dozen different types, cultivated in tidy rows.
Bill Hill, crop manager, also cultivates four acres each of sweet corn, pumpkins, and vegetables. Warrups is a certified organic farm. Although flowers are not a crop included under the certification, they share a field with the vegetables and are cultivated using the same ecological methods. 
 Being a farmer these days can be pretty dicey, says Mr. Hill, a fifth-generation farmer. "That's why you've got to be diverse."
Each year the farmer plows up the field, starts the flowers in the greenhouse from seed, and transplants the seedlings when appropriate. He tries to rotate the flowers within the section; crop rotation being one of the basic practices of organic farming.
Although he cultivates some herbs, Mr. Hill steers clear of most perennials because they are trickier to grow and need more weeding. "I don't use herbicides, so weeds can be a major problem," he explains.
Warrups' pick-your-own flowers include zinnias, cosmos, sunflowers, snapdragons, black-eyed Susans, amaranth, celosia, sweet Annie, calendula, strawflowers and asters. These, like all flowers, are considered high-value crops because new stems will continue to emerge throughout the season. They will, that is, if patrons do not cut the plant at its base.
"Cut 12 inches down on the stem. And choose flowers just starting to open so they last longer," suggests Mr. Hill. "When you get home, clip them again and put them in warm water. Change the water every day or two and the flowers will last a week, sometimes longer."
Customers are encouraged to supply their own clippers and flower container. Water is provided; look for the hose behind the stand.
In many respects, Bill Hill is an old-fashioned farmer. "There is a pull that the land has on you," he says. "I grew up here; I know every field."
The farmer intensively cultivates 15 of the family's 300-acre parcel which was originally a dairy. Successive generations shifted focus over the years.
"My great-great-grandfather built the house in 1840 and the barns," Mr. Hill said. "He had a dairy farm. His son sold it in 1900 and then my grandfather bought it back in the late 20's. It had been actively farmed until the 20's, when it was gradually abandoned as a farm. My parents raised beef cattle here from the mid-70's to 1982. I saw vegetables as a way of making the farm more economically viable, so in 1980 I moved to vegetables. And I've been cultivating flowers for the past 12 years." He does not want his farm to become "too commercial" and so he ceased advertising years ago. "Enough people know about it so I just put a sign at the end of the road," he said. That's John Read Road, a dirt thoroughfare in Redding.
To preserve the open land he and his family have donated the farm's development rights to the Redding Land Trust.
Hayrides are offered in the fall. Mr. Hill admits it is a commercial draw, but also believes it provides people with a rare experience from another era. "There is a big interest in seeing what a farm looks like," he says. "During pumpkin season -- one month -- a couple of thousand people come through here."
As testament to this, he recites the list of places his customers come from: Norwalk, Bridgeport, Wilton, Weston, Danbury, Bethel, Ridgefield and New York state. Some people have come to cut flowers for their own weddings.
Mr. Hill is also a philosopher. He considers how many of the rocks in his field did not emanate from native bedrock; the ones carried hundreds of miles by glaciers and deposited in Redding.
He refers to himself as a nature mystic, willing to try new things to preserve the natural interplay of the environment -- bugs and all. "I love to observe and be a part of the natural world and be a part of the process," he explains.
Mr. Hill is moving into bio-dynamic farming, which follows the philosophy of Rudolf Steiner. "It precedes the organic movement," he says. Although complex in theory, Mr. Hill says the practice is "like homeopathy applied to farming. You apply an organic preparation to the soil in very small quantities and it increases the life of the soil somehow."
Mr. Hill finds great satisfaction in the diversity of his work, the challenge of repairing equipment and figuring out what the weather will do. Most of all, he enjoys being outside.
"I was always interested in gardening and studied botany in school, so it followed naturally to do something like this. Plus I wanted to keep the place in one piece as a farm," he says. "It's fun for me. But it is very labor intensive."
Over the years, his brother, Bob Hill, has helped him manage the farm and bring in the hay. His wife, Laura Selleck, designed brochures about the farm, and their 6-year-old son, Lincoln, often is found hanging out at the farm stand. Three or four other people also work full-time during the summer.
Mr. Hill is a member of Connecticut Farm Bureau, and serves on the certification committee of the nonprofit Northeast Organic Farm Association of Connecticut. When a farm is certified organic, it means the farmer has subscribed to the association's standards, submitted an affidavit detailing farming practices and the history of the farm and has been visited by an inspector from the certification program. The certification committee also examines soil tests before it decides whether to award certification to a farm.
The pick-your-own flower season at Warrups Farm runs until frost, and the field is open Tuesday through Sunday, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Visitors can pick their own pumpkins and have a hayride on weekends throughout October. The first three weekends in March, the Warrups host maple syrup making demonstrations.
"I get the most pleasure out of seeing school groups; showing the kids where broccoli comes from," says Mr. Hill. "Nature is infinitely amazing. Just contemplate a flower for a while. There's an order and symmetry to everything that doesn't always seem apparent in the everyday chaos."

HEADLINE: A Premium Crop From the Shade

BYLINE: By JAY AXELBANK 

 BODY:
WHAT do the jungles of Sumatra have in common with the Connecticut countryside? Not much -- unless you're talking about growing tobacco for cigars. It all began in the late 1800's when Connecticut tobacco farmers faced stiff competition from Southeast Asian imports. Researchers and farmers came up with an ingenious idea: Why not grow tobacco here under cotton netting to approximate Sumatran conditions, meaning perpetual cloud cover and high heat and humidity.
Thus was born "Connecticut shade tobacco," with its cured leaf with its kid glove smooth texture and distinctive taste is used worldwide to wrap expensive, hand-made premium cigars. 
 Connecticut shade is a hot player in the new cigar boom that is sweeping America. And this week under the miles of long, white tents (now made of polymer netting) in north-central Connecticut, thousands of farm workers are swiftly -- but gently -- plucking and hanging the last of the tobacco leaves to cure. It looked for awhile as if the 1997 crop would set a 10-year record. But an attack of blue mold, a fungal disease that appears every few years, may keep the yield at 1996 levels despite increased tobacco acreage.
Growers like Emil Mulnite, who farms 160 acres in East Windsor, say they have been hit pretty hard. Elsewhere in the Connecticut River Valley, blue mold infestation is scattered with varying severity.
Jim LaMondia, plant pathologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment station in Windsor, reckons as much as 20 percent of the value of the crop could be lost -- about the same as in the last major blue mold attack in 1979. Recent heavy rains, Dr. LaMondia says, have only added to the problem.
The precise size and quality of the 1997 crop, however, will only become known in the months to come -- or, in some cases, a year or two -- after curing, processing, sorting and aging.
State officials and growers had estimated that this year's crop would reach 2 million pounds (before curing), worth $52 million or more. Now it is felt that the 1997 harvest probably will not get much above $38 million, about the same amount that last year's harvest pumped into the state's economy. The acreage boost -- to 1,200 acres from 1,000 last year -- as well as higher tobacco prices will help. And these dollar figures don't include an additional $10 million or so that comes from broadleaf tobacco, which is used primarily for lesser-grade cigar binder and filler.
Whatever the outcome, 1997 will still be a good harvest, according to most growers. In a year or two, it will be wrapping cigars in the $3 to $5 range.
"We just can't keep up with demand," says Austin T. McNamara, president of the General Cigar Company, the largest grower of Connecticut shade with 300 acres. General Cigar, headquartered in Bloomfield, manufactures the Macanudo, the largest-selling premium cigar in America, which is wrapped only with Connecticut shade. Mr. McNamara says the firm has doubled production of all its premium cigars this year.
Despite its prominence here, tobacco draws a blank from many Connecticut citizens. Including shade and broadleaf, it ranks No. 6 on a list of 23 in the value of the state's farm output while occupying just 3,000 acres out of the approximately 400,000 acres devoted to agriculture in the state. Shade tobacco is centered in a narrow belt on both sides of the Connecticut River from Hartford to the Massachusetts line.
"Most people are surprised when they find out what we grow under these tents," says Kathi Martin standing under the white netting that shades the nine-foot plants and increases the temperature underneath 5 to 10 degrees, as well as the humidity. She helps manage her family's 120-acre farm, called H. F. Brown, in Windsor.
"People equate tobacco with Southern states," she continues. "Even many of our cigar-smoking customers dont know how unique shade tobacco grown in Connecticut really is."
Farmers have tried to grow wrapper tobacco under the same tent- shade conditions in other parts of the United States and in the tropics, where labor is much cheaper and land far more plentiful. But without success. Traveling through Tobacco Valley, one keeps hearing references to Connecticut's mysterious mix of soil, climate, growing conditions.
Tom Rathier, soil scientist at the Windsor experiment station who specializes in tobacco cultivation, explains that the Connecticut River Valley is blessed with sandy loam with lower levels of silt and clay -- and optimum drainage. "The key is drainage," he says. "Whether water comes from irrigation or rain, tobacco doesn't like to sit in water."
And Connecticut shade has had something else going for it since the 1920's: the Windsor experiment station. It has helped perfect the crop through better cultivation, including crossbreeding of strains for quality, size of leaf and pest resistance. General Cigar and other growers keep seeds -- tinier than grains of sand -- going back decades for crossing tobacco varieties.
"Tobacco quality comparable to ours may be found in other places like Cuba or Sumatra where our seed originally came from," says Angel Daniel Nunez, a senior vice president of General Cigar. "But you cannot duplicate our taste anywhere else."
He points out that the wrapper is only about 5 percent of the weight of a cigar, "But it accounts for most of the taste. A Connecticut wrapper cigar smokes cooler, longer, more evenly and with a delicate taste."
Connecticut shade, according to Ms. Martin, is now cultivated, for example, in Ecuador and marketed as "Connecticut seed" leaf. "But one puff and a smoker knows it is not the real thing," she says.
Don't just take Connecticut's word for it. Gordon Mott, managing editor of Cigar Aficionado magazine, says: "Connecticut shade is considered, simply, the finest wrapper tobacco in the world with its high degree of suppleness, consistent golden brown color and flavor that's not overpowering."
Shade tobacco is one of the most labor intensive, complex, delicate, risky, expensive -- and lucrative -- crops in the world. If Mother Nature is very kind, tobacco growers can turn a profit of $5,000 or more an acre. In a golden year -- no hail, wind or disease to harm delicate leaves -- farmers could realize double that amount.
But growers are skittish about divulging details of acreage, crop sizes and profits. "Even we have trouble getting statistics," says Rick Macsuga, marketing and inspection supervisor at the Connecticut Department of Agriculture in Hartford. "You can't blame them because the tobacco business is so risky and competitive. Besides, a lot of growers over the years have been on a roller coaster."
Connecticut growers claim their shade-wrapped product is every bit the equal of cigars from Cuba -- which contributed some seeds to the Connecticut pedigree decades ago. Today, the growers point out, the economically hard-hit Cubans don't have the resources to adequately fertilize or to age their tobacco as they used to in their heyday. "A Cuban cigar is still a great smoke," says Mr. McNamara. "Comparing Connecticut and Cuban cigars is like comparing two great French wines. But the fact is Cubans are not pampering their tobacco like we are."
And pampering is an understatement. In April, growers plant seedlings in greenhouses. In May, they painstakingly transplant them to the tented fields, using both men and machines.
The tents are designed to filter out about 25 percent of the sunlight. The space between plants and rows is calculated down to the inch -- as is the distance between rows of leaves in curing sheds.
Around July 1 the harvesting begins. Approximately three leaves per plant are harvested every week until the plants' 18 or 20 leaves -- dark green, silky and slightly sticky -- are stripped off the stalks by the end of August.
Everything about tobacco growing and processing is carried out with the precision of a military campaign. "Do you hear that snapping sound?" asks Mr. Nunez as workers pluck leaves. "Two or three days ago you would not have heard it. The tobacco would not have been ready to be picked -- it wasn't talking to you."
Workers are trained to deftly snap off the leaves at the very base of the stem with thumb and forefinger. The leaves are so easily bruised that too much finger pressure is enough to reduce a leaf to interior binder material rather than the top-grade wrapper. Even the tiny pink flowers that bloom atop a plant can damage a leaf simply by falling on it and resting there until it causes a fatal blemish.
A leaf is also immediately disqualified for top-of-the-line wrapper if it is accidentally torn or punctured. "A cigar smoker demands a clean, even colored wrapper," says Jean-Marc Bade, co-manager of the Windsor Shade Tobacco Company, a co-op representing eight growers.
The curing takes place in hundreds of darkened well-ventilated sheds, where the leaves are carefully strung together on long white cords, then hung to dry and cure for about six weeks.
The 30-foot-high sheds are checked daily for temperature and moisture. "The tobacco has to have a moisture content of between 12 and 24 percent," says Mr. Nunez.
At the end of the six weeks, the now-brittle leaves are humidified to make them pliable enough to ship out to warehouses without damage. The next stage, several months long, begins: fermentation and sorting out the leaves by size, color and quality.
Finally the tobacco is aged for a year, two years or longer -- depending on the standards of the cigar maker -- before making a final appearance as a wrapper on a fine cigar.
Connecticut shade tobacco tends to be environmentally friendly, growers proudly claim. Organic fertilizer is generally used because the plants thrive on it and pesticide spraying -- except for use against blue mold -- is kept to a minimum. "Pesticides could spoil the taste," says Mr. Nunez.
While growers luxuriate in the current cigar boom, they well remember the ups and downs over the decades. Perhaps nobody recalls better than Mr. Mulnite, who has spent all of his 90 years among tobacco leaves in East Windsor.
"Back in the 1920's," he says, "it was the peak for all tobacco -- shade and broadleaf. We're told the state had about 30,000 acres -- 4,000 of them in shade. But in the late 40's, we went up to about 8,000 acres in shade alone. The white tents were everywhere. We were famous by then."
But the sky began to fall, starting in the 1950's, with competition from a synthetic wrapper leaf made from homogenized particles of tobacco. Cigar smoking itself began drifting out of vogue. By 1975, according to the State Department of Agriculture, shade acreage had shrunk to 3,000 acres. The nadir was in 1992 when only 720 acres were planted.
"We thought Connecticut tobacco growing was doomed," says Edgar M. Cullman, chairman of the Culbro Corporation, parent of General Cigar. Connecticut farmers switched to pumpkins, strawberries or nursery items. But then came the cigar mania and tobacco growers galloped back from the brink.
Still, growers keep a wary eye on potential competition, from Cuba if relations are normalized, and on the controversy swirling around tobacco and health issues.
Thus far, they have not been targeted by anti-tobacco activists, nor were they named in the suit that the state has filed against tobacco firms.
"Nor has any other state acted against cigar tobacco," added Richard Blumenthal, the state's Attorney General. "I admit that cigar smoking has the potential to cause cancer and other diseases. But cigars are only a small proportion of the overall tobacco market and don't involve the same kind of marketing and advertising aimed at children as cigarettes."
Even the anti-tobacco crusader State Representative Robert Farr of West Hartford says, "Cigar smoking does not have the same addiction problem."

HEADLINE: Cancellation Sinks Pricey Audience Test

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

DATELINE: ELMSFORD

 BODY:
THE first Gold Star Event at the Westchester Broadway Theater here, "An Evening with Jackie Mason" on Aug. 12, was an unqualified nonevent. "Insufficient promotion" and "scheduling conflicts" were the reasons given by Allan Gruet, the theater's press and public relations director, before the cancellation of Mr. Mason's one-night stand, which was to have been a pricey test case for audiences on Mondays and Tuesdays, the nights the musicals of the moment give way to solo performances by singers, comedians or big bands. The question was whether audiences accustomed to paying $51 plus tax for Jackie (The Joke Man) Martling or $53 plus tax for Jerry Vale (with a guest comedian, John Pizzi) would go for the Mason tariff: $125 plus tax, which totals $133.44.
The answer must wait until after Oct. 20 -- Mr. Mason's rescheduled date -- or after Nov. 17, the appearance of Connie Francis, the second scheduled Gold Star Event for which $100 and $125 tickets are on sale. No other relatively upscale performers have been signed, but the management's wish list, in response to customers who have reportedly requested bigger names, includes Paul Anka, George Carlin, Don Rickles, Harry Belafonte and Joan Rivers. 
 A question of entertainment has become, like virtually everything else, a problem in economics. Is one Connie Francis, say, worth two Al Martinos? Such engagements will invariably steepen fees, at least of those performers teetering between A and B lists (we are not talking megastars here). Tickets for Mr. Vale's on Oct. 7 have escalated to $67.25, tax included, no comedian.
For such performers as Mr. Martino and Mr. Vale, Westchester is a small-change stopover on the way home to California after an Atlantic City booking. Recent Monday or Tuesday "special nights" have included the Guy Lombardo Orchestra, Frank Patterson, the Irish tenor, with singers and dancers, and Johnny Maestro and the Brooklyn Bridge in rock-and-roll songs from the 50's and 60's, with the comedian Pete Michaels. Next up: the Irish Rovers on Oct. 6.
The musical of the moment through next Saturday is "South Pacific" in a pedestrian staging, unlighted by essential romantic leads. Yet, the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical has been faring better than "Carousel," a superior musical with a far superior cast, which played here from January through April.
The box office success of the musicals at the Westchester Broadway Theater depends on the recognition factor, and that keeps changing. "We cannot do obscure shows, however," Mr. Gruet said. " 'Sayonara,' which was a new musical, bombed."
"Fiddler on the Roof," the most recent production, remains a perennial. Business exceeded 85 percent of capacity, the figure necessary to stay in business. "South Pacific" has topped it. "Carousel" and "Damn Yankees" did not break even.
"Phantom" was a hit the first time around, but not the second. Ditto "Dreamgirls."
"But why 'South Pacific' drew crowds and 'Carousel' didn't, I cannot figure out," Mr. Gruet said.
Or as Hammerstein put it:
"Who can explain it? Who can tell you why? Fools give you reasons -- Wise men never try."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBOORHOOD REPORT: TRIBECA;
Candy, Nuts and a Bite of History Move On

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
The moving trucks will be coming downtown this week. And as they take the last nut and chocolate processing machines from A. L. Bazzini Company on Greenwich Street, a little bit of New York history will be going with them.
"We were the last food manufacturer in TriBeCa," said Rocco Damato, owner of the company. "Without us, there's no one left." 
 Indeed, in a neighborhood that once was home to the city's wholesale produce and dairy businesses, Bazzini's departure leaves one butter and egg warehouse and a couple of upscale retail bakeries.
According to Madeleine Wils, the wife of the owner, the dairy business -- Harry Wils & Company -- is also planning to move, and for the same reason: TriBeCa has become too fancy, and its real estate too expensive for them to stay.
Founded by Anthony Bazzini in 1886, Bazzini processes fruits as well as nuts, and makes chocolates and other candies. It supplies Yankee and Shea Stadiums and stores like Balducci's and Zabar's.
It has been in TriBeCa since 1968, driven there from Park Place by urban renewal programs that swept many of its competitors to the Hunts Point market in the Bronx or out of the city entirely.
Nevertheless, when Mr. Damato and his late brother-in-law, Jim Strong, bought the business from Mr. Bazzini's heirs in 1983, there were plenty of other food businesses around, including Hotel Bar Butter and Martinson Coffee.
But while Bazzini stayed, the others soon left; the Martinson building is now Robert DeNiro's TriBeCa Film Center.
Mr. Damato was never completely immune to the gentrification around him. His wife, Electra, opened a high-end food store on Bazzini's ground floor in the late 1980's, and a few years later he sold some of his space to condominium developers, shifting part of Bazzini's production to North Carolina. Then last year he decided to move it all away.
"It doesn't pay to stay here anymore," Mr. Damato said. "Real-estate taxes are too high, and energy costs are, too."
Although wooed by North Carolina, New Jersey and others, Mr. Damato found the best deal in Hunts Point. In fact, he is bringing much of the North Carolina production back north, and is happy that he won't have to dislocate his 50 employees.
Bazzini's food store will expand to five times its present size, Mr. Damato said. And the rest of the building? It's being converted to condominiums, of course. BERNARD STAMLER

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
For Many Small Businesses, The Labor Pool Is Shallow

BYLINE: By DEBRA NUSSBAUM 

 BODY:
DICK BELCHER, a bank president in a small Indiana town, cannot recall when the economy was better. At his bank, delinquencies are virtually nonexistent and business is steady.
While a strong economy brings many good things to small businesses like his, it also creates a problem: Where do you find enough qualified employees? 
 The national unemployment rate of 4.8 percent in July was the lowest in almost 24 years. And small businesses, particularly in rural communities with smaller labor pools, are finding that their biggest challenge these days isn't bringing in work orders and jobs. It is finding someone to do the work.
Mr. Belcher employs nearly 100 people at five branches of the First Federal Savings Bank, with about half the jobs in Rochester, Ind., a town of 7,000 about a two-hour drive north of Indianapolis. Over the last 36 months, Mr. Belcher said, he has found it difficult to fill all the positions in his branches. He now has three job openings.
"It's a market for the employees," Mr. Belcher said. "We have had to raise salaries and talk more about our benefits."
Several years ago he started a profit-sharing plan, which he sweetened this year, and he has also offered a 401(k) -- an inducement provided by few small employers in the past.
Employment at small businesses has a broad effect on the economy. About 53 percent of the nation's workers are employed by companies with fewer than 500 workers. And despite competition for workers at businesses large and small, most economists say wages and prices are not rising sharply -- and thus, with the threat of inflation abated, interest rates have stayed unchanged, meaning a period of unusually good news for the economy.
Yet small-business owners say the competition for workers has caused them to raise salaries in some cases and benefits in others. The owners have also become more flexible with work schedules and advertised the jobs over a much wider areas.
The employment problem for small business "has been skyrocketing in the last year and a half," said William Dunkelberg, an economics professor at Temple University in Philadelphia and chief economist for the National Federation of Independent Business in Washington. The group represents 600,000 member companies, 80 percent of which employ fewer than 40 people each.
In July, 29 percent of the 2,000 employers responding to the federation's monthly survey said they were having trouble filling at least one job. That is the highest percentage in 25 years, Professor Dunkelberg said. Often in the early 1980's, less than 6 percent of employers said finding workers was a problem.
When asked to list the biggest problems facing their companies, the managers put the availability of skilled employees right after taxes and government regulations, Professor Dunkelberg said. In the past, inflation and interest rates were larger concerns.
The December 1996 survey showed that 32 percent of the respondents had recently raised compensation for employees, a figure that Professor Dunkelberg interprets as another sign of increasing demand for workers. The federation's surveys also showed that 10 percent of the business owners had unfilled openings for unskilled laborers.
"We've generated so many jobs," Professor Dunkelberg said. The problem is compounded in a smaller town, he said, where "you don't have as big a pool of workers."
At the Ana-Lab Corporation in Kilgore, Tex., Charles Whiteside, the owner, said he had been unable to fill three positions. The company, which does environmental testing and operates water systems, employs 60 people in the town of 11,000 residents. Ana-Lab offers health insurance, sick leave, retirement and education benefits, Mr. Whiteside said, but he has still gone two months with openings.
"We've had a lot of economic development and new industry here," he said. "There's not enough good employees for the demand. We pay a lot of overtime here because we don't have enough people."
In Indiana, Mr. Belcher recently hired a woman in her 30's from another local business. She was making a higher hourly wage at the other job, he said, but needed the benefits that his bank offered: "She told me, 'I'm at the age where I need to be concerned about retirement.' "
Sarah Wilson, publisher of The Rochester Sentinel, the local newspaper, said the lack of a 401(k) plan had cost her workers. Indeed, one former employee returned after the newspaper instituted such a plan this year.
"Applicants in their 20's are asking about that," she said.
Employers like Mr. Belcher and Ms. Wilson have usually been able to rely on local networking and newspaper advertising to find employees. But increasingly, small-business owners are finding they have to branch out.
By using trade journals and college placement services, Ms. Wilson recently found candidates for an advertising manager's job that had been open for several months. Mr. Belcher has used temporary employment agencies.
Both employers say they accept the fact that small-town life will attract some candidates and discourage others. "It's definitely a life-style change," Ms. Wilson said. "It's not New York."
They also know that for some workers a small-town business is a springboard to a larger market and that a certain amount of turnover is inevitable.
"That's something small business has always faced," said Bruce D. Phillips, director of the Small Business Administration's office of economic research in Washington. But the wage disparity between large and small businesses has shrunk. On average, according to Mr. Phillips, pay at small companies -- defined as those with fewer than 500 employees -- is 93 percent of that at large companies. In rural areas, employees also find that their living expenses are lower.
Ms. Wilson said two former employees had returned to the newspaper. One had tried another business and the other had left to join a larger company. But both found that they preferred the work and benefits at The Sentinel.
Flexibility has become another selling point for small businesses. Mr. Belcher said letting working mothers adjust their schedules so they could pick up their children after school -- or see a Little League baseball game -- had helped make his company a more attractive place to work.
"We have picked up employees that way," he said. "If you have to go to the doctor, we don't dock you."
In Redfield, S.D., a town of 2,800, Dale Haiar runs two shifts totaling 65 workers as plant manager for Dakotah Inc., which makes insulated throws and blankets. His previous employer, a plant in Aberdeen, S.D., was beginning to have problems finding skilled workers, he said, but Dakotah has had several applications from workers who were let go in government cutbacks at a state school. The company has also pulled in workers with its benefits: health insurance, paid vacation and sick days. About 80 percent of his employees are wives of farmers, he said.
"The benefits package is the big thing," Mr. Haiar said. "Dad can farm and Mom can provide the insurance."

Chart: "Help Wanted"
A sign in the window cannot be counted on the fill jobs at small businesses in the current economy. William Dunkelberg, an economics professor at Temple University, offers these suggestions to employers.
 
Use university and community college placement offices
"You have a great captive labor pool," he said. Use students part-time while they are in school and you "get a chance to look them over."
 
Start an internship program
Many students are underemployed. Interns will often stay on in a full-time job after graduation and they have already had your training. Set up a relationship with an area college placement office so that the placement officer knows when you have openings and steers good people to your company.
 
Call trade organizations
Many have computer job banks.
 
Talk to regional Chambers of Commerce
Some of them post job openings or have programs to help locate new employees.
 
Use trade journals
In addition to local advertising, ads in trade journals can attract applicants for higher-paying jobs for which relocation would be worthwhile.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Digging for Treasure in Their Own Backyards

BYLINE: By ANNE TERGESEN 

 BODY:
INVESTORS already face a dizzying array of funds that use all kinds of arcane strategies to invest in every corner of the globe. Perhaps that helps explain why more people are choosing funds with the straightforward approach of focusing on companies in their own backyards.
But as the number of regional funds grows, so does the debate over their value. 
 The funds' managers argue that investing locally gives them an advantage, because they can really get to know the companies whose stocks they own. Critics, however, contend that a regional focus is just a marketing gimmick. And as one might expect, the performance of the funds has been mixed.
There are now more than 20 funds with a regional emphasis, selling Northwestern companies to Oregonians, Silicon Valley stocks to Californians and the industrial heartland to Midwesterners. Though outsiders -- residents of other areas -- can usually buy regional funds, they often appeal mainly to local pride.
The appeal seems to be working. In five of the last six years, regional funds have grown faster than the average for equity funds, and now total about $3.1 billion of assets, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund trackers in Chicago.
This year, the amount of money in regional funds soared 30.4 percent through July, compared with an average increase of 22.5 percent for all funds, Morningstar said. And the investment style has proved hot enough to attract at least two newcomers, focusing on Michigan and New York State, since May.
Fund managers in Seattle; Columbus, Ohio, and East Lansing, Mich., say they can keep better track of a regional portfolio because they socialize with employees of the portfolio companies, keep abreast of local news, drive by parking lots to see which businesses are busy, and stop in to test customer service.
Conrad Herrmann, senior manager of the Franklin California Growth fund, went to a hockey game with a friend who worked for one of the fund's holdings, Bay Networks. The friend had so much work to do that he rushed back to the office at 10 that night, Mr. Herrmann said, "reaffirming to us that our position was solid." Later, the fund, which has some of the best returns of any regional fund, sold the stock at a profit, he added.
Similarly, Norm Klopp, who runs Fairport Midwest Growth, said his knowledge about hundreds of executives in the eight states bordering the Great Lakes had helped him predict several successful turnarounds. For example, after following the career of John P. Reilly for years, Mr. Klopp didn't hesitate to buy shares in Figgie International after it named Mr. Reilly chief executive in 1995. Since then, the stock has appreciated almost 100 percent, Mr. Klopp said, helping the fund gain an average of 21 percent a year.
In the age of air travel and instantaneous information, the backyard advantage may be disputed. "The communications and technology revolution has brought investors much closer to firms than may have been the case 20 or 30 years ago," said Gerald Perritt, editor of The Mutual Fund Letter.
Even some managers who like the philosophy have hesitated to adopt it formally. Daniel Perkins, whose Perkins Opportunity fund invests about half its $84 million in assets in the upper Midwest, said he avoids the regional label because he does not want to be boxed in by securities regulations that require those professing a geographic allegiance to invest at least 65 percent of their assets there.
And critics argue that it is unwise to invest in a fund that ties its hands. If companies in another state are hot, managers who cling to laggards at home restrict returns, said John Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors in Chicago. He said investors also expose themselves to increased risk by tying portfolios to the fortunes of their local economies, which may already influence the security of their jobs and the value of their homes.
Portfolio managers note, however, that they take steps to reduce the risk of geographical concentration. Aquila Cascadia Equity, which focuses on seven Western states, roughly replicates the industry weightings of the Standard & Poor's Mid-Cap 400 index, said George W. Hosfield, a portfolio manager of the fund. Because the Northwest lacks oil and natural-gas companies, Cascadia compensates by buying such stocks with the portion of the fund that is invested outside its region.
James P. Foster, who runs STI Classic Sunbelt Equity, has an unwritten policy to start selling a position once it accounts for more than 3 percent of the fund's assets. STI invests in a 12-state area from Virginia to Texas.
Some critics suggest that the recent spate of new regional funds has less to do with investing principles and more to do with a need to stand out in a crowded field. The growing popularity of regional investing "is consistent with the amount of additional marketing that has gone on in this industry in the last couple of years," said Brian Mattes, a principal at the Vanguard Group, which does not offer regional funds.
Even some of these funds' managers cite marketing as one rationale for their offerings.
"We needed to differentiate ourselves as a new fund," said Patrick Dooley, the managing director of the New York State Opportunity Funds, the first of which had its debut in May.
WHEN there is the matter of returns. As a group, regional funds have trailed the average domestic equity fund, whether for the first seven months of 1997, the past 12 months or the last five years, Morningstar said.
"There's no good reason to own one of these funds if it can't compete with diversified equity funds," said Laura Lallos, a senior Morningstar analyst.
A few of the funds have compiled standout records. Franklin California Growth I, with a heavy emphasis on technology, has among the best three- and five-year records of any growth fund, despite trailing badly this year. And Composite Northwest, which emphasizes companies in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Alaska, has zoomed 55.7 percent in the last 12 months, a hot performance for any fund.
But lagging returns and portfolio limitations have caused at least one fund to drop a regional slant. Shareholders of One Group Gulf South Growth voted recently to eliminate the portfolio's concentration on the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico and to instead invest in small companies around the country. The fund is up only 10 percent or so this year and has not burned up the track in previous years. Rick Jandrain, managing director of equities for the fund's new parent, Banc One Investment Advisors, said One Group should be free to pursue "the best companies without worrying about what states they are in."

In School for Deaf, America's Promise to Immigrants Is Kept

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS 

 BODY:
For deaf immigrants, especially those from third world countries, the United States is a place rich beyond imagining, offering a cornucopia of services: schools with the most up-to-date pedagogic techniques, electronic and telecommunication devices that ease communication, civil rights protections and an organized advocacy community.
Many of these advantages are not available to illegal immigrants, like the deaf Mexicans smuggled here to peddle trinkets and held in conditions approaching bondage in two Queens apartments. They were forced into the underground economy because current law prohibits their employment of any illegal immigrant, disabled or not. 
 But for deaf immigrants who are eligible for green cards or citizenship, the United States is the land of opportunity. The Lexington Center and School for the Deaf, a 135-year-old academic and social service agency at 30th Avenue and 75th Street in Jackson Heights, not far from the apartments where the trinket peddlers lived, is one of many institutions that provide unusual training to the disabled.
Lexington, like many other American schools for the deaf, has shifted over time from the so-called oralism that dominated schooling for the deaf for decades. The old system emphasized time-consuming and often unsuccessful efforts at speech, and the newer system stresses mastery of sign language. In Mexico, by contrast, only the biggest cities even have schools for the deaf, and their focus is on the old-fashioned oral methods.
Lexington also has access to the latest aids: telephones that allow the deaf to send messages by teletype, devices that flash when a doorbell rings or a baby cries, dogs trained to alert their masters to sounds the human ear cannot hear. In underdeveloped countries, such help is generally unavailable or unaffordable.
These educational and technological services are staples at schools like Lexington, which is private but financed with public money. But tides of immigration have brought curricular changes.
The school has developed a tri lingual approach to teach deaf children in their home language (be it Urdu, Russian, Spanish or Cantonese), the school language (English) and American sign Language, a visual communication system with its own syntax, vocabulary and grammar. Lexington's student body is now nearly 60 percent foreign-born, from families that speak 28 different languages.
Some immigrant children arrive able to speak their native language but with varying degrees of impairment. Some can read a bit. Some are familiar with the sign language used in their home country, which is different from American sign language in vocabulary but similar in grammar and syntax.
Others arrive illiterate in all three languages, with no communication skills other than an idiosyncratic form of sign that deaf people commonly develop when not taught a formal version.
Developing language skills under such circumstances is a complicated process with, say, a deaf teacher fluent in Spanish and sign aided by a Russian or Chinese translator. While the first instructor presents the lesson, the children with other languages read the lips of native translators. Hands are flying, multiple languages are spoken, multiple sets of lips are read, until the children master English and American sign language.
Lexington's vocational center has also developed programs to deal with the crush of new immigrants, who are often ignorant of their legal status under America's changing immigration laws.
To guide clients through the process, the center assigns sign language interpreters to accompany the deaf to immigration hearings, explain the law and translate documents. But despite all these advantages and innovations, an illegal immigrant educated or trained at Lexington and other places like it eventually runs into a brick wall when the time comes to find a job: Federal immigration laws.
Graduates of vocational programs who lack legal status cannot be offered job placement services.
"They cannot access the system," said Dr. Kevin Keane, who is Lexington's assistant superintendent. "So we are training them to do what? Eventually, they will have to enter the underground economy." JANE GROSS

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Why German Auto Makers Are Humming

BYLINE: By LARRY DIGNAN 

 BODY:
AUTO industry analysts are abuzz over the new models that German manufacturers are bringing forth this fall, like the Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle and a modified Volkswagen Beetle. But high as expectations are, the analysts say other aspects of the companies' business may be equally important in making them good long-term investments.
The German companies are cutting production costs, just as their American counterparts did in the 1980's, and demand for their products is growing in Europe. And with uncertainty over Europe's planned common currency, the euro, the dollar has soared against the German mark to levels unseen in six years, making these vehicles less expensive for Americans. United States sales contribute anywhere from 6 percent to 50 percent of these companies' revenues. 
 American investors can get in directly on this action with Volkswagen and Daimler-Benz, parent of Mercedes-Benz, through the companies' American depository receipts.
The two companies are very different. Daimler derives only about two-thirds of its income from auto and truck sales; its various other ventures include a stake in Airbus Industrie, the European airplane consortium. And while the company's cars are synonymous with luxury, its new models, like the sport utility vehicle and a compact car set to have its debut in Europe this fall, will carry more modest prices.
Volkswagen is purely an auto company. Its current goal is to expand its presence in the higher-priced market, using its Audi subsidiary to take on BMW and even enhancing some Volkswagen models, like the new Passat, to duel with Mercedes.
But Daimler and Volkswagen have something in common: their stocks are doing well, particularly Volkswagen's, even though both have pulled back a bit recently because of concerns over Germany's economy and possible changes in monetary policy. Both stocks have enough fuel for a longer run, many analysts say.
True, if Germany raises interest rates, the mark's value will climb against the dollar, increasing the cars' prices here. And the new models may fail, despite the industry's excitement. Nevertheless, analysts say, the two companies look good.
DAIMLER has already sold off about one-third of its businesses, mostly unprofitable ones like Fokker, the Dutch aircraft company, said Paul Korngiebel, a senior analyst at Brandes Investment Partners in San Diego. It has also streamlined its organization and struck favorable labor pacts.
The payoff so far: Daimler's first-half profits were 1.8 billion marks, more than double those of the corresponding period a year earlier.
Daimler is also saving money by simplifying its engineering. It is using modular assembly techniques, partly by outsourcing various tasks, said Rich Lazarchic, manager of the American Express IDS Global Growth fund, which owns Daimler shares. For example, suppliers now give Daimler whole doors rather than just door components.
Of course, Daimler's challenge is to maintain its famous engineering excellence as it trims costs. "Quality is the main reason people buy a Mercedes," Mr. Lazarchic said. "They can mix and match parts, but the cars still have to appear as if they were individually done."
Still, Daimler has strengths beyond the Mercedes name. Its truck business is the world's largest, and it is in a good position to benefit from the weak mark. Because most of its plants are in Germany -- some other car makers' facilities are more spread out -- its costs have fallen far in dollar terms.
For its part, Volkswagen has been in the forefront of the movement to simplify production techniques. "They have cut a great deal in costs by reducing suppliers and creating economies of scale," said Loretta Morris, a senior international portfolio manager for Nicholas-Applegate Capital Management in San Diego, which owns shares in Volkswagen and other German auto makers.
"The restructuring has given them good operating margins and return on equity," Ms. Morris said.
As for Volkswagen's new models, the Beetle has garnered the most attention. Many analysts say the retooled Bug -- the original is still made in small volume in Mexico -- will catch on because nostalgic baby boomers will be happy to pay the price -- about $15,500.
However, Volkswagen's long-term bottom line will be more affected by the new Golf, said Robert Sigler, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in New York. And he is hopeful because the new Golf will be cheaper than its old version yet produce higher margins because of manufacturing efficiencies.
Another big factor in Volkswagen's fortunes is its success in China and Latin America, and Mr. Sigler is optimistic on that front, too.
"They have a foothold in the key growth markets," he said. In Brazil, for example, where Volkswagen has 36 percent of the market, car sales are up 24 percent this year.
Mr. Sigler projects that Volkswagen's earnings will grow 20 percent to 30 percent within 18 months.
Ms. Morris also expects to see further gains in Volkswagen's stock, which she called cheap despite its run-up. The stock is at the low end of the European auto makers' group, selling at about 20 times 1997 earnings and 14 times projected 1998 earnings, less than Daimler's respective multiples of 24 and 22.
Some analysts, however, say such comparisons are misleading because Volkswagen is just a car company while Daimler is more diversified.

HEADLINE: Cuban Culture Avoids Political Tensions

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your article on the growing popularity of Cuban art in the United States (Arts pages, Aug. 21) says a "loophole" in the Helms-Burton Act is responsible for the surge in Cuban music sales. In fact, the Berman amendment to the embargo, passed in the late 1980's, exempted cultural activities from the restrictions imposed on trade between the United States and Cuba. 
 Since United States law prohibits sale of a Cuban product only if the earnings end up in Cuban Government coffers, the Castro regime has allowed its artists to keep their fees from performances and sales overseas. Also, regulations requiring performers to permanently reside in Cuba have been relaxed and artists are allowed to settle abroad, provided they do not break with the regime.
Before the Berman amendment, Cuban artists like Pablo Milanes and Gonzalo Rubalcaba were denied visas to perform in the United States. Today, United States record companies enjoy the benefits of the new cultural-exchange system.
President Castro winks at the thawing of cultural relations, but at the same time he is keeping political tensions with Washington as high as possible.

HEADLINE: Tito Mahones: A Life On the Edge

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
TITO MAHONES woke up in his Bedford-Stuyvesant apartment last Tuesday feeling better than he had in weeks. He may have only had a few dollars in his pocket, but the 40-year-old handyman, street hawker and jack-of-all trades was expecting a few renovation jobs to come his way. For once, he thought, good luck was on his side.
After tinkering with some broken television sets and making breakfast for his father, he got on a Manhattan-bound J train, lugging an armload of scavenged merchandise -- clothing, books and refurbished electronics -- that he could peddle on the streets. He made his way to the East Village, where, on a shady patch of sidewalk at Ninth Street and First Avenue, he made an easy $80 in sales. God must have been looking out for him, he thought, because the police didn't even harass him once. Feeling as if he didn't have a care in the world, Tito returned home that evening with enough groceries to fill his empty refrigerator. 
 "Things is looking up," he told his father as he mopped the kitchen floor and cleared out a week's worth of dirty dishes from the sink. But just as he started to vacuum his grimy carpet, the power died. So did the lights. He looked out the window, saw the Con Ed crew in the street and knew that his unpaid electric bills had finally caught up with him. Defeated by the dark, he sat on his bed and cried. Later that night, he pawned his tools for $20, bought a few 40-ounce bottles of Colt .45 and sat in his bedroom as the crack heads began gathering below his window on De Kalb Avenue. "Seems I just can't get ahead," he said, his face lit by the glow of a Newport. "I must be cursed 'cause bad luck follows me wherever I go."
Bad luck. Bad circumstance. Bad judgment. Tito Mahones has them all. On his own since he was 15, Tito survived on street smarts, petty larceny and big-time drug deals. He has been in and out of prison a dozen times. He has been homeless twice. His body is a three-dimensional canvas of thick scars, remnants of the beatings, shootings and stabbings from his days as a teen-age gang member. At night, his dreams are so full of mayhem he can only sleep a few hours at a time. "I've almost used up all of my nine lives," he said with a half-grin last week, surrounded by the candles that illuminated his kitchen. "But I don't go down easy. I think God wants me to survive for a reason. He wants me to do something with my life."
Tito doesn't know much about bull markets and mutual funds, but he can smell the city's booming economy, the prosperity and the opportunities. He just can't figure out how to make the system work for him. Tito is stuck on the margins, just getting by, living hand to mouth. "On bad days, I'm lucky if I can buy me a slice of pizza," he said. "On good days, I hand out dollar bills to the addicts who hang on my stoop." If only he could get a steady job he swears he would save money, open a bank account, get a phone, buy a used van and start up the contracting business he has long dreamed of owning. Maybe then he could start giving money to his six children. Maybe he could afford to move away from his rundown apartment, the random violence and a neighborhood he believes is holding him back.
Tito doesn't have a resume and never made it past fifth grade, but when he has money in his pocket, he can talk big about his prospects, his get-rich schemes. "I feel like I'm about to break through," he said the other day, showing off $50 he made fixing the roof of a neighborhood church -- money that bought him back his pawned tools. "If I keep busy working, I can blank out my problems. When I'm not, I get myself into trouble."
His youthful brawn has long since given way to a soft belly, but if provoked, Tito can still put up a fierce fight. And while middle age has mellowed his fury, a quick temper is never far from the surface. "Everywhere I go, people think I'm a tough guy because the way I walk," he said. "They look in my eyes and they think I'm a killer. If they gave me a chance, they'd see I'm a nice guy."
Since his last brush with the law -- a six-month jail term for drug possession in 1991 -- Tito has been trying to forge a new life built on hard work and clean living. He has, he says, "found God," and his friends and family agree that the hard-drinking hell-raiser has become something of a pussycat. "Tito is so honest, you could drop a wallet and he wouldn't even look at it," said his brother Leon. "His biggest problem these days is that he's too good to people who give him nothing in return. He's very sensitive, so when folks disappoint him, he beats himself up."
It doesn't take much to set Tito back. A fight with one of his brothers, a junkie's insult or losing a game of dice will foul up his head and send him into a dark hole. Things are like that for Tito. Some weeks are good; some weeks are real bad. The first two weeks of August were worse than usual. It all started with the death of his brother Paco, after a long battle with AIDS. When he heard the news, Tito stopped working and took solace in a six-pack of beer. Nearly a hundred people gathered at the wake, including all of Tito's six surviving brothers. Only a sister, lost to drugs and mental illness, didn't show up.
As a boom box filled the San Juan Funeral Home with samba, children -- a half-dozen of them Paco's -- ran around the crowded chapel. Others practiced crossing themselves in front of the pewter casket. An iridescent Last Supper, rendered in felt, hung opposite a mural of puffy clouds floating over turquoise skies. Paco's oldest daughter brought a custom-made floral arrangement shaped like a bongo drum, her father's passion before heroin destroyed his life. Few tears were shed among the mourners, most of whom saw Paco's death as a release from suffering. After viewing the body, people spilled onto the sidewalk, chatting in a mix of Spanish and English and sipping drinks from bottles wrapped in brown paper bags.
Tony Escobar, one of the few brothers to make it out of Brooklyn, came all the way from Florida, where he works installing utility ducts. Even though they hadn't met in years, Tito was nervous because he owed Tony $150. Tony didn't bring it up, but Tito still felt ashamed. "It's bad enough that I didn't have enough money to buy a suit," he said, tugging at his black shirt.
Like Paco, Tony had a different father than Tito -- a man he never knew. His mother, Fanny Mahones, an immigrant from Puerto Rico, fed her eight children on welfare checks. Until he learned Spanish a few years ago, Tito and his mother could barely communicate. "We don't have much of a relationship," he said. "She hates me. I think it's because I remind her of my father."
 
A Cruel Childhood That Ended at Age 9
Growing up, the children spent most of their time in the streets. But in the kitchen, Fanny Mahones ruled with an iron fist, her son recalled. "We never got enough to eat," said Tito, describing how his mother kept the refrigerator chained with a heavy padlock. When drunk, she could be cruel. "If we wet our bed, Mom would put our naked bottoms on the hot radiator so we wouldn't do it again," he said.
The family moved every few years, from East New York to Brownsville to the Lower East Side to Bedford-Stuyvesant. The brothers had to fight wherever they went. "There were so many of us, and our skins were all different shades, people assumed we were a gang," Tony said. "We were tough. We never backed down from a brawl."
It was Tony who got Tito involved in raising pigeons, a popular hobby in Brooklyn during the 1970's. But what started as a peaceful pursuit turned into a cat-and-mouse game of pigeon theft from neighboring rooftops. Once, when a competitor stole some of the brothers' birds, Tony and Tito set his coop ablaze.
By age 9, Tito had stopped going to school. He spent his days on the streets tagging his older brothers, all of them members of the Tomahawks, one of central Brooklyn's most fearsome gangs. His first arrest came at 9, for shoplifting. At 12, he was arrested for driving a stolen Chevy Impala given to him by his brother Carlos. When a police officer called his mother, asking her to pick him up at the station house, Tito recalls her saying, "You take him." A judge sent him to a juvenile detention center upstate, where he stayed for the next three years. "I was so busted up, I cried for a week," he said. His mother never answered his letters. No one ever visited.
The day he turned 15, he was transferred to a home for troubled youths in the Bronx. After a few weeks, he slipped away and went back home. When his mother refused to open the door, he ended up on the Lower East Side, sleeping in Tompkins Square Park. "Mama," a well-known heroin dealer on East Sixth Street, took him in, looking after Tito and other runaways. In exchange, they worked as drug runners or helped out in her busy shooting gallery, injecting customers in parts of their bodies -- buttocks, legs and the back of the neck -- that would hide the track marks.
By the time he was in his early 20's, Tito was running his own dealership on De Kalb Avenue, just north of the elevated subway line on Broadway. Those were crazy days in Bedford-Stuyvesant and Bushwick. Crack was hot, and at night the streets became a battleground for rival dealers. "Every day, someone would get knocked off," Tito said. "I've seen too many people die, a few of them in my arms."
His good fortune came to an end one spring night in 1992, when a competitor tossed a Molotov cocktail through Tito's apartment window. To escape the flames, he jumped out a fourth-floor window, landing on a mound of garbage that filled the roofless building next door. More than three hours passed before firefighters found his unconscious body.
After he left the hospital, his right hand permanently damaged, Tito ended up at the Atlantic Avenue men's shelter. "I had nowhere to go," he said. "No one wanted me." One evening, he sneaked into his mother's apartment and barricaded himself in the bathroom, he said, "with a 40-ouncer in one hand and a .38 in the other." The last time he had tried suicide by drinking a bottle of iodine from his mother's medicine chest. It was a miserable attempt and after his stomach was pumped, he had to face the world with a mouth that stayed purple for weeks.
He didn't pull the trigger that night and passed out drunk on the floor. When he woke up a few hours later, he vowed to clean up his act. He remembered his friend Pepe, an ex-crack addict who had gone straight with the help of a church in East New York. Pepe introduced him to Pastor Lydia Grenade, who ran Faithful Mission on Pennsylvania Avenue. The pastor gave him food and a bed and showed him how to live an honest life.
At Faithful Mission, Tito met June Weatherly, a soft-spoken schoolteacher from Trinidad who was getting back on her feet after an abusive relationship and a bout of homelessness. Tito and June seemed to have a lot in common: they both craved stability, a tight family. He was impressed by her kindness, her education. She was moved by his frank way of speaking, his earnestness and the fact that he taught himself to read and write at 28, watching "Sesame Street" while in prison. Five months after they began dating, June became pregnant.
 
A Broken Relationship, And a Bond With His Son
Tito is the father of five other children, by two other women, but Jonathan's birth was the only one he actually showed up for. "Mine were the first hands they put him in after he was born," he said proudly. After his son's birth, however, Tito started gambling again and June grew weary of the lies and his inability to bring home a steady income. After a year together, she got an apartment in a housing project in Coney Island and moved out with Jonathan.
A few days after Paco was buried, Tito took refuge at June's place, looking after Jonathan and trying to regain his footing. He was broke, but time away from De Kalb Avenue would do him good. There's not much action on Surf Avenue; no numbers joints, no one tempting him to party. The only lure is the pinball arcade, where Tito sometimes goes to ease his boredom. Seagulls squawk overhead and when the wind blows from the east, you can hear the crashing waves. The people on Surf Avenue are mostly working-class, the projects clean and graffiti-free. Compared to his dingy apartment, which has no locks on the doors, June's home is like a palace. "It's real quiet here, almost too quiet," he said.
They are no longer a couple, but Tito tries his best to stay involved in Jonathan's life. "My other kids, well they don't know me too well," he said. "I want this one to think of me as his daddy." When he woke up on Wednesday, the heaviness in his gut had eased. He stepped onto the balcony and looked out over the Atlantic, watching freighters and cruise ships disappear in the haze. On the boardwalk below, he could see people jogging. Inspired, he went down to the beach and did a set of pushups. They left him short of breath. "First time in six years I exercised," he said. "At Rikers, I worked out all the time. I used to be the champion arm wrestler. I gotta get back in shape."
When June came home that afternoon from her job as a teacher's aide, Tito's good spirits quickly faded. Sally Jesse Raphael was on the television. The theme: "I Was Rich but I Lost Everything." Tito shook his head and said, "That's the story of my life." June let out a laugh and Tito muttered something under his breath. Later they took Jonathan to the beach. Tito was dressed in a full set of fatigues, leftovers from the days when he volunteered for the Army Explorers, leading troops of city kids on field trips.
By the time they reached the boardwalk, they were already arguing. June said that Tito never gave her any money for Jonathan's upbringing. Tito's hands waved angrily, beer splashing out of the can he was holding. He was almost snarling. "Why you have to disrespect me?" he asked. "I don't need you to respect me, just stop disrespecting me." June kept quiet, knowing that anything she said would stoke his temper. When he went off to a relieve himself against a wall, she talked about her frustrations, describing the day Tito gambled away $900, money they had planned to use for a crib, a carriage and baby clothing. Then there was the time he sold her furniture and dishes after she had moved out. "Tito would go straight from the check cashing place to the numbers parlor," she said. "Sometimes we wouldn't have a dime."
When Tito came back, he was calm. As he gazed at Jonathan playing in the sand, he made a quiet confession. "I know I messed up," he said, his eyes tearing. "I guess I wasn't the man you thought I was."
June is moving on with her life. Right now she is focused on completing a masters degree in education at Medgar Evers College. She has forgiven Tito for the past but holds out little hope for reconciliation. The way she sees it, Tito's accumulated trauma is too much for him to bear. "Tito can't get away from the streets," she said. "It's in his blood. The street is where he gets his sense of belonging, his respect, but these people always betray him and then he comes here and takes it out on me."
Once, after she paid off a gambling debt, Tito agreed to go to a Gamblers Anonymous meeting. "He showed up drunk, and then walked out, saying he didn't have that kind of problem," she recalled. "Tito is a good person, but I don't think he can sort out his life until he gets help."
 
A New Haircut And a Ray of Hope
A few days later, when Tito turned up at his usual peddling spot on First Avenue, his hair and mustache were gone, shaved off by his brother Leon. "Time for a change," he said, rubbing his shiny head like an awkward schoolboy. "New look for a new life." There was something jaunty in Tito's walk, more strut, less swagger. A big renovation job on Pacific Street had come through and Con Ed had turned the power back on, agreeing to look into his claim that someone in the building was illegally tapping his line (the utility acted after a reporter inquired about the shutoff). More than a month had passed since he had fed the one-armed bandit that sits, illegally, between the Pampers and pet food at the back of his corner bodega. "Things is looking good for me," he said. "I'm feeling happy."
As long as it is not raining, Tito can be found bopping around the East Village, "a place you won't get killed if you wander off your block," he said. In Brooklyn, a guy can get shot walking into the wrong neighborhood. To him, the East Village is freedom. "Here, everyone's all mixed up: black, white, Puerto Rican," he said. "The worst I get over here is dirty looks." His dream is to find an apartment on a quiet street, but he knows he couldn't afford East Village rents.
Tito hadn't come by to join the peddlers that day. "I'm on to bigger and better things," he said, showing off the Swanson watches he had bought that morning from a wholesale place on 28th Street. With a loan from a friend, he was able to buy 20 watches at $5 apiece. In neighborhoods like East New York, he knows he can get $10 a watch. He lined his wares up inside a vinyl display case and headed east toward Avenue C, "where the Dominicans and Puerto Ricans buy 'em like hot cakes." He hit every bodega, botanica and sidewalk domino game on the way, yelling "barato, barato, barato" in Spanish ("cheap, cheap, cheap") or "Got them watches, got 'em cheap," in English. He carried a paper coffee cup filled with water and a submerged watch. "This way they know you're not lying when you say they waterproof," he explained.
By the end of the day, he had sold all but five and went back to buy another batch. "I gotta sink the money right into more merchandise, otherwise I'll spend it," he said over a slice of pizza. "If I go home at night, I'm bound to get in an argument with someone. Then I'll get upset and my mind will switch channels. When that happens, I start drinking and gambling." Finished eating, he excused himself and went back on to the street. Avenue C was buzzing. The sun was sinking. There were deals to be made.

Inside, his children and nieces and nephews mourned and practiced the Sign of the Cross.

Ground Broken for Pathmark but Concerns Remain

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
Two years after leaders in East Harlem grudgingly accepted a deal brokered by Mayor Giuliani that would give the community a stake in the controversial Pathmark project, construction is finally set to begin.
But as politicians and community leaders gather tomorrow on the empty lot on 125th Street between Third and Lexington Avenues for the groundbreaking ceremony, bitterness lingers among East Harlem's leaders. 
 For supporters of the project, including Mayor Giuliani, the event is a milestone in the community's effort to revitalize the greater Harlem area. With rooftop parking and a Chase Manhattan Bank branch that will open seven days a week, the $15 million, 50,000-square-foot store will create 200 mostly part-time union jobs with health benefits, with 75 percent of the slots to be filled by community residents.
Darren Walker, the spokesman for the developer -- the East Harlem Abyssinian Triangle -- called the project "an extraordinary event" for Harlem. "After decades of no significant growth, we now are beginning to reverse the trend," he said, adding that residents throughout Harlem support the development.
The East Harlem Abyssinian Triangle is a partnership between the Community Association of East Harlem Triangle and the Abyssinian Development Corporation, an arm of the Abyssinian Baptist Church.
But the heads of several local job training and development agencies say the project is falling short. They say most of the jobs created by the store will pay $5.25 an hour, not enough to support a family.
Jose Pagan, the vice chairman of Community Board 11 in East Harlem and the chairman of the board's economic development committee, said the Community Association has not lived up to its promise to work with the board to hire workers for 25 percent of the construction jobs.
"With construction weeks away, they have not hired anybody," Mr. Pagan said.
Concerns have also been raised in recent weeks by Raul Rodriguez, the executive director of the East Harlem Council for Community Improvement, which is to make job referrals to Pathmark, and Harry Rodriguez, chairman of Community Board 11.
Freddy Brown, who is president of the Community Association, said hiring decisions have not been made because the project's closing did not become final until Thursday night. He said he was planning a meeting with the contractor, James A. Smith, this week to discuss job opportunities. JANE H. LII

Value and Growth: More Than a Distinction

BYLINE: By ANNE TERGESEN 

 BODY:
IF the stocks of small companies are finally waking up, as some analysts said during the market's recent storminess, it may be a good time to remember that not all such stocks are alike.
There are growth stocks and there are value stocks in the small-capitalization world, and the common belief that small caps have been doing poorly must be revised when this distinction is made. The growth stocks -- those with above-average earnings prospects -- had total annual returns of just under 12 percent this year through Thursday. But the return on the value stocks -- those that are inexpensive relative to the company's earnings -- was 19.8 percent. 
 "Value is having a phenomenal year," said Claudia E. Mott, director of small-cap research at Prudential Securities.
Such starkly differing results between the two sets of stocks -- measured by looking at the growth and value components of the Russell 2000, the benchmark small-cap index -- are hardly unusual. Last year, for example, the value small caps had a total return of 21.4 percent, nearly as much as the 22.9 percent return of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. In the same period, the growth stocks had a tepid gain of 11 percent. But in 1995, the growth stocks outperformed the value stocks, 31 percent to 25.8 percent.
The pace of the economy and many other factors determine which type of small cap excels. But generally, value stocks outdo the growth variety when the total small-cap market is cool, and growth beats value in a hot market. Thus, in the cool small-cap market of 1993, value small caps had returns that were nearly double those of the growth types. But in the hot market of 1991, growth stocks outpaced value stocks by about 10 percentage points.
With value stocks ascendant these days, what are some favorites of the managers who run successful small-cap value funds?
William J. Nasgovitz, who manages the Heartland Value Plus fund, likes the Continental Homes Holding Corporation of Scottsdale, Ariz., which builds single-family homes in the South and West.
"We are making a bet here on interest rates," said Mr. Nasgovitz, whose fund has risen 36.9 percent over the last 12 months, through Thursday. "Our call is that rates are going lower," which would spur home buying.
But in case he is wrong about lower rates, Mr. Nasgovitz has a safety net. At $22.1875, Continental's stock is cheap, he said. While the stocks of home builders generally trade at an average of 10 times earnings, Continental's sells for a multiple of just 5.2, meaning that the stock will have to rise about 90 percent just to catch up to the industry average. The stock also trades at slightly below its book value of $23 a share.
True, "they probably will have a down quarter, and that's a caveat," Mr. Nasgovitz said of the company, which has annual revenues of $726 million. But Heartland remains bullish on Continental, saying it is diversifying from the weak geographic markets that have deflated its new orders and its stock price, and is venturing into the growing retirement-housing market, which may benefit from new tax laws.
Quanex, a Houston steel and aluminum mini-mill that makes, among other things, air-bag canisters, is another good bet, said Frank Reichel, whose Stratton Small-Cap Yield fund has gained about 43 percent in the last 12 months.
With Government mandates requiring that both front seats be equipped with air bags by the 1998 model year, and with many new cars now featuring back-seat and side bags as well, Quanex's canister business should grow by 50 percent over the next three years, he estimated.
Quanex stock is also cheap, Mr. Reichel said. At $31.75, it trades at 13.5 times its earnings per share, compared with an average multiple of 24.9 for the Russell 2000 at the end of July. And the company, which has annual sales of $896 million, is paring its debt and expanding market share.
All told, the stock may rise to $45 within 12 months, Mr. Reichel said, although he added that if aluminum prices rose, Quanex's fat profit margins might be reduced.
Both Mr. Reichel and Mr. Nasgovitz look for bargain-price stocks that pay dividends. Gary Haubold, who has steered the PBHG Small Cap Value fund to a just under 21 percent return since its start in May 1997, is a value investor who, on occasion, also buys growth stocks. He says a great value stock is a cement maker, Lone Star Industries of Stamford, Conn.
Lone Star stock is trading at $52.25, or about 10.2 times its estimated earnings per share next year. While that price level is consistent with companies that have "mediocre growth prospects," Mr. Haubold said, the outlook for cement is positive. With the economy growing, demand is strong. And cement prices are due for a lift, he added, because of the industry's longtime underinvestment in new capacity.
Moreover, he said, some foreign companies are in the market for American cement makers. If Lone Star, whose $368 million in sales make it the country's ninth-largest such concern, is acquired, its share price could rise above the $65 that he foresees within 12 months.
As with Continental Homes, however, Lone Star stock may suffer if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates and building is curbed.
OF course, inexpensive small caps will not outshine growth stocks forever. Indeed, Satya Pradhuman, the manager of domestic quantitative analysis at Merrill Lynch, expects growth stocks to lead small caps back to health this year. As the gains in blue-chip earnings slow, investors in search of high-earning stocks may turn to growth small caps instead, he said. Their mediocre performance since 1995 has made them cheap, he added.
Ms. Mott forecasts a growth-stocks revival for late in the year, but sees scant evidence of one now. With traditional value strongholds like financial services and basic industries doing well, "value still has some strength to it," she said.

Some Stocks That Even The Bears Would Buy

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
WHEN they look at stocks these days, they use words like "mania," "ridiculous" and "crazy."
They are bears, and some have been predicting a blowoff in stock prices for years. But if you ask them politely, most will acknowledge that there are companies and sectors that are not obscenely overvalued. And for investors worried about the market's recent drops, what better havens than those picked by pessimists? 
 Following are the stock selections of four notable bears:
 
Energy and Health Care
James B. Stack, president of Investech Research in Whitefish, Mont., is quick to say he is not a "gloom and doomer." Still, for the last year and a half the $30 million he manages has been 70 percent to 80 percent in cash.
"The greatest danger is not valuation," he said. "The greatest danger is that we have a psychology that this is a correctionless market, which has eliminated the fear of risk." Without saying how much the market should fall, he said he would feel more "comfortable" if stock prices declined by 15 percent.
The stocks that Mr. Stack does own are in sectors that do better at the end of bull cycles and, often, have high dividends. Energy, drugs and health care and utilities are three examples.
"We are holding stocks like Royal Dutch Petroleum, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Citizens Utilities, which pays a 6 percent stock dividend and is selling at a very low historic valuation level," Mr. Stack said.
He is also watching Japan. "If we see any strength in the Japanese economy, including a rise in interest rates, we will be moving into their stock market," he said.
 
Cable and Private Prisons
Steve Leuthold, chairman of Leuthold/ Weeden Research in Minneapolis, manages about $120 million. He says it will take more than rising inflation or interest rates to bring on a steep correction.
"Those things will upset the professionals, but not Main Street, and that is what is driving this market," he said.
But even though he is awaiting "something that shakes the confidence of Mr. and Mrs. Main Street," he bowed to the reality of the bull market earlier this summer.
"In June we increased our equity exposure to about 47 percent, from 17 percent," Mr. Leuthold said. "We are short-term bullish and long-term scared as hell."
His newly bought stocks are in life insurers like SunAmerica, the Provident Companies and the Equitable Companies. Insurers have good growth prospects, Mr. Leuthold said, yet many of their stocks trade at prices that are low relative to earnings.
Because he sees privatization and incarceration as growth fields, Mr. Leuthold also likes what he calls the "crime stopper" group, companies like the Corrections Corporation of America, the Wackenhut Corporation and the Pittway Corporation.
And even though Bill Gates's deal in which Microsoft bought 11.5 percent of Comcast has made cable stocks pricier, a bear like Mr. Leuthold still considers them cheap enough, given their growth potential. His picks include Comcast, Adelphia Communications and Cablevision Systems.
 
Insurers and a Cafeteria Chain
Charles Allmon, who said in August 1987 that the market was due for a fall, has been predicting the next one almost ever since.
"My guess, and I think it is a reasonable one, is a drop in the Dow of 40 percent to 60 percent by the year 2000, give or take one year from the high the Dow reaches in this cycle," said Mr. Allmon, who believes valuations are crazily high.
The editor and publisher of Growth Stock Outlook, in Bethesda, Md., Mr. Allmon also manages about $140 million. Those accounts are now 80 percent in cash, he said, "more cash than I was holding in 1987."
Still, there are some stocks he likes, including Luby's Cafeterias, which has its outlets in shopping malls across the South, and two insurers, Jefferson-Pilot and Aflac.
Because of the 4.5 percent yield for Luby's, the insurers' growth prospects and other factors, "I am willing to hold these stocks even if they decline 30 to 40 percent," he said.
Mr. Allmon also likes the prospects of Mity-Lite, a manufacturer of folding tables and chairs. "They have no balance-sheet problems and a ton of cash," he said.
And he said he would love to buy some technology stocks -- he particularly likes software stocks -- but they cost too much. "I have about 12 to 15 technology stocks on my list, but they would have to decline 40 percent or more in value before I would consider them," he said.
 
I'll Pass, Thanks
Unlike the other members of the group, William A. Fleckenstein has all four paws squarely on the ground.
"If you believe we are in a new era and the business cycle has been conquered, you can make an argument that securities are pretty expensive, but not bordering on the ridiculous," said Mr. Fleckenstein, whose Seattle money-management firm, Fleckenstein Capital, specializes in short-selling. "If you believe the business cycle has not been conquered, and there are still problems, the equity market is almost ridiculously priced. I am in the latter camp."
Mr. Fleckenstein owns one silver stock, which he declined to identify. He did own some technology stocks but sold them when their prices fell.
"Things are so uniformly out of whack it is hard to find anything I would feel comfortable owning," he growled. "I don't see anything that is compelling. It is far easier to find things that are ludicrous."

Laggards Become Leaders As Small Stocks Revive

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
THE stock market's recent slump -- and its wild volatility last week -- are shuffling the leader boards for stocks and mutual funds.
The well-known multinational stocks that pulled the market higher all year, like General Electric and Exxon, have been outpaced by smaller companies from Ethan Allan furniture to Pool Energy Services. And the once-popular consumer stocks like Coca-Cola, Gillette and Procter & Gamble have lagged badly, even as stocks that tend to track the overall economy, the ones like Caterpillar and Alcoa that Wall Street calls cyclicals, have more than held their own. 
 The pattern continued even as the market fell sharply on Thursday and on Friday morning, before rallying at 3:30 on Friday afternoon. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day off six points but up 2.5 percent for the week.
While it is too soon to say whether the shifts in stock leadership will persist, market gurus say the changes to date have been driven by more than just fears that many stock prices are too high -- which by many measures they are. Corporate earnings, the underpinning of the bull market in stocks, have come under pressure at some big multinational companies, and that has made many investors worry about the outlook for that sector.
The turnabout in stocks has brought to the fore some diversified domestic mutual funds that spent the year through July in the small-stocks backwater. In particular, funds that invest in the very smallest stocks, known as micro-caps, have prospered in August, including Bridgeway Ultra Small and Oberweis Micro Cap, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund trackers in Chicago.
The laggards have been diversified funds that concentrate on bigger companies, especially those in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which had been the best performers until August. One of the worst performers this month, Rydex Nova, was one of the leaders through July. The fund uses futures and options to produce better returns than the S.& P. 500 when it is rising, but that also results in larger declines when the index is falling.
Things have been more stable for specialized mutual funds. Technology funds consolidated their top spot; Merrill Lynch Technology D posted the biggest gain among all American equity funds in the month through last Thursday, followed by Seligman Communications and Information and Fidelity Select Electronics.
Chief among the losers were funds that invest in financial services like banking, insurance and brokerage firms. These funds fell in part because of rising interest rates. Funds that specialize in health care were pulled down as drug stocks took a much bigger hit than the broad market. Adding to the selloff were worries about the expiration of patents in the years ahead and downgrading by some large brokerage firms.
Whether small stocks, cyclicals and technology stocks will continue to dominate the market, and investors' hearts, is unclear. Looking at the entire year, multinational stocks are still fighting with the cyclicals for No. 2 billing, behind technology issues.
And small-company stocks performed the worst this year, even though the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks has risen 22.5 percent since April 11, when the market hit bottom after a monthlong plunge this spring. That is not a bad performance, until one compares it with the gains of technology stocks. The Pacific Stock Exchange Technology index soared 38.3 percent in the same period.
"There is a change in the leadership that is evolving," said Eric Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. So far it seems to be favoring the stocks of small companies, he added, but "it is not decisive."
Several analysts argue that small-company stocks could move up if multinationals continue to disappoint investors as Coke and Gillette did recently with their earnings projections. "As we go longer into this cycle and see some of these larger companies stumble, people begin to look elsewhere," said Edwin Miska, co-manager of the Evergreen Limited Market fund, one of August's top performers, which specializes in very small companies that have solid earnings records but that investors have largely overlooked.
The key will be whether big companies can maintain their profitability, said Claudia E. Mott, director of small-cap research at Prudential Securities. "So much depends on third-quarter earnings," she said. "Will the dollar hurt the larger companies? Will big names say things will be slower?"
She is not yet convinced that market leadership is broadening from the big names. So far, she noted, the outperformance of the Russell index in August has consisted of losing less than the other indexes. The recent jump in the flow of money into small-cap mutual funds could improve this performance. According to AMG Data Services, $1.3 billion went into small-cap funds in the week that ended on Wednesday, and the four-week average flow into the funds is $562 million, the highest since the end of January.
Bryon R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, is expecting many large multinational companies to have earnings problems, because their revenues have been growing slowly.
For example, in the second quarter, operating earnings of the 50 multinationals in the Morgan Stanley index of such companies rose 15 percent while revenues climbed just 7.7 percent.
This means that to increase their earnings, these companies have to depend on cost-cutting, which, he said, is getting harder and harder.
The best performance, he predicts, will come from cyclical stocks, including companies dealing in technology, basic materials, machinery and capital equipment, as well as retailers and automobile companies. "The economy is stronger than people thought it was," he said. "And in a stronger economy, economically sensitive stocks look better."
But Mr. Wien warns that a shift in investor sentiment in favor of cyclicals and away from the multinational consumer stocks will not come quickly. "The belief was so deep," he said, "that it will take a while to break."

HEADLINE: 10 Years After, Lessons of an Earlier Market Peak

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
IT was a glorious summer on Wall Street. Stock prices rocketed to a series of new highs as investors poured record amounts of money into mutual funds. The last recession was a distant memory, and, although interest rates were perking up a bit, inflation appeared under control. With Labor Day approaching, few saw any reason for the market run-up to end anytime soon.
Sound familiar? The description fits today, but the same events transpired in the summer of 1987, at the end of one of the greatest bull runs in Wall Street history. On Aug. 25, 1987 -- 10 years ago tomorrow -- the Dow Jones industrial average peaked at 2,722.42, culminating a spectacular advance of more than 40 percent in just eight months. 
 Who on Wall Street that day could have known that less than two months later, those gains would evaporate in a frenzy of selling, the memory of which still produces knots in the stomachs of many market longtimers?
To some who lived through it, the crash of Oct. 19, 1987 -- when the market plummeted 22.6 percent in a single session, a percentage decline nearly twice as large as the 1929 debacle that ushered in the Great Depression and more than seven times the 3.1 percent plunge that rattled Wall Street nine days ago -- seemed like a bolt from the blue.
But even as the first crocus poked its head out of the still-thawing ground that spring, signs of trouble were sprouting on the economic landscape. By late August, they were everywhere, and a few nervous investors were beginning to sniff a disaster. Before the market opened on that Black Monday in October, stock prices had already fallen more than 17 percent from their peak.
With the parallels between the market exuberance of 1987 and 1997 so stark, the question naturally arises: Are there also parallels between economic conditions then and now that forebode another market meltdown?
A review of the developments that led to Black Monday makes it obvious that the United States economy is in much sounder shape now than it was then.
In addition, policy makers have clearly learned the lessons of that era and are not likely to make the same mistakes.
But the same historical retrospective shows that even as events that bring down a market unfold, their capacity for damage often goes unrecognized. And that raises a troubling question for investors in 1997: Now that the economic generals know how to fight the last war, will they recognize the warning signs of the next one?
So many economic and political episodes -- from the recent currency crisis in Southeast Asia to last month's balanced-budget accord in the United States -- hold the potential for disruptive consequences that even the savviest policy maker cannot know exactly how to respond to them. And market downturns have a habit of catching people by surprise. Indeed, the big guessing game on Wall Street these days is whether a correction or worse is under way at this very moment.
That said, many analysts are much more comfortable with the resilience of the American economy today than they were a decade ago. "From my perspective, 1997 and 1987 are very dissimilar," said Wayne D. Angell, a Bear, Stearns economist who 10 years ago was a member of the Federal Reserve Board. "At that time, you had a deterioration of the economic policy environment, which meant stocks were not going to work as the market had priced them.
"The economic condition was worsening from October 1986 through October 1987," he added. Today, by contrast, it is not. "My major responsibility is to blow the whistle of alarm if economic policy starts to deteriorate," Mr. Angell said. "I do not see any signs of that occurring. I continue to expect that the bull market goes on and on and on, interrupted only by some corrections."
 
Letting the Good Times Roll
Probably the most striking similarity between 1987 and today is the investor euphoria that in both periods helped fuel the market to ever loftier peaks -- peaks that, then as now, economic killjoys were warning were unrealistic by traditional measures. The good times, it seemed, would never end.
"I would say that things today are maybe 70 percent similar to 1987" in that regard, said Robert Farrell, a senior investment adviser at Merrill Lynch who in 1987 was the firm's chief market strategist. "On an economic basis, the two periods are different. But we have a period of overvaluations, with high public participation in the market and a high level of complacency in bullish sentiment."
For example, Mr. Farrell recalls, analysts considered the market to be highly valued in March 1987 -- and it shot up another 20 percent over the next five months as $3 billion a month flowed into mutual funds, foreigners scrambled to invest in American stocks and the total supply of stock shrank from all the leveraged buyouts and other deals that were taking place.
Market players who recount their astonishment at the 1987 gainssound remarkably like people today marveling over the Dow's climb from one millennial post to the next.
Barton M. Biggs, chairman of asset management at Morgan Stanley, spent part of August 1987 climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa.
"I had been out of touch for a week, and when I came back down from the mountain I got a copy of The International Herald Tribune," Mr. Biggs recalled. "I remember looking at the prices of stocks and just being stunned by the gains that had occurred in just a week."
Peter Lynch, then the manager of the Fidelity Magellan fund, the country's largest mutual fund, also spent a lot of his time shaking his head in wonder.
"What sticks in my head is that in the four years from August 1982 to September 1986, the Dow went up 1,000 points," Mr. Lynch said. "In the next 11 months, it went up another 1,000 points. That's an unbelievable acceleration."
Like many investors in 1987, though, Mr. Lynch saw no reason to fear a market crash. Indeed, he went on a mid-October trip to Ireland, the first vacation he had taken since the beginning of the bull market in 1982.
He acknowledges having some misgivings as the market headed lower in early October, but, he said, "I'm not going to cancel what was to be my first vacation in five years, based on something that might never happen."
Of course, historical analogies are never exact, and the mood of the 80's differed in some important ways from today's.
In contrast to the more circumspect 1990's, investors and corporations had a weakness back then for extravagant borrowing and flamboyant gestures like the Digital Equipment Corporation's decision to have a $20 million party aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2 in Boston Harbor to announce a new product offering.
Even so, Mr. Biggs said, investors were probably a bit more squeamish 10 years ago than they are now.
"I see much the same environment today that I saw in 1987 as far as the momentum of the market, and the enthusiasm in stocks that are going up, making their own magic," he said. "But I think there was less exuberance then than there is today. Any time you get a market making a big move, people tend to ignore valuation measures. And there's always the argument that it is different this time and this is a new era. But in 1987, I don't think people were making that argument to the same extent that they are now."
Mr. Farrell of Merrill Lynch agrees about the climate of a decade ago.
"Nobody was talking about the economy being in a sweet spot, with just enough strength and no inflation," he said. "At that time, people were concerned about the economy. And while there were people talking about a new era, that was not as prevalent as it is today."
But if the mood was ebullient back then, the forces driving the economies of 1987 and 1997 were pushing in very different directions.
 
The Clouds Gather
Then, as now, the most potent force was the cost of credit. The higher the interest rates people and businesses must pay for loans, the heavier the drag on the economy; the lower the interest rates, the more powerful the impetus.
For those who were asked to compare the two eras, one of the sharpest discrepancies was the sudden uptick in interest rates in the summer of 1987, even without any explicit action by the Federal Reserve Board.
That reversed what had been an extended period of rate declines that unwound the high interest rates engineered in the early 1980's by the Fed chairman, Paul A. Volcker, to squelch rampant inflation.
From January through July 1986, the Fed made three cuts in the discount rate, the rate at which member banks borrow money from the Fed. As short-term rates fell, so did Long-term rates, to about 7.5 percent from 10.5 percent a year earlier. As rates came down, so did commodity prices; in July 1986, at the time of the third rate cut, the price of a barrel of crude oil stood at $9.74.
In August 1986, the Fed took a final step to cut short-term borrowing costs, trimming half a percentage point from the discount rate, to 5.5 percent. Mr. Angell, the former Fed board member, now says that was a mistake. "Paul Volcker and I both agreed afterwards that was the one we shouldn't have made," he said. Soon, the prices of precious metals started to rise, followed by the prices of other commodities later in the year.
Those price gains were largely ignored by Fed watchers, who, drawing on their experience of the early 1980's, saw monetary aggregates -- M1, M2 and other money supply statistics -- as the most important indicators of economic direction. By the time Federal Reserve policy makers agreed that inflation was picking up again, "we were behind the curve," Mr. Angell said.
Had the Fed bumped rates up closer to 7 percent in the first quarter of 1987, it might have orchestrated a soft landing of the economy and avoided the market turmoil to come, he said. Instead, its inaction was compounded by a a surprise move in early June by the Reagan White House: the decision not to reappoint Mr. Volcker as Fed chairman and to name Mr. Greenspan -- the former chief economic adviser to President Gerald R. Ford but mostly an unknown quantity as a monetary policy maker -- to the post instead.
Mr. Greenspan took office in mid-August and the Fed finally raised rates on Sept. 4, but by then world markets had lost confidence in its resolve. "I think there was a question about the Federal Reserve's credibility," Mr. Angell said. "The 30-year bond would not have been able to rise well above 10 percent without some people making pretty heavy bets that monetary policy would not be able to bring inflation down."
Stock prices had already started to slip further in early October, as the Federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans -- rose a quarter-point and the yield on long-term Treasuries rose above 10 percent for the first time in two years. The mood of the stock and bond markets was not helped when Salomon Brothers announced its intention to close its municipal bond department and lay off 10 percent of its staff, setting the tone for retrenchments around Wall Street.
Today, the monetary picture could not be more different. Mr. Greenspan, confirmed to a third four-year term last year by an adulatory Senate, reigns as the inflation-slaying idol of the financial markets. While some people worry that he is not keeping the credit reins quite tight enough, most people expect him to work them with just the right finesse.
The discount rate is at 5 percent, the same as it was a year ago, while in the same period short-term Treasury bills have hovered at just over 5 percent and 30-year bonds have eased to 6.65 percent from 6.79 percent. And nobody pays attention to M1 or M2 anymore.
"I'm not suggesting that the Federal Reserve is that much smarter today than in 1987," Mr. Angell said. "But I feel confident that the Federal Reserve has a lot of credibility. As a result, there is little likelihood that the Fed will have to raise interest rates a whole bunch or make a whole series of increases." He expects the Federal funds rate, now at 5.5 percent, to end the year at 5.75 percent.
 
Disunity at the Top
The confusion surrounding American monetary policy in 1987 was not limited to interest rates. Nobody could quite figure out the Federal Government's stance toward the dollar.
The dollar's strength, or weakness, exerts a huge influence over the American economy. A strong dollar makes American goods more expensive overseas, weakening demand and thus widening the country's chronic trade deficit. A weak dollar, on the other hand, makes imports more expensive, and thus can be inflationary. One of the main tools for modifying the dollar's value is raising or lowering interest rates, which makes dollar-denominated securities more, or less, appealing to investors.
In early 1987, the Reagan Administration switched its policy from one favoring a weaker dollar to one that was officially neutral and finally, in mid-April, modified it further with a declaration by Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d that further declines would be "counterproductive." But it was reluctant to implement the higher interest rates and narrower budget deficits that would make that goal a reality.
Worries about the dollar's continued slide had started to push interest rates higher in mid-March, catching many bond traders and Wall Street firms by surprise. In the second quarter, Wall Street firms lost $1 billion because of higher long-term rates.
Financial markets were also caught in the intricate crossfire among the industrial powers over whether the best way to stabilize the dollar was for Washington to do more to tighten fiscal policy or whether Germany and Japan should do more to stimulate domestic spending. September also brought into the open the conflict between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, with Mr. Greenspan apparently determined to demonstrate his independence from the Administration on coordinating international economic policy.
Today, by contrast to 1987, the dollar is stable and relatively strong. In the last year, it has risen about 22 percent against the Japanese yen and 26 percent against the German mark, with the recent budget accord between President Clinton and the Republican Congress providing another bulwark.
More important, there is no lack of cooperation between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury, now led by Robert E. Rubin and his Deputy Secretary, Lawrence H. Summers. "It would appear that Alan Greenspan and Bob Rubin have regular weekly meetings, and they appear clearly in sync," Mr. Angell said. "You don't have any statements coming from Larry Summers or Bob Rubin that would cause you to say, 'Does this make sense in regard to what the Fed is doing?' "
 
Other Economic Worries
Aside from all the confusion emanating from lawmakers and policy gurus 10 years ago, serious economic dislocations were developing at home and abroad.
By late August 1987, oil prices had climbed above $20 a barrel because of uncertainty in the Persian Gulf, where foreign oil tankers were flying American flags and sailing under American escort.
Moreover, the trade deficit was still ballooning despite the lower dollar, which was just beginning to help make American goods more competitive in world markets.
The banking system was in serious straits. Congress approved a $10.8 billion infusion into the beleaguered Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, which insured deposits in savings and loan associations, many of which already were suffering the ill effects of real estate loans gone sour. But everyone close to the situation knew that the money was grossly inadequate and that the Reagan Administration wanted to put off dealing with the problem until after the 1988 election.
Simultaneously, Brazil threatened the big American money-center banks with a refusal to repay its debts. In the second quarter, the 15 largest United States banks added more than $10 billion to their reserves for possible loan losses, the largest such move since the Great Depression and one that significantly cut the pool of money available for loan to American corporations.
Today, all those problems have receded into memory. World oil production is rising, and many analysts expect prices to decline from the current $20 to $21 a barrel to $18 or less in the next few months -- though American dependence on imported oil has grown, auguring potential problems for the economy if there is ever an abrupt cutoff of supplies. The trade deficit is down substantially as a percentage of gross national product. And the banking system is healthy.
 
Then Again, You Never Know
For all the differences between 1997 and 1987, the economy wasn't all that bad back then. Indeed, after the October crash led to an easing of Fed policy, the economy continued to grow for nearly three years. In the view of some analysts, the market collapse that fateful fall day was not as bad as it seemed.
Mr. Lynch, the former Magellan fund manager, noted that in 1986-87 the market first went up 1,000 points in 11 months and then went down 1,000 points in two months. "If the market had instead gone sideways for a year, people wouldn't have been worried at all," he said. "In fact, nothing really happened. Companies were doing well. Corporate profits were O.K.. The crash was one of those funny things that happen in time.
"There is a big misconception that everyone lost money in 1987," he added. "But the market was up for the year. Everyone did not put money in the market in August and take it all out in October."
And if the economy was not as bad then as many people now assume, it is also not necessarily as invulnerable now as some would like to think. After all, Murphy's Law -- if something can go wrong, it will -- often strikes when people are reveling most loudly in their good fortune.
For example, said Mr. Farrell of Merrill Lynch, it not yet clear how the market will react to last month's budget agreement. "It is hard to read right now, but it is going to affect the market in some way," he said.
Mr. Lynch finds great reassurance in the small talk he indulges in with strangers on airplanes. "I don't have people recommending stocks to me these days," he said. "That's usually the final sign of the speculative boom: People recommend stocks to me, and those stocks go up. There are four phases of reactions people have when I meet them on an airplane and they ask what I do and I say I manage money. In the first phase, they say, 'Oh,' and they go on to the next subject. In the second phase, they ask, 'What do you like?' In the third phase, they might then recommend you take a look at something. But in the fourth phase, they recommend a stock to you and you take a look at it and you notice that it goes up substantially. We don't seem to have entered that phase yet."
 
The Downward Spiral
After the market peak on Aug. 25, 1987, it was a short trip to the market meltdown. In its first meeting after Mr. Greenspan took charge, the Fed finally made its move, raising the discount rate by half a percentage point, to 6 percent, on Sept. 4. But the market sensed that further tightening was in the offing. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had already slid 5 percent from its peak, continued to drift down, as investors weighed signs of higher inflation. Then, in quick succession, the index of leading indicators registered its sixth consecutive increase, signaling a strong economy that might have to be reined in; foreigners appeared to be steady sellers of Treasury bonds, indicating that rates would have to go up to attract enough future buyers; and, in mid-September, the Government reported that industry operated at 81 percent of capacity in August, the highest level since late 1984, another sign that the credit noose would have to be tightened.
By early October, investors had learned that the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.8 percent the previous month, its lowest rate in eight years, and money-center banks moved independently of the Federal Reserve to raise their lending rates, lifting the prime rate half a percentage point, to 9.25 percent.
On Wednesday, Oct. 14, the Dow suffered its largest single-day point drop: 95 points, or 3.8 percent. The next day, Chemical Bank led its peers in raising the prime rate by another half-point, to 9.75 percent. The Dow, helped along by a furious rate of futures-related trading as institutions sought to lock in the year's still-impressive portfolio gains, fell another 57 points, to 2,355.
Before the week ground to a halt, however, stock prices collapsed in a broad selloff on Friday, Oct. 16, again spurred by a heavy bout of futures-related program, or computer-driven, trading. Capping the stock market's worst week since the week in 1940 when France fell to the Germans, the Dow recorded its first daily loss of more than 100 points and finished the week down 9.5 percent. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was the heaviest ever, at 338.5 million shares. At the end of the day, the bellwether market index stood at 2,246, or 17.5 percent below its August peak.
And the worst was yet to come.

"The Pride Before the Fall"
The remarkable stock market run-up in the first eight months of 1987 masked an accumulation of events that, in retrospect, offered early warnings of the tubmle -- and then the collapse -- that would follow in September and October. Incipient inflation, a dispute over the strength of the dollar, ballooning trade deficits, tightening credit and a rise in private lending rates -- well ahead of any action by the Federal Reserve -- all helped turn Wall Street's euphoria into an avalanche of sell orders.
 
April 1987 -- Bond prices drop sharply because of fear that a falling dollar will revive inflation. Government bond investors lose about $20 billion.
 
June 15 -- Crude oil price rises above $20 a barrel for first time in 17 months, up from $10 a year earlier.
 
July 17 -- Dow Jones industrial average closes above 2,500 for the first time, for a gain of 32 percent so far in 1987.
 
Aug. 25 -- Dow industrials gain 25 points to close at 2,722.42, a record.
 
Sept. 1 -- Long-term bond yields rise to 9.27 percent after the sixth consecutive monthly increase in the index of leading indicators. Dow falls 52 points, or 2 percent.
 
Oct. 16, Friday -- Dow suffers first daily loss of more than 100 points, on heaviest New York Stock Exchange volume yet recorded: 338.5 million shares. Treasury bill rates plunge.
 
Oct. 19 -- Black Monday. The Dow loses 508 points, falling 22.6 percent.
 
CORPORATE EVENTS
 
March 18 -- Chase Manhattan Bank offers a certificate of deposit whose interest rate is linked to gains in the value of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
 
June 9 -- Brazil threatens to withhold billions of dollars in loans to U.S. banks. Banks are forced to increase loan loss reserves, leading to $10.8 billion in second-quarter losses for the 15 largest U.S. banks. It was their worst quarter since the Great Depression.
 
Aug. 24 -- Gillette spurns $5.4 billion takeover offer from Revlon, the third rejection of a takeover offer from Ronald Perelman in a year.
 
Sept. 16 -- Industries operated at 81 percent of capacity in August, the highest level since November 1984, the Government reports.
 
Oct. 7 -- Money-center banks raise the prime rate by one-half point, to 9.25 percent, the highest since early 1986.
 
GOVERNMENT EVENTS
 
May 19 -- Federal Reserve votes to tighten monetary policy, a decision made public on July 11.
 
June 2 -- President Reagan nominates Alan Greenspan as Federal Reserve chairman, to replace Paul A. Volcker.
 
July 17 -- Treasury suspends sales of savings bonds and postpones regular weekly auction after Congress fails to extend Federal debt ceiling.
 
Aug. 4 -- Senate follows House in approving a banking bill to inject $10.8 billion into the savings-and- loan insurance fund.
 
Sept. 4 -- Federal Reserve raises discount rate to 6 percent from 5.5 percent.
 
Oct. 2 -- Unemployment falls to 5.8 percent in September, the lowest level in eight years.
 
Oct. 14 -- Trade deficit narrows to $15.7 billion, but decline is only half as much as expected.
 
Oct. 19 -- White House issues statement in which President Reagan says, The underlying economy remains sound.

THE FED
Inflation? What Inflation?
The Federal Reserve, continuing a remarkable economic experiment in which it has kept interest rates low despite shrinking unemployment and unusually strong economic growth, left interest rates unchanged, with the key Federal funds rate at 5.50 percent. That is because inflation remains at the lowest level since the early 1960's, below an annual rate of 2 percent in the first half of the year. Providing evidence of the strong economy, the nation's trade deficit narrowed, to $8.2 billion in June from $9.54 billion in May, as exports rebounded to a new record and imports subsided for the first time this year. Housing construction was steady in July at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.45 million.
 
THE MARKETS
It Climbs! It Dives!
What could be more fun in the dog days of August than a roller-coaster ride? One can only hope investors have retained a 12-year-old's enthusiasm for thrills and chills. The Dow industrials, surging back from a 247-point tumble on Aug. 15, , chalked up three consecutive gains of more than 100 points -- a first for the blue-chip average. Then, on Thursday, investors took profits with a vengeance, apparently worried that interest rates could rise and spoil everyone's fun. The Dow lost 127.28 points, and the pummeling continued on Friday, with the average losing XXX.TK points to close at 7,XTK.TK. With leading technology companies like Microsoft, Intel and Dell joining the retreat, the Nasdaq composite index also skidded, closing at 1,5TK.TK, down TK.TK for the week.
 
U.P.S. STRIKE ENDS
The Brown Trucks Are Rolling
After more than 80 hours of intense negotiations, 185,000 striking teamsters began returning to work at United Parcel Service. Company executives said fears of mounting losses forced them to settle the 15-day strike. The union won most of its demands, like keeping control of pensions and limiting the use of part-time workers. Hourly wages for full-time workers over the five-year contract are set to rise by $3.10, to a top rate of $23, and for part-time workers by $4.10, to a top rate of $15. Ron Carey, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, asserted that the settlement would be as much a boon to labor as the failed air traffic controllers' strike of 1981 was a bust. And most Americans -- even Wall Street analysts, who normally see wage inflation where labor sees a living wage -- were cheered. But four days after the settlement, Mr. Carey was handed a setback. After an eight-month investigation into allegations of fund-raising abuses by Mr. Carey's campaign, a Federal official threw out his narrow re-election victory over James P. Hoffa and ordered new balloting.
 
TOBACCO SUITS
Is the Marlboro Man Wheezing?
About 100,000 Americans "might have" died from smoking-related diseases, conceded Geoffrey Bible, the chairman and chief executive of Philip Morris, during pretrial questioning by a lawyer representing the State of Florida. The state is suing the major tobacco companies, seeking $12.3 billion for the public cost of smoking-related illnesses. Separately, the attorneys general of 20 states asked the White House to support an exemption of the Liggett Group from the financial terms of the proposed $368.5 billion settlement with the tobacco industry because of its earlier deal with their states and the company's "valuable role" in bringing the other tobacco companies to the bargaining table.
 
THE A.M.A. DEAL
What the Doctor Ordered?
Stung by widespread criticism of its planned endorsement of Sunbeam health care products, the American Medical Association sought to abandon its marketing alliance with the company. "The A.M.A. apologizes for creating a public doubt about our motives," said Dr. P. John Seward, the organization's executive vice president. Instead of a royalty deal that was expected to bring in millions of dollars, the A.M.A. wants to package informational brochures with health care products, charging companies fees to cover its costs. Sunbeam's reaction was stormy. Its chairman and chief executive, Albert J. Dunlap, said, "We have a contract with the A.M.A., which we are prepared to honor, and we expect them to honor it as well."
 
VALUJET CRASH
F.A.A. and Airline Faulted
Supervisory failures by both Valujet Airlines and the F.A.A. were responsible for the Everglades crash 15 months ago that killed all 110 people aboard, the National Transportation Safety Board said. James E. Hall, the board chairman, said, "The Valujet accident resulted from failures all up and down the line, from Federal regulators to airline executives in the board room to workers on the shop room floor." The plane crashed because of a fire started by oxygen generators from other planes that were improperly packed by a contractor and loaded into the jet's cargo hold.
 
'MIDLIST AUTHORS'
You're Not John Grisham
These are humbling times for seasoned writers known as "midlist authors," those whose sales are too mediocre to crack the best-seller lists. The book market is gloomy, and publishers say multimillion-dollar advances paid to top-tier writers have soaked up financial resources. In the 1960's, many writers whose books sold fewer than 15,000 copies believed publishers had a social contract with writers, but publishers today feel the need to satisfy stockholders, said Albert N. Greco, a Fordham professor. Still, Ann Birstein, a retired Barnard professor who had eight books published before receiving 10 rejection letters on her latest literary novel, keeps trying. And Barry Beckham, a novelist and writer of college guides, was turned down on a work about Chase Manhattan Bank. Now he is serializing it on the Internet.
 
BREAST IMPLANTS
Dow Chemical Loses in Court
In a major courtroom setback for one of the nation's largest chemical producers, a Louisiana state jury in New Orleans found that Dow Chemical had knowingly deceived women by hiding information about the health risks of silicone used in breast implants and had failed to test silicone adequately before it was used in the human body. The decision in a class-action lawsuit potentially involves the claims of 1,800 women who received breast implants. What compensation, if any, eight representative women should receive will be decided in the trial's second phase, expected to start in late September.
 
THE MERGER FRONT
British to Pay Less for MCI
MCI Communications won F.C.C. approval for its $23.4 billion merger with British Telecommunications. But MCI stunned Wall Street with an ominous disclosure that financial terms of the deal might be revised. Indeed, British Telecom said Friday that it would pay as much as 22 percent less than originally agreed. In other merger developments, Texaco, seeking to increase its oil reserves in California, agreed to acquire Monterey Resources, the oil assets of the former Santa Fe Railroad, in a stock transaction valued at $1.12 billion. Comverse Technology, a leading maker of telephone voice mail systems, agreed to pay $843 million in stock to acquire a rival, Boston Technology.

HEADLINE: Spoils of Peace;
A New Credo: Make Money, Not War

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
HAS there ever been a moment quite like this? In the United States, high-yield retirement accounts are making near-millionaires of thousands of salaried workers and hourly wage earners. In India, resort towns are crammed not with foreign tourists but with newly affluent Indians, more than a few of them village people in chartered buses who come to enjoy wonders once reserved for the rich and powerful. All over Asia, and in eastern Europe, Russia and Latin America, the emerging middle classes are buying designer clothes and computers and taking foreign vacations. Even in struggling but newly hopeful Africa, leaders are urging aid donors to prod investors and provide advice on how to fire up the private sector.
As a whole, the world economy has been growing at about 3 percent annually in recent years, a rate of expansion that will exceed that of the 1980's, the United Nations predicts. It's easy to fret, as many do, over blips and glitches -- and neither Wall Street nor the tiger currencies of Southeast Asia have been without them lately. But that misses the larger point: never before in modern history, arguably, has so much of the world savored economic growth, however rough around the edges. Much of this is thanks to peace. 

 
 
Freed Spirit

Economists call the surge in human productivity the real peace dividend -- it is not simply reductions in military spending. And though they may disagree about how wisely this windfall is or is not being reinvested in one place or another, they pretty much agree that a world battered by a century of devastating wars now faces a future with unparalleled opportunity.
No major international wars are being fought. The world has its ugly regional conflicts -- its Bosnias, its Rwandas -- but no Stalin, no Hitler, no Mao visits the cruel whims and devices of totalitarianism on vast numbers of its people. No military alliances are faced off in a global arms race. Democracies flourish. The end of the cold war has removed ideological chains and with them distortions of economies rooted in big-power rivalries. India, for example, lost its cozy relationship with Moscow and was forced to sink or swim with economic reform, jettisoning an accretion of Soviet-inspired practices. In Central America, a number of nations, not the least of them El Salvador, lost the automatic cold-war patronage of the United States and are now learning to build civilian economies largely on their own resources and with new partners, including some major Asian ones.
Since ancient times, people have required the breathing space of peace to plant crops, develop crafts, build industries and engage in barter -- to release the enormous human energies that quickly turn to economic activity. In the 1990's, there are new factors at work spreading such vigor worldwide -- not least technology. One of the most technologically sophisticated nations, the United States, has emerged as both a military giant and economic powerhouse, a situation few predicted a decade ago when it was fashionable to argue that America's leadership would not survive the century.
Gavin Wright, an economic historian at Stanford University, says that analysts have been comparing this era to the Pax Britannica of the last century and early this century, "when the British had domination of the seas and certainly were not afraid of being attacked in Britain." Such a situation, he added, "was a very positive thing for long-term investment in new technologies and skills." As this century ends, the United States is in roughly the same position and, released from the cold war fears of giving away knowledge to the enemy, is more willing to share and sell American know-how.
"You could say that we wouldn't be having this globalization unless it were basically an era of peace," Mr. Wright said. "People are relaxed about the transmission of technology across borders."
 
A Foundation
 But many historians and analysts of world trends caution that peace on its own is never enough for sustained economic strength. Peace provides only a positive environment for development and growth. Social, political, cultural and sometimes geographic factors take over from there, they say, and they point to short-term problems in healthy countries and some long-term weaknesses elsewhere -- in many African nations, in North Korea and in pockets of the former Soviet bloc. Also, in an age of economic globalization, the policies of disparate nations and regions need a certain amount of mesh. The collapse of Communism and the discrediting of centralized economic policies have fostered integration. But the next stage is crucial.
"If peace is defined as the absence of conflict, that may or may not mean that you have what you need to get economic growth going," said Paul Goble, a former adviser to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d on Soviet nationalities and the Baltics who is now a director at Radio Free Europe in Washington. Mr. Goble sees many false hopes for what peace could bring in Central Asia, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
"The Chevron oil company has obviously seen the movie 'Field of Dreams' one too many times," he said. " 'If you drill it you can get it out.' You can drill it, but whether you can get it out is a big question. Central Asia is potentially one of the wealthier places in the world except that its located in the middle of a huge land mass and you can't export things easily. If you have the infrastructure and geography right, then peace may let economic development break out. If you don't, then it doesn't."
James Chace, a Latin American expert who teaches international Relations at Bard College and edits the World Policy Journal, agrees that "the danger is to try to make too easy a connection between peace and prosperity." But he tempers his doubts. "It's true that in peace you are more likely to have prosperity. Generally businessmen don't like war. The merchants of death may, but that's an exception. For the average businessman, the banker, it spells turmoil, uncertainty -- so why would you do it? Interstate conflict is less and less likely now."
The looming problem is translating worldwide growth into equity for all, he said, and that applies to the United States as much as to the third world.
"In times of war, you rally people around the flag," he said. "But if there's no trouble abroad, it's very hard to distract them. If you strip people of the benefits they have come to expect, if too many people are left out of the economic boom, particularly in the middle class, then you can have internal turmoil. Turmoil at home and peace abroad -- I think that is the most likely danger, unless you begin to have an economy that avoids social dislocation."
Mr. Chace looks back to the 1890's, when the United States was at peace and in an economic boom, but there was unrest because organized labor was suppressed and not a lot of wealth was trickling down. A century later, the growing phenomenon of small civil conflicts, coupled with widening gaps between rich and poor in many nations -- and the existence of hundreds of millions of people in absolute poverty worldwide -- gives policymakers plenty to work on in peacetime.
"Peace is not only the absence of conflict," said Juan Somavia, Chile's representative at the United Nations. "It is the presence of human security -- at the individual level, the family, the community. Peace is also positive things happening within a society. The two peaces are necessary. The problem today is that, yes, you have less major conflict, but you also have more human insecurity worldwide. The real security threat of the future is that people feel insecure in their own societies."
And it isn't hard to see why they would view economic globalization not as an unparalleled opportunity to attract investment and modernizing skills to their countries but as a new form of economic imperialism.
With external threats fading, the policies of nations are now on the line, with no place to hide, most economic historians and social scientists agree. Amartya Sen, professor of economics and philosophy at Harvard, says one challenge is to sustain research when there are no foreign threats, for the betterment of lives. Another is to change the thinking that posits war as a source of human creativity.
 
Domestic Upheavals
 Claudia Goldin, an economic historian at Harvard, agrees. "Periods of war are periods of tremendous disruption," she said, and sometimes the negative effects are great even when the war is not fought on one's own soil. Case in point: the domestic upheaval caused in the United States by the Vietnam War. Calling wars the mother of invention is wrong, says Ms. Goldin.
"Out of World War II came antibiotics, aluminum, jet planes, the atomic bomb," she said. "We had everything that American ingenuity was forced through long hours and hard labor to invent in the briefest period of time.
"It was an enormous triumph but it was not because of the war. We had it in us all the time. We would have had a jet engine. Antibiotics would have been invented. Aluminum would have been produced. We had synthetic rubber, we just had no reason to use it. Most great inventions do not come when you have a gun to your head."

Damage to Mt. Morris Bank Could Be Developers' Bonus

 BODY:

To the Editor:
For many years the city has been trying to auction the Mount Morris Bank building but with no takers ("Fire Is a New Blow for an Old Bank," Aug. 10). The millions needed to make it usable made no economic sense. Now that the top floors have been removed the building is a huge bucket that will trap water and snow. 
 After the bricks start falling again, an "emergency" order will be issued and the building will be leveled. Since the land use review process has been concluded the vacant land will then be sold to developers for many millions.

France's Allegiance: To Things French, Like Hypocrisy

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
CHARLES de GAULLE, who knew his people well, once said: "Every Frenchman wants to benefit from one or several privileges. It is his way of affirming his passion for equality."
It was the general's way of gently capturing an essential French duplicity. Perhaps in no other country are form and substance so divergent. Formal discourse is full of grand principles: equality, solidarity or, more recently, the iniquities of American-driven globalization. But the substance may have more to do with the defense of privilege or the concealment of pragmatic acts in the robes of idealism. 
 A French politician's art thus lies in offering splendid ideals while insuring the people get fed. Francois Mitterrand, the late President, was a master of the art. After a brief and calamitous experiment with textbook socialism, he opted to defend only principles lofty enough that they would never affect the franc's strength. Goodbye, Albania; hello, the bourse. By the end of his second term in 1995, he had elevated the riddle to the heart of his governance.
All this may be worth remembering at a time when France is taken very much at its word. During the cold war, French posturing was an irritant, but seldom more, to the United States. In its aftermath, a very public French stand against the harsh capitalism of America's boom and the dangers of a world driven by the American quest for profit has given a new edge to the allies' old sparring. At times, as at the summit of major industrialized nations last month in Denver, it has looked like real rivalry.
France has become America's favorite European basket case. With its socialist government trying to create state-sector jobs by the hundreds of thousands, its record unemployment, its diatribes against globalization, its quaint plans for 32-hour work weeks and its defense of an apparently unaffordable welfare state, France has taken over Britain's role as the faintly risible archetype of the failed European economy. It is the Titanic-with-piano-still-tinkling adrift on a sea of global competition.
There is, of course, much substance to this vision of France. Fewer and fewer businesses want to hire because it costs too much to do so, and many of the 3.6 million unemployed have settled into a way of life based on perennial state financial assistance combined with odd jobs on the black market. Initiative is quashed and dependence encouraged. Disillusionment spreads.
But the French reality is rather more complex. It has to do with the fact that change, adaptation and modernization must be masked because they have little to do with the country's self-image.
That image is attached to notions of equality, a strongly centralized Jacobin state and change, if it all, through revolution alone. Evolution is a kind of anathema in the land of 1789 and 1968. As Pierre Birnbaum, a sociologist, said, "We have not found the way to modernize while preserving our imagined community."
So modernization takes place on the quiet. Thus, in the past decade alone, France has turned a currency that was a laughing stock into one virtually as strong as the German mark. It has freed capital movements, an idea once unthinkable in the home-par-excellence of the secret Swiss bank account.
It has sold off great swaths of state industry, including the automaker Renault, the oil company Elf Aquitaine, the chemicals giant Rhone-Poulenc and the manufacturer of Gauloise cigarettes, Seita.
 
Creeping Retail
 It has littered the countryside with Americana: more than 600 McDonald's restaurants, Toys "R" Us in countless malls, Haagen-Dazs on fashionable Paris streets. It has adopted American habits, cutting way back on the leisurely lunch and banning smoking in the Metro. It has allowed St. Germain-des-Pres, sanctuary of the Left Bank intellectual, to turn into a glitzy -- and depressing -- home to international fashion.
Its national airline, Groupe Air France, no longer flies to even major cities where it cannot make a profit. The profit motive, pure and simple, has also driven numerous private companies -- including Michelin, L'Oreal, Carrefour and the luxury-goods conglomerate LVMH -- to adapt and remain highly competitive throughout the world. These have contributed to the country's huge trade surpluses, and to the fact that France is the world's fourth-largest exporter.
Drive out of Paris in the direction of Rambouillet, and you will soon find the town of Coignieres. A decade ago there were wheat fields there; today it is a hymn to the American way of life. A busy highway cuts through a landscape dominated by McDonald's and other hamburger restaurants, Pier 1 Imports, warehouse-stores selling bathroom fittings, and advertisements full of words like "light" and "cool." Coignieres is globalization incarnate.
 
Nothing to Be Done
 "I suppose all this is inevitable," said Jacques Eperon, who runs a small choucroute tavern opposite the Coignieres McDonald's. "I don't like it much, but in the end you have to accept it."
So change is accepted and not much liked. And more than ever, politics becomes the art of concealing change behind anti-American slogans and the like.
Lionel Jospin, the new socialist Prime Minister, seems to be aware of this. The Government talks a lot about the 32-hour week and jobs in the state sector and American economic arrogance while it gets on with preparing new privatizations and the austerity measures needed to qualify for the planned adoption of a single European currency, the euro, at the end of next year.
Mr. Jospin knows that the French still want to dream of "du pain et des roses" -- "bread and roses," or a salary and poetry. In this he has proved more adept than President Jacques Chirac, who sometimes seems insufficiently shrewd for the divided French heart.
A lot is heard today about French roses. The country wants to offer some poetry and compassion to a globalized world where it often seems the rich get richer and the poor poorer. That can be an irritant to America. But it should not be forgotten that France also has an eye on its bread.

Defining Disadvantage Up to Preserve Preferences

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHO'S left?
That's the question that follows the Clinton Administration's recent announcement that it is considering a proposal to make it easier for whites to qualify for contracting preferences that had been reserved almost exclusively for racial and ethnic minorities. The proposal is part of a trend in which supporters of affirmative action seeking to widen the policy's political base, pushed by a 1995 Supreme Court ruling that made it difficult to operate programs based solely on race, have steadily broadened the definition of oppressed groups whose members qualify for special help. 
 Conceived as a policy to help blacks, many affirmative action programs have, over the years, been stretched to cover Hispanic people, Asians, Native Americans, Hawaiian Polynesians and women of any color or creed. Now, the Administration is contemplating rule changes that would open the affirmative action door to more whites, including white men.
While arguably legally necessary, the proposed change raises a number of uncomfortable questions. At what point have the benefits of affirmative action been scattered so broadly that they actually diminish rather than enhance opportunities for blacks, the group the policy was originally designed for? What is the justification for recent immigrants, who came to the United States voluntarily and may or may not have suffered from discrimination, to share the fruits of a policy meant to help the descendants of slaves who were forcibly brought here? At what point does "socially disadvantaged" become defined so broadly that the only ones not included are Donald Trump and Bill Gates?
"We have reached the point where Hasidic Jews are eligible, immigrants from India are eligible, white women are eligible," said Gerald Reynolds, president of the Center for New Black Leadership and a fervent opponent of affirmative action for anyone. "We've gone so far from the original idea that I believe it's time to reassess the whole approach."
 
A Different Purpose
 As the beneficiaries of affirmative action have increased, its moral rationale has changed. Supporters now speak as much of achieving diversity in a work force or on a college campus as they do of making up for past racism or preventing current discrimination. But while diversity may be a noble goal, it does not necessarily mesh with the original idea of affirmative action: helping to overcome the vestiges of slavery and Jim Crow.
"The concern that I have about the rhetoric of diversity is that it doesn't have any moral bite to it," said Glen C. Loury, a professor of economics at Boston University. "You end up with a kind of touchy-feely policy where you've lost the thread of why you were looking to treat people specially in the first place."
The latest step in the trend toward affirmative action catholicism came Aug. 14, when the Small Business Administration proposed changes in requirements for companies to qualify as "small disadvantaged" businesses. The new rules would cover companies that want to be enrolled in special programs that provide technical help and eligibility for certain Federal contracts set aside for them. The rules also cover companies that, if signed up as subcontractors, give larger prime contractors bonus points when they bid on Federal contracts.
Under the proposal, the owner of a small company would be considered economically disadvantaged if he or she had a personal net worth of less than $250,000, excluding equity in a home -- a criterion that more than 90 percent of Americans could meet. Applicants would also have to show that they were socially disadvantaged, meaning that they have been the victims of some kind of chronic discrimination. Blacks, Hispanic people, Asians and members of other racial minorities are presumed to meet this criterion, while whites, both men and women, would have to make a showing of past bias.
While the proposed new rules would make it generally easier for whites to make a case, Federal officials say white men will still have difficulty establishing that they have suffered from discrimination. "This is not opening the floodgates for people who might not qualify," said Aida Alvarez, the S.B.A. administrator.
Perhaps not yet. But the Federal courts could very well toss some banana peels on what is already a slippery slope. Last month, Federal District Judge John L. Kane Jr. in Denver ruled that the white owner of a construction company had been the victim of bias -- and therefore was socially disadvantaged -- because he lost out on a government contract as a result of an affirmative action program that the Supreme Court later ruled unconstitutional. The ruling is not binding beyond Colorado, but it lays down a new legal principle: whites who could prove they have been unfairly treated by affirmative action programs would be eligible to apply for affirmative action programs.
"Judge Kane's ruling draws a circle around this program and puts everyone inside," said William Perry Pendley, the Denver lawyer who represented the white contractor.
The question of widening eligibility is vexing to black supporters of affirmative action. More beneficiaries could mean more support for a policy that is under growing attack in the courts and in the political arena. But more beneficiaries also means diluted benefits. In 1987, when they were first included in a Department of Transportation program that set aside contracts for "disadvantaged" businesses, companies owned by women earned 20.4 percent of dollars in the program. By 1996, the percentage had climbed to 41.4 percent.
"That's why it's such a dilemma," said Anthony W. Robinson, president of the Minority Business Enterprise Legal Defense and Education Fund. "You do need that kind of political support to try to preserve the policy. But sometimes you wonder whether you're cutting your own throat at the same time."

You Can't Read Books Fast Enough

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

 BODY:
SO many titles, so little time. So why do publishers produce enough new books daily to overpopulate a small library wing?
On any given day, the nation's latest literary choices amount to feast or frenzy -- roughly 166 new titles ranging from "Biggest Elvis" (promoted as "a witty novel that turns a trio of Elvis impersonators working clubs on the Pacific Rim into a powerful evocation of America") to "Letters From a Nut" ("Dear Greyhound Bus People: I will be dressed like a stick of butter. Can I get approval for this?"). 
 With more than 58,000 trade titles published last year, not even a voracious reader can keep up, a fact that some publishers of serious nonfiction and popular novels are starting to absorb in a bleak time of declining hardcover sales.
"You have to realize that your obligation as publisher is not to sign every book available in the marketplace," said Jo Kiener, the chief operating officer for HarperCollins, which angered many writers and their agents when it decided in June to cancel more than 100 contracted books.
"Your obligation is to the business," Mr. Kiener said, "and we choose to publish so that we can do the best damn job we can with publicity, marketing and promotions."
 
Information Overload
 Media conglomerates are not the only ones questioning the steady widget-like production of popular books. Small publishers, who are trying desperately to gain their share of attention for literary fiction and serious nonfiction, also have doubts.
"Everybody has come to the conclusion that the number of titles is not the same thing as the number of readers," said Peter Osnos, a former Random House executive who started a new Public Affairs imprint to publish serious nonfiction.
"We don't believe anymore that the publishing of books is Immaculate Conception," he said. "You have to find the audience because there's an awful lot of competition for people's time."
It's a truism in New York City, the hub of American publishing, that readers are slicing up their time, shifting from the written page to the flickering computer screen and web sites. But, in fact, books are still holding their own in the competition for attention. While people have been devoting less time to reading newspapers and magazines over the last decade, they have actually increased the time they spend on books -- dedicating about 100 hours a year to that pursuit, according to various recent surveys. And although many of them are logging on to the Internet and its many on-line services, that time amounts to only eight hours a year.
So why then are publishers having such a difficult year selling books? Albert N. Greco, an associate business professor at Fordham University who has studied the consumer book market, says that a critical part of the answer is a simple issue of supply and demand.
"What I think you have is a tremendous amount of titles," he said. "There are too many titles being published and too many in the wrong market. You're looking at an aircraft carrier in the Atlantic Ocean and you can't turn that around on a dime. They have contracts for books that won't be delivered until the year 2000 and there is a massive commitment to books in the pipeline."
The tide of titles actually reached its crest in 1995 with 62,039 new titles, a 20 percent increase from the year before, which was the highest output of American books since the Puritans brought the first press to the Massachusetts Bay colony in 1638.
 
Wrong Theme, Wrong Time
 But this growth did not generate an increase in sales. It also didn't guarantee contracts and fat advances to every author seeking to write the great American novel; many were laboring over manuscripts lacking the popular appeal that publishers want.
"You picked the wrong theme in the wrong time," observed Mr. Greco of literary authors hoping to rise with the tide. "There's a very limited market for midlist authors and that limited market is not going to grow."
It was in the midst of this wave that Jonathan Karp, a senior editor at Random House, shared a lunch with a colleague from sales who idly mentioned a notion that would haunt the editor for days to come.
"You know," the salesman confided in Mr. Karp, "I'd be perfectly happy if we didn't publish any new novels for a year or two. Our books would sell a lot better if there were a moratorium on fiction."
That conversation prompted Mr. Karp to raise the issue at an editorial meeting with 15 colleagues. He wondered aloud if there was any real demand for the novels that they publish. The first response was silence, he recalled in an article he wrote for a publishing journal. Then came the brave consensus: it's a publisher's job to build demand.
In the last few weeks -- since canceling books and trimming its publishing list -- HarperCollins has been making the case that it is going to build demand for its books by promoting and focusing on a smaller number of titles. "Everyone understands that there are signs of diminishing returns with an ever-increasing number of books," said Mr. Kiener, who estimated that his company's list of titles published annually will drop to 1,000 from 1,600.
 
The Yale Method
 Perhaps publishers should seek some guidance from librarians and curators who have already faced the issue of book inflation and finite shelf space.
Patricia C. Willis, the curator of the Yale Collection of American Literature in New Haven, subscribes to the "cone theory" -- in which the book production expands outward in girth with more books published each year. As the cone widens, she said there is simply too much for her collection to absorb.
"There are so many being published that it is time to trim the list," said Ms. Willis, who described the Yale library as an "intelligent vacuum cleaner."
But unlike publishers, Ms. Willis is free to make her choices based on literary distinction. She follows no particular rule except she considers the staying power of contemporary authors and monitors whether rare book collectors consider the works valuable enough to keep for years to come.
Asked if Tom Clancy novels are stocked on her shelves, Ms. Willis swiftly replied, "I have Tom Wolfe, who is a graduate."
 
Graph: "Too Many Books Published and Not Enough Readers"
Publishers have been printing more books than people are actually buying. Some have begun to cut back. Graph tracks the number of book titles produced, from 1991 through 1996. It also shows a breakdown of 1995 book purchases, by book category. And, it tracks the number of hours spent per person using various forms of mass media each year in the U.S., from 1986 through 1996.

HEADLINE: G.I.'s Slaying in '92 Entangled in Panama's Politics

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PANAMA

 BODY:
On the eve of a visit here by President George Bush in June 1992, an American soldier was shot and killed as he drove an Army Humvee near the Panama Canal. Based on the accounts of witnesses, an arrest warrant was quickly issued for the son of a powerful anti-American politician who is the president of the party that now governs this country.
Five years later, the man arrested, Pedro Miguel Gonzalez, has still not been tried for the slaying of Sgt. Zak A. Hernandez. The police official who led the investigation that resulted in Mr. Gonzalez's arrest has been forced to resign, his life has been threatened and he now faces prison on charges that he and human rights groups say are fabrications. 
 "In this country, those who have power define the truth, so I suppose I should not be surprised by what is happening," the former police official, Jaime Abad Espinosa, said in an interview. "In Panama, politics is often mixed in with the administration of justice, but this case is extraordinary by any standard."
From the start, the killing of Sergeant Hernandez and the wounding of another American soldier at the same time have taken one odd turn after another. Mr. Gonzalez was named as the chief suspect in the slaying almost immediately and a $100,000 reward for his capture was offered. But for more than two years he evaded capture and was said by the police to have fled to Cuba.
Early in 1995, Mr. Gonzalez gave himself up. But instead of going to the police, he surrendered to President Ernesto Perez Balladares at the National Palace, with his father, Gerardo Gonzalez, and Mr. Abad's replacement as chief of police at his side. The proceedings were shown on national television.
Gerardo Gonzalez, a member of Congress, said he had sought that unusual arrangement "to avoid an attempt on the kid's life." Once Mr. Perez Balladares came to power in September 1994, he said, "the proper conditions for my son's personal security finally existed, so that he could defend himself and not be killed in jail." Under the previous Government, Mr. Gonzalez maintained, "there was only a campaign of judicial terrorism and persecution against" his son.
But Arcadio Hernandez, the father of the slain American soldier, thinks the surrender in the palace sent a different message. "What it really said was that both the father and the President of Panama were going to give him aid and support, that he had all the resources of the Government at his disposal," Mr. Hernandez said in a telephone interview from his home in Puerto Rico.
These days, Pedro Miguel Gonzalez is confined to an air-conditioned jail cell equipped with television, cell phone, fax and computer. Prosecutors have repeatedly indicated his trial is imminent, only to delay it further at the last minute.
The postponements have come as Panama is beginning negotiations that would permit as many as 4,000 American troops to remain here as part of an antidrug effort after the Panama Canal is handed over to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.
Under the canal treaties, American troops stationed in the former Canal Zone are supposed to leave here by that date, and all American bases are to be handed over. But President Perez Balladares has floated the idea of a drug interdiction center as the linchpin of an effort to attract foreign investment and tourism to the so-called "reverted areas."
A banker and economist, Mr. Perez Balladares represents the pragmatic, business-dominated wing of the Revolutionary Democratic Party. In contrast, Gerardo Gonzalez heads a populist, anti-American faction of the party, which Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega controlled during the 1980's and used as a tool of military dictatorship until Mr. Bush sent 20,000 American troops to depose him in December 1989.
"Gerardo Gonzalez hates the Americans and wants them gone," said a Latin American diplomat here. "But with his son in jail, he must be careful not to offend the President, who knows perfectly well he has a trump card and has used it to keep Gonzalez in line. So it has been in the Government's interest, and perhaps Washington's too, to drag this case out as long as possible."
Gerardo Gonzalez is expected to be elected president of the Panamanian Congress in September. He said in an interview that he would insist his son's trial take place as soon as possible. "We're tired of waiting," he said. "The boy is innocent, and there is no proof against him."
Neither Raul Montenegro, Minister of Government and Justice, nor his deputy, Martin Torrijos, responded to requests to discuss the charges against Mr. Gonzalez or Mr. Abad.
American officials here and in Washington also declined to comment publicly on the case. But a local lawyer, Diego Velazquez, has been hired by the United States Embassy to represent the Hernandez family's interests and assist the prosecution.
The chief prosecutor in the case was said by colleagues to be on vacation, but in an interview, Mr. Velazquez said he had no doubt that Pedro Miguel Gonzalez and two accomplices, who have been arrested, were responsible for the killing. Three witnesses put them at the scene, he said, and others saw them in the stolen car from which the shots were fired. The car was later found on one of Gerardo Gonzalez's farms.
Ballistic tests ordered by Mr. Abad also implicated Pedro Miguel Gonzalez in the killing. But Gerardo Gonzalez then accused Mr. Abad of suppressing other ballistic tests that he said exonerated his son. This led to Mr. Abad's arrest and trial.
No verdict in that case has been announced. But Mr. Abad has strenously denied any wrongdoing, and said the charges had been fabricated to weaken the case against Pedro Miguel Gonzalez. "There are only two alternatives," he said. "Either I stole evidence, or he is a terrorist and an assassin who is using the influence and protection of his father to make me a scapegoat and derail the prosecution of this case. And I will tell you this: I am no thief."
Human rights groups here have strongly criticized the Government's treatment of Mr. Abad. The Panamanian Center for the Investigation of Human Rights and Judicial Assistance said the charges against him had been subject to "manipulation" and handled with "unaccustomed dispatch," whose "clear purpose is that its result influence the result of the other case."
Mr. Abad said that on the day of his trial, he was approached in the courtroom by Gerardo Gonzalez, who said to him, "You're a C.I.A. dog, and I'm going to see you go to jail."
Asked for his account of the confrontation, Mr. Gonzalez said that it was "absolutely a lie" to say he accused Mr. Abad of working for the C.I.A. "I said that he was working for the American Embassy, that he was a puppet who allowed himself to be manipulated," Mr. Gonzalez said.
Arcadio Hernandez said such incidents would not dissuade him from attending the trial of the man accused of killing his son. But he is concerned about the outcome.
"They've threatened witnesses and thrown out judges and acted with no respect for the rule of law," he said. "So far, it's been nothing but a show, and I worry that what comes next is going to be even worse."

HEADLINE: Credit Lures College Students Down Path to Onerous Debt

BYLINE: By HALIMAH ABDULLAH 

 BODY:
LaToya Dailey's credit troubles began with a T-shirt giveaway. They spiraled into a credit-card debt of more than $8,000 by her sophomore year in college.
"I was a freshman and there was this guy giving out free T-shirts, so I went over," said Ms. Dailey, who just completed her junior year at the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa. " 'Want a free T-shirt, just sign up here for a Discover card.' So I did. And I've been signing and paying ever since." 
 Richard Matson, an aspiring filmmaker who attends Columbia College in Chicago, said he figured he would have no problem getting through college debt-free. His parents had saved an $80,000 college fund. But today, $65,000 and three colleges later, Mr. Matson is running through the remaining money with a monthly credit-card payment of $900. He used his credit cards to satisfy his needs, often splurging on his wants: books, trips to New York, film supplies and beer.
"It's stupid, I know; sometimes I blow my money on silly things," he said. "I've gotten a lot of other offers from credit-card companies and so far I've turned them down. But now I'm thinking about getting every one I can find."
Scenes of credit-card representatives offering items like Frisbees, T-shirts and candy as "premiums" to sign up for various credit-card offers have become commonplace on American college and university campuses, experts say. This aggressive marketing has led more and more students to subsidize their education and their life styles with credit cards. The debts come on top of record amounts of student loans, and students around the country say they feel overwhelmed by the consequences of their credit-card use.
College students teeter under a load of missed payments, high interest rates and default accounts, said Robert McKinley of RAM Research Group, a credit-card industry research company in Frederick, Md.
Freshmen and students strapped for cash are especially enticed by the credit-card marketing, said Debbie Conrad, manager of community education at the Michigan division of Credit Counseling Service, a nonprofit organization that counsels people with debt problems.
"We're running into students who feel they had neither the income nor maturity to handle a credit card," she said.
Mr. Matson is transferring to Columbia University in New York next year and now realizes that debt is inevitable. "I have about $15,000 left in my savings account," he said. "It's not going to be enough to cover tuition at Columbia. I'm just going to have to take out a loan."
Spokeswomen for some of the nation's largest credit-card companies contend that students have no more problems with credit-card debt than anyone else, although they decline to give numbers.
Maria Mendler of Citibank, said of the students, "Sometimes they're a better credit risk."
But consumer debt specialists say they are seeing more students in trouble. It is a result of the increased marketing of credit cards to college students in the late 1980's and early 1990's as part of an industry effort to revive the then-sluggish credit-card market, Mr. McKinley said.
Patricia Scherschel, a spokeswoman for the USA Group, a nonprofit group that provides student loan services, said that it was easy for student debt to snowball because many students are taking on larger student loans just to get by.
"Clearly students are borrowing more to finance their college education," she said. "Investing in a college degree is worthwhile even if it means the student needs to borrow."
The rise in student loans can be attributed to several factors, said Tom Kane, associate professor of public policy at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Since 1993, when the Government raised loan limits and made getting loans easier, loans have tended to supplant outright grants, Mr. Kane said. As private colleges limit institutional aid, he said, "the share of the cost paid by families and students in tuition has been rising."
At Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, students are learning a lesson in debt management. Its students graduate with, on average, $26,031 in debt, according to U.S. News & World Report's annual ranking of colleges.
Students are advised about their debt load upon entering and graduating, said Donald Chenelle, director of financial aid at Case Western. He said students "have to budget and manage their money well."
Across town in the corporate offices of Cleveland Scholarship Programs Inc., students are learning to do just that. More than 90,000 students have been served by Cleveland Scholarships, the nation's oldest college-access program, helping inner-city youngsters get and pay for a college education. The program advises and coordinates financial aid for more than 500 students every year.

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeks Elbow Room To Develop Trade Deals

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: EDGARTOWN, Mass., Aug. 23

 BODY:
President Clinton called on Congress today to give him greater freedom to negotiate free trade agreements with other countries, getting a jump on one of the toughest legislative challenges that await him when he returns from his Martha's Vineyard vacation.
In his weekly radio address, Mr. Clinton made a detailed defense of his economic strategy, which he said hinged on opening more markets abroad with "tough new trade agreements." 
 "To keep our economy growing and to create these good jobs," he said, "we must keep tearing down foreign barriers to American goods and services."
Mr. Clinton is seeking so-called fast-track authority, which would give the Administration greater flexibility in seeking several new trade accords around the world, including a long-promised extension of free trade privileges to Chile.
The fast-track legislation would allow the Administration to negotiate trade accords that Congress could approve or disapprove, but not amend. The theory is that if Congress could change the contents, negotiations would never stop. The last fast-track authority lapsed three years ago.
But the President faces stiff opposition within his own party, in a debate that is likely to figure prominently in the next Presidential race. With the backing of labor unions, Representative Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader and a likely rival of Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination in 2000, opposes the legislation.
Opponents say the North American Free Trade Agreement has cost America jobs, depressed wages and damaged the environment along the border, assertions the Clinton Administration disputes.
Trying today to blunt the main objections to his trade policy, Mr. Clinton said he would "continue to promote worker rights and responsible environmental policies with our trading partners."
The Clinton Administration had considered pushing for the trade legislation last spring, but concluded that it would interfere with negotiations on a balanced-budget agreement. The Administration is now counting on passage of the legislation this fall, since it probably could not win Congressional approval in 1998, an election year. Mr. Clinton plans to submit the legislation in the second week of September, aides said.
"It'll be a tough fight, no question," said Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman. The President, he added, "wants to take every opportunity to remind the American people of the benefits of free trade."
While his proposed first step is to negotiate a free trade accord with Chile, Mr. Clinton has more ambitious plans. Fast-track authority would let him pursue the "Free Trade Area of the Americas," which he promised at the Latin American summit meeting in Miami in 1994.
But despite Mr. Clinton's efforts, the United States is seen internationally as retreating from its vigorous free trade policy. Canada and Mexico, the two other Nafta signers, are thus striking their own deals in Latin America, saying they cannot wait for the United States to act.
Mr. Clinton warned today that the United States risked being left behind. "If we don't seize these new opportunities," he said, "our competitors surely will. Already since 1992, in Latin America and Asia alone, our competitors have negotiated 20 trade agreements that do not include the United States."
Noting that "95 percent of the world's consumers live beyond our borders," Mr. Clinton said more than one-quarter of the country's economic growth over the last four years had come from trade abroad.
In the Republicans' weekly radio address, Senator Bob Bennett of Utah charged that John Huang, a former deputy assistant secretary at the Commerce Department and later a fund raiser for the Democratic National Committe, had used his Commerce post to pass sensitive information to his former employer, the Lippo Group of Indonesia. Mr. Huang has denied the accusation.

HEADLINE: The Tangled Trail That Led to a Beef Recall

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Neb., Aug. 23

 BODY:
One late spring day last year, several trucks rolled away from the Hudson Foods processing plant in this small city in the heart of the nation's beef belt. They were loaded with beef patties destined to be turned into Whoppers at Burger King restaurants in the Midwest.
But after the trucks were well on the road, Hudson Foods made an unsettling discovery. It had shipped the meat before getting the results of the bacterial tests that Burger King requires, said Mark A. Giresi, senior vice president at Burger King. When the results came back, they showed that some of the beef had staphylococcus bacteria, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea. 
 "We made them pull it all back," Mr. Giresi said, before the meat made it to any Burger Kings.
Hudson Foods dismissed a worker over the incident and tightened supervision and shipping procedures.
"Human error was made and the company dealt with it aggressively and strongly," Skip Rutherford, a company spokesman, said today.
But Burger King was alarmed enough to do something it had never done: it placed Hudson Foods on what it called probation, checking the plant's Burger King production line eight times a month.
In late June, after a year with no problems, Burger King stopped the special monitoring. Seven weeks later, Hudson Foods was pressured by Federal officials into closing the Columbus plant indefinitely and making the nation's largest meat recall, 25 million pounds of ground beef.
Today, Mr. Giresi said Burger King would stop buying beef from Hudson Foods, so the plant is losing its biggest customer.
Hudson Foods called the decision a "serious disappointment" and said it was doing everything it could to regain Federal approval.
"We believe this is a very good and safe plant," Mr. Rutherford said.
The trajectory of the relationship between Burger King and the Hudson Foods plant may say as much about the competitive and sensitive nature of the meat industry as it does about the specific quality of production at a single meat processor thrust suddenly into the spotlight.
It is a world where Federal regulations have left much unspecified. Many practices are determined by the dictates of efficiency or the marketplace. So many different steps and companies are involved that the chain from ranch to slaughterhouse to processing plant to customer is far from an easily traceable line.
At the Hudson plant here, many employees and even Federal inspectors say that the plant, one of the most modern in the industry, is clean and generally well run. But Federal investigators said that some of the plant's practices were worrisome. Specifically, they said, poor record-keeping and the mixing of leftover hamburger patties on June 5 into the next day's production meant that there was no guarantee that any meat produced subsequently would be free of bacteria.
Officials from the United States Department of Agriculture have said that meat from Hudson Foods was contaminated with E. coli bacteria before it ever reached the Columbus plant, most likely in one of a handful of slaughterhouses. Seventeen people in Colorado became ill after eating the hamburger patties. All recovered, but bacteria in food kills an estimated 9,000 Americans a year.
Federal officials told Burger King that the problems they did find at the Columbus plant were not found in the separate production line the plant ran for Burger King, which requires significantly stricter procedures than Federal law does.
Still, Mr. Giresi said, "We've advised them that we will not be buying any more beef products." He said that Burger King, which has nine other beef suppliers, would still buy chicken from Hudson Foods. The chicken is produced at other plants.
Mr. Rutherford said Hudson was reviewing its options for the plant.
"We've also said that if we can do things better, then we'll certainly be open to doing that," he said, adding that the company remained convinced that the contamination came from outside. "We've listened; we've heard. If there are improvements that need to be made, we'll do that."
The plant at the center of this swirl of events is in many ways a more advanced and better-maintained operation than many other meat-processing plants, said Federal officials and employees who have worked at Hudson and similar companies.
It is an impressive edifice, a sprawling grayish-beige building with gleaming windows, a stone-fringed pond out front, and, at least on a sun-baked day in August, dozens of sprinklers spraying the bright green manicured grass. On Friday, the day after the plant was temporarily closed and the recall of the 25 million pounds of beef -- nearly a fifth of the plant's annual production -- was announced, employees were open in their support for the plant.
"I have a freezer full of Hudson meat I get with an employee purchase discount, and I'm not throwing it away," said Jenny Jacobson, 26, who operates a scale used to weigh meatloaf and tubes of meat.
Ms. Jacobson and two other employees, leaving the plant after a company meeting, said the sanitary procedures were the most sophisticated and strict they had ever seen.
"We wear hairnets and hard hats over that," Ms. Jacobson said. "Men with any facial hair at all wear beard nets. We all have to go through a boot wash when we come in."
Mary Everett, 41, another scale operator, interjected: "No nail polish, no jewelry. We're a good-looking bunch, I'll tell you that."
Brenda Johnson, 24, who makes meatloaf boxes, added, "They even have automatic toilet flushing."
The Hudson Foods plant, with its 230 employees, is not the most significant employer in Columbus, which is about 90 miles west of Omaha. In fact, the city calls itself the most industrialized municipality in Nebraska. It has a low unemployment rate and 6,000 manufacturing jobs -- making everything from hypodermic needles to satellite antennas.
Still, when Hudson Foods Inc., based in Rogers, Ark., opened its only beef plant here two and a half years ago to make frozen patties for Wal-Mart, Sam's Club and other chains, people lined up for jobs, said Dale Collinsworth, executive vice president of the Columbus Area Chamber of Commerce. The pay was average, but the plant was modern and mechanized.
The Hudson Foods plant has had the kind of brushes with regulatory agencies that most meat producers have. In 1996, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the plant $4,000 for mostly administrative infractions like inadequate written guidelines for emergency evacuations. (Since 1972, Hudson Foods has been fined $454,498 by OSHA, more than $330,000 of that imposed last month against a poultry processing plant in Noel, Mo.)
In Columbus, Agriculture Department inspectors are at Hudson Foods every morning, as they are at most large plants, to see that the plant complies with Federal regulations. While the Department of Agriculture has approved new regulations that will begin taking effect in January, current guidelines do not prescribe as many tests or procedures as Burger King and some other large chains. Employees said that staff quality-control inspectors sampled beef every hour and tested it at a plant laboratory.
An inspector for the Department of Agriculture, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the Columbus plant as very clean. Still, he said that in addition to the record-keeping and leftover meat practices that caused the Federal Government to push for a recall, the department was questioning some practices at the plant, including a decision to have cleaning crews work only at night, rather than cleaning the plant after each lot of beef is processed, which could be several times a day.
After the recall and temporary shutdown, James T. Hudson, the company's chairman, said in a statement that the decision was made "out of an abundance of caution to restore the public confidence."
For its part, the city of Columbus is standing solidly behind Hudson Foods. "Anybody who has been through their plant knows it's just as clean and well run as any place can be," said Dick James, who was broiling cheeseburgers at Dickie Doodles, his convenience store near the plant.
Many people said they wished the Agriculture Department would focus more public attention on the slaughterhouses and on the stores that sold the beef patties in Colorado.
"I think it's been blown out of proportion," said Rick Kubler, a stock and insurance broker eating at Glur's Tavern. "Nobody's died."
And Mr. Collinsworth said all the publicity might have an ulterior undercurrent. "There's always somebody out there trying to downgrade the meat industry," he said. "I'm sure the people -- veggies, is that what they call them -- I bet they're rejoicing right now."

HEADLINE: With Fierce Competition for Homes, Minutes to Spend Millions

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
A few weeks before the stock market surged past 8,000 for the first time, James and Tiffany Palmer ventured into the Manhattan real-estate market with a modest goal: an extra bedroom for Whitney, their newborn daughter.
The couple saw little reason to worry. She is a lawyer at a white-shoe firm, he is a stockbroker. Both not yet 30, they were a poster couple for the city's booming economy. And yet from their first meeting with a nervous real-estate agent in May, they saw they might as well have been shopping for blue-period Picassos. 
 "The broker just came right out and said: 'I only have six apartments,' " Mr. Palmer, 29, recalled. "I said, 'Can you do a check?' She said: 'I checked. That's it. Call another broker, they'll give you the same six apartments.' "
It was a cold dose of reality, even on the Upper East Side, for a couple reluctantly willing to spend half a million dollars for two bedrooms. But the Palmers' story -- one of bidding wars, lost apartments, hard dealing and jangled nerves -- is not among the worst these days.
Manhattan apartment prices, which had been climbing steadily out of a six-year slump, have now begun to slingshot skyward in many neighborhoods, brokers say. And buying an apartment has once again become a singular New York ordeal.
The average price of apartments sold by one firm has increased 17 percent since last summer. Prices for large apartments -- four bedrooms and up -- have jumped 32 percent over last year, a rise not seen even in the mid-1980's frenzy.
But the market for buyers is worse than the 1980's in a more fundamental way, brokers say: even those willing to pay inflated prices are having a harder time. The supply is short because relatively few new buildings are under construction, and the conversion of rental apartments to cooperatives, once a kind of pressure-release valve, has slowed to a trickle.
At the same time, sharply rising rents are inducing more renters to try to become buyers, and the city's freshly scrubbed image is drawing more outside buyers.
The result is the tightest market in decades. Even with the recent volatility of the stock market, brokers say price increases show no signs of flagging.
"This has become the strongest real-estate market in recent memory, maybe the strongest in the postwar period," said Clark Halstead, head of the Halstead Property Company, a leading brokerage in Manhattan. The company recently reported that average sales prices in Manhattan below 96th Street have increased for five straight quarters.
Some ripples are already beginning to reach parts of Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and the northern Bronx, though those price increases appear less steep. Still, James Cornell, a Brooklyn broker whose territory covers Park Slope, Prospect Heights and Windsor Terrace, said demand was so much higher than supply that "we're doing more taking names than actually showing property."
Bigger paychecks and lower interest rates have buoyed demand and increased prices in nearly every metropolitan area in the country. But in Manhattan, where much of the real-estate market has always been in an eye-popping category by itself, the situation is magnified.
New York is a city full of frightened, frustrated buyers and savvy, sometimes unscrupulous sellers. When the Palmers walked into their first prospective apartment on East 73d Street, not completely satisfied with what they saw, their broker pulled them aside and urged them to meet the seller's price, $440,000.
"I said, 'What are you, crazy?' " Mr. Palmer recounted. "That's not the way it's done."
But other buyers rushed in, the seller invited them all to submit offers in writing and the Palmers, who reluctantly wrote down $460,000 -- $20,000 above asking -- were outbid.
"We were blown away," Ms. Palmer, 28, said recently. They lost three more apartments in bidding wars before finally finding one on East 86th Street, where they agreed to the asking price.
There are still many oddly shaped or dismally dark apartments that sit on the market for months because they are overpriced. But the Real Estate Board of New York, in a survey of 673 cooperative sales during the second quarter of 1997, found that sellers got an average of 95 percent of their asking price, the highest percentage in years.
Recently, many more apartments than usual have sold above the asking price: one in the most recent Real Estate Board survey went for 115 percent. In the second quarter of 1994, by comparison, the average seller got only 83 percent.
Aware of the demand, brokers say that some sellers have adopted hardball tactics: demanding sealed, written bids, something that used to be rare; throwing bids out when more lucrative offers come in, using a contract already signed by a buyer to bargain for a better offer.
Mark Zimmerman, a real-estate lawyer, said a client rejected by a co-op board suspected that the man selling the apartment had persuaded a friend on the board to turn down his offer because a new buyer offered more money. "But we can't prove anything because the board's deliberations are all private," Mr. Zimmerman said. "The seller is really in complete control now."
The squeeze is finding its way even into the rarefied upper reaches of Fifth and Park Avenue apartments, where it seems every real-estate brokerage has what could only be called embarrassment-of-riches stories.
An American banker, returning to New York after several years in Paris, said that he apartment-shopped with his wife for a week in April and offered $1.15 million, slightly under the asking price but all cash, for a six-room place at Fifth Avenue and 68th Street. The satisfied couple returned to Paris, only to get a call from their broker.
Another buyer had sauntered in and offered "significantly over the asking price" -- also in cash -- said the banker, who asked that his name not be used. He and his wife flew back to search for another apartment, and when they found one, they took no chances. "I said, 'I'll write you a check this afternoon if you like,' " he said. "Let's not futz around with this."
Dan Green, the 36-year-old owner of a travel agency who also lost a luxury apartment to a higher bidder this spring, summed up his experience succinctly: "Now, you have literally seven minutes to make up your mind. And we're talking about a lot of money here."
Prosperous buyers are "getting accustomed to loss," said Barbara Corcoran, who heads the Corcoran Group, a high-end Manhattan brokerage. "And once they lose an apartment they love," she said, "they become different people."
Buyers in the market's lower register are having just as hard a time.
The Real Estate Board survey found that studios and one-bedrooms cost 10 percent more than in the second quarter of 1996. Two-bedrooms -- the largest number of apartments sold in Manhattan -- cost 19 percent more. The Corcoran Group said last week that the average price for an apartment sold by one of its brokers was $464,000, up from $364,000 two years ago.
All of which makes it more disheartening than ever to compare Manhattan prices to those in the rest of the country. For that half million the Palmers were willing to spend, for example, they could have had a three-bedroom condo with a lake view in downtown Chicago.
It is more difficult to assess New York City's prices outside Manhattan, where brokers do not consistently collect boroughwide statistics. But a recent study of the price of houses found that 101 of the 130 ZIP-code areas outside of Manhattan experienced rises.
In Brooklyn, the study found, 35 of the 36 ZIP codes showed increases, as did all 12 ZIP codes on Staten Island. And that is with a relatively flat inflation rate.
In interviews, brokers in every sector of the market said emotions were running high. Buyers distrust brokers, who they feel are pushing them into a sale for their commission's sake. Couples snap at their brokers and their lawyers and at each other. "What's happening here is that people can't really shop for their dream home as much anymore," said Mr. Zimmerman, the real-estate lawyer. "It's not, 'Wow! This is my home and it's wonderful.' It's about getting the deal done."
Brokers, stung by deals that failed because clients moved too slowly, are also getting tougher. Marlene Steiner, a normally soft-spoken broker at Corcoran, said she has to watch herself. "I'm starting to sound like 'Glengarry Glen Ross,' " she said, referring to the David Mamet play about Chicago real-estate hustlers who live by the maxim: "Always be closing!"
It does not appear that the pressures will ease anytime soon. While city permits for new construction are up, the numbers are nowhere near as high as analysts say they would need to be.
Construction permits, both for rental and sale, are up through June of this year -- 4,252, compared with 3,531 for the same period last year, according to the United States Census Bureau. The numbers are small when compared with construction during the mid-1980's, when 20,332 permits were issued.
And even before the current crunch, analysts were saying that to keep pace with demand, the city would have to construct 40,000 new apartments every year -- a number even they admit is unrealistic.
Meanwhile, brokers said they have begun to see many more renters deciding to buy because rents have also been increasing sharply.
Added to other pockets of demand that appear to be growing -- buyers moving to the city for the first time, those moving back from the suburbs, those deciding not to go to the suburbs when they have children, and buyers from abroad -- the result is a market increasingly out of balance.
"I think it's safe to predict," said Debra Beck, an executive vice president of the Real Estate Board, "that there are going to be a lot of disappointed people walking around out there for a while."
Tomorrow: How the rising real estate market is creating a ripe climate for scams.

HEADLINE: Summer Scene in City: Mayor's Rivals on Move

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
From crowded shopping boulevards to a parade route in the Bronx and a public swimming pool in Queens, three Democratic mayoral candidates competed for the attention of New Yorkers at play yesterday by assailing Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and, to a lesser extent, squabbling among themselves.
Ruth W. Messinger, smiling and waving as she carried her 1-year-old granddaughter, Amani, marched in the Afro-American Caribbean Day parade on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx. Sal F. Albanese, wearing a white shirt and necktie, shook hands at the Deepdale Pool Club in Little Neck, Queens. And the Rev. Al Sharpton told supporters in Harlem that the race was settling on the issues he had flagged from the start: police abuses and endemic unemployment. 
 All three candidates, talking to whatever constituents they could find on a crisp and sunny Saturday, continued to attack the Mayor over what prosecutors say was an attack on a Haitian immigrant, Abner Louima, by police officers at the 70th Precinct station house in Brooklyn.
"These people engaged in depraved behavior and they should be locked up," said Mr. Albanese, a City Councilman from Brooklyn. He blamed lax police hiring practices. "Too many cops wind up as ticking time bombs," he said.
Ms. Messinger called for tougher penalties for officers who give false testimony in investigations of wrongdoing. "It might have sent a message to officers in the Seven-Oh and other officers around the city who were beginning to think that you could get away with actions like this," Ms. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, said.
Mr. Sharpton, participating in a loud and festive rally at the offices of the National Action Network, a nonprofit political group he heads, referred repeatedly to the attack at the 70th Precinct. His focus reflects his calculation that the Louima case will produce a surge of interest in the primary among black voters, presumably to his benefit.
"Why did that policeman say that, 'It's Giuliani time?' " Mr. Sharpton said, recounting Mr. Louima's account of what an officer said during the attack.
Mr. Sharpton's question drew shouts from the crowd: "Talk about it! Talk about it!"
"He knows he's in trouble," Mr. Sharpton said of the Mayor. "He can run but he can't hide."
Both Mr. Sharpton and Ms. Messinger kept the focus on the Mayor. But Mr. Albanese, who has recently complained about difficulty in winning attention, turned his attention on Ms. Messinger. Mr. Albanese called a reporter yesterday morning to take issue with the way Ms. Messinger described her credentials in the Voter Guide issued by the Campaign Finance Board. In it, Ms. Messinger listed herself as a teacher, because, her aides later said, she taught for two years at the Children's Community Workshop School, an alternative school that operated from 1968 to 1974 and was founded by parents.
Mr. Albanese, who taught in New York public schools, said that that did not qualify her as a teacher. "Albanese charges she's distorting her own occupation!" Mr. Albanese said, referring to himself in the third person. "Are you going to call her on it? She's not a teacher."
Ms. Messinger's spokesman, Leland T. Jones, said: "It's a false charge. There is no fire. There is no smoke, except the smoke that Sal is blowing."
The primary is now just over two weeks away -- Sept. 9 -- though none of the candidates encountered overwhelming interest about the contest yesterday. And while Mr. Sharpton and Mr. Albanese bounced from event to event, Ms. Messinger, who is widely viewed as the front-runner, kept to a more leisurely schedule.
After attending the parade, she visited the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, at Albert Einstein Hospital, where he was recovering from minor surgery, before calling it a day. "I'm going to have my hair washed," she said.

HEADLINE: Don't Tinker Just When Health Care Is Working

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Workers Getting Greater Freedom in Health Plans" (front page, Aug. 17): Just a decade ago consumers were outraged as health care costs spiraled 12 percent per year. Today costs are stable and medical care inflation is below 5 percent. Still everyone is unhappy. What it boils down to is that people want more health care, but no one wants to pay for it. 
 Although health care in California is still more expensive than in any other state, the number of insured is twice the national average. And according to a study by Spectrum Economics, the savings attained by California's managed care revolution probably exceeds $4 billion per year.
With all of this success, California faces 11 pieces of legislation attempting to regulate managed care. They could increase health care costs up to $11 billion, and invite frivolous lawsuits.
Regulation of health care must be achieved through deliberation, not by a reactive, piecemeal approach. Gov. Pete Wilson of California realized this when he asked a task force to analyze the impact of managed care and make recommendations before he signed any reform bills.
Other states could learn a lesson from California: Figure out what is, and is not, working before trying to fix it.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Airline Clubs: Worth the Cost?

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
WHEN flights are delayed and the airport concourse looks like the subway at rush hour, children crawling among luggage and lines winding to pay phones, anxious travelers yearn for surcease. Alas, an airline club may not be the haven it is supposed to be.
An on-the-fly examination of airline clubs in the United States shows a consistent result: If flights are held up at a major hub, the clubs are only slightly better than the public waiting areas. It's hard to find a seat without asking someone to move a briefcase, the phones are busy, the receptionists have their hands full and the ambiance is harried. 
 When things are on schedule, people who travel a lot find much to use in an airline club. But even then comes the question of whether a club is worth $175 to $300 a year if it is not a business expense. As with a health club membership, the value derives from frequency of use. For example, for anyone who must frequently make a particular trip with a child, or regularly take a connecting flight, especially when the weather is uncertain, a club might be worthwhile.
Because I travel by myself a lot, I would want a club to help me cope. I want a place to set my bags aside while I use the phone, bathroom or perhaps modem. But I recently saw that not all clubs can do this because some are outside the airport's security barrier, or on "landside." When passengers leave the club to board a flight and are questioned about letting their luggage out of sight, no exception is made in security procedures.
This limitation became clear at La Guardia Airport in New York. Gary Lonieski, United Airlines' manager of special services, passing the luggage cubicles in the Red Carpet Club, pointed to signs that have for a year prohibited their use. I saw families watching television with their legs buried in luggage, just like nonclub users. And no one I talked to expects security at airports to be relaxed.
La Guardia's central terminal, undergoing revamping, has clubs on both sides of the security barrier. Three are landside: United's Red Carpet Club, Continental's Presidents Club and, now under renovation, Trans World Airlines' Ambassadors Club. American's Admirals Club is on the far side. Delta, Northwest and US Airways, with their own terminals at La Guardia, also have clubs beyond the barrier. There is no club for the Delta Shuttle.
How is the distribution elsewhere? Uncertain. As a sample, Bill Dreslin, a spokesman for American, said his experts did not know exactly how many of the Admirals Clubs were outside security barriers; he estimated 11 of a worldwide total of 46.
 
An Inspection Tour
To inspect clubs, I used a collection of one-visit courtesy passes I had requested. They bore my name but did not identify me as a reporter. I rather expected the haughty glances I receive when I stare enviously at the nice glasses in first class as I pass through on my way to plastic-cup land. But I got a friendly greeting from every airline's club, and the receptionists offered to check me in for my flight, print out boarding passes or make any reservation changes. To maintain calm, flights are not announced in the clubs, requiring passengers to stay alert. Some clubs have smoking areas, sometimes in the bar.
I got a real sense of a club's comfort last winter, when I flew Midway Airlines on a trip to Chapel Hill, N.C. Because American Airlines provides service for Midway at Raleigh-Durham Airport, the Admirals Club next to the gate accepted my one-shot cards. A colleague and I were able to put our bags aside, sample and select a wine and sit facing each other for almost an hour to discuss the meeting we'd just attended.
More airports are adding public alcoves with A.T.M. machines, fax machines, express-mail drop boxes and computers with credit-card access to E-mail or the Internet. La Guardia has just added two areas like this, with seats that can be moved, and usually are, according to Susan Baer, the airport manager.
As such facilities are expanded, the essence of a club seems less about doing business and more about privacy and quiet.
All the clubs except for T.W.A.'s have short-term passes, allowing a traveler to test them. These cost from $25 for one-day passes to US Airways' US Air Clubs and Delta's Crown Rooms to $50 for a one-day membership from United or American or a 60-day trial from Northwest's World Clubs. Some may be obtained on the spot.
In addition, American Express platinum card-holders are admitted to the clubs of Northwest and Delta and many clubs admit first-class and business-class passengers holding overseas tickets. Airlines with overseas partners have reciprocal arrangements with those lines' clubs.
 
What Membership Costs
The first year of a regular membership in American's clubs costs $300 or 50,000 frequent flier miles; for Continental, $200; Delta, $300 or 30,000 miles; Northwest, $270; T.W.A., $175 or 30,000 miles; United, $400 or 50,000 miles for nonpremier frequent flier members, and $275 or 40,000 for premier members; and $225 for US Airways. There are also spouse and domestic partner memberships at various prices; all seven airlines let a member take two guests into domestic clubs, and usually any number of members of the immediate family.
Drinks in public airport bars are not cheap, and Northwest's World Clubs and Delta's Crown Rooms still provide free drinks in the United States. American and United have free drinks in clubs overseas, and Continental provides free drinks in Honolulu, London and Guam; elsewhere, economy-class members pay.
Only Delta will not admit members without a Delta ticket for that day, for example, when they might be using another airline or are at the airport to meet a delayed flight.
Delta has clubs in 48 airports; American in 46; United in 43; Northwest in 26; T.W.A. in 23; US Airways in 21 and Continental in 14. But people shopping for clubs should focus on whether there is a club in the places they are most likely to be stuck. Boston, Chicago O'Hare, Honolulu, Los Angeles International, La Guardia, Newark and San Francisco have the most choices, with other domestic and Canadian airlines not mentioned here offering entree to other airlines' clubs.
A number of clubs are being renovated this summer, and members are being admitted to other airlines' clubs nearby. Delta has renovated and reopened one of its six clubs at Atlanta and is overhauling its others one by one. American has put in a children's play area in Miami, as well as two showers, and is enlarging its club at Terminal 3E in Dallas-Fort Worth, where a children's play room will be added, as well as two showers. Northwest has put a dressing room at its new Newark club and will add them at Seattle and Detroit.
Asked about showers, which seem like a splendid amenity, many airlines said they were available in first-class lounges, or in arrival areas overseas.
Despite expansions and renovations, an informal poll by Frequent Flyer magazine last fall showed that 63 percent of the respondents -- total not disclosed -- considered the clubs too crowded.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 14, 1997, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
The Practical Traveler column on Aug. 24, about airline clubs, listed one club erroneously among those that admit nonmembers holding American Express platinum cards, and omitted another that does. Delta does not admit nonmembers with such cards; Continental does.

Mir Bobbles Dim the Evil Empire's Aura

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
FOR months the Russian space station Mir has truly inhabited the twilight zone, performing what usually seems like slapstick comedy until it begins to verge on tragedy. Since a nearly fatal collision in June, when an overloaded supply ship was steered into the station's science module instead of into its docking port, every mishap up there has seemed like another episode of "Lost in Space."
And before the cosmonauts finally carried out their vital repair mission on Friday, there were a lot of episodes. The 11-year-old computer that runs the world's only manned space station, less powerful than some of the chips now found in cellular telephones, went out of service three times, once when a cosmonaut accidentally disconnected it. There were brownouts, blackouts, losses of oxygen and heat, and a problem with the water. The last commander became so stressed by it all that he developed heart problems. 
 So it is now clear that the prophecy delivered so trenchantly 10 years ago by John Le Carre in "The Russia House," his novel about the end of the great Soviet myth, turns out to be true. When his dissident scientist asserted that the "Soviet Knight is rusting in his armor" and that "our backwardness is our greatest military secret," Mr. Le Carre seems to have been writing history, not fiction.
So then why did the people of the United States spend most of the second half of the 20th century convinced that those technically superior Soviets were always three steps away from conquering the world?
Sure, Sputnik beat America into space, and so did Yuri Gagarin. But what of the space race now? The United States has a rover on Mars, while the impoverished Russian Space Agency has trouble getting replacement parts. Don't two generations of paranoia seem a little silly when Russian cosmonauts whip out compasses and navigate by the light of the stars, as if they were Magellan?
"Of course it was all madness," said Jonathan Sanders, who followed the Soviet Union at Columbia University's Harriman Institute for the Advanced Study of the Soviet Union and now covers Russia as a correspondent for CBS. "The whole policy of the United States was based on insecurity and fear and irrational thought. They called it national security policy. But to anyone who ever came here and looked at the place, it was obviously something else, it was really a national insecurity policy, and it guided American thinking for decades.
"The best thing we got out of it all was the Interstate highway system," Mr. Sanders said, only half in jest, recalling that President Eisenhower sold the enormously expensive public works project to the American people as a way to move military materiel, and the population, when the Russians started coming.
It is true that a visit to Moscow would have had to throw any cold warrior into denial. How could a country with (it always seemed) no working elevators, with long bread lines and with clothing that fell apart at the seams threaten the peace, security and supremacy of a nation that was richer than any other place had ever been?
 
Well, They Did Have the Bomb
From 1980 to 1986 alone, in the new tough era of facing down the "evil empire," the Pentagon's budget doubled, to $281.4 billion from $140.7 billion. After inflation, that still was a 50 percent increase, the biggest peacetime expansion of the military in the United States' history. Most of it was justified in terms of the possibility of war with the Soviet Union. And this was just when the Soviet military was beginning to fall apart.
Of course, the Soviets did have the bomb, and they still do. They said they spent 15 percent of their gross national product on defense (nearly twice America's highest level of spending), and they spent even more because thousands of factories that were not explicitly defense plants would have shut in an instant (and now have) without the backing of the Ministry of Defense.
"You can say we were hoodwinked by the cold war, but I don't think that is completely fair," said Marshall Shulman, who for four decades has been one of the most acute and active Sovietologists. "They focused on certain things like their missile system. They put all their money into what they could do. We couldn't have ignored that. It would have been foolish."
America's interest in the Russian space program, he said, was like "a boxer's clench," where they couldn't hurt us as long as we were engaged. And as to the harm they might do us if we weren't with them?
"That era is over," he said without a trace of regret. "I think we should just move beyond it."

Netscape goes back to the trenches as it revives the browser war.

BYLINE: By Steve Lohr 

 BODY:
REMEMBER the browser war? Well, it's back with a vengeance. And by officially reviving hostilities with Microsoft last week, Netscape Communications has displayed a hard-won understanding of the principles of technology marketing in the Internet era.
Rule 1: Market share is a company's most valuable asset. Spending to increase a software product's market share, or slow its erosion, is a prudent investment. 
 Rule 2: You make money mostly from selling Internet products to companies, but you make your name in the consumer market. Besides, the corporate and consumer markets will increasingly blur, so brand-name buzz counts a lot.
Specifically, Netscape announced that it would return to its roots by once again marketing its Navigator browsing program as a stand-alone product and begin a new assault on the home market, a campaign called "Netscape Everywhere."
The move is an abrupt change from last fall, when Netscape executives declared the browser war with Microsoft a thing of the past. The Mountain View, Calif., upstart said it had matured beyond that scrappy conflagration. Instead, the company explained it would focus on the lucrative corporate market and fold its browser into an industrial-strength product, Communicator, a bundle of E-mail and workgroup software.
At the time, Marc Andreessen, co-founder and senior vice president for technology at Netscape, said: "The big war in 1997 is going to be over groupware and E-mail. We're going to take those software markets and turn them upside down."
Yet in the market for groupware -- software that enables employees to work on documents together -- Netscape is facing established competitors, led by I.B.M.'s Lotus unit and Microsoft. So far, Netscape's inroads in that market have been only gradual.
And Netscape's decision last fall to bundle its browser into Communicator, which competes with the Lotus Notes offering, did not go down well with International Business Machines. To use Netscape's browser, Lotus in effect would find itself marketing a competitor's groupware product.
So in late July, I.B.M. made its point emphatically by announcing that it would include Microsoft's Explorer browser with Lotus Notes. The announcement, according to Clay Ryder, chief analyst of Zona Research, was "a strategic move on Lotus's part to put pressure on Netscape to unbundle Navigator."
Netscape did precisely that last week, and friendly relations between I.B.M. and Netscape have been restored. Lotus Notes users will now be able to use the Navigator browser without Netscape's groupware baggage.
"We want the browser, whether from Microsoft or Netscape, to act like the universal dial tone for Internet connectivity -- an open and standard technology," said Irving Wladawsky-Berger, general manager of I.B.M.'s Internet division. "We don't want the browser to be a Trojan horse for other people's proprietary technology and products."
The Netscape move to unbundle Navigator and accelerate its consumer marketing is also a response to Microsoft's gains in the browser market. In the 10 months ended in June, Microsoft's share of the browser market climbed to 32 percent, from 8 percent previously, according to Zona Research. Over that time, Netscape's share slipped to 64 percent from 83 percent.
At Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Wash., gaining share in the browser market has been a corporate imperative for two years. But Microsoft made little headway until last August, when it introduced version 3.0 of Internet Explorer, which analysts regarded as a strong rival, technologically, to Netscape's Navigator.
For Microsoft, the browser war is just beginning. To the company, the browser is a key desktop brand and a core technology, or platform, as is the personal computer operating system -- a market Microsoft dominates with its popular Windows program.
To gain market share, Microsoft gives its browser away. And a rising share, Microsoft figures, will translate into increased sales of lucrative offerings, like the server software that feeds data or documents to clusters of workers in corporations. "Browser market share is definitely important to us," observed Brad Chase, the vice president of Microsoft's Internet client group. "We're a platform company."
At Netscape, Jim Barksdale expresses some irritation at all the recent commentary about Microsoft's advance in the browser market. Mr. Barksdale, the Netscape chief executive, notes that his company still has a commanding share of the browser market, and it has no plans to watch that share erode sharply.
Perhaps, he said, with Netscape's focus on the corporate market last fall, the company emphasized the browser somewhat less. But no longer, he continued, adding that the browser is the brand that users see on the desktop. In deals with Internet service providers and telecommunications companies, from Bell Atlantic to Deutsche Telekom, 100 million copies of Netscape software will be distributed over the next year -- "carpet-bomb marketing a la America Online," Mr. Barksdale said.
"We're going to have at it," he said. "And we're going to keep a very nice share of the browser market."
Most analysts praised the new Netscape campaign as a needed return by the company to its origins as an aggressive marketer with a sure grasp of the economics of the Internet.
"This is a change in strategy that will help slow the decline in its market share," said David Smith, an analyst at the Gartner Group, a research firm. "They should have done it six months ago."

HEADLINE: For Hispanic Lawmakers, Time to Take the Offensive

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
At times lately, Hispanic legislators in Congress have felt like a ragtag group of volunteer firefighters confronting a scorched earth campaign against immigrants.
The early brush fires, the ones that took aim at illegal immigrants, seemed predictable and not much of a threat. But when Republicans took control of Congress in 1994, the G.O.P. leadership set its sights on taxpaying legal immigrants. Almost daily, Hispanic Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives confronted new legislation -- bills to ditch bilingual education or to kick green-card holding residents off welfare. There were efforts to keep would-be immigrants out of the country. 
 "Yes, we were constantly having to put out fires," said Representative Xavier Becerra, Democrat of California, who is chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. "And when you are constantly fighting fires, it's hard to develop a strategy of pre-emption on some of the major issues. You've got all of your fire engines out on the scene already."
That may be changing. While Hispanic lawmakers and advocacy groups have suffered a string of policy defeats, namely on welfare and immigration, they are convinced that the worst flare-ups are behind them.
One indication that attitudes might be shifting was a victory last month on the reinstatement of Supplemental Security Income benefits for some elderly and disabled legal immigrants, after a bitter and protracted battle that seemed lost early on.
In many ways, Hispanic House members, 20 in all, are at a pivotal juncture. The economy is on a rollicking roll, which has always helped dampen anti-immigrant fervor. The Republican Party, alerted to the burgeoning electoral clout of the Hispanic population -- now 10 percent of the population of the United States and expected to become the largest minority in the country by 2010 -- appears to have softened its stance on issues relating to immigrants.
And although most Hispanic lawmakers are, in the words of Mr. Becerra, "a minority within a minority" as Democrats in a Republican-controlled Congress, they are beginning to make small but important inroads in the political landscape.
More Hispanic Representatives now sit on major committees than ever before. Mr. Becerra sits on the Ways and Means Committee, which handles tax issues. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a Republican from Florida, is a member of the Rules Committee, which plays an important role in shaping or blocking legislation. And a handful of Hispanic Representatives sit on the Appropriations Committee.
But it took a maelstrom of adversity to galvanize Hispanic leaders, both in Congress and across the nation, to focus on the issues most important to them in a more aggressive and comprehensive way.
"The welfare reform bill that was signed into law a year ago last Friday was a rallying point" for the Hispanic community, said Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., Republican of Florida, who was instrumental in cutting off S.S.I. welfare benefits for legal immigrants, but later changed his position out of concern for the elderly. "It was something that brought them together."
Last year's Presidential election also proved to be a watershed. Hispanic immigrants, a group that typically stayed home on Election Day and tended to shrug off citizenship, recognized the power of their vote. Prodded by the Republican-led movement to deny immigrants benefits, millions became citizens and marched into the polls.
In doing so, they helped President Clinton capture Florida and Arizona, and they helped keep him on solid footing in California. Their presence at the polls also played a role in a major coup in conservative Orange County, Calif., where Loretta Sanchez, a Democratic political novice, defeated Robert K. Dornan, a nine-term Republican Congressman known for his diatribes against immigrants, in a race that is still being contested.
Hispanic influence at the ballot box accomplished several things: It provided a burst of much-needed confidence. It forced Republicans to reconsider their position on immigrants. It gave more weight to the voices of the three Hispanic Republicans in Congress. And it enabled Hispanic Democrats, especially Mr. Becerra, who became chairman of the caucus this year, to ratchet up their pressure on President Clinton.
"They are becoming much more vocal and much more effective, and they are exploring how they can get their positions across," said Georgina Verdugo, regional counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund. "In the White House, the Latino voting population in general is seen as much stronger. They can capitalize off that a bit more."
Since the election, Mr. Becerra and other Hispanic Democrats have tried to hold the President to his promises, particularly his pledge to undo the more punitive measures in the welfare bill and immigration bill, as well as his 1992 commitment to establish a more diverse Administration. The departure of Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros in this term leaves Federico F. Pena, the Energy Secretary, as the only Hispanic member of the Cabinet.
But it was this year's battle over benefits for disabled and elderly immigrants that best illustrated how Hispanic members of Congress can effect change when they coalesce around one issue.
In December, it seemed to some members that reclaiming any of the benefits wiped out by last year's welfare reform law would be next to impossible. Republicans were arguing that the law should be given a chance to work before any tinkering went on. And Democrats, while earmarking at least some money, did not initially press the issue.
Sensing the urgency, some members of the Hispanic caucus seized on the 1996 election results as leverage and began a series of high-level meetings with the White House. They knew the President had to push for the restoration of benefits as part of the balanced budget deal or the battle would fizzle.
"The President pledged to do this in August, and we were there in November supporting this President," Mr. Becerra said. "We expected that something would be done."
As part of their strategy, they enlisted 77 members of Congress for a protest vote of "present" on a piece of legislation and worked closely with advocacy groups.
The two Florida Republicans, Representatives Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, orchestrated their own crusade and met repeatedly with several party leaders. Other allies also stepped up the pressure, including several influential Republican Governors and Senators.
In the end, $11.4 billion was included in the budget deal to restore benefits, more than expected but half of what was originally cut. "I think it showed with this welfare battle that we were victorious," Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said.
Yet, much of the criticism aimed at the caucus in the past -- that the members cannot work effectively as a group on most issues -- remains unchanged. Hispanic members of Congress are a mixed bag: Republicans and Democrats, urban and rural, Puerto Rican, Mexican-American and Cuban-American. The diversity is viewed as an asset, but still drives a wedge among them.
As chairman of the caucus, Mr. Becerra, 39, has touted one goal -- unity. "The base line consideration for me is to have a cohesive working group," he said in an interview last week.
But Mr. Becerra has been privately and roundly criticized for driving away the only two dues-paying Republicans in the caucus, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and Mr. Diaz-Balart, Cuban-Americans who are steadfast in their enmity toward Fidel Castro.
The two members expressed dissatisfaction with a working trip Mr. Becerra, who is Mexican-American, and his family took to Cuba while he was campaigning for chairman of the caucus in December, and with his failure to call for free elections in Cuba when he returned.
Mr. Becerra defended the trip, saying he had traveled to Cuba as a member of Congress, not as caucus chairman. He also said that other caucus chairmen and members who had visited Cuba and openly expressed support for Mr. Castro had not faced such vehement criticism from Ms. Ros-Lehtinen or Mr. Diaz-Balart. The caucus does not take a position on Cuba policy because there is no consensus.
Hispanic advocacy groups have widely bemoaned the February departure of the two Republicans, who are considered invaluable while Republicans control Congress. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and Mr. Diaz-Balart, who did not sign the party's Contract With America because of its harsh posture toward immigrants, still lobby on behalf of immigrants, but they do so apart from the caucus.
"The Republican leadership certainly listens to Lincoln and Ileana," Mr. Shaw said. "Any time you make one of these caucuses a one-party caucus, you are just telling them to go sing to the choir."
Raul Yzaguirre, the executive director of National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group, agrees that the departure of the two is a setback, but one he hopes is only temporary. "There is no question about it," he said. "It is a loss. It is not an irreparable loss."
Mr. Yzaguirre is optimistic that the lessons learned from the internal turmoil of the caucus and the welfare bill will help in upcoming battles.
The caucus is already gearing up for what it predicts will be the next heated controversy in Congress, the debate over how to conduct the census. "We've decided to pre-empt the fires to the degree we can," Mr. Becerra said.
More important, Mr. Yzaguirre said, the political powerhouses are now paying attention. At La Raza's convention earlier this year, Vice President Al Gore and Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, who is a possible Presidential rival of Mr. Gore, both made appearances, even though the race is three years away.
"We have every reason to believe, and there are an awful lot of examples that both Gore and Gephardt, and whatever their counterparts may be in the Republican Party, are taking the Hispanic vote very seriously, very early on," Mr. Yzaguirre said.

HEADLINE: Sign a Lease, Pay the Rent, Then There's No Apartment

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Naval Bandari had scoured Manhattan for weeks before coming across the beautiful apartment on Thompson Street in Greenwich Village that would provide him with a brief and expensive look at the seamy side of the real-estate boom that has driven rents skyward.
The bearded, blond-haired man who showed him the airy one-bedroom triplex earlier this year offered to rent it for only $1,500 a month -- a bargain in anybody's real estate book. Mr. Bandari put down $3,000 cash and signed a one-year lease. It was the last time he saw the money or the apartment. 
 "It was a gorgeous apartment and the deal was too good to be true," Mr. Bandari said. "I should have realized that. I get married in two weeks and I still don't have an apartment."
The number of accounts like Mr. Bandari's is growing, stories of swindles by con artists, hustlers and unscrupulous real estate agents who prey on people only too willing to turn over thousands of dollars in commissions, deposits and rents.
The schemes are driven by a hot market in which affordable apartments are so scarce that potential tenants feel they must bend over backward to secure a promising rental.
In Mr. Bandari's case, prosecutors say he was one of 18 people swindled out of more than $50,000 in January and February by a man pretending to rent the triplex at 211 Thompson Street.
Neither the Department of State, which licenses real estate brokers and information vendors who sell lists of apartments, nor the State Attorney General tracks the rise and fall of complaints alleging rental frauds. But tenants and reputable brokers say that the number of swindles is on the rise.
"When a market is as hot as the rental market is now, it attracts a lot of unsavory types," said Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, a large rental broker in Manhattan. "And tenants, because of their anxieties, become less cautious than they ought to be."
And Andrew S. Heiberger, who started the Citi Habitats real estate agency to cater to twenty-something professionals like himself, said part of the problem is that pushiness doesn't necessarily define a scoundrel; that's a quality good brokers share. "The common trait is aggressiveness." he said. "That's inherent in the job. But at the same time, you can't let down your guard. This is New York City. You can't assume you're dealing with someone who is straight up."
After falling modestly during the recession in 1992 and 1993, rents for apartments in New York City, especially in Manhattan, have risen steadily for the last three years. And with relatively few apartment houses built in the 1990's, the market is very tight. The average rent for a studio in a non-doorman building on the Upper East Side or the Upper West Side jumped almost 23 percent between 1994 and June, 1997, according to Feathered Nest. In the last six months alone, rents for one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments in non-doorman buildings climbed about 15 percent.
All this makes it much harder to find an affordable apartment for New Yorkers and newcomers, like the thousands of college graduates who pour into the city every year headed for Wall Street, publishing houses and law and accounting firms. Real-estate brokers and con artists alike are well aware of just how desperate people are to find a new home.
"The anxiety levels for apartment seekers are high because demand is so many times greater than the supply and the average person loses at least one apartment before finding one," Mr. Heiberger, the Citi Habitats owner, said. "This is where they're going to live, the single most important decision they're going to make during the entire year. And these crooks prey on them."
Mr. Heiberger and other brokers recommend that renters refuse to meet agents on the street, not hand over money anywhere but in an office, and ask for a Department of State identification card and a photo ID. They also suggest that renters try to give rent or security deposits directly to the landlord. Be wary of agents who can be reached only on voice mail or beepers, they say.
The prospective renters of the apartment at 211 Thompson Street certainly lost thousands of dollars. The Manhattan District Attorney has charged Michael Ross, 28, in a criminal court complaint of grand larceny and scheming to defraud more than 10 people.
Mr. Ross, who disappeared after his arraignment, allegedly rented the apartment in January and then placed ads offering the triplex for rent in The Village Voice and elsewhere. About 18 people toured the apartment, signed a lease for $1,300 to $1,500 a month and immediately turned over up to $3,900 each, mostly in cash, prosecutors said. "The idea you could get a duplex on Thompson Street for $1,300 was very enticing," Daniel Castleman, chief of investigation for the Manhattan District Attorney, said. "Ross gave every indication he was the landlord. He was preying on people in a very vulnerable situation."
Dishonest brokers and con men are wreaking havoc on the lives of some renters.
Typical of the college graduates who scour the market every summer only weeks before starting a new job, Harrison Mullin and two friends went to the office of Gotham City Realtors on Park Avenue South a year ago with little time to spare.
After showing the three men a large three-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side for less than $2,000 a month, a Gotham agent urged them to put down a $300 deposit immediately lest they lose it to another renter. Mr. Mullin did. Four days later he wired more than $7,000 in commissions and fees to Gotham's bank account, expecting to move in on July 3.
A short time later, the Gotham agent told Mr. Mullin that the apartment was no longer available and ultimately refused to return his money. Outraged, Mr. Mullin said he confronted the owner of Gotham, Joseph Rofe, who eventually gave him a check for $1,500 and then refused to return the rest of his money. Mr. Mullin obtained a court judgment against Gotham but Mr. Rofe still refused to return the money.
Finally, the Department of State moved against Mr. Rofe, who had accumulated a long series of complaints dating back to 1990, typically alleging that Gotham City had refused to return a $300 deposit from clients after failing to deliver a promised apartment.
"We saw a pattern of Gotham collecting a $300 commission up front and refusing to return it after no deal took place," said Laurence Soronen, litigation counsel for the Department of State. "People went to court and they still refused to return the money. There was a continuing scheme and the complaints were coming in hot and heavy."
In March, Mr. Rofe pleaded no contest before an administrative judge to charges ranging from fraud, improperly retaining deposits and unlawful business practices. He was stripped of his real-estate license, fined $3,500 and ordered to make restitution of $13,684 to seven people, including $6,342 to Mr. Mullin. A former colleague of Mr. Rofe, Robert Bielsky of Peninsula Properties Inc., pleaded no contest to similar complaints. His license was suspended and he was fined $2,500 and ordered to make $3,398 in restitution.
Mr. Mullin finally received his money in June, but he is bitter about the experience. "I'm still out $2,500 to lawyers," Mr. Mullin, now 23, said. "You know this is a booming city for young people. You've got all these kids coming in who aren't ready to be taken advantage of."
The New York Department of State and the State Attorney General are now hunting for a certain unlicensed apartment information vendor who sells lists of supposedly available apartments for $150 through ads in The Village Voice, The New York Times and the World Wide Web. But according to investigators, the lists are worthless; the apartments are either not for rent or gleaned from other newspaper ads. More than two dozen people filed complaints alleging that they were unable to get their money back.
So far, the vendor has stayed one step ahead of the authorities by conducting business under a variety of corporate names and by changing addresses, which has been done at least 10 times, officials said.
"These type of operators are like a jack-in-the-box on wheels, folding and popping up under a new name," Joseph Mahoney, a spokesman for the Attorney General, said. "We have a lot of interest in pursuing this type of scam because they are bleeding unsuspecting renters. The problem seems to be making a bit of a resurgence."

HEADLINE: China Faults U.S. Official Over Tibet Trip

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 24

 BODY:
With Tibet emerging as a potentially serious obstacle in United States-China relations, Beijing issued a tartly worded attack today on a Congressman who recently traveled to Tibet and accused the Chinese authorities of strangling traditional culture in the Himalayan region.
In a long statement from the New China News Agency, a senior official from Tibet accused the Congressman, Representative Frank R. Wolf, Republican of Virginia, of deliberately trying to stir up trouble and lie about true conditions in Tibet. 
 "All people with a sense of justice, including the Tibetan people, are enraged by his actions," said the official, Raidi, who heads the local legislature in Tibet and uses one name.
Mr. Wolf, who traveled to Tibet from Aug. 9 to 13 as a tourist without telling the authorities he was a Congressman, told reporters in Washington last week that he saw evidence of religious persecution and the obliteration of Tibetan culture and language by an influx of Chinese traders and merchants.
In response to those assertions, Mr. Raidi listed a series of statistics to show that Tibet's economy, agricultural output and foreign trade were all growing fast, and he insisted that 46,000 monks and nuns can worship freely.
But he defended the Government's tight control of unauthorized religious activities, which Chinese leaders often suspect of advocating independence for Tibet.
"The reason to crack down on activities by separatists who are acting under cover of religion is to protect the majority of the religious believers and insure that the religious activities are carried out in line with the doctrines," Mr. Raidi said.
"In line with the doctrines," as Mr. Raidi did not have to elaborate, means religious worship that submits to the authority of Communist Party officials, who generally ban any organized activity they themselves do not control.
Today's outburst came as Washington and Beijing prepare for a summit meeting in late October, when President Jiang Zemin travels to the United States to meet President Clinton, and each side is eager to bridge disagreements over human rights and nuclear nonproliferation.
However, concern over conditions in Tibet has been growing in Congress. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright recently agreed to name a special coordinator within the State Department to monitor conditions there and to urge China to negotiate with the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for peacefully campaigning for greater autonomy in his homeland.
Mr. Raidi, reflecting Beijing's frustration at being unable to limit the moral authority of the Dalai Lama, denounced the religious leader as a tool of imperialist forces trying to undermine China.
"He never concerned himself with the real life of the Tibetan people, and did nothing beneficial for Tibet," Mr. Raidi was quoted as saying. "The Tibetan people, thus far, are aware of his separatist theory and have long abandoned him."
Over the weekend, the New China News Agency also issued a series of statements quoting scholars who defended China's right to rule Tibet.
One argued that Tibetan culture can coexist alongside Chinese culture just as Eskimo culture can in Alaska, which like Tibet is a spacious and remote area where the culture of a minority population lives under a higher sovereign.
Mr. Wolf, a champion of religious freedom, said he had urged the Clinton Administration to press Mr. Jiang for the release of what human rights organizations estimate to be 700 prisoners of conscience in Tibet. He also argued that urgent action was needed to save Tibetan culture from being overwhelmed by Chinese settlers, who he said outnumbered ethnic Tibetans in Lhasa, Tibet's capital, by about 160,000 to 100,000.
Mr. Raidi, in response, argued that Chinese residents account for less than 3 percent of the official population in all of Tibet. He did not offer statistics for Lhasa, and it is possible that many Chinese businessmen are counted as temporary residents and do not appear in official tallies, the same as thousands of military personnel stationed there.
In his defense of Chinese rule, Mr. Raidi argued that Tibet had carried out democratic reforms beginning in 1959, the year the Dalai Lama escaped to exile in India after an uprising that might have led to his arrest.
Yet in the 1960's and 1970's, even official Chinese accounts concede, zealous Chinese officials and rogue factions of Red Guards destroyed thousands of temples, banned virtually all religious worship and imprisoned untold thousands of monks and nuns.
At the time, the Government insisted that Tibet was a happy place of progress, much as Mr. Raidi's statement today did. Today's statement was also notable for its strong nationalist tone.
"Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, Tibet experienced the most profound changes in its history during the last 40 years, particularly after the democratic reform," Mr. Raidi was quoted as saying.

HEADLINE: Yearlong Effort Key to Success For Teamsters

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Early on a brisk March morning, 150 brown-suited drivers and loaders huddled outside the United Parcel Service terminal just off Interstate 80 in New Jersey, chanting: "It's our contract. We'll fight for it."
Though it was four months before their contract expired, four months before a strike deadline, these workers in Saddle Brook, like those at rallies in 30 other cities around the country that morning, were already gung-ho volunteers in the teamsters' efforts to mobilize members to stand up to U.P.S. -- and to stand firm in a strike, if it came to that. 
 The rallies received scant attention, but they turned out to be part of an unusual -- and unusually sophisticated -- mobilization effort that was pivotal in the teamsters' winning most of what they sought in their 15-day strike against U.P.S. It was labor's biggest victory in years, and it came in the nation's biggest strike in more than a decade.
The teamsters' yearlong mobilization included scores of rallies at U.P.S. sites as well as other major efforts, like sending questionnaires to 185,000 teamsters asking what they wanted from the U.P.S. negotiations and collecting 100,000 signatures backing the union's demands. But the union did not neglect minor details: at one point, it distributed 50,000 whistles for use at the rallies.
By the time the July 31 strike deadline approached, the teamsters had turned their U.P.S. membership into a Juggernaut that the company's executives underestimated. In dozens of interviews with U.P.S., union and Federal officials, the union's mobilization and the company's misreading of it emerge as the keys to the teamsters' victory.
U.P.S. executives acknowledged major miscalculations: they did not think there would be a walkout, and they thought the workers were too divided to sustain a strike. One U.P.S. official acknowledged that the company thought it could win the showdown by getting tens of thousands of teamsters to cross the picket lines.
But those hopes were dashed by the union's efforts. Explaining the mobilization strategy, Ron Carey, the teamsters' president, said: "First, you have to get organized. You have to have something that brings you together. When you are organized, you then create the leverage you need. You've got to get involved."
Company officials asserted that the teamsters' plans demonstrated that Mr. Carey was always intent on calling a strike, rather than settling, to bolster himself politically. They say he wanted to rally his members behind him because he knew a Federal official might order a rerun of the vote in which he was re-elected as teamsters' president last year. In an interview on Friday, the day the Federal election overseer did overturn his victory because of illegal contributions, Mr. Carey denied that he had ordered the strike for personal political reasons. "That's all bull being spun out by the company," he said.
 
Months of Mobilizing
At the teamsters' convention in Philadelphia 13 months ago, the heavyweight event was the face-off between Mr. Carey's forces and those of his election opponent, James P. Hoffa. Tucked in a booth belonging to the union's Parcel & Small Package Division, Rand Wilson was preoccupied with another, distant battle.
He was buttonholing dozens of U.P.S. shop stewards and stuffing their pockets with a booklet called "Countdown to the Contract." It contained a month-by-month calendar until the July 31 strike deadline and gave myriad tips on how to escalate pressure on the company and build a communications network to keep workers informed and involved.
Ten months ago, Mr. Wilson worked with Mr. Carey and Ken Hall, director of the teamsters' parcel division, to draft the survey that asked U.P.S. workers what priority should be placed on creating more full-time jobs and what was more important, wage increases or improved pensions.
The survey found that 90 percent of the part-time workers said creating more full-time jobs was very important. That became a bargaining priority because three-fifths of U.P.S. workers are part-timers.
On March 7, four days before the company and union began negotiating, the teamsters flew two representatives from each of the 206 U.P.S. locals to Chicago for a rally. Soon after, rallies began around the nation, organized in part by 18 full-time field representatives. On March 10 rallies were held at 10 U.P.S. sites, and on March 25, at 30 sites. There were even more in April, May and June.
All shop stewards received a seven-minute video about the U.P.S. negotiations. The union also gave out tens of thousands of "It's Our Contract. We'll Fight For It" stickers for workers to wear.
In mid-July, with the negotiations going nowhere, U.P.S. workers voted 95 percent to 5 percent to authorize a strike.
Mr. Wilson, who coordinated the mobilization, said after the strike ended that the effort had several purposes. "We believe that the best way to avoid a strike is to show the unity of members," he said. "By signaling the seriousness of members, we hope the company will be more serious about negotiating. In the event of a strike, the advantage is people are well-informed and prepared to do what is necessary to win."
 
The Teamsters Walk
As so often happens in bargaining, U.P.S. and the teamsters faulted each other for making little progress between March 11, when negotiations began in Washington, and the July 31 deadline.
The early strategy, both sides say, was to take the three dozen outstanding issues and have them whittled to three or four shortly before the deadline. Then the tightly wound Mr. Carey and the company's courtly chairman, James P. Kelly, would thrash out the final issues and proclaim a settlement.
But shortly before the deadline, a raft of differences remained over pay, subcontracting, safety and other issues. The two sides grappled over the company's demand to create a U.P.S.-only pension plan, a move the union feared would endanger its multi-employer plans. The company balked at the teamsters' demand to make 10,000 part-time jobs full-time.
When the talks deadlocked early on Thursday, July 31, the two sides telephoned John Calhoun Wells, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, who was working in the Midwest. He jumped on a plane for Washington.
"I received a call that it looked like a train wreck was possible," Mr. Wells said in an interview.
At 6 P.M. he met with the teamsters' 50-person bargaining team and 20 U.P.S. representatives, but then he invited the chief negotiators to meet with him in his office. Making little progress, he asked the union to extend its midnight strike deadline, and Mr. Carey obliged.
On July 30, the company had presented what it called its "final offer," but the union rejected it. On Aug. 2, the teamsters presented a new proposal, but U.P.S. rebuffed it.
The talks resumed in Mr. Wells' office at 6 P.M. on Sunday, Aug. 3. In interviews, several company officials said U.P.S. executives indicated in that session that they might move well beyond their "final" offer. Mr. Kelly said he had expected teamster leaders to begin serious give-and-that at that meeting.
But after four hours, Mr. Carey walked out and announced the strike for 12:01 A.M. on Monday, Aug. 4.
Describing the Sunday talks, Mr. Sternad, the U.P.S. spokesman, said, "We made offers on a contract that looked remarkably similar to the one that teamsters ultimately accepted." He said that U.P.S. even suggested it would withdraw its pension demand.
"It didn't become apparent till very late in the game that a strike was planned, that it was going to happen regardless," he said. "It was indeed premeditated."
Mr. Carey strongly denies that account, insisting that the company offered nothing firm beyond its July 30 offer and nothing close to what the union ultimately accepted. He also denied that U.P.S. had signaled it would withdraw its pension demand.
"If anyone should be accused of forcing a strike, it's U.P.S," he said. "When we were faced with fish or cut bait, which was Thursday night, I agreed to go further. We went the extra mile."
 
A Public War
Strikes, like wars, are fought on many levels: sustaining the fighters' morale, propagandizing to court public opinion, working nonstop on logistics and probing one's opponent for weaknesses.
To keep its members informed, the union updated its World Wide Web site every few hours, faxed bulletins to teamster locals and set up a toll-free hot line for strikers. The teamsters strained to make sure that full-timers and part-timers backed the walkout, and each other. The union convinced many full-timers that U.P.S.'s pension proposal would endanger their pensions, a contention the company ridiculed. The union also repeatedly told full-timers that the surge in part-timers endangered their own job security. For their part, the part-timers backed the full-timers' demands because many hoped to become full-time one day.
Every chance Mr. Carey got, he hammered the part-time issue, knowing that it resonated with a public upset with stagnant wages and corporate downsizing. "America wants to move people from welfare to work," he said, "but with these low-wage part time jobs, U.P.S. is doing just the opposite."
Teamster leaders knew that public support was crucial to buoy the strikers' morale and to pressure U.P.S. The strikers gave out pro-teamster score cards at baseball games and visited U.P.S. customers to explain the strike.
At company headquarters in Atlanta, U.P.S.'s generals had several strategies of their own. To neutralize the teamsters' public relations, the company staged its own blitz, which included advertisements in more than a dozen newspapers, defending the company's pension proposals and the quality of its part-time jobs.
Company officials acknowledge that they thought they could win the strike by pressuring Mr. Carey to let the rank and file vote on the company's "final" offer -- a vote the company was confident it would win. In advertisements, television appearances and letters to its workers and to Congress, U.P.S. called Mr. Carey undemocratic for blocking a vote.
In another strategy, the company pressed President Clinton to seek an injunction under the Taft-Hartley Act to stop the strike. U.P.S. asked its many customers who were being hurt by the strike to flood the White House with letters, going so far as to provide them with sample letters.
In the strike's first week, there was far more activity away from the bargaining table than at it. Mr. Wells persuaded the two sides to resume talks on Aug. 7. The talks meandered for two days, and finally Mr. Kelly walked out on Saturday, Aug. 9.
"The position of the teamsters continues to be unrealistic," he said. "Their position does not allow us to compete."
The two sides began bracing for a long strike.
 
The Endgame
That Saturday afternoon, Mr. Wells and Labor Secretary Alexis Herman met at the White House with John Podesta, the President's deputy chief of staff. Fearing that the strike would hurt the economy, the Administration decided to upgrade its role and move Ms. Herman to center stage. On Monday, she met separately with Mr. Carey and David Murray, the company's chief negotiator.
Back in Atlanta, U.P.S. officials saw that things were not going their way. President Clinton indicated he would not invoke Taft-Hartley. Mr. Carey refused to allow a vote on the company's prestrike offer, even though several hundred workers held rallies calling for one. The company was getting clobbered in public opinion polls, strikers' morale remained strong and other unions pledged millions of dollars to pay for strike benefits. And only a few thousand strikers crossed the picket line.
"The company thought the full-timers and part-timers wouldn't stick together and a lot of people would start crossing the picket line," said Wayne Fernicola, secretary-treasurer of a New Jersey local. "That really took the steam out of their sails."
After talking repeatedly with Ms. Herman and Mr. Wells on Tuesday and Wednesday, the two sides resumed negotiations on Thursday in the Grand Canyon room at the Hyatt-Regency hotel. They talked from 9 A.M. Thursday to 3 A.M. Friday, and then from 8 A.M. Friday until 5:30 A.M. Saturday. Talks resumed at 8 A.M. Saturday and went until 2:30 Sunday morning.
Mr. Wells said he told the bargainers on Friday: "Do you both want to have a fight to the death? You can demonstrate to the world that you're sufficiently powerful that you can destroy each other.
"I talked about two scorpions in a bottle."
According to Mr. Wells, the negotiators' positions began to thaw on Saturday.
Mr. Hall, the union's chief negotiator, said a breakthrough came on Sunday when the company suggested it might withdraw its pension demand. Urged by his advisers to help seal a deal, Mr. Clinton weighed in on Sunday, telling the negotiators to redouble their efforts.
Early on Monday afternoon, the negotiators said, the overall package emerged as they began wholesale swapping of demands. The company abandoned its pension proposal and accepted the union's demand to make 10,000 part-time jobs full-time, but in five years, not in four as the teamsters had demanded. The union's main concession was to accept a five-year agreement, instead of a four-year accord.
Trumpeting the agreement as a watershed victory for American labor, Mr. Carey said, "In virtually every area, this agreement is much, much better than the last offer before the strike."
Though U.P.S. officials said they had a multibillion-dollar war chest to withstand a strike, they said they made major concessions because they feared a prolonged walkout would cause them to lose permanent market share to lower-wage, nonunion competitors. Company officials acknowledged that unless they waited months, they were not going to get a Taft-Hartley injunction.
"There was no strategy to outlast the teamsters," said Mr. Sternad, the U.P.S. spokesman. "The strategy was to get back to work. It was devastating our business and our customers."

HEADLINE: As U.S. Urges Delicacy on Swiss Gold, New York City Hints at a Bold Stroke

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 22

 BODY:
As it tries to persuade Switzerland to pay greater restitution to victims of the Holocaust, the United States has been engaged in a delicate dance with the increasingly testy Swiss public. But now New York, taking a far more confrontational approach with Swiss companies, may be about to upset that effort.
Ever since May, when the United States issued a report harshly critical of how Swiss banks aided the Nazis and impeded the efforts of Holocaust survivors to recover their family fortunes, the Clinton Administration has sought to calm the ensuing political storm. It has repeatedly praised the Swiss for confronting the past, and steered clear of any hints that it might consider sanctions against the banks. 
 Now New York's Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, whose family included Holocaust victims, is starting to drop those hints.
Mr. Hevesi has been dogging Swiss companies for months now, noting that New York's pension funds are big investors in Swiss companies and asking for details about how much the companies have contributed to a special fund set up to aid aging Holocaust survivors. Most of the companies have said they are contributing -- but have decided to keep the amount secret.
In an interview, Mr. Hevesi declared that he was "deeply disappointed" with the actions of Switzerland's largest private bank, the Union Bank of Switzerland, which still declines to disclose details about Holocaust-era documents it was caught destroying in January.
Mr. Hevesi, who is running for re-election in November, said he had asked his staff to "begin an internal review of the city's options" in dealing with Union Bank, which earned fees in excess of $1.25 million last year for performing a variety of banking services for the city. Through a New York spokesman, the bank said on Friday that it was "surprised by Mr. Hevesi's comments" and that it had been "responsive to all his requests."
Mr. Hevesi stopped short of actually threatening to cut off business with the bank, and even if the city did that, the economic impact would be minimal. But Clinton Administration officials say they are worried that his actions, along with a newsletter titled "Swiss Monitor" that Mr. Hevesi has begun circulating to financial officers of other states and cities, could hamper delicate, behind-the-scenes negotiations with the Swiss.
Stuart E. Eizenstat, the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, said in an interview broadcast on Swiss television on Friday that the Clinton Administration "feels very strongly that any sanctions at any level -- Federal, state or local -- are counterproductive."
Mr. Eizenstat has spent much of the last three months trying to manage the backlash in Switzerland over the publication of the historical report. .
The report concluded that Switzerland's banks tilted the country's traditional neutrality toward Nazi Germany, hiding gold and other assets the Nazis looted throughout Europe, even long after Germany's surrender. It determined that Swiss banks knowingly violated a 1946 accord to turn over half of those assets to the Allies for the resettlement of refugees.
The report also concluded that the banks had systematically hampered efforts by Holocaust survivors and their heirs to recover assets placed in Switzerland for safekeeping. Last month, more than a half century after the war's end, the banks reluctantly published a list of long-dormant accounts that were opened by non-Swiss citizens before Germany's surrender in 1945.
Even before the report was published, three major Swiss banks all said they would contribute to a Special Fund for Needy Victims of the Holocaust, and other Swiss firms have made donations. The Swiss central bank also promised a significant donation, but the required parliamentary approval has been delayed until at least the fall. A much larger humanitarian fund proposed by the Swiss Government, not primarily intended for victims of the Nazis, must be approved in a national referendum that the Government has yet to schedule. Polls show that it may be defeated.
Washington's diplomatic strategy in dealing with Switzerland on all these issues has been to accentuate the positive. It has never publicly discussed, for example, forcing Switzerland to live up to the 1946 accord, which would require the banks to disgorge billions of dollars in profits they made trafficking in gold and other assets that the Nazis looted in Europe.
"My feeling is that sanctions are neither justified by the objective steps that Switzerland has taken," Mr. Eizenstat said in the interview, "nor are they productive when the Swiss Parliament has yet to approve its own contributions to the special fund."
Noting that "Swiss public opinion is very fragile at this time," he cautioned that even the hint of imposing penalties on Swiss firms "creates an atmosphere of Swiss-bashing that is not justified."
New York's approach, however, seems less interested in diplomatic niceties than in concrete answers.
Last month Mr. Hevesi wrote to the chief executives of Swiss companies in which New York's $70 billion pension funds have invested. "We have found that a company's public image is one of its most valuable assets," he wrote in the letters. "Similarly we have found that contingent liabilities -- such as potential boycotts or even the expense of lobbying against such boycotts -- are often undervalued. As investors in many Swiss companies, we do not want to see their values diminished."
He asked the firms to let him know if they were contributing to the Holocaust funds, and if so, how much. At the same time he began publishing the newsletter to keep financial officers up to date on the actions of Swiss firms. "We must seek to make restitution to the survivors and victims' heirs who are the rightful owners of assets held by Swiss banks since before World War II," Mr. Hevesi wrote in the first issue of his newsletter.
So far a dozen firms have confirmed that they are making contributions, but only one has disclosed how much. "As to your question with respect to the size of our contribution," wrote Fritz Gerber, the chairman and chief executive of Roche, one of Switzerland's larger companies, "I hope you can understand that we have agreed not to disclose individual figures in order to avoid internal discussions." Another executive wrote of "an agreement between the participating companies not to publish the amount of the individual donations."
In Switzerland, some executives and politicians have already said that they feel as if they are being shaken down for contributions. More than a few, including a former President of Switzerland, have said they suspect the United States is engaged in a conspiracy to undercut Switzerland's role as a world financial center -- and thus a competitor to New York.
So far the Swiss institution that has plunged itself deepest into the controversy is the Union Bank of Switzerland. After a guard at the bank, Christoph Meili, discovered carts full of old ledgers awaiting shredding and slipped some of the information to a Swiss Jewish group, he was dismissed. He has since moved his family to the United States, where Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican, pressed Congress to grant them permanent residency. Last month President Clinton signed a bill that does so.
The bank remains unapologetic about Mr. Meili's treatment, however, even after it admitted that some of the documents dealt with the forced sale of German properties belonging to Jews before the war.
It has also said little in public about comments by Robert Holzach, its honorary president, who told the New Yorker this spring that Jews are excluded from top posts in most Swiss banks and that he suspected a Jewish conspiracy lay behind the recent disclosures about the banks.

HEADLINE: Face Time for Federal Express

 BODY:
When a big corporate political donor is invited to press his company's case at the White House before the President, he is probably going to expect results. But the attempt by Federal Express to buy influence with the Clinton Administration over an economic dispute with Japan, which was disclosed last week, has not helped anyone.
Instead of advancing his company's interests, Frederick Smith, the Federal Express chairman, has probably set them back. Thanks to the now well-documented tendency in this White House to mix policy-making with insatiable political fund-raising, a sensible objective for the United States has been tainted and the 1996 Democratic fund-raising effort has been revealed once again as structurally corrupt. 
 President Clinton says he is proud of the fund-raising he and his party carried out in recent years, and that there were no direct quid pro quos for donors. But the episode involving Federal Express, first reported in The Washington Post, provides a case study in why the system he embraces not only has polluted American politics but has actually damaged American interests abroad.
At issue is a long-running demand by Federal Express to fly cargo through Japan to its new hub at Subic Bay, the former American naval base in the Philippines. A 45-year-old aviation agreement between the United States and Japan clearly requires Tokyo to grant access to Federal Express, as this page argued two years ago. Both the Bush and Clinton Administrations have supported the company's cause, but Federal Express wanted sterner action. Mr. Smith used his meeting with Mr. Clinton to press for sanctions against Japan. Federal Express also ponied up $506,000 in campaign contributions to the Democrats last year, along with $540,000 to the Republicans.
Federal Express has been a major success story in the competitive global economy, and is worthy of American support. Its gamble in setting up a hub at Subic Bay has revitalized the area around the old naval base. It makes sense in the new age of commercial diplomacy for the United States to help American companies in their attempts to win contracts and market access. But such an approach is simply undercut in the eyes of the world when it looks like nothing more than a payoff for a large political donation.
In addition, the United States needs to be sensitive to the risks of favoring one company's interests over another's, however plausible that company's case. The appearance of evenhandedness was undermined by Mr. Clinton's ill-advised meeting with Mr. Smith. Until now, the United States has refrained from the tougher approach of the sanctions demanded by Federal Express. Though sanctions might well be justified and certainly would be legal, there was good reason to hesitate. Sanctions could well invite Japanese retaliation, which, in turn, would almost certainly damage other American companies doing business in Japan. In negotiating with Tokyo, the United States has to weigh the interests of everyone, not just Federal Express.
The point is that the United States' bargaining position with Japan has been weakened because of Mr. Smith's clumsy intervention and the Administration's willingness to peddle White House meetings. Even among those in the White House who opposed the idea of sanctions, there was agreement that Mr. Smith had a legitimate complaint. It will be understandable now if Japan takes less seriously an American demand that looks so obviously like a favor to a political contributor.
Other airlines have reason to fear that Federal Express will gain an upper hand over them. The way to remove such suspicions is obvious. Enacting legislation banning open-ended contributions by individuals and corporations is the only way to restore integrity to the process in Washington.

HEADLINE: 1997 U.S. OPEN;
Ho Returns In Time To Say Farewell

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY 

 BODY:
Yesterday was the first day of freshman orientation at Rice University, and Tommy Ho played hooky.
He also played tennis, and when he had finished his final-round qualifying match and watched his taller, healthier opponent, Dick Norman of Belgium, give his racquet a final disgusted kick, Ho was in the main draw of the United States Open for the first time since 1994 with a 6-3, 6-4 victory. 
 This is an odd sort of comeback in that it also appears to be a farewell. Ho has enrolled at Rice, where he plans to pursue a degree in economics and volunteer as an assistant coach with the men's tennis team.
He is only 24, but for much of the last two years, his lower back has felt considerably older than that. He took four months off in 1995, eight in 1996 and another three so far in 1997.
"The basic problem is that I've had two herniated disks; I'll spare you all the ugly details," he said. "Basically, my back is a career-ending injury. There are times when I can't tie my shoes for two or three days. So stiff. So painful. Other days, it can be all right, even good. The weather has a lot to do with it. When it's sunny like this, it is certainly better."
If it is better, it is also because Ho decided to get an injection earlier this month to help break up scar tissue in his back. It might seem like a Faustian bargain, but Ho is making the best of his borrowed time.
The week before arriving here, Ho reached the quarterfinals at the ATP Tour event in Indianapolis. Now, after three consecutive straight-set victories in qualifying, he will face Martin Damm of the Czech Republic in the Open's first round today.
 "Maybe it's fate, but right now I'm playing my best tennis," said Ho, one of nine men to qualify for the Open yesterday.
Ho, who was born in Winter Haven, Fla., was once considered a potential champion. In 1988, he won the national 18-and-under championship at age 15, and then he became the youngest man to play a match at the United States Open, losing to Johan Kriek in straight sets in the first round. But precocity did not evolve into stardom -- his highest career ranking is 85th -- and now he is searching for some graceful form of punctuation.
Oddly enough, Ho was the first person to win a professional match in the revamped national tennis center. It happened at the challenger event held last month when he won his first-rounder, 6-0, 6-0.
"Sometimes, I'm just thinking, 'God, I'm going to miss all this,' " he said. "But I look around this stadium, and I realize it's a new era, a new Open. This is what it will be the next 20, 30, 50 years. And at least I got a chance to play in the new facility."
The other American who, on the final day of qualifying, earned a chance to play in the Open was no nostalgic former teen-age phenom. He was Geoff Grant, a late-blooming Boston resident who, with his curly, long red locks, exuberance and sartorial excesses, looks a bit like the soccer star Alexi Lalas minus the goatee.
Grant, a 27-year-old Duke graduate, can tell you horror stories from satellite tournaments in Guatemala and challengers in Uzbekistan. He hits with two hands off both wings and now, after quitting the sport for 10 months, he is brimming with passion.
"When I quit, I was jealous of people getting ahead of me in the business world and moving ahead with their normal lives," said Grant, who defeated Dirk Dier of Germany, 6-3, 6-4, yesterday. "But I realized eventually that I really hadn't given tennis everything I could."
No longer jealous, Grant showed up at the Open qualifying in 1995 wearing a suit after a half-hearted interview for a radio sales job in Manhattan and proceeded to lose in the final round. "Obviously, the sales interview went terribly," he said with a grin.
Grant wasn't grinning quite so widely when he heard about his first-round draw: he will play Gustavo Kuerten, the French Open champion.
Then again, it could be worse. He could be Todd Larkham, a 203d-ranked Australian qualifier who drew Pete Sampras and will get to play the world No. 1 and two-time defending Open champion on tonight in the new Arthur Ashe Stadium in front of thousands of utterly unobjective Americans.
"I've watched him on the telly 101 times, and I'll bet he's never even heard of me," Larkham said. "Maybe he'll break an ankle or something."

HEADLINE: Rescuing a Big Phone Deal From Oblivion;
British Telecom's Chairman Makes Fateful Trans-Atlantic Pledge to MCI

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
Sometimes the most tortuous negotiations can be teased along with a grand gesture by a single person.
Sir Iain Vallance, the chairman of British Telecommunications, made such a gesture last week during a pivotal moment in the talks to salvage his company's acquisition of the MCI Communications Corporation. MCI had agreed to accept a 22 percent reduction in the value of the deal. But the company's directors wanted a guarantee that the transaction would finally close without further snags, according to people with knowledge of the talks. 
 Sir Iain's bold stroke? If British Telecom's shareholders did not ratify the deal, now worth $19 billion, he would resign, he promised MCI directors in Washington, speaking to them on a video hookup from London.
People familiar with the matter said his pledge gave MCI's board the confidence to accept the revised deal. And it ended a bizarre trans-Atlantic corporate melodrama. "It was extremely difficult," said Gerald H. Taylor, chief executive of MCI, referring to the three days of talks that led to the new terms announced on Friday. "But when we looked at what MCI would be like by itself, it wasn't as good as what we have now."
What MCI has now, though, is the subject of spirited debate among shareholders and analysts. Did the company preserve a powerful alliance that will set the agenda for the global communications industry of the future? Or did it simply patch up a relationship that will slip back into chaos the next time MCI or British Telecom hits a rough spot?
"Given what's happened over the last few weeks, I'm assuming there are some bruised egos there," said Scott Wright of Argus Research in New York. "Behind the shoulder-to-shoulder unity, there are dark undercurrents at those companies."
The contretemps between MCI and British Telecom has implications for the rest of the telecommunications industry, which is consolidating into a handful of vast alliances. Global partnerships like that of MCI and British Telecom are clearly more challenging than domestic mergers.
But even deals between next-door neighbors, like the recent combination of Bell Atlantic and Nynex, are prone to internal strife and culture clashes. And it was bad personal chemistry between top executives that helped derail tentative merger talks earlier this summer between AT&T and a regional Bell company, SBC Communications.
Taken together, such pairings indicate that even in telecommunications -- where all companies are basically in the same business -- manners and management may be what matter most.
For British Telecom and MCI, the pressure to smooth over their differences is especially acute because the companies must still persuade their respective shareholders that the revised deal is worth supporting. Earlier this year, investors in both companies had voted their support for the original deal, although some MCI shareholders had filed suits contending that its terms were insufficiently generous.
MCI and British Telecom now both plan to resubmit the deal to shareholder votes by November or early December, with a goal of closing at the end of the year. But some analysts are already predicting additional lawsuits from MCI shareholders.
Based on the value of the deal when it was announced last November, MCI shareholders will receive $2.02 a share less for the company under the new terms. They will also be deprived of a one-time British Telecom dividend worth $1.21 a share. Moreover, MCI shareholders will wind up with 25 percent of the combined company, versus 34 percent under the old agreement.
The prolonged dispute over the terms laid bare the stark differences between the two companies and two sets of shareholders. From British Telecom's perspective, the dispute was a cut-and-dried case of renegotiating an acquisition to account for the deterioration in MCI's financial results. That deterioration had been made clear on July 10, when MCI warned Wall Street that it was running unexpectedly large losses from its entry into the local phone business. The company said those losses could reach $800 million in 1997.
British Telecom responded by pushing to reduce the price of the deal to mollify its institutional shareholders, who were used to the steady earnings of a regulated utility and who reacted to MCI's warning with fury. At British Telecom's annual meeting in July, one investor told Sir Iain he was an "English muffin," who had allowed MCI "to eat him for breakfast."
For its part, MCI could not understand what all the fuss was about. As the No. 2 company in the intensely competitive American long-distance business, it was accustomed to making bold bets and weathering losses to break into new markets.
And so, when Sir Iain and other British Telecom executives investigated MCI's business and then demanded that the deal be revised, it plunged MCI into a searing internal debate, according to several executives with knowledge of the company. After three decades of refusing to back down from conflict with a monolith like AT&T, some insiders resisted the idea of MCI's now capitulating to its monolithic British partner.
"There was a lot of emotion and a lot of different perceptions," said an adviser to B.T., who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "The American perceptions and the U.K. perceptions weren't the same."
MCI's first response to British Telecom was to argue that B.T. had no legal grounds to change the deal. Lawyers for British Telecom had pointed to a clause in the original agreement that allowed either company to terminate it if there was a "material adverse change" in the business of the other. But a separate document carved out some businesses from that category. Among those, MCI's lawyers insisted, was local phone service.
MCI's law firm, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, prepared an analysis of the company's legal options. The firm thought MCI had a good chance of beating British Telecom in court. But besides the unseemliness of suing to complete the combination, MCI's lawyers also knew that the case would drag on for years, cost millions of dollars and distract MCI from its business.
"Litigation isn't really a business plan," a legal adviser to MCI said, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
As for MCI's actual business plan, several analysts said the company would have been severely handicapped by losing British Telecom's war chest when it was mounting an assault on the local telephone-service monopoly. And although all the world's other big phone carriers had not yet paired off, MCI might never have found a partner of the scale and with the resources of British Telecom.
"This was a choice between economic reality and emotional independence," said Michael Price, a managing director at Lazard Freres & Company, who advised MCI on the original deal and its revision.
After considering these issues, MCI's chairman, Bert C. Roberts Jr., decided to make a deal with British Telecom. But in accepting a lower purchase price, he still had to convince his colleagues and MCI's directors, some of whom were fiercely opposed.
MCI's board met for six and a half hours on Wednesday and several hours more on Thursday to hash out its options. Even on Thursday night -- hours before the revised deal was announced in London -- board members were raising concerns about whether even the new pact would survive a B.T. shareholder vote.
To assuage those concerns, Sir Iain and Sir Colin Marshall, who is the deputy chairman of British Telecom and the chairman of British Airways, addressed MCI's board by video. In addition to Sir Iain's pledge to resign, British Telecom agreed to pay MCI a fee of $750 million if the deal fell apart. And the amended agreement does not contain any loopholes about "material adverse changes." Shortly before 9 P.M. on Thursday, MCI's board felt secure enough to vote approval of the revised terms.
The following morning, British Telecom and MCI executives tried to put a good public face on the whole episode. They reiterated the strengths of the combined company, which, despite the discord, will carry the harmonious name of Concert: 43 million business and residential customers in 70 countries with revenue of $43 billion, or 6 percent of the $670 billion global telecommunications market.
Even though the changed deal is intended to compensate British Telecom, the executives argued that it would benefit MCI's shareholders, as well. That is because British Telecom now plans to issue fewer shares and more cash to acquire MCI. By reducing the projected number of outstanding shares by 10 percent, Concert will have higher per-share earnings, which will be good for MCI shareholders who will become shareholders of Concert.
"This is a win-win scenario," said Yves Istel, an investment banker at Rothschild, who advised British Telecom. "When everybody became persuaded of that, the pieces fell into place."
B.T. also tried to squash persistent rumors that it would set off on a housecleaning at MCI's Washington headquarters. The company said it did not plan to order 5,000 layoffs at MCI, as The Financial Times had reported on Thursday, although it did not rule out some layoffs. And British Telecom said it did not plan to remove any senior MCI executives.
It declared that it would support MCI's efforts to break into the local phone market and that it would not put pressure on MCI to scale back its investments -- and projected losses -- in that business. Privately, though, MCI officials said the company would become more selective about which new local markets to vie for, in an effort to keep those losses below $800 million.
Despite the sting MCI may feel in having to accept cheaper terms, some analysts argue that it is getting off easy. In addition to its costly local initiatives, the company has suffered an erosion in its core long-distance business. Together, those negative developments could in fact account for a 35 to 45 percent reduction in MCI's value since the original pact, according to Daniel Reingold, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company.
"MCI did very well for itself, in light of the challenges ahead in the United States, both in long distance and local," he said.
At MCI's headquarters, though, the mood is one of acceptance rather than triumph. The company's bruising encounter with British Telecom demonstrated that for all its entrepreneurial zest, MCI is destined to remain very much the junior partner.
Or, as Sir Iain put it on Friday, "it could well be in the interest of MCI shareholders to have a smaller slice of a greater cake."

HEADLINE: Forecasters Begin to See Who Will Feel Effects of El Nino

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
AS the latest version of the powerful weather-maker known as El Nino develops into a giant of its breed in the tropical Pacific, forecasters are beginning to get a clearer idea of how and where its impact will be felt globally in the weeks and months ahead.
For openers, there may be good news: El Nino has called into serious question earlier forecasts of an unusually active Atlantic hurricane season. The warming Pacific waters that define El Nino spawn wide-ranging atmospheric conditions that carry over into the Atlantic and tend to abort developing hurricanes. And as the 1997 hurricane season enters what should be its busiest period, the tropical regions that give rise to the big storms are almost eerily quiet. 
 "We're seeing a dead Atlantic at the moment; there's nothing going on out there" and El Nino is surely the reason why, said Vernon Kousky, an expert at the Climate Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Camp Springs, Md.
But come winter, El Nino may not be so benign. If the forecasters are right, it will bring abnormally high rainfall to California and virtually the entire southern tier of the United States. The last time El Nino appeared with strength comparable to this year's, in 1982-83, California and much of the southern tier were drenched again and again, causing floods, mud slides and general climatic havoc. Worldwide that year, El Nino caused more than 1,000 deaths and exacted staggering economic costs.
Already, early signs of El Nino's work are appearing in some parts of the world. Indonesia is drier than normal, for example, and the forecasters expect this situation to widen into a drought affecting the entire region, including Australia. That is characteristic of El Nino. So are the heavy rains that have recently fallen in Chile, giving that country a year's supply of precipitation in two drenching downpours. The weak monsoon and dry conditions now being experienced in Pakistan and northwestern India, the breadbasket of the Indian subcontinent, are also characteristic of El Nino disturbances.
El Nino is a vast pool of abnormally warm water that is brought about from time to time by naturally occurring oscillations in atmospheric pressure and ocean movements in the equatorial Pacific. Until recently, this pool materialized every two to seven years, but in the 1990's the warm El Nino waters have been in place most of the time. Why this is so is not clear; some scientists suspect that it may be somehow related to global warming, but others disagree.
In any case, the warmer ocean pumps more energy and moisture into the atmosphere, and this in turn alters wind and rainfall patterns around the world. The nature and severity of the resulting disturbances is directly related to how warm the equatorial water gets.
Just now, equatorial water off South America is about 9 degrees Fahrenheit above normal, according to the Climate Prediction Center, and it is expected to warm further in the months ahead, reaching a peak from February to April, when the equatorial waters would normally be warmest. This year, the water is already as warm as it was in the winter of 1982-83, when El Nino's bite was its sharpest of the 20th Century.
The forecasters are confident that California and the southern tier will experience abnormally heavy rainfall this winter and next spring, said Mr. Kousky, because that has been the invariable result when El Nino is at its strongest. But whether the abnormal precipitation will actually translate into the havoc of 1982-83, he said, depends on how the atmospheric circulation patterns that transport storms from the Pacific to the West Coast and across the continent develop.
El Nino, when it materializes, presents forecasters with an especially good predictor of weather trends months in advance; without it, they are hard pressed to make long-range predictions. With El Nino's aid, the Climate Prediction Center has just issued a forecast for January through March of next year.
The forecast calls for higher-than-normal precipitation for most of California, New Mexico, Arizona, most of Texas, the Gulf Coast, Florida and eastern Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. Below-normal precipitation is predicted for the Ohio Valley, the Midwest east of the Mississippi and Montana. Elsewhere, including the Northeast, normal rain, snow, ice and sleet are forecast.
The prediction says that warmer-than-normal temperatures will prevail on the West Coast and most of the northern tier of the country as far east as the Great Lakes, but it is expected to be colder than normal in much of the Southeast.
While the forecasters cannot be sure until this fall's atmospheric circulation patterns become established, they say the Northeastern United States may be in for a relatively mild winter. One reason for iffiness about the Northeast is that atmospheric circulation over eastern North America is influenced by sea-surface temperatures in the North Atlantic as well as by El Nino, and forecasts for Atlantic temperatures for this winter are uncertain. Even if the Northeastern winter does turn out to be mild, said Mr. Kousky, that does not rule out some snowstorms.
A more immediate uncertainty for the Eastern United States has to do with the Atlantic hurricanes. El Nino generates strong west-to-east winds that blow into the hurricane cradle of the tropical Atlantic. These winds tend to shear tropical disturbances apart before they can develop into hurricanes.
In June, forecasters at Colorado State University in Fort Collins predicted that this year's hurricane season would be more active than normal for the third consecutive year. In an early August update, the Colorado group revised its forecast downward somewhat but still predicted an above-average year. The prediction calls for a total of six Atlantic hurricanes, two of them major ones, and five other lesser tropical storms strong enough to be assigned names. So far there have been four named storms, including one minimal hurricane. All occurred in July.
Dr. William M. Gray, the chief author of the Colorado forecast, said his group agonized over the revised August prediction. El Nino aside, he said, a wide range of conditions, including warm sea-surface temperatures in the Atlantic, favor hurricane development. "This is the hardest forecast I've ever made, with El Nino breathing down our throats like this," said Dr. Gray, whose predictions have been generally accurate.
Mr. Kousky said even the revised prediction was too pessimistic. "My feeling is that we'll get fewer hurricanes than what he's forecasting," he said.
Dr. Gray conceded: "Vern could be right. I don't know what's going to happen. Nobody knows. We gave it our best shot, and we'll go with the forecast."
A word of caution: Even if Mr. Kousky is right and there are fewer hurricanes than expected, it takes only one to cause a disaster; 1992 was a year of infrequent hurricanes and tropical storms, yet the big one that did develop that year was Hurricane Andrew, the most destructive storm in American history.

GRAPHIC: Maps: "El Nino Returns, Bringing With It The Threat of Climactic Distruption"
The climate disruptor known as El Nino appears when sea-surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific rise above normal. The heat sets off atmospheric chain reactions affecting weather around the globe. As of last month, the temperatures had already risen to levels recorded in the winter of 1982-83, when the most powerful edition of El Nino so far in the 20th century raised climatic havoc in many parts of the world. Forecasters expect the seas to warm further in the months ahead, and based on that they have issued long-range temperature and precipitation forecasts for the coming winter in the United States. Maps show these forecasts. (Source: N.O.A.A. Climate Prediction Center)

HEADLINE: Looking For Laughs? Call a Harvard Grad;
As Writers and Producers, Young Alumni Find They Can Make a Lot of Money Fast

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Richard Appel was a Harvard man for the 1980's. He graduated with a degree in history and literature in 1985, went directly to Harvard Law School, like many of his classmates, and later joined the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan, a conventional step in a high-flying career.
And today? Mr. Appel is a Harvard man for the 1990's: he writes for "The Simpsons." 
 Welcome to the other Hollywood. Without doubt, the movie industry continues to be the most visible and glamorous side of the entertainment field. But head over to the second most fashionable tables at the city's must-see lunch spots, or peek inside some of the biggest houses in Los Angeles's toniest neighborhoods, and you will find the frequently better-paid and at times better-educated writers and producers of television shows.
Prime-time television may be reviled in intellectual circles for its supposedly lowbrow sensibilities, but many people in the medium regard this as a second golden era, both in terms of money and the quality of writing. Few things demonstrate the growing attractiveness of the field more than the presence of dozens of Harvard graduates (as well as many other Ivy Leaguers), particularly in the realm of comedy. Writing staffs of shows like "The Simpsons," "King of the Hill," "Saturday Night Live" and "Late Show With Dave Letterman" have come to look like Harvard alumni clubs.
Many other shows, including "Party of Five," "Cracker," "News Radio," "Third Rock From the Sun," "Seinfeld," "Veronica's Closet," "The Larry Sanders Show," "Suddenly Susan," "Murphy Brown" and "The Naked Truth," have or have had Harvard writers and producers and even a few Harvard-educated actors.
It is a career path that, as many of these people admitted, at one time seemed declasse by Harvard standards, but has gained considerable cachet with the soaring salaries and numbers of graduates heading out here.
"It's like there's a conveyor belt of people now coming out here," said Mr. Appel, who added that many of them, like himself, had worked at The Harvard Lampoon, long a launching pad for television comedy writers. ("The Lampoon has been the end of many a promising career in cancer research," said David Sacks, class of '84 and a co-executive producer of "Third Rock From the Sun.")
These people are, of course, endowed with varying degrees of talent. But, more important, they tend to be exceptionally ambitious, and the world of television now has credibility as a place that bright young Ivy Leaguers can go to show off their skills, something they were far less likely to do a generation ago.
Jonathan Aibel, class of '91 and a writer at "King of the Hill," said he recently went to a reunion and spent time with two classmates who are currently law clerks to United States Supreme Court justices. He said he had feared some subtle sense of rejection but was pleasantly surprised.
 
Shift in the Focus Of Money and Power
 "They said they enjoy the show," he said. "It was really good to hear that."
It is a business that pays huge sums even to very young people and is rising in prestige because of heavy media coverage. It requires not bursts of output and solitary efforts, as in writing screenplays or novels, but an ability to churn out consistently snappy scripts in collaboration with other writers, week in and week out.
"It's the same thing motivating these people that motivated graduates in the past, just in a new area," said Carolyn Strauss, class of '85 and a vice president for original programming at HBO. "The focus of money and power just shifted in a way."
At a show like "The Simpsons," fairly typical for sitcoms, a story editor, who holds one of the most junior positions, earns about $110,000 in a 22-episode year. (Payment is made by the episode.) The job of supervising producer, a mid-level writing position often reached after a few seasons, pays roughly $550,000 a year, and the top writing job, that of executive producer, $700,000 to as much as $3 million a year.
By contrast, the top salary for a first-year associate at a major New York law firm is roughly $86,000 a year, a figure that rises to about $170,000 in the fifth year, according to the National Association for Law Placement.
"I think we'd all be doing this even if it paid $16,000 a year," insisted Bill Oakley, class of '88 and a consulting producer of "The Simpsons." "But it does help that you can make as much after a few seasons as someone who's been at a law firm for 40 years."
Steven Peterman, class of '72 and an executive producer of "Suddenly Susan," said, "This has become a fast-track place where a smart person can make a lot of money in a hurry."
It helps, too, many said, that television shows are run by writers rather than deal makers. This produces a work environment that many regard as more intellectual and more in touch with the craft than film, which some writers complain is an endless series of pointless meetings.
"In television you work for other writers," said Jonathan Collier, class of '83 and a consulting producer on "King of the Hill," which was created in part by another Harvard alumnus, Greg Daniels, class of '85. "In film you work for people who want to have lunch with you."
Indeed, there is a sort of reverse snobbery now, with many television writers looking down on film as generally less interesting than good television.
John Romano, an executive producer and co-creator of "Michael Hayes," a one-hour drama series that will make its debut this fall, was an English professor at Columbia University before coming to Hollywood. He said he had been drawn here in part because he felt that the literature of the medium was more interesting than movies, or even many of today's novels.
"Television dramas are genuinely intelligent and interesting in the complexity of the situations in which you can put your characters," said Mr. Romano, who attended Yale, not Harvard. "Television in that sense is rich in character and complexity, even in a way film generally is not. There are many writers who find film language poor. And the novel has really turned inward."
Heavy news coverage of the television industry has also added sex appeal to the business. "In the 1980's investment banking got the same media play that Jamie Tarses gets today," Ms. Strauss said, referring to the embattled young president of ABC Entertainment.
And one should not underestimate the draw of the relaxed character of the television writing business, in which a pressed shirt is as welcome as a tie-dyed T-shirt and dreadlocks in a corporate boardroom.
"There's a tremendous amount of work, a tremendous amount of competition, tremendous job insecurity," Mr. Sacks said. "There are lots of periods of unemployment. Nevertheless, just the opportunity to show up and work in jeans and a T-shirt is a huge electromagnet to young people."
 
A Bit Defensive About Their Jobs
 Which is not to say there is not a knee-jerk defensiveness among these Harvard graduates.
"Yeah, I have had encounters with people recently who thought not only that television writing was for morons, but have said things like, 'Don't you of all people wish you wrote for something more positive?' " Mr. Appel said.
Mr. Appel, who is married to the novelist Mona Simpson, said he never felt a need to apologize for his work in her literary circles but added, "I guess you can't help but be a little defensive."
Irene Ng, a Harvard pre-med student who stars in a Nickelodeon show, "The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo," said there was still some division among students in their views on television.
"One group is fascinated by television and impressed and happy for you," Ms. Ng said. "They think it is really just great. The other group is like, well, one friend said: 'Acting on TV, it doesn't help people. It's so self-promoting.' I do get a sense that some people think working in TV's not socially responsible."
William Wright-Swadel, head of Harvard's career services office, said that the largest number of Harvard's 1,600 or so graduates each year still went into what he called "the big four": law, business consulting, medicine and investment banking. Nevertheless, he said that a media fair, the first ever, was set up last November to introduce students to jobs in the entertainment business. It drew nearly 800 students in a half-day.
"The thing that was important was that the whole thing was student-generated," he said.
Lucy Fisher, class of '71 and the vice chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said that for a number of years she had hired her assistants from Harvard. She said she no longer did so but that she was receiving a growing volume of inquiries from undergraduates.
"If I opened those floodgates, I know about a zillion Harvard people would come out here," she said. "There's a lot of interest."
Some Harvard graduates said they had had to conceal their alma mater because of anti-intellectual attitudes just below the surface among some people in Hollywood.
Nestor Carbonell, class of '90 and an actor who plays Luis, the passionate Latin photographer, in "Suddenly Susan," said he had hid his Harvard background at times because some directors thought he could play only highbrow parts, not street toughs.
 
What a Diploma Can Accomplish
 But the name and the network can clearly help. Christopher Keyser, class of '82 (and class of '85, Harvard Law School), is the co-creator and executive producer of the drama "Party of Five." He said he had never obtained a job because of his Harvard connections, but he admitted that they could help get a young writer a second look, which can make a big difference. "The world is an unfair place like that," he said.
But, he insisted, "there is not a secret handshake."
All this still leaves open the question of whether these well-educated writers are raising the quality of prime-time television or trying to appeal to what some critics describe as the lowest common denominator. GQ magazine raised the issue several years ago in an article titled "Smart People, Dumb TV."
For their part, the writers tend to regard their work as lifting the quality of television, citing the popularity of their shows as evidence.
"For me it's the perfect synthesis of high and low," said Mr. Sacks of "Third Rock From the Sun." "You can make a great insight into the human condition and then have a guy tumble down a flight of stairs."
Well, let the reader judge. Mr. Sacks cited a "Third Rock" parody of the show "E.R.," in which the characters in his show, aliens in human form, had insinuated themselves into a hospital, pretending to be physicians.
"When's our next shift?" Sally asks.
"Hard to say," Harry replies. "We're not doctors."
"I can't wait to go back to that place," Tommy says. "It's like Disneyland. Only with a really high fatality rate."
In another episode, which is to appear on Halloween, Tommy and Sally buy costumes at a shop and dress up as Sonny and Cher. Dick, the group's leader, asks who they are supposed to be.
"Julius and Ethel Rosenberg," Tommy replies. "But I think the guy at the store made a mistake."

GRAPHIC: Charts/Photo: "THE SALARIES"
Story editor, a junior position, pays about $110,000 for a 22-episode year for "The Simpsons." Supervising producer, a mid-level writing job, pays about $550,000, and executive producer, the top writing job, $700,000 to $3 million. A first-year associate at a big New York law firm can earn about $86,000; in the fifth year that rises to $170,000.
 
"THE ALUMNI"
Four of 13 writers of "The Simpsons" are Harvard graduates, including, from left, Richard Appel, class of '85; David S. Cohen, '88, and George Meyer, '78, who are all co-executive producers. (Bill Oakley, '88, a consulting producer, is not shown.) Five of 14 writers for "King of the Hill" and 3 of 8 writers for "Party of Five" are also Harvard alumni. (Andrew Semel)

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Advances Against Yen As Flat Japan Rates Are Seen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the yen yesterday as sluggish consumer spending in Japan bolstered expectations that interest rates there would not rise soon, while the United States currency was little changed against the mark on concern German rates might head higher.
In late trading in New York, the dollar settled at 118.79 yen, up from 118.31 yen on Friday; the dollar edged up to 1.8205 marks from 1.8168 marks. The pound slipped to $1.6051 from $1.6093. Volume was thin yesterday, as there was no trading in London, the world's largest currency market, because of a bank holiday. 
 The dollar received a lift against the yen after Japanese reports showed that an April tax increase stifled sales at department stores, supermarkets and electronics retailers in July for the fourth consecutive month.
The sales reports touched off a rally in Japanese bonds, as traders bet record low interest rates would not be raised soon. Higher rates would buoy the yen by luring global investors to some yen assets.
"Any talk of Japanese interest rates headed higher seems to be premature," said Jack Griffin, manager of foreign exchange sales at Fuji Bank. "If you're an investor looking at the situation, you wouldn't put your money in Japan."
Also weighing on the Japanese currency was fragility in Southeast Asian currencies. Countries in that region are among Japan's largest trading partners.
"Asian currencies are still showing weakness," said Thomas Lapinski, chief currency trader at MTB Bank. "There's concern more of them will need bailout packages and that Japan will need to assist."
The dollar was little changed against the mark after a higher-than-expected rise in consumer prices fueled speculation the German central bank could soon raise interest rates.
"There's fear that inflation is kicking up in Germany," said Thomas Lapinski, chief currency trader at MTB Bank. "A lot of traders are a bit nervous the Bundesbank might raise rates."
West German consumer prices rose two-tenths of 1 percent in the month ended mid-August, and 2 percent from the comparable period a year earlier.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Fall a Bit Pending Economic Reports

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities slipped yesterday as investors grew cautious prior to this week's economic reports and Government note auctions.
The 30-year bond fell 7/32, to 96 9/32, with the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rising to 6.66 percent from 6.65. 
 Analysts said this week's reports might show signs of economic strength, raising fears of inflation, which erodes the value of bonds. In addition, the Government auctions could cause dealers to try to raise the yields in advance to make the securities easier to distribute to investors.
Today, the Treasury will auction $15.5 billion in new two-year notes and tomorrow, it will sell $11.5 billion in new five-year notes. Steven Landis, director of fixed-income investments at Bull and Bear Advisers Inc., said that with dealers raising yields in preparation for the sales, there could be "a distribution rally coming out of the auctions."
In when-issued trading, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.98 percent, while the five-year was offered at a price to yield 6.24 percent. Rates at yesterday's bill auction were up moderately and in line with expectations. The three-month bill came in at 5.12 percent, up from 5.08 percent the previous week, while the six-month rate was 5.14 percent, up from 5.12 percent.
While the approach of the Treasury auctions might be contributing to the rise in yields, traders said that the recent volatility of the market had been exacerbated by other factors, including the thinness of trading. Yesterday, volume was among the lightest levels of the year; many market participants have left for vacations.
Mr. Landis also cited international factors for the recent volatility, including the currency crisis in Southeast Asia and the weakness of the Japanese economy. Also, the continuing sluggishness in Germany -- and the threat of an increase in interest rates, which Mr. Landis said would only compound the problem -- has further left investors scratching their heads.
All this should be making the United States market more attractive, because foreign investors have few other options. As a result, Mr. Landis said, the market was now only going through a technical adjustment and that it was still cheap by comparison.
While there was little economic news of note yesterday, Doug Burtnick, managing analyst with Technical Data of Boston, said the rest of the week "does carry a few tidbits worth watching, starting with tomorrow's two-year auction."
On the surface, he said, it looked as though the auction should go fine. Yields on the two-year note have risen by about a quarter of a percentage point over the last few weeks, and Wall Street expects the Federal Reserve to enter the market this week. "But with the summer doldrums comes a lack of liquidity," he said. "That should force dealers to try backing the market up even further on Tuesday morning," raising yields again.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Bills		 	 	Average Price	98.692	97.401		 	 	Discounted Rate	5.12%	5.14%		 	 	Coupon Yield	5.26%	5.35%		 	 	High Price	98.699	97.407		 	 	Discounted Rate	5.09%	5.13%		 	 	Coupon Yield	5.23%	5.34%		 	 	Low Price	98.689	97.401		 	 	Discounted Rate	5.13%	5.14%		 	 	Coupon Yield	5.27%	5.35%		 	 	Accepted at low price	32%	48%		 	 	Total applied for	$37,648,406	$30,073,000		 	 	Accepted	$6,088,866	$3,797,600		 	 	Noncompetitive	$1,320,047	$1,232,719

HEADLINE: Colombia In Disarray, But Leader Prospers

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Aug. 25

 BODY:
The Letters to the Editor column in El Tiempo one recent day read like the script for a movie that could be called "Country on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown."
The first note was from a woman to her husband who had been kidnapped months ago, urging him not to lose hope. Another reader exploded over the "swindlers, juvenile delinquents, phony civil servants; peddlers selling umbrellas, videos, books, dogs, taffy, knives, kites; predators, murderers just out of jail" who besiege him the moment he leaves home each morning. 
 A third brought up a promise President Ernesto Samper made, that his last year in office would be a "striptease," unveiling great works. With interest rates on savings accounts falling short of inflation, the pledge rang true in a way, the reader said. "We've been completely fleeced."
Three years into his four-year term, President Samper has proved himself a far shrewder, more audacious politician than his opponents in Washington or here at home imagined in the adrenaline-filled days when the clamor for his resignation echoed from streets to boardrooms.
Mr. Samper has won the battle over the drug corruption charges against him. Nobody here expects him to leave office before his term expires next August. And yet his victory is dubious. By virtually any measure, Colombia is in its worst shape in decades, demoralized, angry and broke.
"He's a political genius," said Francisco Mejia, an economic consultant who was one of those calling for Mr. Samper to step down. "But it doesn't matter. He doesn't have credibility, nobody trusts him, and without that, you can't really run a country."
Pardoned by Congress on charges that drug dealers from the southern city of Cali pumped $6 million into his election campaign, the President has used control of jobs, pork-barrel projects and the airwaves to avoid resigning.
Supportive members of Congress have been rewarded with cash for enormous, often unnecessary projects in their districts, devastating the country's once enviable economy. Economists like Mr. Mejia estimate that the district of Heyne Mogollon, who came under severe criticism for playing down the case against Mr. Samper when he chaired the Congressional Committee of Accusations, has received an estimated $20 million in assorted contracts.
"Most of the upper classes live off the state, and the President has tremendous pull," said Hernan Echeverria, who stood at the forefront of the drive among business leaders to remove the President, only to watch their commitment dissipate as time passed. "He has so many contracts, so many jobs, to give out."
Economic growth, which had been running upwards of 5 percent a year before Mr. Samper took office, is down to an expected 1.5 percent this year, while the major international investment houses are advising their clients to look elsewhere. Revenues gained from privatization have gone largely to pay salaries rather than to build public works necessary for future growth. The unemployment rate, once at 6 percent, has more than doubled.
With the Government soaking up domestic sources of finance, Colombian companies have increasingly turned to foreign banks. During Mr. Samper's term, foreign debt has soared to $32 billion from $17 billion. And Government spending as a share of the gross domestic product has swollen to 33 percent from 20 percent, said Mr. Mejia.
In social and political terms, the situation is hardly more optimistic. About 70 percent of all the kidnappings in the world occur here. More people died violent deaths in the first nine months of 1996 than all of last year in the United States, which has nearly eight times the population. Jose Miguel Caballero and John Murphy, two gung-ho entrepreneurs who make bulletproof fashion wear, are busy outfitting all the candidates for next year's presidential elections.
In order to prevail over his enemies, Mr. Samper has had to curry favor with power bases that are frequently at odds, much as he has tried to satisfy the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, the Cali traffickers who allegedly financed his election, as well as officials in Washington, who criticize him for protecting the interests of the drug lords.
A perfect example has been a bill to reinstate extradition, which the President launched as Washington prepared its annual report card on Colombia's cooperation in fighting drug exports. The United States, which would like to be able to try the Colombian drug lords in its own courts, is eager to have an extradition treaty with Colombia, and Mr. Samper's proposal has effectively muted Washington's criticism. But the law would not apply to drug dealers who turn themselves in, like the Rodriguez Orejuelas. And a twist in the bill announced last week means that passage of a second law, under the next President's administration, will be necessary.
Such weak leadership has been a boon to the right-wing paramilitary groups and the leftist guerrillas, who together control more than half the country's territory.
In the atmosphere of lawlessness beyond any sense of proportion or shame, some crimes veer into the surreal. Last week, a legislator reported that a 32-foot-wide metal bridge weighing 40 tons had disappeared from his district. Residents of San Agustin, in Neiva state, said they neither saw nor heard anything.

HEADLINE: Stocks Drift Aimlessly as Dow Drops 28.34

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
After a week of disorienting volatility, the stock market turned less volatile yesterday, but no less disorienting.
Blue-chip stocks showed little direction for much of the day, drifting in and out of negative territory, before finally succumbing to modest losses. Smaller stocks performed better. 
 Analysts said that the market's seeming aimlessness was caused in part by the thinness of trading as many investors were away on vacation. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was near its lowest level of the year, with just 392 million shares changing hands.
"The light volume is the main culprit today," said Edward Collins, a trader at Daiwa Securities. "I can't make a trend of much of anything."
Though the Dow Jones industrial average fell at the opening bell, it soon turned higher, gaining 56 points, before drifting lower through much of the afternoon.
At the closing bell, the Dow was off 28.34 points to close at 7,859.57. It was the third consecutive loss for the Dow, which has been sluggish all month long.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also slumped, losing 3.39 points, to 920.16. But the Nasdaq composite index, which is laden with technology issues, rose 2.88 points, to 1,601.57.
Among the major measures, the Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks was the day's best performer, up 2.36 points, or 0.57 percent, to 418.09.
While rising interest rates in the bond market and nervousness over the state of the economy seem to have reduced some investor enthusiasm in the last month, smaller issues have quietly come to life.
Not only has the Russell been steadier than the Dow and the S.& P. 500, but midsize companies, as represented by the S.& P. mid-cap index, have also fared well. The S.& P. midcap index rose 1.47, to 313.21 yesterday, and is now up 22.5 percent for the year, outpacing the Dow, which is up 21.9 percent.
And while blue-chip technology issues were only a trifle higher yesterday, smaller technology stocks soared. The Russell 2000 Technology Index rose 1.26 percent, and the S.& P. small-cap technology index gained 1.55 percent. Among other stocks that did well were tobacco issues, which rose after the companies agreed to pay $11.3 billion to settle a smoking-related lawsuit in Florida.
Because the market was so strong in July, some analysts say it was inevitable that it would weaken in August, tempering a run that saw the Dow gain nearly 2,000 points, or 29 percent, between mid-April and early August.
But Gail Dudack, the chief investment strategist at UBS Securities, said that the strike at United Parcel Service, weakness in the dollar and heightened activity in derivative securities had contributed to the downdraft.
"The key thing is the market's been overvalued, and there's also an extensive use of derivative strategies," she said. Besides, "August is a vacation month, and a thin market is often a more volatile market because it doesn't take as many buyers or sellers to move the market."
Indeed, last week -- on weaker- than-average volume -- the Dow had four consecutive 100-point moves, and on Friday plunged 177 points before rallying sharply in the final hour of trading to close down 6.04.
Analysts said that because of high valuations and jitters over interest rates and the economy, the market was taking a break after a spectacular run, with bulls and bears battling for the upper hand.
"This is like a prize fight that's gone well past 15 rounds; both fighters are exhausted," said Jon Olesky, the head trader at Morgan Stanley.
Among the hardest hit this summer have been the bluest of the blue chips, companies like Coca-Cola, General Electric, Gillette and Procter & Gamble -- two of which recently warned of earnings slowdowns. G.E. -- which fell 3/4, to 64 1/8 yesterday -- is down 24 percent from its recent high. And Coke, which fell 1, to 59 11/16, is down 14 percent in a month.
Gillette fell 1 7/16, to 85 1/4 yesterday, and Procter & Gamble, the Dow's worst performer, fell 2 1/4, to 136 1/4.

HEADLINE: In Suffolk, Bok Choy and Good Wine

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: CALVERTON, N.Y.

 BODY:
With the push of a button, Jack Van de Wetering, the largest producer of greenhouse plants in the New York metropolitan region, can rotate his entire crop of 10 million plants in just one hour.
"At the height of the season, we've got about 20 acres inside our greenhouses," Mr. Van de Wetering said. "We move them inside and out on a mechanized system of wheels and trolleys, enabling us to produce three to four times more than in the old traditional greenhouses." 
 Mr. Van de Wetering, whose father, a Dutch seed grower, came to the United States after World War II, has become a leader in the agricultural revolution on Long Island, enabling Suffolk County to expand its role as the largest producer of agricultural products, based on wholesale value, of any county in New York State.
His sprawling Ivy Acres farm here on the rural North Fork of Long Island, just north of the end of the Long Island Expressway, includes 40 acres of greenhouses and research buildings and produces 65 million plants a year.
While Long Island was once known primarily for its potatoes and ducks, it now produces a variety of products, from wines and specialty foods to bok choy (Chinese cabbage) and other Asian vegetables sought by the region's growing Asian population.
"There is no county in New York State, or possibly in the United States, where agriculture is more diversified than Suffolk County," said William Sanok, an agent with the Suffolk-Cornell University Cooperative Extension Association. "It's not just potatoes and Long Island duckling anymore, but a competitive world in which farmers have been forced to produce a wide variety of high-return crops employing innovative technology."
He said that all this innovation was taking place on the eastern two-thirds of Long Island.
Despite the pressure to turn yet more of the rural East End into vacation and year-round housing, the state's agricultural census indicates that Suffolk continues to increase its agricultural output. The total value of production rose from $93 million in 1982 to well over $160 million in 1995, when the last such census was taken. The census being taken this year is expected to show even more growth, officials said.
Suffolk's farm industry generates 8,000 jobs and contributes a quarter of a billion dollars to the local economy, county officials said.
The 1995 cash receipts for crops alone totaled $146.4 million, including $17.7 million for vegetables, $3.8 million for fruit, $110.5 million for nursery and greenhouse plants and $14.8 million for field crops. Livestock and poultry receipts totaled $13.6 million, according to the State Department of Agriculture and Markets.
While potato acreage has dropped from 19,000 acres in 1982 to around 6,000, vegetable production has remained steady at around 8,000 acres. Vineyards, rare in 1982, have grown to nearly 2,000 acres. And while total farm acreage, measured at 50,000 in 1982, has dropped to around 30,000, productivity and the wholesale return per acre has increased, Mr. Sanok said.
Over the last three decades, farmers have been pressured by higher costs for land, labor, taxes and energy. They have also been affected by new laws intended to protect Long Island's environment and underground supply of drinking water. Many duck farmers chose to close down rather than install expensive sewage treatment equipment to process duck waste to reduce the pollution of nearby bays.
To beat the high cost of energy, Mr. Van de Wetering joined forces with Richard Harrison, a former engineer at Brookhaven National Laboratory in nearby Upton, to reinvent the greenhouse.
They designed a lightweight aluminum grid on wheels that moved all the plants in and out of the greenhouse at will, and robots to plant the seedlings. These and other innovations enable them to produce three times as much as the traditional greenhouse.
Dr. Andrew M. Novakovic, professor of agricultural economics at the Cornell University School of Agriculture and Life Sciences, said, "What's going on on Long Island is really just kind of an acute case of what's happening elsewhere in New York, the Northeast and the rest of the country."
The success of Suffolk farmers in finding their own niche in a changing marketplace, combined with a growing appreciation among county officials of the value of maintaining the East End's rural character, led to the adoption in 1974 of Suffolk's Farmland Preservation Plan.
Since then, the county has placed approximately 10,000 acres into permanent open space agricultural land, said George Proios, assistant Suffolk County executive for environmental affairs. The plan's ultimate goal is 20,000 acres of protected farmland.
The preservation program was among the first in the United States and has become a source of pride among agriculture officials on Long Island and in Albany.
"We see Suffolk County as a terrific role model for any community that is trying to preserve and protect is agriculture industry," said Pete Gregg, spokesman for the State Department of Agriculture and Markets.
"The fact that Suffolk has been able to do so well, despite pressures from development and other sources, says a great deal about its farm friendly attitude and actions," he said.
The Island's tourism industry has also found that it is good business to be friendly to farmers, said Dr. Pearl Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, the Island's largest business organization.
"Tourism wouldn't be as strong on the East End if you didn't have agriculture here," Dr. Kamer said. "It creates an ambiance that tourists expect. They come because they want to spend their time in a less hurried rural atmosphere."
The wine industry, which began in 1973, has brought the most significant change in agriculture to Long Island in recent years, Mr. Sanok said. It now produces about 3.5 million bottles a year, valued at more than $30 million.
The Lenz Winery in Peconic says that the North Fork is a perfect place to grow grapes for wine.
"It's the sunniest place in the Northeast and has just the right amount of breeze to ventilate the vines," said Thomas Morgan, marketing manager for Lenz. "So far this year, growing conditions have been ideal, and if we don't get any more rain until September, we'll be very happy."
While most other crops on the Island depend on some form of irrigation, the wineries would rather live without it.
"Irrigation encourages surface roots," Mr. Morgan said. "We prefer deep roots that seek out the minerals and other ingredients that make for good wine."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
As SFX Deal Is Announced, More Mergers Are Expected

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
While stepping up the rapid pace of consolidation in radio broadcasting, Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst's acquisition of SFX Broadcasting is hardly giving the industry a pause.
News of the $1.2 billion deal, which was announced yesterday, propelled the stocks of many radio companies, including those of Emmis Broadcasting, which has repeatedly declared that it is not for sale, and of Clear Channel Communications, an aggressive acquirer of stations. 
 Indeed, there is a clear sense on Wall Street that more deals are on the way in an industry that has been awash in mergers and acquisitions for more than a year. About 20 percent of the nation's 10,300 commercial radio stations are now owned by seven major companies, including Hicks, Muse, the Dallas buyout firm.
"It's no surprise whatsoever that they're up," said Bishop Sheen, a fixed-income analyst with First Union Capital Markets, said of radio stocks. "The real question is, will we get to Labor Day without another $2 billion announcement."
Hicks, Muse said it would acquire SFX's 71 radio stations, making it the leading operator of radio stations in the country, in terms of the number of stations owned, eclipsing the CBS Radio unit of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Hicks, Muse, which already owns 241 radio stations through its various subsidiaries, including the Capstar Broadcasting Corporation, is assuming about $920 million in debt.
Shares of SFX surged $6.25, or 9.2 percent, to $74.125. Class A shares of Emmis rose $2.1875, or 5 percent, to $46.0625, while Clear Channel shares gained $1.75, or 2.8 percent, to $63.75.
Once the struggling orphan of the media industry, radio companies have become a hot commodity. Regulators in recent years have allowed owners to acquire a larger share of local radio markets, which in turn helped the companies increase their advertising revenues. All of the biggest companies in radio, including Westinghouse, Jacor Communications and the American Radio Systems Corporation, pursued SFX, which is based in New York, in the hope of strengthening their grips on mid-market cities.
A buyer until a few weeks ago, American Radio, the fourth-largest radio broadcaster, with 69 stations, has suddenly decided to switch sides and become a seller. Analysts said that the company had found it hard to compete with the larger players given its debt and the rapidly escalating cost of acquisitions.
On Wednesday, American Radio said it had hired Credit Suisse First Boston to assess its strategic alternatives, which, as one analyst said, was "code for: We're for sale." Within hours American Radio's stock soared 17 percent, to $45.625. Jacor and Westinghouse are now mentioned as possible suitors, and the stock closed unchanged yesterday at $48 a share.
"They're not aligned with one of the massive groups and they don't have the capital to pay for an acquisition," Victor B. Miller 4th, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company, said of American. "I think they decided it's time to go. The best combination for American is Clear Channel. They have no overlapping markets and they're both in the broadcast tower business."
Analysts said that Emmis Broadcasting might also follow suit and become a candidate for a takeover.
No one has embraced the consolidation trend with more enthusiasm than Hicks, Muse. Earlier this year, the buyout firm and the Evergreen Media Corporation agreed to form the nation's largest independent radio broadcaster. The combined company, the Chancellor Media Corporation, is in the process of buying 10 radio stations owned by Viacom Inc.
Much of the consolidation so far has taken place in the country's large and midsized cities. The merger and acquisition craze will now "trickle down" to smaller markets, analysts said.
Since the Federal Communications Commission eliminated many regulations governing station ownership last year, more than 2,100 of the 10,300 commercial radio stations in the nation have changed owners in deals worth an estimated $15 billion.
But the industry had been poised for a drastic change since 1991, when a recession drove down radio advertising revenues for the first time in 30 years, even as the number of stations increased. The F.C.C. raised local and national ownership limits in 1992, allowing a company to own as many as two AM and two FM stations in the same market.
Prior to that move, advertisers had regarded radio as a less effective way than newspapers or television to reach consumers. But with deregulation, companies could accumulate multiple stations in a single market and, presumably, deliver a greater audience to advertisers. At the same time, it made sense for once-tiny radio companies either to sell or to buy stations in other markets to gain size and heft.
"It's metamorphosized from a survival technique to a device that allows radio to compete more effectively with local television and newspapers," said Mr. Miller of Bear, Stearns. "Now you're seeing a hell of a lot of competition. These are not lightweight, dinky radio groups anymore."

HEADLINE: Doctors Win Pact to Run City Hospitals

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration has reached an agreement to let a private group of doctors operate a major hospital network in the Bronx, the first time that a large public teaching hospital in New York City would not be run by a private hospital or medical school.
Under the unusual arrangement, worked out in principle on Friday, the city will pay a group of about 375 doctors $253 million over three years to operate Jacobi Medical Center and North Central Bronx Hospital, which together are known as the North Bronx Health Care Network. To handle the hospital's business matters, like billing and writing checks, the doctors will use a private management company that performs the same function at the city's Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn. 
 Most of the doctors in the group have worked for years at the two hospitals, which have been operated until recently by the private Montefiore Medical Center, and before that by the Albert Einstein School of Medicine of Yeshiva University. In June, however, the city terminated Montefiore's contract to run the two hospitals, citing poor performance, and at that point the doctors decided to form their own corporation and make a bid to run the hospitals themselves.
The contract with the doctors is the latest illustration of the increasing competitiveness in the region's health care system. The city established affiliation agreements with large private hospitals decades ago because it feared that high-quality doctors could not otherwise be attracted to its public hospitals. Both sides agreed that a contract like this one would probably not have been possible before managed care and reduced insurance reimbursements put greater economic pressure on doctors and hospitals.
In fact, one of the main reasons the city said it canceled Montefiore's contract was that the private hospital had been siphoning patients and income away from the public hospital, a growing practice in the city's hospitals, said Dr. Luis R. Marcos, president of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation. That will not happen under the new arrangement, Dr. Marcos said, because the doctors will no longer be working for a private hospital.
"This has a lot of advantages for us," Dr. Marcos said in an interview yesterday. "Not only does it save us a lot of money, but it removes the incentive on the part of doctors to send patients somewhere else. And because it's the same doctors, there's a continuity of care that's important to our patients."
The agreement must be approved by the board of the city hospitals agency, which is expected.
Dr. Paul Gennis, the leader of the Jacobi/ North Central Bronx Physicians Alliance, as the doctors' group is known, said many doctors at city hospitals have long chafed under the traditional affiliation agreements with private hospitals.
"Many of us have felt for a long time that these affiliation contracts never made sense," said Dr. Gennis, chief of the emergency room at Jacobi. "When Jacobi or any H.H.C. hospital contracts with an outside entity, there's no incentive for that entity to improve the operations and business of the hospital. They just meet the letter of the contract but go no further. But the doctors in the hospital have a stake in its success, because this is where we live and work."
It will be the first time that the alliance and the private management company, University Group Medical Associates, have run a network of this size, although University Group has run Coney Island's business operations for about 20 years. Dr. Gennis said he believed that in combination with University Group, the doctors had sufficient experience to run the two hospitals, which have a total of 782 beds. Coney Island has 450 beds.
The hospitals will maintain their academic affiliation with Albert Einstein College, which will supply them with medical students and residents. The college will have no role in operating the hospitals, however, having pulled out two years ago after complaining about the city's stringent new productivity requirements.
Those requirements, which demand an increasing level of productivity from each hospital, will be in force under the new contract. The doctor's alliance can be fined if it does not meet goals in each medical department, and it will be expected to maintain the same level of care each year, although the city payments will decline each year. This fiscal year the city will pay $89.5 million; next year $83.9 million, and the following year $79.5 million. The city paid Montefiore $101 million to run the hospitals last year.
This is not the first time that the city has contracted with private groups of doctors, which already operate two smaller hospitals in Brooklyn, Coney Island Hospital and Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center. But by agreeing to such a contract at Jacobi -- which, along with Bellevue Hospital Center, is one of the two academic bulwarks of the city hospital system -- the city sent a clear message to all of its large affiliates that times have changed.
"In the past, we needed the affiliation agreements to attract good doctors, but that is not the case anymore," Dr. Marcos said. "Now, with patients at a premium, we can attract first-rate physicians on our own. And a contract like this gives us more control over the hospital, because the doctors' corporation depends on H.H.C."
The agreement is a further embarrassment to Montefiore, which has lost hundreds of millions of dollars in city affiliation fees -- and possibly lucrative referrals -- even as the city chose to hire the same doctors who have long worked at Jacobi and North Central Bronx. Montefiore officials issued a terse statement yesterday saying they planned to work with the doctors' alliance to achieve an orderly transition.

HEADLINE: City Gets Higher Profit on Tennis Than on Baseball

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is refusing to appear at the new $254 million National Tennis Center because of a lease provision that would force the city to pay fines if jets from nearby La Guardia Airport pass over the site during United States Open tennis matches.
But when his anger recedes, Mr. Giuliani may discover that David N. Dinkins, his tennis-loving predecessor, produced a better financial deal for the city than those it has in stadium leases with the Yankees and the Mets. 
 The main difference is that while the city is ultimately responsible for maintenance costs on the two baseball stadiums, its deal for the tennis center puts those costs squarely on the United States Tennis Association.
Last year, for its two-week tournament, the tennis association paid $1.1 million in rent to the city. That nearly equaled the $1.2 million the city netted from the Yankees for the seven-month baseball season: the Yankees paid $5.1 million, but $3.9 million in maintenance costs were deducted from that sum. The city's net profit from the Mets last year was $400,000: $3.8 million in rent, offset by $3.4 million in maintenance costs.
In 1995, the tennis association paid $1 million, but the city lost $300,000 on Yankee Stadium. That year, the Mets' rent of $3.4 million exceeded the maintenance costs by just $100,000.
With the new tennis center, including Arthur Ashe Stadium, operating, the tennis association's payment is expected to rise to $1.5 million this year.
"The U.S.T.A. deal is an excellent deal for the city," Alan G. Hevesi, the City Comptroller, said. "And, for two weeks, we're getting a lot of rich folks spending a lot of money at the tennis center and filling up our hotels."
But Colleen Roche, the Mayor's press secretary, said, "That's not the issue."
The relative financial merits of the three leases are "irrelevant to the Mayor's opposition to the United States Tennis Association contract," which is based on the jet noise provision, Ms. Roche said.
The provision, which has never been invoked, would fine the city up to $325,000 if too many jets fly over the center during Open tennis matches, although flyovers necessary for safety are exempted.
The Federal Aviation Administration, not the city, controls air traffic, but the city agreed to lobby the F.A.A. to keep diverting planes over other parts of Queens during the tournament, as it has done since 1990. The Mayor has questioned the safety and fairness of the diversions.
"He cannot and will not look beyond that issue," Ms. Roche said.
The tennis association's lease calls for a $400,000 base payment, plus 1 percent of tennis center revenues over $25 million. And the tennis association pays all maintenance costs, while the city maintains Shea Stadium and reimburses the Yankees to keep up Yankee Stadium.
From 1986 to 1996, the city's Department of Parks and Recreation said, the tennis association has paid $4.4 million in rent, with no maintenance costs to offset the city's profit.
In that period, the Mets produced a $1.2 million surplus of rent over maintenance for the city; the Yankees, a $500,000 net loss.
The Yankees' payments might have been higher if not for the way the team accounts for its cable television revenues. The team divides its 12-year, $500 million cable deal with the MSG Network into several contracts, and then uses a portion of the annual MSG payment of more than $40 million, along with percentages of ticket sales, concessions and parking, to figure its city rent.
Parks Department figures show the cable portion of the Mets' and Yankees' rent payments were identical in 1994, 1995 and 1996, even though the Yankees' deal is about four times larger.
The Yankees' lease, in particular, nettles city auditors. Each year, the Yankees submit maintenance bills, which the Comptroller's Office routinely pares by several hundred thousand dollars. Some of those audits have dragged on for years.
Although the city does not maintain the tennis center, it invested $11 million to improve ramps and roads that lead to the renovated facility.
"For that, we're getting an $8 million community payment from the U.S.T.A. and access to 40-plus courts in the rest of the year," Mr. Hevesi said.
Mr. Hevesi's office calculated that the Open's direct economic impact on the city this year -- including tickets, concessions, television rights, sponsorships, hotel, retail and restaurant spending -- will be $161.3 million, slightly less than the $166 million projected for the Yankees.
Another aspect of the tennis association's deal with the city was how it financed the tennis center.
The city issued $150 million in tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds, at a rate the tennis association could not get on its own. But the city is protected from making any debt payments, which the tennis association must pay.
Mr. Hevesi said it was "not too likely" that the Yankees and Mets, which are both seeking new ball parks, would pay for their stadiums without city and state financial aid. "That would be an ideal world," he said.
So, the city will incur no debt from the tennis center, unlike the 1974-75 renovation of Yankee Stadium, for which the city must pay $1.1 million each year through 2004. No debt remains to be paid on Shea Stadium.

HEADLINE: Trying to Make Labor Work;
Can New Secretary Revive a Beleaguered Department?

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Once the teamsters strike at United Parcel Service of America was settled last week, it was hard to find Alexis M. Herman. After the initial round of triumphant news conferences on the night of Aug. 18, Ms. Herman, the new Labor Secretary who played a widely praised role in keeping the talks going when both sides seemed ready to quit, just wanted to go on vacation.
She agreed only reluctantly to her public relations chief's pleas to appear on television interview programs the morning after the settlement. She then virtually disappeared for two days last week to relax with friends and family in her hometown of Mobile, Ala., seldom checking in with her staff in Washington. 
 But even as Ms. Herman has refused to preen in the afterglow of the strike, her newfound celebrity is providing her an opportunity to advance a more progressive agenda affecting business and workers that as in the case of the Labor Department itself has languished for years in Washington's liberal backwaters. The question is whether Ms. Herman can build on her enhanced visibility and stature or whether the settlement will turn out to be the high-water mark of her career.
So what does Ms. Herman want to do with her hard-won credibility?
"I hope it will help spotlight the issues that we care about -- whether it is lifelong learning or the challenge of moving people from welfare to work or retirement security for young women and girls," the earnest Ms. Herman said in a telephone interview.
She noted how the dispute between the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the company over investing U.P.S. pension funds opened a window on a wider debate. "I hope these things will get more attention because of this," she added. "Look at the attention pensions got during the strike."
But turning those lofty goals into actual accomplishments will not be easy. Ms. Herman, 50, hopes to complete the consolidation of dozens of Government worker training programs into a single system that provides vouchers that workers can use to create an individualized job education plan. She also wants to pass legislation that would simplify the creation of retirement plans for small business. And her agency is studying major new workplace safety regulations that are bound to produce conflicts between business and labor.
Whether or not Ms. Herman can turn her momentary advantage into long-term policy gains, it has been a remarkable turnaround for a woman who just a few weeks ago was engaged in an uphill battle simply to win confirmation as Labor Secretary. She was repeatedly dogged by questions about her past business associations and her political fund-raising activities in the White House.
Today, however, she is a virtual candidate for canonization, gracing the front pages of the nation's big newspapers and managing to place herself at the center of the issue of the long-term erosion of the wages and security of average American workers in a city with a notoriously short attention span.
It is far from certain that Ms. Herman's intervention in the U.P.S. battle was decisive. Forces larger than the Labor Department and the White House were driving the two sides to find a quick resolution to their costly dispute, which could have done far more damage if it had lasted much beyond its 15 days.
But, as President Lyndon B. Johnson used to say, "If they're going to blame me for the rain, I'm sure as hell going to take credit for the sunshine."
President Clinton nominated Ms. Herman, a longtime Democratic activist, to the Labor post last December. But she quickly became embroiled in the campaign finance scandal because of her contacts with donors as head of the White House's Office of Public Liaison during Mr. Clinton's first term.
Her private business dealings in the 1980's as a consultant to corporations on affirmative action, also raised questions about what some in Congress characterized as sweetheart investment deals that she may have gotten because of her political connections.
But after months of inconclusive investigation, Ms. Herman was confirmed by the Senate on April 29 and sworn in 10 days later.
Her first weeks in office were relatively quiet, as she recovered from the bruises of the confirmation fight and learned her way around the Labor Department, where she last worked in the Carter Administration as head of the Women's Bureau.
Then came the U.P.S. strike and the significant increase in Ms. Herman's public profile.
The coincidence of forces that has brought Ms. Herman to prominence this month provides her with a belated opportunity to advance the Administration's labor agenda, which has met much resistance in the Republican Congress and the business community.
Ms. Herman is crossing the country this week to highlight her priorities. She is on a five-city tour with each stop designed to showcase one of her chief agenda items.
Today she is in Seattle to speak with former welfare recipients who now have jobs about the Administration's welfare-to-work initiative.
On Tuesday, she is scheduled to tour the El Paso Job Corps program to talk about retraining workers for jobs in the information economy. On Wednesday, she is to address the problems of balancing work and family life at Honeywell Inc. in Minneapolis.
On Thursday, it is supposed to be Nashville and a meeting with workers, employers and a Girl Scout troop to talk about pension security and the importance of early retirement planning.
And she is to close the blurry week with a visit to a mine near Morgantown, W. Va., where the Labor Secretary will talk about workers' health and safety.
The priorities are little changed from President Clinton's first term. While they seem on the surface to stir only marginal controversy, former Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said he was stymied in trying to advance his ambitious agenda, particularly after the Republicans won control of Congress in 1994.
"I'm proud of what we accomplished, but there's obviously much more to be done," Mr. Reich said. "We had some advantages in 1993 that are not present today. It was relatively easy to get the school-to-work apprenticeship law enacted, as well as the first round of pension reform."
But American workers will need considerably more help in adapting to the new economy, Mr. Reich said. Persuading Congress or corporations to finance training programs will be one of the most important tasks Ms. Herman faces.
"The budget is far more constrained, the Republican dominance is more entrenched," Mr. Reich said. "On the other hand, the unions are more aggressive and possibly more popular, if the U.P.S. strike is any indication."
Mr. Reich's recent book "Locked in the Cabinet" was challenged by several critics as failing to accurately reconstruct events he witnessed. But there is little question that it captured Mr. Reich's own frustrations in dealing with Congress, the bureaucracy and even with his close friend, the President. "Alexis is perfectly positioned," he acknowledged, with some envy, "to achieve some important accomplishments."
Still, Ms. Herman could end up just as frustrated as Mr. Reich was. Among the Labor Department initiatives that Ms. Herman hopes will survive the Washington buzz saw is a new Occupational Health and Safety Administration standard on repetitive stress injuries, a rapidly growing form of workplace disability arising from computer keyboarding, lifting heavy packages and other repeated actions.
OSHA is also developing new rules on indoor air quality, including protection from secondhand smoke, that business interests complain would add to their costs. The agency has already received 115,000 public comments on the air-quality proposal, thousands more than it has ever received on a potential regulation.
Jeffrey H. Joseph, vice president for domestic policy at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said that Ms. Herman's current glow was not going to change the lineup of forces in the age-old war between business and Government.
"No matter who's there," Mr. Joseph said, "the bureaucracy carries on."
He said that Ms. Herman ingratiated herself with the teamsters and other unions by helping to settle the U.P.S. dispute in terms generally seen as favorable to the union.
"But having said that, the Department of Labor is not the department of organized labor," Mr. Joseph said. "The Secretary shouldn't be that close to unions. Remember, 90 percent of American workers don't belong to unions, and that number is rising." (Over all, about 15 percent of American workers are union members; roughly 10 percent of workers in the private sector belong to labor unions.)
Paradoxically, Ms. Herman is accused of trying to ingratiate herself with organized labor even though the A.F.L.-C.I.O. originally opposed her nomination to head the department because she was seen as insufficiently grounded in union politics and policies.
Ms. Herman's own business background and her close relationships with corporate executives and political donors at the White House also caused labor to look on her with some suspicion.
But she appears to have redeemed herself with union leaders through her forceful role in the U.P.S. strike.
Richard L. Trumka, secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the former head of the United Mine Workers, noted that unions originally supported former Senator Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania for the Labor Department job. He said that many in the labor movement were skeptical that Ms. Herman could be an effective advocate for their issues.
"Absolutely, she helped herself," Mr. Trumka said. "She showed tremendous skill and a commitment to the institution of collective bargaining. That has to make her job of helping workers a little easier."
The Labor Secretary traditionally delivers a broad-gauged assessment of the state of the American work force on Labor Day, often at a big union-sponsored event in a traditional labor bastion like Boston, New York or Detroit.
Ms. Herman chose Washington's National Cathedral as the site for her coming Labor Day speech, in a reflection of her religious upbringing and as a way to emphasize the sanctity of work, she said.
She will speak from the pulpit of the Gothic-style structure next Sunday.
"I will speak about the moral value of work, first of all," Ms. Herman said. "I was raised to believe that next to family and faith, the most important thing in our lives is the work that we do."
She added, as an aside, that she had been around Washington too long to expect the current adulation to last.
"I can only say I'm going to stay firmly focused on the future," she said. "I'm going to treat every day in this job as if it were my first day."

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
THEY tell a story in Bordeaux about Jean de Rauzan, an 18th-century owner of what is now Chateau Rauzan-Segla in Margaux, France. At some point the Marquis de Rauzan became convinced that the Bordeaux shippers were underpaying him for his wine. So he chartered a vessel, filled it with his best vintages and crossed the English Channel to London to sell directly from the ship.
Finding no takers, he announced he would toss his wine into the Thames until buyers stepped forward. He dumped a cask over the side; then another, then two more. Finally, unable to bear the waste of good wine, the crowd began to buy and, it is reported, at the Marquis's price. Over the next two centuries that sort of initiative was rare at Rauzan, although Thomas Jefferson was impressed enough during his 1787 visit to order 10 dozen bottles. 
 Most wine fans are aware that winemakers, including the great chateaus of Bordeaux, are vulnerable to weather and economic crises. But the chateaus are also hostages to the vagaries of successive owners. There is no better example of this than Rauzan-Segla. The modern renaissance of Rauzan began just two years ago, when the chateau was purchased by the Wertheimer Group, best known as the owners of Chanel, the fashion and perfume house in Paris.
At one point, it appeared that the Wertheimers were front runners in the bidding for Chateau Latour in Pauillac, one of the five first growths, which had been in British hands since 1962. But at the last moment, in June 1993, Latour went to Francois Pinault, a French industrialist, for about $130 million.
Apparently determined to buy a Bordeaux chateau, the Wertheimers -- Alain, who lives in New York; Gerard, his brother in Geneva, and Charles Heilbronn, their half-brother, also of New York -- turned to Rauzan-Segla. They bought it, almost a year later, for somewhere between $28 million and $50 million, depending on the source of the information. The sale price was not made public. Rauzan-Segla had been for sale for years, following the financial collapse of its owner, George Walker, a British investor, who bought the estate in 1988.
One of the Wertheimers' first moves was to hire David Orr as chairman of Rauzan-Segla and John Kolasa as director. Both had held similar posts at Latour and had been replaced by Mr. Pinault. Their next step was to change the spelling back. It had become at some point Rausan-Segla. When Jefferson bought the wine he called it, simply Rozan. The chateau was then owned by a Madame de Rauzan, who occasionally spelled her name Rozan.
Around the French Revolution, the estate was divided in two, when a Mlle. de Rauzan, probably a daughter of Madame Rauzan -- or Rozan -- married Pierre Louis de Segla. Another daughter married a certain Seigneur de Gassies, and their portion of the estate became Chateau Rauzan-Gassies. When the "s" appeared is unclear, but it will live on if only in the inscription over the stone archway leading to the chateau.
In the famous Bordeaux classification of 1855, Rauzan-Segla was placed just below Chateau Mouton-Rothschild, which had been designated the best of the second growths. When Mouton-Rothschild was elevated to first-growth status in 1973, the only time the classification has ever been changed, Rauzan-Segla became the first of the seconds.
The Cruse family, once-powerful Bordeaux wine shippers, owned the property from 1903 to 1956 and erected the present chateau on the foundations of two previous buildings. Over the years, a few improvements were made to the cellars and vineyards, but through most of the 20th century, Rauzan-Segla rarely lived up to its 1855 ranking. Managed for a time by Echenhauer, another Bordeaux shipper, the chateau turned out good wines in 1986 and 1988.
The rise of the so-called "super seconds" in the 1980's, chateaus like Leoville-las-Cases, Pichon Lalande and Cos d'Estournel, bypassed Rauzan-Segla, where grapes were crushed by foot and the bottling line was outside the cellar, subject to the unpredictable Bordeaux weather.
Under the Wertheimers, the vineyards have been replanted; drainage has been improved; a new press, fermentation tanks and storage cellar have been installed, and the first- and second-year aging cellars, where the wine is kept in barrels until ready for bottling, have been rebuilt. The results of this effort have shown up in the wines. Critics' ratings of the three vintages since the Wertheimer takeover -- 1994, 1995 and 1996 -- have been uniformly high.
The impact of new plantings is well in the future, but the first of the new-owner vintages have profited from rigorous selection. In previous vintages at Rauzan-Segla just about all the wine from each harvest was bottled under the chateau's label. The procedure since the chateau changed hands has been to use only the top 45 percent of the harvest for the first wine and the second 45 percent for Segla, which is the chateau's second label. The lowest 10 percent is sold off for inexpensive blends. Only financially strong properties can afford this kind of selection.
Of Rauzan-Segla's 163 acres, about 120 are planted with vines. The mix is about 65 percent cabernet sauvignon, 30 percent merlot and 5 percent cabernet franc. Having been the 19th-century equivalent of a super second, Rauzan-Segla would like to be one again. There is more at stake here than prestige. The super seconds like Pichon Lalande and Ducru-Beaucaillou can command prices as much as 20 percent higher than their less honored second-growth colleagues. There is no reason to believe that it won't happen at Rauzan-Segla with a little patience and the Wertheimers' money.
The old Marquis de Rauzan would be happy about that.

TASTINGS
Pine Ridge Winery Cabernet Sauvignon, Rutherford, Calif., 1994. About $22.
 
Pine Ridge is a member of that distinguished small group of wineries that call the Stag's Leap section of the Napa Valley home. But this cabernet, which includes 11 percent cabernet franc and 6 percent merlot, comes from Pine Ridge vineyards a little farther west in the equally famous Rutherford Bench part of the valley. Pressed, I would say that Rutherford is the St. Julien of the valley, and Stag's Leap is the Pauillac. But that can change from winery to winery and from year to year. This 1994 is a beautifully structured wine with a nice touch of wood in the nose and the taste. It spent at least 16 months in French oak and is very drinkable now. And yes, it will almost certainly age elegantly.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW;
Mobsters and Grand Opera (Sound Familiar?)

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
Try as he might to be a likable heroic type, Laurence Fishburne has always conveyed the icy gloom of a man who has gazed into the abyss and come away with a withering sense of disgust. Mr. Fishburne's cold, lidless stare and the hard curl of his lips suggest that while contemplating the void, he whiffed a stench so foul it left him permanently on the brink of nausea.
In "Hoodlum," Bill Duke's hugely ambitious but unsatisfying gangster film about organized crime in Harlem in the 1930's, Mr. Fishburne has a role that suits his aura of implacable pessimism. As Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson, an ex-convict who takes over the Harlem numbers racket and fiercely defends his turf against a rival mobster, Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth), Mr. Fishburne is as coolly ruthless as Al Pacino's Michael Corleone in "The Godfather." 
 The comparison is not frivolous. With a running time of nearly two and a half hours and a sprawling cast of characters, "Hoodlum" aspires to be an urban American epic on the order of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. Its vision of crime and upward social mobility is similar, as is its portrayal of government officials on the take and loyal mob lieutenants sacrificed along the way. As in "The Godfather Part III," the bloodiest shootout is staged with a grand operatic flourish (to the strains of an aria from "Tosca," no less).
But "Hoodlum" fails to evoke the tragic realism that gave the first two installments of "The Godfather" the force of social history writ in stone. Though set in New York City, it was filmed in Chicago, and you feel the discrepancy. Several key performances are also shaky. And while Mr. Duke's direction has visual panache, the movie is unevenly paced. Chris Brancato's pulpy, melodramatic screenplay laboriously underlines each dramatic turning point.
"Hoodlum" begins as Johnson is released from Sing Sing and returns to Harlem, where he becomes an assistant and bodyguard to Stephanie St. Clair (Cicely Tyson), the elegant French-speaking queen of the numbers racket. Her business is so lucrative that Dutch Schultz, a ruthless mobster and beer baron who operates under the watchful eye of the Mafia superboss, Lucky Luciano (Andy Garcia), decides to move in on her territory.
When Schultz connives with Thomas E. Dewey (William Atherton), New York City's special prosecutor against organized crime, to have her arrested and jailed, Johnson takes charge of her business, It isn't long before he is butting heads with Schultz and winning most of the skirmishes. "Hoodlum" portrays Johnson as much the lesser of two evils. Where Schultz is a psychopath who relishes humiliating his black underlings with racist epithets, Johnson sees himself as a Robin Hood protecting an enterprise that despite its illegality is a crucial economic mainstay for Depression-era Harlem.
His intentions seem honorable enough for him to be able to persuade Francine Hughes (Vanessa Williams), a beautiful, pious charity worker, to marry him. The marriage closely parallels that of Michael and Kay Corleone, as the body count of Johnson's enemies steadily rises and Francine becomes increasingly horrified by her husband's profession.
The scenes of Johnson's courtship and marriage are awkwardly shoehorned into the narrative, and Ms. Williams gives a characteristically flat, passionless performance as a wife who eventually flees a marriage that has brought her piles of jewelry. Mr. Garcia's Lucky Luciano is another weak link. The actor is too relaxed and jocular to convey the kingly pride or the tension and insecurity of being an underworld monarch. And Mr. Atherton as the corrupt special prosecutor gives one of his typically over-the-top, snake-hissing performances.
But Mr. Roth's Schultz is a compelling enigma. Wearing a fatuous half-smile and gazing through blank, hooded eyes, the actor plays Schultz as a sadistic, poker-faced madman who remains unreadable until the second he reacts, which is usually with a grinning spasm of violence. In the film's most gruesome moment, Schultz arrives at a meeting and casually deposits the severed testicles of a slain enemy on the table.
Ms. Tyson is also memorable as the self-appointed (and self-deluded) crime queen, whose fondness for tossing off French phrases and attending the opera are played as pretentious affectations. Chi McBride and Clarence Williams 3d are effective in their roles of loyal lieutenants (on opposite sides of a war), each of whom grows to loathe his boss.
As Mr. Fishburne stalks grimly through the film, you feel his character's cynicism and disbelief more palpably than any noble intentions. With Michael Corleone, at least you felt a moral choice was being made and saw its chilling consequences. When at the beginning of "Hoodlum" a prison warden releasing Johnson from Sing Sing asks him if he has read the Bible, Mr. Fishburne mutters bitterly, "It's a good book." You know he's already chosen the wrong path.
 "Hoodlum" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of extreme violence and gore and one of torture.

Treasury Prices Edge Up, Ending Four-Session Slump

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended slightly higher yesterday, recovering from early weakness as an auction of new two-year notes was well received. But trading was thin again yesterday, exaggerating the price movements.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 8/32, to 96 17/32, ending a four-session slump. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.64 percent, from 6.66 percent on Monday. 
 Yesterday's gains came despite strong economic reports. While the Commerce Department reported yesterday that orders for durable goods fell six-tenths of 1 percent in July, orders actually rose three-tenths of 1 percent when excluding transportation goods.
Other reports also showed signs of economic strength. Existing-home sales rose 2.2 percent in July, to an annual rate of 4.24 million units, pointing to continued robust demand in housing. And the Conference Board's consumer confidence index jumped to 129.1 in August from 126.3 in July, a demonstration of buoyant consumer mood and outlook.
The signs of strength provoked some hesitation at first in the bond market, as investors worried that such strength could herald a pickup in inflation and a response from the Federal Reserve. But analysts saw little in the data to change their view that inflation remained contained.
"The economy continues to advance at a healthy clip with few signs of sustainable inflationary pressures," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst with Chase Asset Management. "Durable goods appear to be on a moderate, sustainable upward path, a clear indication of the economy's forward momentum."
The next significant economic report, Mr. Fine said, will be the revised gross domestic product report for the second quarter, which is due out tomorrow.
"The Fed appear to be in no rush to move to a less accommodative monetary policy stance, although it is clearly remaining vigilant by maintaining a bias toward tightening," Mr. Fine said. "But the bond market recently has been slowly inching from a neutral Fed stance to one that encompasses the possibility that the next Fed move could well be a tightening."
In other words, the market is pricing in a rate increase by the Fed.
With the Treasury selling $15.5 billion of new two-year notes at auction yesterday, the market was vulnerable to supply pressures as dealers positioned themselves ahead of the auction. Dealers often cause rates to rise ahead of an auction to make the issue more attractive to investors and insure its quick distribution.
But Treasury securities edged higher into the afternoon after the two-year note auction, which saw the new issue awarded at the high yield of 5.998 percent.
Today, the Treasury will auction $11.5 billion of new five-year notes. Ahead of the auction, dealers were offering the new notes at a price to yield 6.23 percent, which is the yield traders expect will be awarded at auction.
Short-covering by investors betting against the market also helped sustain the gains. Short-covering rallies occur when when some market participants sell borrowed securities, hoping to buy them back later at lower prices, thereby pocketing the difference. But if prices begin to rise instead of fall, these participants have to buy back securities to limit their losses.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new two-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Price . . . 99.772
High Yield . . . 5.998%
Low Yield . . . 5.940%

Dollar Declines Against Mark On Concerns on Rising Rates

BYLINE: By Bridge News 

 BODY:
The dollar plummeted to a five-week low against the mark yesterday because of continued concerns that the German central bank will raise interest rates soon despite opting not to do so yesterday.
The dollar weakened against the yen because of concerns about increased trade tension as a key United States trade official visits Japan. 
 The dollar initially rose after the German central bank, the Bundesbank, said that it would keep the securities repurchase rate at 3 percent, but soon reversed course with currency traders selling in waves. Higher interest rates typically lift a nation's currency because a rise in rates increases the value of some assets in that country. Investors were concerned that even though the Bundesbank left rates steady, it might raise them soon because of a report yesterday that German inflation was running at a higher-than-expected rate.
"The market had generally expected a relief rally after the Bundesbank announcement, but players took it as an opportunity to sell," said John Rothfield, an international economist at Nationsbanc-CRT.
The dollar was quoted in late New York trading at 1.7953 marks, down from 1.8205 late Monday. It was the lowest level since July 21 and left the dollar down 5 percent from a nearly eight-year high of 1.8832 on Aug. 5. The dollar settled at 118.18 yen in New York, down from 118.79.
The dollar weakened against the yen on concerns that trade friction between the United States and Japan, driven by Japan's rising trade surplus, could flare anew. That belief was fanned by news that Wendy Cutler, the assistant United States trade representative, was in Japan for talks. Ms. Cutler said she would discuss "the entire range of our trade agenda" with the Japanese, though she declined to comment on whether she would express disappointment with attempts by Japan to deregulate its auto parts market, an area of particular disagreement.
Increasing trade tensions with Japan typically cause currency traders to sell the dollar against the yen because they believe that the United States may alter its policy of supporting a strong dollar if Japan continues to run a large trade surplus with the United States.

HEADLINE: Janet Good, 73; Advocated the Right to Die

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

 BODY:
Janet Good, a longtime civil rights worker who cooperated with Dr. Jack Kevorkian to help terminally ill people die, ended her own life yesterday in her home in suburban Detroit. She was 73.
Mrs. Good had suffered from pancreatic cancer and said she hoped not to die as her mother had, slowly and in great pain. As it was, Mrs. Good confounded her doctors, who had expected her illness to take her life by early 1996. 
 "My time, obviously, is not quite here," she said in an interview late last year. Yesterday, she decided it was, said a person familiar with her decision and who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
At a news conference in Southfield, Mich., Dr. Kevorkian's lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger, asked the authorities not to pry into the circumstances of Mrs. Good's death.
And while Mr. Fieger declined to confirm that Dr. Kevorkian was present when she died, he said, "Janet Good is no more the victim of a homicide than anyone else who has died in association and in the presence of Dr. Kevorkian."
In recent years, Dr. Kevorkian has become well known for assisting in dozens of suicides. He has been tried but acquitted several times, and Mrs. Good became his top assistant, helping him screen those seeking help to die and consoling their survivors.
She said she was proud to have been indicted in late 1996 on charges of assisting in a suicide. "I was almost offended when I wasn't charged last time," she said. The indictment was later dropped because of her deteriorating health.
Dr. Kevorkian's name was hardly known in 1989, when Mrs. Good started the right to die movement in Michigan by founding a chapter of the Hemlock Society in her living room. The chapter now has several hundred members.
In June 1990, Dr. Kevorkian asked her if he could use her house for the very first assisted suicide.
Although she agreed at first, she later declined after conferring with her husband, Ray, a retired Detroit police commander who thought the deed might be illegal.
"The doctor called me every name in the book," Mrs. Good recalled later.
But they mended their differences, and in May 1996, after her husband had changed his mind, she allowed Dr. Kevorkian to use her home to help end a life.
After her own illness was diagnosed, she said her belief in a right to die had come naturally, in part because of her mother's suffering. "I have worked for civil rights and women's rights and human rights for many years, and this seemed to me just another right we should have," she said.
A native of Detroit, Mrs. Good worked for the State of Michigan, processing unemployment claims.
In the 1970's, she led a successful drive to make sexual harassment illegal in the state, a triumph that won her election to the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.
She was also honored by the Log Cabin Society, a gay Republican group, for consoling AIDS patients and their families.
Survivors include her husband of 55 years; a son, Michael, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a daughter, Marjorie Helmling, and a sister, Margaret Moran, both of Detroit; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. Her oldest daughter, Donna Ungar, died in 1995.

HEADLINE: Show Them The Money;
New York's Financial District Is a Must-See Tourist Destination

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
Wall Street is booming, and tourists are flocking to New York in record numbers. Until recently, one apparently had nothing to do with the other.
Yet lower Manhattan is now swarming with camera-carrying tourists, whose brightly colored T-shirts and shorts contrast vividly with the suits and stripes that otherwise abound downtown. That is because increasingly, these tourists are in town to visit the financial district. 
 They are making reservations weeks in advance to see the $140 billion in gold ingots stacked in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's vault, posing for pictures in front of the big bronze bull on Broadway and lining up weekdays as early as 8 A.M. to snag one of the 3,000 tickets given away to see the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
To meet the rising demand, the Federal Reserve opened a $750,000 visitors' gallery last month. The New York Exchange is finishing a $2 million remodeling of its decades-old tourist center and has extended its hours so that 700,000 people a year can pass through. The American Stock Exchange, which sacrificed its visitors' mezzanine years ago to make way for a new trading floor, is studying ways to build a new one. Even the obscure New York Mercantile Exchange spent $1 million for an exhibit hall and two public viewing galleries at its new waterside headquarters in Battery Park City.
At the Museum of American Financial History, a small, 10-year-old institution whose exhibits run to 200-year-old bonds and 19th-century stock certificates, a surge in attendance led to a move in April from the space around back where it had paid no rent to the front of the old Standard Oil Building at 26 Broadway.
And Heritage Trails New York, a nonprofit group that gives walking tours of lower Manhattan historic sites, added a weekly World of Finance tour this summer and quickly sold out through Labor Day. The tour, on Wednesday mornings, has been extended indefinitely, said Alexia Lalli, the executive director. It includes a stop outside Delmonico's, which the guide describes as the 19th-century birthplace of the power lunch.
Recently, Mike and Jane Strojny, accountants and financial planners from Biloxi, Miss., devoted a full day to their pilgrimage, stopping at the New York Exchange with their daughter, Jennifer, after seeing the gold vault beneath the Federal Reserve. Mr. Strojny said that staring down at the trading floor was as exciting as going to the Statue of Liberty.
"It actually is a place," Ms. Strojny marveled after watching the tumult. "It's not telephoned in, it's not computered in. It's sort of like watching history happen."
The financial institutions say they are getting into the tourism business not to make money but to burnish their image. "The merchandise we sell is there because people want something to take home," said Robert Zito, a spokesman for the New York Exchange, which has a gift shop that sells everything from women's scarves with the exchange's logo to bull-and-bear paperweights. "It's not a profit center by any means."
Tourism and financial officials tick off several explanations for the bull market in bull-market tourism, including the heightened attention the media pays to the Dow Jones industrial average and the popularity of the Stock Market Game, a nationwide stock-picking simulation in which 650,000 schoolchildren now participate. But basically, they say, it derives from the same phenomenon driving the expansion of the stock market itself: the tens of millions of Americans who have recently begun investing through mutual funds or through Individual Retirement Accounts, pensions and 401(k) plans.
"With the market going as well as it has, and people in the 90's putting their money in a lot of different financial vehicles, they're coming to New York and going downtown to see either where their money is going or where it's coming from," said Stephen J. Morello, president of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau. He added that the trend was particularly interesting because none of the financial institutions has done much promotion at all.
On the blocklong line outside the New York Exchange the other day Sam Harold, 12, a sixth grader from San Pablo, Calif., said he was in New York to check on his first investment. He bought shares in Hasbro, the toy maker, six months ago, he said, and when he flew to New Jersey to visit his grandmother he asked her to take him to New York so he could watch his money at work.
"I just want to see it, to see the stuff that happens on the floor," he said.
Behind Sam and his grandmother were Jake and Jeanne Rosen, evangelical ministers from Creve Coeur, Mo., with their children, Aliza, 11, and Josiah, 13. The Rosens have invested in a college fund for their children, but it was at Josiah's urging that they were visiting the market. "I want to be a stockbroker," he said. "I think it'd be fun."
If authenticity is what tourists want, the new attractions downtown may be lacking, or at least one-sided. Nowhere in the New York Stock Exchange's visitor center, for example, does the word "crash" appear. The terms "robber baron" and "monopoly" are used only in passing at the Financial History Museum's exhibit on the financing of the nation's railroad empires. And the Federal Reserve's exhibits, which portray inflation as a flame-breathing dragon, tend to provide only one answer for every economic quandary: Tighten monetary policy.
Yet reality does present itself, in the form of the gravel-voiced floor traders sucking on cigarettes on the sidewalk next to the line of visitors, and the middle-aged man on the Mercantile Exchange floor who "busted out" as a speculator, according to the guide, and now looks dejected in his lowly role as a clerk.
Young Sam Harold, emerging from the New York Exchange on a day when the Dow average dropped, conceded that his shares of Hasbro had dipped a dollar since he bought them.
But the 12-year-old said he planned to be a long-term investor, so he couldn't worry too much. Besides, he was having too much fun.

HEADLINE: Chicago Hails District As Symbol of Gay Life

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Whether their families came to America buoyed by hopes or bound by shackles, chasing a fortune or a factory job, or just searching for a place to worship in peace, Chicagoans remember their roots. And they stick together.
While not as ethnically segregated as it was even a decade ago, Chicago is still a big city of many little nations. A drive along Halsted Street, for example, seems like a leap across continents: the maps of Ireland on the faces in Canaryville, the joyous sounds of Mexico on the sidewalks of Pilsen, the grit and fire of the spirit of Africa in the churches and dance halls of Englewood. 
 Cultural identity is considered such a treasure in Chicago, in fact, that city planners in recent years have used ethnic pride as a key element in a billion-dollar project to beautify and revitalize old neighborhoods, posting signs and banners to proclaim local heritage in such places as Greektown and Chinatown.
The latest neighborhood to be celebrated, a vibrant commercial strip along North Halsted Street, will have its own special symbol: towers ringed with the universal colors of the gay pride rainbow.
Civic recognition of a largely homosexual neighborhood, coming in a tradition-minded place like Chicago, a city that customarily reflects a more conservative, Midwestern view on social mores, is a profound example of the growing acknowledgment of gay life as part of the American cultural fabric.
"This is a first in the country," said Mark Johnson, a spokesman for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington, saying that no other city had formally promoted a neighborhood for its homosexual culture.
The move follows the passage of a domestic-partner law in Chicago earlier this year, endorsed by Mayor Richard M. Daley, which extended certain benefits to the same-sex companions of city workers.
"You would expect this in San Francisco or New York, but not Chicago," said Mary Lake, a 40-year-old lesbian who manages the Brown Elephant, a nonprofit secondhand store on North Halsted. "What this says is just wonderful. It is a recognition that we, as gays and lesbians, are a culture, a culture that has something to celebrate."
Less than 20 years ago, Chicago police officers were raiding bars frequented by homosexuals, and sometimes beating gay men. And the old Democratic machine, controlled by the legendary Richard J. Daley, was known to conduct whispering campaigns about the rumored homosexuality of political foes.
These days, under the leadership of Mr. Daley's son, the Democratic Party in Chicago routinely endorses political candidates who are openly homosexual. Larry McKeon, the Mayor's former adviser on homosexual issues, was elected to the Illinois Legislature last year with the backing of the Democratic Party.
"The gay issue represents the most striking difference between old Mayor Daley and his son," said Don Rose, a campaign manager who has worked for many liberal Chicago political candidates.
Not only does Mayor Daley have an adviser on matters of concern to homosexuals, a post currently held by Mary Morten; the Police Department, too, has a liaison to the gay community, Lori Cooper, a patrolwoman who is a lesbian. For all the changes, Chicago is hardly a paradise for gay people. Homosexuals are still the targets of physical attacks, and bigots still scream slurs from passing cars in gay neighborhoods.
"When I lived in Seattle, I would never think twice about holding hands with my girlfriend in public," Ms. Lake said. "In Chicago, there are only a couple of neighborhoods where you would feel comfortable doing that."
But cultural openness is making stereotypes more difficult to sustain. The television actress, Ellen Degeneres, showed millions of Americans that a lesbian could be the girl next door.
Here in Chicago, a city that lives and breathes sports, the basketball star Dennis Rodman has surely caused some second thoughts about sex roles. Big and tough, with a blue-collar persona, Mr. Rodman is just the kind of Chicago-style, toughest-cat-on-the-block dude that men here respect. But he likes to wear dresses and feather boas.
"In some of the tough Chicago neighborhoods, Dennis Rodman has done more than anyone to change the image of sexual identity," Mr. Rose said.
In the city's celebration of the North Halsted neighborhood, there is surely some measure of appreciation to the gay community for cleaning up Dodge.
"Before gays started moving in," Ms. Morten said, "this place was a dump."
Sometimes called Boys Town, the neighborhood had been at the center of homosexual life in Chicago for more than a decade, transforming a down-at-the-heels, gang-ridden place into a district so prosperous that many homosexuals can no longer afford to stay.
In the view of many gay and lesbian Chicagoans, North Halsted has become passe, just as the rainbow banners in pink, red, yellow, blue, green and violet will rise to proclaim it the epicenter of homosexual life in the city.
These days, the hottest neighborhood for gay men and women is Andersonville, farther north along Lake Michigan. Andersonville is home to one of Chicago's most cutting-edge restaurants, Tomboy.
In signs and banners along Clark Street, Andersonville promotes itself as a Swedish-American neighborhood. In truth, the vast majority of Scandinavians left before most of the hip, young crowd was born.
The movement of gay people to the Andersonville neighborhood meant one thing to Greg Marvin, 30, a real estate developer.
"When gays start moving in, buy!" said Mr. Marvin, who is heterosexual. "They keep things up. They don't make trouble. What more could you want from a neighborhood?"
Not everybody was thrilled about the city's designation of the Halsted neighborhood. Paul Caprio, the director of Family-PAC, a conservative political action committee, called the comparison of a gay neighborhood to Greektown and Chinatown "an insult to those great communities."
The Rev. Charles Lyons of Armitage Baptist Church accused the city of choosing to "wallow in the slime of moral decadence by celebrating perversity."
But in general, there was little opposition to the move to recognize the gay neighborhood. John Olson, 37, was one of the few homosexuals who expressed cynicism over the city's plan.
"It's all aimed at gay yuppies," said Mr. Olson, who wore a tattered sport coat. "What about the homeless people lying in alleys, gay and straight? This is all about money."
But judging from the views of dozens of homosexual Chicagoans, the city's celebration of a gay neighborhood was nothing short of wonderful.
Bill Amo, a 52-year-old Chicagoan, said it was heartening to see younger homosexuals coming into a world without a sense of shame and guilt.
Two decades ago and more, he noted, most bars that catered to homosexuals did not have windows, or had very small windows, because almost nobody wanted to be seen.
With a smile, he pointed to a nearby bar that had an American flag over its doorway, designed with the colors of gay pride, and great big windows.
"Nowadays, you go into a gay bar and people want to sit in front of the window," he said. "It's a great view out there."

Consumer Optimism Bolsters Growth Outlook
Reports hinted that consumer spending could remain strong for the rest of the year, driving further strong economic growth.
The Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index rose to 129.1 points this month from 126.3 in July, bouncing back near the 28-year high seen in June. Orders for durable goods eased by six-tenths of 1 percent in July, the Government said, but analysts saw underlying strength in the report. Yet another report showed that sales of existing single-family homes rose in July. [Page D2.] 

Military Contractor to Be Sold
United Defense, a maker of armored military vehicles, is changing hands; its joint-venture owners, FMC and Harsco, accepted an $850 million bid from the Carlyle Group, a leveraged-buyout firm. [D2.]
 
Much at Stake With New Chip
In a top-secret project code-named Merced, Intel and Hewlett-Packard are designing a computer chip that would mark the most significant shift in the history of the immensely popular Intel microprocessor family. Market Place. [D8.]
 
Another Decline for the Dow
Stock prices drifted lower again as blue-chip issues continued to flounder in what has become a stalled bull market. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 77.35 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 7,782.22. [D8.]
 
Treasury prices, however, ended a string of four straight declines, recovering from early weakness as an auction of new two-year notes was well received. The 30-year bond yield fell to 6.64 percent from 6.66. [D6.]
 
The dollar plummeted to a five-week low against the mark because of continued concerns that the German central bank will raise interest rates soon despite opting not to do so yesterday. [D7.]
 
Toyota Pact Lifts Republic Stock
Shares of Republic Industries surged 7.5 percent following the announcement that the company, the nation's largest car dealership owner, had reached an agreement with Toyota. Republic's shares had been in a slump since the spring, when Toyota and Honda began to battle Republic's plan to buy car dealerships nationwide. [D2.]
 
Canadian Insurers Lock Up Deal
Great-West Lifeco, Canada's largest group life and health insurer, said that it had raised its offer to buy London Insurance and that the companies had signed an agreement to prevent other bids, superseding an earlier agreement between London Insurance and the Royal Bank of Canada. [D8.]
 
Battle Over a Memoir
The publishing house of William Morrow is battling with Whitewater prosecutors over an unfinished manuscript for a memoir by the fallen Justice Department official and Clinton confidant, Webster L. Hubbell. [A1.]
 
Union Alliance Expected
The Union of American Physicians and Dentists, one of the few independent doctors' unions, plans to announce that it will join forces with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. [A18.]
 
Managing Different Risks
Richard L. Huber, the new chief executive of Aetna, is known as a wizard of the corporate comeback. But his turnaround efforts extend beyond his business life: Mr. Huber and his wife, Roberta, live in a troubled Hartford neighborhood that is miles from the lush suburbs where most of the city's business elite have settled. And he has bought almost one-fourth of the buildings on his street, in a crusade to clean things up. [A1.]
 
A Hot Tourist Tip
The stock market has been booming, and tourists are coming to New York in record numbers. Until recently, one trend apparently had nothing to do with the other. But now visitors from Main Street and elsewhere are increasingly flocking to Wall Street. [D23.]
 
Corn and Soybeans Lower
Prices for corn and soybeans fell sharply amid indications that the crops seem headed for bumper harvests. [D7.]

HEADLINE: Israeli Closing of Bethlehem Brings Tensions to a Boil

BYLINE: By JOEL GREENBERG 

DATELINE: BETHLEHEM, West Bank, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Black smoke billowed from burning tires and the crack of rubber bullets echoed through the streets of Bethlehem today as dozens of Palestinian youths hurled stones at Israeli soldiers to protest Israel's military closing of the town, which has now lasted nearly a month.
The clashes reflected rising frustration among Palestinians at Israeli sanctions imposed after the suicide bombing in Jerusalem last month. 
 As the stones and rubber bullets flew, there were fresh disputes between Israeli and Palestinian leaders over whether Yasir Arafat was doing enough to meet Israel's key demand -- that he clamp down on Islamic militants to curb their violence.
Mr. Arafat said today that he had restored security cooperation with the Israelis to an extent that could enable Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright to go ahead with a planned visit that is intended to shore up flagging peace efforts. But his assertion was immediately contested by the Israelis, who accused Mr. Arafat's Palestinian Authority of encouraging the street protests against the closing.
While the Israelis insist that the Palestinians have not done enough on security cooperation, Ms. Albright has not made complete cooperation a condition for starting her first official visit to the Middle East, and such a visit is now expected in the second week in September.
The West Bank and Gaza Strip have been closed off from Israel since the July 30 bombings in the Mahane Yehuda market in Jerusalem, which killed 14 people in addition to the two attackers. The closures have paralyzed the Palestinian economy, preventing tens of thousands of laborers from reaching jobs in Israel and causing heavy losses to Arab businesses.
Although movement between West Bank towns has been restored after initial restrictions, Bethlehem remains under an Israeli blockade, closed off by checkpoints and barriers of dirt and concrete. Israeli military officers say that the measures are part of an effort to track down militants in the area who may be linked to the Jerusalem bombings, and that vital supplies such as food and medicine are being allowed in.
But Bethlehem's Mayor, Hanna Nasser, accused the Israelis of trying to choke off tourism to the town, which is revered by Christians as the birthplace of Jesus. Mr. Nasser said the blockade had already caused losses totaling more than $12 million.
Anger over the protracted closing has boiled over into street protests that began on Saturday and continued today on the outskirts of town near an Israeli outpost at Rachel's Tomb, the traditional burial place of the wife of the biblical patriarch Jacob.
Lieut. Gen. Amnon Shahak, the Israeli Army's Chief of Staff, warned that there was increased potential for a major eruption of violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but not before Ms. Albright's visit.
"I don't think that an explosion is imminent in the next few days," General Shahak said. "I think we're all waiting for the arrival of the Secretary of State.
But undoubtedly there is tension and an accumulation of angers and pressures and a reality that can lead to an explosion."
The frustration was on display in Bethlehem today, where masked youths, some of them using slingshots to fling their stones, charged in waves at Israeli soldiers.
Standing behind coils of barbed wire, the Israelis responded with volleys of tear-gas and rubber bullets. Hospitals reported four people wounded, and a Palestinian policeman was also reported to have been hit. Dozens of schoolgirls were evacuated for treatment when soldiers aiming at stone-throwers fired tear-gas into a schoolyard.
Palestinian police officers made little effort to restrain the rioters, expressing open support for their protest.
"This is a popular response to the siege and starvation," said one officer as he looked on. "When you blow too much air into a balloon, it pops."
Mohammed Fawaghra, a restaurant worker who watched the clashes, said his establishment down the street had no customers because of the closing and the street violence. "Everything's at a standstill," he said. "There's no money, and no work. They're punishing two million people because of a bombing by two people whose identity isn't even known." Israeli officials have yet to establish who the suicide bombers were, where they were from and who sent them.
But in an appearance on Israeli television, the Israeli Cabinet secretary, Danny Naveh, accused Mr. Arafat tonight of failing to combat Palestinian militants and encouraging street riots.
"The Palestinian Authority has yet to do the main thing -- fulfill its obligation to fight the terrorist infrastructure," Mr. Naveh said.
As for the protests in Bethlehem, "it is street violence guided from above by the Palestinian Authority," Mr. Naveh asserted. "This is certainly not what one would call improved security cooperation."
Israeli and American officials have said that improved intelligence sharing by the Palestinians is a condition for further progress in political negotiations.
On a visit to Japan on Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Mr. Arafat had failed to move against Islamic militants, and that his recent public embrace with leaders of Hamas and Islamic Holy War at a gathering of Palestinian factions could be a "kiss of death" to peace efforts. In a statement issued today, Hamas said said it had rejected a call from the Palestinian Authority to suspend attacks.
At the entrance to Bethlehem this afternoon, scores of Palestinian laborers who had skirted an Israeli checkpoint to get to jobs in Jerusalem trekked back from work on dirt paths, bypassing the Israeli roadblock on the way back to town.
They were determined to earn their daily wages, risking arrest and possible beatings by Israeli border police if they were caught in Israel.
"We want to live," said one young man as he walked home.

HEADLINE: SENATE MEASURES WOULD DEAL BLOW TO INDIAN RIGHTS

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Aug. 26

 BODY:
With little debate and no public hearings, a Senate subcommittee last month approved two measures that would knock out some of the oldest principles in how the country's 554 American Indian tribes are governed and deprive them of basic operating money if they do not agree to the changes.
Little noticed in the nation's capital at the time, where they were buried as riders on a spending bill already freighted with the fate of the National Endowment for the Arts and money for new park lands, the proposed changes have caused a furor on the reservations. 
 The tribes say Congress is trying to erode their sovereignty because of a perception that Indian reservations are prospering with casino gambling, disregarding the fact that most of them remain among the poorest places in the nation.
The architect of the two riders, Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, a Republican who has had a running dispute with Indians in his home state for 25 years, says the measures are part of a campaign to force a fundamental change in Indian affairs.
"I find nothing in any Indian treaty that says they must be continuously supported by the Federal taxpayers," Mr. Gorton said in an interview. Mr. Gorton is chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies, which passed a $13 billion spending bill last month that contains the Indian riders and many provisions dear to the Clinton Administration.
Bracing for a showdown, the Clinton Administration has threatened to veto the bill if it contains the Indian measures. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt called it "one of the most radical and unjust of a stream of recent Congressional proposals" and said it would "overturn almost two centuries of jurisprudence."
One of Mr. Gorton's riders would force tribes to waive sovereign immunity from civil lawsuits or lose up to $767 million, nearly half the budget for daily operations on land that 1.4 million Indians live on or near. Under the other rider, tribes could be denied Federal money if their income was above a certain level.
Without sovereign immunity, the tribes say, they could face bankruptcy by lawsuits and would be unable to operate as governments. And subjecting them to income requirements, or what the government calls means-testing, would be singling them out, they say, because other city and state governments do not have to go through such tests for their share of Federal money.
"If Senator Gorton would ever be willing to come to a reservation, he would see very clearly that most tribal governments are barely getting by as it is," said John Blackhawk, chairman of the Winnebago tribe of Nebraska. "These two riders are outrageous. They are a total departure from the government-to-government relationship the tribes have always had with Washington."
Mr. Babbitt has said he would recommend a veto if the riders are left in the bill, but both items are entwined in a package that contains $100 million to keep the National Endowment for the Arts alive and $700 million for evironmental purchases, like a gold mine that threatens Yellowstone National Park and a huge grove of ancient redwood trees that could be logged in California.
"I'm defending them on the N.E.A. and land acquisition," Mr. Gorton said, "so it would not behoove the Administration to come after me on these issues."
The only Indian in the Senate, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Republican of Colorado, said the measures would only be passed "over my dead body."
Sovereign immunity and basic Federal operating funds are not subject to shifting political winds, Mr. Campbell wrote in a letter to Mr. Gorton, but are "a result of solemn promises made by the United States to tribal governments in exchange for Indian lands."
When the full Senate takes up the Interior spending bill next month, Mr. Gorton and his supporters are counting on the fact that 17 states have no recognized tribes within their boundaries. Also, Mr. Gorton said, it may be time to force a significant change in the longstanding status that tribes have had as nations within a nation.
"The irony is that the very concept of sovereign immunity is descended from English Common law," he said. "And it's an anachronism."
Indian governments, as well as Federal and local agencies, often invoke immunity to guarantee that projects like sewage systems or road construction go ahead without the threat of financially crushing lawsuits. Individual Indians can be sued in Federal court, but the tribes themselves are generally protected.
The tribes say they are under assault by Mr. Gorton and others in Congress because of a perception that they are getting wealthy from casino gambling, which in turn has brought some flexing of newfound political muscle.
"This is straight out an attempt to get rid of tribal governments," said John Dossett, general counsel for the National Congress of American Indians. "In order to do that, Gorton and others are playing off a perception that a whole bunch of tribes are getting rich off gaming. In fact, only a handful are making any money at it."
A report in December by the General Accounting Office found that 10 tribes took in more than 50 percent of the $1.6 billion received by Indian reservations from tribal gambling. About one-third of all American Indian tribes have gambling centers. Unemployment on the reservations is more than three times the national average, and 38 percent of all Indian households with children ages 6 to 11 are below the poverty level, more than twice the national average.
Supporters of Mr. Gorton's measures say they resent the power that Indians have over non-Indians on or near reservations. They say it is difficult for someone who is not an Indian to win redress in tribal courts.
"By being able to claim immunity from suit, tribes are not fully accountable in court for their actions like all the rest of us in America are," said Barbara Lindsey, president of a property rights group in Washington state, in a recent statement sent to Mr. Gorton. "It is simply not fair for us to be denied our constitutional due process rights while the tribes can sue us at will."
The Indians say Mr. Gorton has longstanding animosity toward the tribes that dates to his fight against Indian fishing rights in the Pacific Northwest. As Washington's attorney general in the mid-1970s, Mr. Gorton argued and lost a landmark Supreme Court case, known as the Boldt decision, in which Indians were found to have a right by treaty to take up to 50 percent of all the salmon caught in the waters of the Northwest.
"It's my opinion, shared by many of my colleagues around the country, that Slade Gorton has a vendetta against the tribes," Mr. Blackhawk said.
As Mr. Dossett put it, "Clearly, he's on the most wanted list."
In 1995, Mr. Gorton led an effort to cut $200 million from the $1.7 billion budget for Indian tribes.
"He's an Indian-fighter," said Darrell Hillaire, vice chairman of Washington's Lummi tribe. "This agenda is really just Slade Gorton's agenda. And he's counting on the ignorance of the rest of Congress to get it through."
The Lummi, a small tribe with a salmon-fishing culture, were behind the effort to win fishing rights two decades ago. They have since been singled out by a legislative rider Mr. Gorton inserted on an Interior bill several years ago that would have deprived the Lummi of 50 percent of their Federal operating money if any tribal action had an adverse affect on non-Indians.
This week, the Lummi tribe closed its casino near the Canadian border, saying it was losing too much money.
"Before, he was just going after one or two tribes, but now he's launched a broad attack on all the tribes," Mr. Dossett said. "As a result, Indians have stopped being able to accomplish anything positive in Congress and are just fighting all these defensive battles."
Asked about the tribal accusations of a personal vendetta, Mr. Gorton said he had won more cases in the Supreme Court against Indians than he had lost and did not feel a need to even the score. They are angry at him now, he said, because he is trying to break up an old system that many Indians have grown too comfortable with.
"Crying racism is the last refuge of a group of individuals who can't argue on the merits," Mr. Gorton said.
The tribes are particularly angry that on a matter that could so radically change the nature of Indian governments, there have been no hearings, no debate, no field trips to reservations.
"We see this as an abrogation of treaties," said Debra Doxtator, chairwoman of the Oneida Tribe in Wisconsin. "We gave up vast amounts of land in return for sovereignty and certain obligations by the Federal Government.
"Now they want to throw that out," she said. "It would be devastating to us. Yet, we aren't even consulted."
Mr. Gorton said he thought his riders would prevail when the full Senate takes up the spending bill. But he said that even if they did not pass he would continue to use his position as chairman of the committee that oversees spending for the tribes to overhaul Indian affairs.
"These are matters of principle for me," Mr. Gorton said. "Indians are citizens of the United States. They should be governed by laws of the United States as everyone else is."

HEADLINE: A Very Personal Investment in a Blighted Hartford Street

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Richard L. Huber, the new president and chief executive of Aetna, is a Harvard-educated multimillionaire who owns a stake in a 7,000-acre ranch in the upper Amazon, another in Paraguay, a pied-a-terre on Riverside Drive in Manhattan and a beach house in Stonington, Conn.
Mr. Huber's home, however, is a Hartford neighborhood around the corner from a methadone clinic, a couple of blocks from homeless shelters, down the street from a crime-ridden housing project and miles from the lush suburbs where most of the city's business elite have settled. 
 Imagine George M. Steinbrenner living in a restored brownstone in the South Bronx and you begin to get an idea of what Mr. Huber has done.
But Mr. Huber, 60, a corporate turnaround wizard, not only lives in this struggling neighborhood on the edge of downtown Hartford, he also has bought almost one-fourth of the buildings on his street, Charter Oak Place, and has embarked on a crusade to turn things around.
Neighbors describe Mr. Huber and his wife, Roberta, as a two-person urban renewal team. The Hubers took several rundown buildings and spruced them up. They moved out tenants who appeared to be dealing drugs and recruited new ones with solid professional and blue-collar jobs, not to mention a state trooper who parked his cruiser on the block.
Their commitment, in the minds of some Charter Oak Place residents, helped end a decline in property values that saw condominiums that had sold for as much as $160,000 in the heady 1980's bottoming out at under $40,000 a few years ago.
"If they hadn't moved here, the street would be entirely different," said Jim Wade, a consultant with the State Education Department who rents a $475 one-bedroom apartment across the street. "Whatever you think about them, they saved it."
Mr. Wade said the neighborhood even has a new name: "Huberville."
But not everyone is impressed.
"Living in the neighborhood is not good enough," said Luz Santana, a member of Vecinos Unidos (United Neighbors), a Hispanic community group. "More than him living here, we would like the resources of Aetna to be in the neighborhood. They have a lot more to offer and to give us back."
In the 1950's and 60's, the long-gone group of insurance and bank executives who helped run Hartford with a sense of noblesse oblige were known as "the bishops," and no bishop was more respected than the head of Aetna, perhaps the insurance capital's most venerable company.
But Mr. Huber disputes those who call him a bishop for the 90's.The 1990's are not the 1960's, and the company is unlikely to be the economic and civic presence that it was in the so-called golden days, he said. In those days, Aetna helped initiate projects like the Hartford Civic Center, to which it brought the Whalers, a National Hockey League team. The Whalers left town a few months ago, however.
A self-made man who has been an architect of Aetna's downsizing, Mr. Huber makes no claim of altruism or civic virtue. His reason for living where he does is strikingly personal. Having spent his adult life in some of the world's most sophisticated cities -- Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro, Chicago, Boston and New York -- he said he had no desire to live in the suburbs. Two years ago, when he was recruited to work at Aetna, he could not imagine living anywhere but downtown Hartford, even if it lacked the cosmopolitan airs of his previous homes.
"We're city folk," he said in an interview at his 125-year-old gothic Victorian home, dismissing the idea that he was using his house to make a political statement. "I don't want to overplay this, this was a personal choice. We like to live this way."
The Hubers, who have three grown sons, wanted to be able to walk to Hartford's theaters, restaurants and art museum, and Mr. Huber, who is fluent in Spanish and Portuguese, likes to hear languages other than English. The couple had not owned a car in the 18 years before they moved to Hartford, and Mr. Huber reluctantly bought a 1995 Ford Contour so he could drive to the supermarket a few miles away.
The Hubers' purchase of four properties on a street that runs one-fifth of a mile was "enlightened self-interest," he said, noting that it had never been his plan to become a landlord. Soon after moving in, he saw problems in the neighborhood that could affect his home, ranging from a social service center's plans to take over one building to late-night activity by neighbors that looked like drug dealing.
"The only way you're going to control it is if you own it," he said.
Mr. Huber brushed aside talk of crime, though he made sure the door was locked. ("My wife kills me if I don't," he said.) Only last year, a shooting took place on the corner, and when Mr. Huber moved here two years ago, nearby abandoned buildings were being used as crack dens. While crime has dropped substantially in Hartford during the last year, prostitutes could still be seen on a street corner a block away Monday night.
Mr. Huber said that friends and colleagues were nervous about going to his house when he gave his first parties. "They wondered whether they should come in armored cars," he said with a laugh, adding that they were only reassured when they left and discovered that their tires had not been slashed.
In this city of 125,000, Mr. Huber's decision to live here was seen as an important sign that, like the South Bronx, the city's worst times have passed.
In recent years, Hartford was the fastest-shrinking city in the country, losing a greater percentage of its population than any other major city, and it has repeatedly been ranked among the country's 10 poorest cities. Charter Oak Place, with its Victorian-era gothic and Queen Anne-style homes, has reflected the city's changing fortunes.
In the late 19th century, it was where the city's industrial barons lived (among Mr. Huber's properties is an old mansion owned by Richard Jordan Gatling, who invented the precursor to the machine gun). But by the 1970's the street had fallen into disrepair, its houses subdivided into apartments. With the boom of the 1980's, an effort began to return the block to its previous grandeur and turn it into a historic district, with condominiums for professionals.
The crash of Hartford's real estate market in the late 1980's cut that effort short, and when Mr. Huber came to Hartford in 1995, the street was in a precarious position. The family that had restored the Hubers' home had moved to New York and had taken it off the market after no buyers emerged.
Mr. Huber bought the five-bedroom house for $275,000, already furnished, a fraction of the initial $695,000 asking price in 1988.
The move surprised many.
Paul Shipman, an aide to Mayor Mike Peters, remarked that the city has a lot of boosters who live outside its borders. "It's great to have someone in that position of influence be a city resident," he said. "It sends a message."
A neighbor, Tracy Dalenta, a 24-year-old store manager for Casual Corner, a woman's clothing store, said she moved to Charter Oak Place a few months ago, and calmed her in-laws' concerns about crime by saying, "Don't worry, the guy who runs Aetna lives across the street."
Before going to Hartford, Mr. Huber was a top executive at Citibank, Continental Bank, Chase Manhattan and Wasserstein Perella. Many of his jobs involved overseeing operations and deals in Latin America.
He was not initially interested in working for Aetna. At the time, he said, he did not want to do any more turnaround work, he did not want to work for an insurance company and he did not want to go to an "old mill town on a river."
But upon learning more about the company, Mr. Huber changed his mind, taking the job of vice chairman. Last month he was promoted to chief executive and president. And while he has not exactly become a Hartford booster (he complains that there's no dry cleaner nearby and that it still feels like a small town), he said he has found a good wine shop nearby, and he and his wife have clearly become civic leaders.
Mr. Huber serves on the board of the Mark Twain House and Trinity College, two of the leading institutions in the redevelopment of Hartford, and Mrs. Huber is active at the Wadsworth Atheneum, the city's art museum, and the Greater Hartford Arts Council.
He is an idiosyncratic businessman who would rather go on archeological digs than play golf. He and his wife collect Latin American art from the 17th and 18th centuries.
He is on vacation this week in the remote areas of Argentina and Paraguay looking at the ruins of centuries-old Spanish missions. He does not hesitate to say what he thinks.
And while he declines to pronounce upon some grand vision for Hartford, he readily admitted that he hoped to recoup the investment he had made.
Asked whether he was gentrifying the neighborhood, he answered: "I sure hope so. No city ever came back without attracting a group of middle and upper middle class people to live in the city."

HEADLINE: Military Contractor Sold to Buyout Firm

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The FMC Corporation and the Harsco Corporation said yesterday that they had agreed to sell United Defense L.P., a joint-venture manufacturer of tanks and other armored vehicles, to the Carlyle Group, a leveraged-buyout firm, in a transaction that seems to have as much to do with politics as economics.
FMC and Harsco, which respectively own 60 percent and 40 percent of United Defense, accepted the Carlyle offer, worth $850 million, even though the companies reportedly received a higher bid worth $1 billion from the General Dynamics Corporation. 
 Analysts said FMC decided not to accept the higher bid after Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania and a member of the Judiciary Committee's antitrust, business rights and competition subcommittee, promised to examine the anticompetitive aspects of a combination of United Defense and General Dynamics.
General Dynamics management "told us their higher bid would not be accepted because FMC would not have the stomach to go through an antitrust fight," said Peter Asiritis, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston.
Pat Brozowski, an FMC spokeswoman, declined to comment on the bidding process, which began in mid-May.
Norine Lyons, a spokeswoman for General Dynamics, which also makes armored vehicles, said the company was "definitely interested" in acquiring United Defense. "We did not think there was an antitrust problem here," she said.
Senator Specter, who had not previously expressed an interest in the continuing consolidation of military industries, acknowledged in a telephone interview that the fate of 1,200 United Defense workers in York, Pa., was much on his mind.
Analysts said it was highly likely that had General Dynamics been successful in acquiring United Defense, it would have phased out the York plant and shifted production to plants in Ohio where it already builds tanks and other armored vehicles.
"With the downsizing of the defense industry and mergers of a lot of defense contractors, we need to keep as much competition out there as we can," Senator Specter said. He added, "I want to keep those jobs in York."
United Defense, which was formed in 1994 by combining FMC's military systems group with Harsco's BMY combat systems division, employs 5,700 people at 10 manufacturing and service sites in the United States and abroad. Last year, the company had sales of $1 billion.
Effectively, General Dynamics, which makes steel armored vehicles, and United Defense, whose products are manufactured principally with aluminum, have maintained a business duopoly. That condition will remain unchanged.
Still, analysts wondered what Carlyle -- which buys and sells businesses, rather than managing them -- would do with United Defense.
"Our objective is to grow the business either through internal growth or acquisitions, and then over time to exit through a private sale or potentially through a public offering," said Alan Holt, a managing director.
Carlyle, whose chairman, Frank C. Carlucci, served as Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration, is no stranger to military contracting.
The group, which is based in Washington, owns the Aerostructures Corporation, a maker of wings and tail sections for commercial and military planes that it purchased from Textron; a 51 percent interest in the Howmet Corporation, a big manufacturer of turbine-engine components for jet aircraft and gas-turbine engines, and a 30 percent stake in BDM International, a multinational information technology company that provides computer and technical services to private and Government clients, including the Defense Department.
United Defense is probably best known as the manufacturer of the United States Army's Bradley fighting vehicle and armored personnel carriers.
"United Defense has some very unique products, a strong base of contracts and a fairly solid future for those contracts," Mr. Holt said.
Mr. Aseritis said he had no problem with the price Carlyle was paying for United Defense, or with that company's business prospects. But he did have questions about Carlyle's interest in United Defense.
"They are not a strategic buyer who will integrate it with another business," he said. "They are a financial intermediary. I can't envision who they will sell this to in a year or so. Maybe they will try to resell it to General Dynamics for more than $1 billion."
If that is the case, he added, perhaps Carlyle thinks it could gain leverage in Congress for the approval of such a sale with the help of its prominent connections.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Rises As Economy Displays Vigor

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Not only does the economy keep bounding ahead this summer, new reports hint that it will not falter for the rest of the year.
The Conference Board reported today that its index of consumer confidence rose to 129.1 points this month from 126.3 in July, bouncing back near the 28-year high seen in June. And the percentage of those considering jobs plentiful, nearly 38 percent, reached a new peak. 
 "Latest readings suggest no danger that the economy will stall during the final quarter of 1997," Lynn Franco, a Conference Board official, said in a statement accompanying the report.
The Government, meanwhile, reported that orders for big-ticket items from jet engines to camcorders eased six-tenths of 1 percent in July, but analysts found that the overall decline masked some underlying strength.
Orders for the key category of nonmilitary capital goods other than aircraft surged 5.3 percent. Gary E. Schlossberg, an economist at Wells Capital Management in San Francisco, called the increase "quite strong." Capital goods are closely watched because they are needed to produce other products; an increase suggests that strong consumer demand is expected.
Such vigor, Mr. Schlossberg contended, is another factor pointing to an eventual tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. "It certainly increases the risk that the Fed will be moving toward the end of the year to push interest rates up a notch," he said.
Another set of statistics today showed that the housing market revived last month after a June lull, with sales of existing single-family homes advancing 2.2 percent, to an annual rate of 4.24 million. Strength was concentrated on the East and West Coasts, where there have been reports of bidding wars among buyers.
"Many people took advantage of low interest rates and a robust economy to make large purchases, such as a home," said Russell K. Booth, president of the National Association of Realtors, which compiles the report.
Finally, the Government's monthly report breaking down employment conditions by state and metropolitan area confirmed that labor markets are tighter than at any time since the mid-1970's. This tally showed, among other things, that 17 states -- most of them in the Midwest -- had unemployment rates below 4 percent in July, with Nebraska's 2.4 percent the lowest.
The national unemployment rate was 4.8 percent last month.
The Conference Board's report on consumer confidence, based on a sample of 5,000 households, showed that six of the nine geographic regions posted increases, with New England advancing smartly and the mid-Atlantic states, where confidence is lowest by a wide margin, eking out only a small gain. Confidence fell in the Mountain, Pacific and eastern North Central states.
The overall decline in orders for durable goods, those designed to last at least three years, followed an increase of 2.9 percent in June, which was revised from 2.3 percent. The total value of orders in July was $180.5 billion, as expected.
Orders for computers and other electronic equipment and for transportation equipment were lower last month, while industrial machinery and primary metals were higher. The weakness in commercial aircraft surprised some analysts in light of large orders announced by Boeing recently.
Still, Rosanne M. Cahn, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston, called the latest data highly favorable. "Call it more of the 'just right' economy," she said. "It's not too strong, and it's certainly not too weak."
July's home resales, the realtors' report showed, left 2.13 million on the market, a six-month supply at the latest sales pace, down from 6.8 months as recently as May.
"This is a market that is performing very efficiently but is not overheated" despite the spirited competition for some homes, said Paul Taylor, senior economist for America's Community Bankers, an industry group.
The national median price for home resales was $126,500 last month, 4.1 percent higher than in July 1996, but the Northeast lagged with a gain of just 2.1 percent compared with figures from the previous year.
The July sales gains were 8 percent in the West and 5 percent in the Northeast, with the South showing no change. Sales fell 1.8 percent in the Midwest.

HEADLINE: In South African Beer, Forget Market 'Share';
A 14-Brand Monopoly Takes 98% of Sales

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Aug. 26

 BODY:
South Africa is a capitalist country, but it sometimes doesn't act like one. Once a year, for example, an announcement is made that recalls the way Communist states once decreed increases in the price of bread or heating oil. Here, however, it is the annual change in the price of beer.
The dictum does not come from a Government ministry, but from a company, South African Breweries Ltd., that can do so without fear of contradiction because it is virtually a monopoly. It sells about 98 percent of South Africa's beer. It is not uncommon for a bartender, asked what beers he pours, to reply: "All of them." He means all 14 S.A.B. brands, from the local leaders, Castle and Lion, to the Heineken, Guinness, Amstel and Carling Black Label brands that the company brews under license. 
 Valued by the market at $10 billion, S.A.B. is the continent's largest industrial company -- in a category that excludes the huge mining houses and insurers. The company also owns more hotels and retail stores than any other enterprise and dominates the soft-drink and fruit juice market.
But what makes South African Breweries truly noteworthy is how it defies the stereotype that monopolies are sluggish and inefficient. It is considered one of the best-managed South African companies. It is certainly one of the toughest competitors.
The company's beer production costs are the world's lowest. And it keeps price increases below the inflation rate, so the real cost of a beer, before excise taxes, has been halved in 20 years.
Moreover, in a country generally slow to take to affirmative action, S.A.B. has been in the forefront of racial advancement -- though not out of a sense of charity. About 93 percent of its beer customers are black, and in the volatile early 1990's, its trucks venturing into black townships were hijacked and firebombed as a way to strike back at the white-ruled state. So S.A.B. lent dozens of its black drivers the money to buy trucks, trained them in running small businesses and hired them as contractors. The firebombing stopped. Now it has many blacks in middle management, and other companies poach its talent.
South African Breweries understands its market well. On a continent where most people survive on subsistence farming, commercial brewing is the one industrial process that is found in every country -- and survives every calamity. The Primus Beer brewery in Kisangani, Congo, kept working throughout the civil war there. The Mutzig brewery in Kigali, Rwanda, was the first industry rebuilt after the genocidal conflict there. And the Club brewery in Monrovia, Liberia, was guarded by foreign peacekeeping troops throughout Liberia's civil war.
The biggest brands of South African Breweries are pale yellow lagers, not unlike Budweiser or Miller High Life in taste, but with a relatively high 5 percent alcohol content. "Their customers like that bite in the back of the throat," one analyst said. (The taste of darker beers like Samuel Adams and Dos Equis is not particularly popular here and such beers do not play much of a role in the company's portfolio.)
A powerful brand-builder, South African Breweries is the biggest sponsor of soccer, cricket and rugby. It has also spent $15 million supporting schools and clinics. That may be relative peanuts for a company its size, but few South African corporations do anything for the poor.
Flush with cash -- it had a pretax profit of $740 million on sales of $8 billion in its latest fiscal year -- it is expanding aggressively overseas, buying breweries in Tanzania, Zambia, Botswana, Uganda, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Spain and China. It is, by volume, the world's fourth-largest brewing operation after Anheuser-Busch, Heineken and the Miller Brewing unit of the Philip Morris Companies.
In South Africa, which Pepsi-Cola has abandoned, the company bottles both Coca-Cola and Schweppes. It owns both of the top fruit juice brands, bottles spring water and owns 30 percent of the two biggest makers of wine and spirits.
It also owns 64 hotels, including the Holiday Inn and Intercontinental franchises, and 1,500 stores selling groceries, clothing, furniture and appliances, including the Edgar's, Sales House, Jet, OK Bazaars and Hyperama chains, some of the country's biggest. And it makes auto glass, matches, razors, textiles, laminate board and shoes, dominating some of those smaller industries as it does beer.
Its earnings per share have increased with almost boring regularity every year since 1967. Lacking competition, it can essentially decide how much profit to make, and in its annual report, the graphs for its beer business, 70 percent of earnings, never zigzag, but rise in a gentle, steady curve.
Being a monopoly is not exactly an embarrassment, said Graham Mackay, group managing director, but he did confirm what a bartender at the company's amusing beer history museum said: S.A.B. sometimes helps out the local breweries who share the remnants of the market.
"We certainly try not to stomp on them," said Mr. Mackay, who serves as chief executive. "We like having some competitors around -- really just for cover, if nothing else."
South Africa has virtually no antitrust laws, and the present monopoly was created by the merger of two competitors in 1979. Nonetheless, Mr. Mackay said, the company is constantly having to defend itself against "quite spurious allegations that we must have got where we are by illegitimate means." He calls the market "fully contestable," with no legal barriers to entry.
Analysts agree about the legal framework, but say big foreign brewers are simply, and probably sensibly, scared away. Against serious competitors, S.A.B. hits back hard, and it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to match its computer-controlled breweries, truck fleets and advertising.
Moreover, South Africans have high per-capita consumption and fierce, conservative brand loyalty. "In the mine hostels, where you have 10,000 men, you can't even make a tiny change on the label," said Johannes Letsapa, an owner-driver delivering beer in Soweto. "They say: 'It's different. We don't want it. Give us the old bottle.' "
Pepsi's experience, said Kerry Clarke, an analyst at Fleming Martin, a brokerage house, "was a bit of a lesson." Pepsi just walked away after an expensive attempt to get back into southern Africa. S.A.B.'s Coca-Cola division matched Pepsi's every move, increasing advertising, cutting prices and enlarging its bottles from 1 liter to 1.25.
Both Anheuser-Busch and Miller Brewing have studied the market and stayed out, said Chris Gilmour, an analyst with Smith Borkum Hare, a Merrill Lynch affiliate.
Representives of both American companies confirmed that they sell only tiny amounts of beer here, do not advertise and have no plans to expand. Budweiser and Miller can be found here, but only as novelties in yuppie pubs and liquor stores.
Twenty years ago, Mr. Gilmour said, Whitbread Breweries of Britain took S.A.B. on and "failed miserably." For example, it introduced a beer named Colt 45 after the American malt liquor. S.A.B. promptly came out with Stallion 54, confused the market and grabbed the niche.
No one has accused the company recently of any illegal competition-crushing behavior. But Michael Fridjhon, a lawyer and author of "Conspiracy of Giants," about the beer, wine and liquor industry, said the company "played it incredibly dirty" in the past. Years ago, he said, when the South African currency, the rand, was stronger, local retailers tried importing Carlsberg to sell at a lower price than local brands. Suddenly, Mr. Fridjhon said, the S.A.B. deliveries to those retailers halted as trucks "mysteriously broke down." The store owners got the message and dropped the imports, he said, though no accusations "ever got near a courthouse door."
Mr. Mackay insists such episodes never happened. "It's the kind of urban legend we hear all the time about what the mighty S.A.B. would do if crossed," he said. "It always evaporates on examination." Mindful of its delicate position, the company has a code of conduct, he said, and any depot manager behaving in such a way "would simply be fired."
The company is engaged in a nasty advertising war with next-door Namibia Breweries, which sells Windhoek lager and has a fraction of the top end of the market. Windhoek is made in compliance with 16th-century German brewing laws, using only hops, barley and water, and its makers sneer at S.A.B. for adding corn, sugar, preservatives and foam stabilizers. S.A.B. says its consumers like its beer just fine.
S.A.B. wants to build breweries in Namibia and attack Windhoek at home, but says the company has pressed the Namibian Parliament into raising taxes on imports and forbidding a foreign brewery.
In its expansion plans, South African Breweries is taking the opposite tack from American brewers. It is avoiding well-served markets in Western Europe and Japan, and concentrating on the developing world, which is full of rundown state-owned breweries for sale cheap. It is not trying to sell Castle and Lion overseas, but to buy local brands -- obscurities like Safari, Kilimanjaro, Zambesi, Vultur, Snowflake and Ursus -- make them at lower cost, sell more and collect the revenue better.
S.A.B. insists on having control, on having local partners and on including a financial institution like the World Bank -- not because it needs the financing, Mr. Mackay said, but because the bank's presence helps keep the host government honest.
The company is also working to protect its flanks at home. Robin McGregor, a critic of South African monopolies, admires the company's efficiency but says its beer could be even less expensive. "They always boast about being below the consumer price index," he said. "That's great, but they could be considerably lower."
The Competition Board, which Mr. McGregor recently joined, is about to embark on a 12-month investigation of the liquor industry, which is dominated by a few companies. "We could recommend that they be broken up, like AT&T," he said. "Or say that they mustn't do their own distribution. Or conclude that they are one of the world's most wonderful companies, and we should do nothing -- though I doubt that."
Mr. Mackay rejects the AT&T comparison, pointing out that the phone giant was a regulated monopoly. "We would resist vigorously" any attempts to break up the company, he said.
"I think the days in which that was seen, in simple-minded fashion, as the answer to any economic ills, are way past," he added, perhaps hopefully. "I don't think you'd find a broad consensus for doing that kind of thing even in the States these days."

HEADLINE: Firm Discloses Talks With the S.E.C.

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc. is talking with the Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve the agency's possible legal action over its role in the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif., in 1994.
The S.E.C. has "authorized an action" against Rauscher Pierce as well as a current and a former employee over $880 million in Orange County bond offerings, the company said in its quarterly report filed with the S.E.C. 
 The firm, a unit of Interra Financial Inc., said it was seeking a resolution before the agency files an action in the United States District Court of California.
Rauscher Pierce was among a number of securities firms that sold bonds for Orange County, which deposited the proceeds into the county's investment pool. The county declared bankruptcy in December 1994 after losses in the pool mounted when it made wrong-way bets on interest rates.
The filings were first reported today in The Wall Street Journal. The S.E.C. declined to comment.

HEADLINE: DEFECTING ENVOY FROM NORTH KOREA TO GET U.S. ASYLUM

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
The United States announced today that it would grant political asylum to North Korea's Ambassador to Egypt, his brother and their families. Officials said American intelligence agents had spirited them out of Egypt and brought them to this country over the weekend.
The Ambassador, Chang Sung Gil, is the highest-ranking North Korean to seek political asylum in the United States. While the Clinton Administration said little publicly for fear of upsetting delicate negotiations with North Korea, senior officials described the defections as an intelligence bonanza for the United States. 
 As head of the embassy in Cairo, one of the North's most important postings, Mr. Chang was familiar with his Government's dealings in the Middle East, especially its sale of missiles and other arms to Egypt, Syria and Iran, the officials said. The sales to Iran, in particular, have been of concern to the United States and allies in the region, including Israel.
The fact that Mr. Chang defected to the United States -- and not to South Korea, as others have -- means that the Central Intelligence Agency will be the first to interview him, without having to work through the filter of South Korea's intelligence services.
Mr. Chang's brother, Chang Sung Ho, also a diplomat, served most recently as the trade attache at North Korea's mission in France. The Ambassador's wife is an actress who, one official said, had close ties with the leadership in Pyongyang, including North Korea's top leader, Kim Jong Il. Officials declined to disclose her name, citing security concerns. The South Korean press identified her as Choe Hae Ok.
The State Department announced the defections one day before delegates from the United States and North Korea are to meet in New York for a third round of talks about missile proliferation.
In those talks Washington has pressed the North to accept international restraints on exporting missiles and missile technology. American officials say they expect to discover at the talks on Wednesday whether the defections will produce any diplomatic fallout.
[North Korea demanded on Wednesday that Washington hand over the Ambassador and his brother, who it said had defected to avoid punishment for embezzling public funds and leaking state secrets, Reuters reported. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the brothers had been dismissed in late July and ordered home for investigation.
["Any individual or authority that conceals or protects the criminals will be considered to have been involved in their crimes and will be made to bear due responsibility," the official Korean Central News Agency quoted the spokesman as saying in a report monitored in Tokyo.]
 Just last week the State Department announced that it had imposed new economic sanctions on North Korea for the "missile technology proliferation activities" of two companies. The two companies were accused of exporting components that could be used in missiles. The penalties are only symbolic, though, because the United States has no trade with North Korea.
The State Department's spokesman, James P. Rubin, declined to provide more than the sketchiest details of the defections and the Administration's decision to grant asylum. He would not discuss how the diplomats had left Egypt.
He did say the episode should have little effect on the missile talks in New York or on the "four party" talks that the United States, China and the two Koreas are to resume next month. Those talks are a forum for negotiating a formal peace treaty to end the Korean War.
In recent years, as North Korea's increasingly isolated Government has faced economic collapse and political uncertainty, it has suffered scores of defections to South Korea, most of them through China or other third countries.
Mr. Chang, 48, served as Ambassador in Cairo for three years. He was apparently only a month away from returning home when he appeared at the United States Embassy in Cairo on Friday seeking asylum, American officials said. He previously served in the Foreign Ministry, reaching the rank of Deputy Minister.
The officials said Mr. Chang and his brother, who left Paris with his wife and two children earlier, apparently had coordinated their defections.
The United States has not yet officially granted asylum, but rather a temporary status, known as parole, that is the first step toward asylum. The officials said the Koreans would receive full asylum as soon as necessary legal steps were taken.
The senior official said Mr. Chang might have feared punishment when he returned to Pyongyang, perhaps because he had failed to persuade Egypt to provide more emergency food aid. The Government in Pyongyang has desperately sought aid to cope with starvation brought on by the economic decay and by recent floods, followed now by a drought. In addition, South Korean reports said his son had earlier defected to the West, and presumably he would have faced punishment for that.
Mr. Chang is North Korea's first Ambassador to defect, although lower-ranking diplomats in Africa defected in 1991 and 1996.
The most senior North Korean to defect was Hwang Jang Yop, a former member of Pyongyang's ruling council and an early mentor to Kim Jong Il. He sought asylum in Beijing in February and, after a brief stop in the Philippines, arrived in South Korea in April. He defected after attending a conference in Japan, where he failed to obtain food aid.
Mr. Hwang has since warned that his country is preparing to wage war against the South, but officials in Washington have played down his comments, saying he had not been in a position of power in recent years.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up on Rate Outlook From Germany and Japan

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most leading currencies yesterday on expectations that interest rates in Germany and Japan would not rise soon.
The dollar gained against the mark after a member of the German central bank's policy-making council, Hans-Jurgen Kobnick, said there was no immediate need to raise rates. 
 The dollar increased against the yen after a top finance official in Japan expressed concern about the state of the economy there.
"There was a lot of dollar buying on the note that the Japanese economy is still weak and interest rates will stay low," said Jeffrey Yu, senior currency trader at Sanwa Bank. "And with the German economy still very sluggish, I don't think they could justify a rate rise in Germany."
Late in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 118.88 yen, up from 118.18 Tuesday. It traded at 1.8025 marks, up from 1.7953. But it eased against the British pound, which rose to $1.6148 from $1.6147.
In an interview with The Financial Times, Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs, said, "I am more concerned about the economy than I was two months ago." That contrasted with more optimistic assessments by Japanese officials earlier this year.
His remarks suggested that the Japanese economy was not recovering fast enough to prompt the central bank to raise record low interest rates.
The dollar received help against the mark as some traders wagered that Germany's central bank would hold off on a rate increase.
"The last thing they need to do is raise interest rates," said Doug Lee, a corporate currency trader at Sakura Bank.
But the dollar pared some gains against the mark in afternoon trading after another Bundesbank council member, Helmut Hesse, suggested that the bank might defend the mark by raising rates or selling dollars if the dollar rose too far, too fast. "If the dollar climbs to 1.90 marks or more, the Bundesbank will act," Mr. Hesse said in an interview with the Dow Jones news service.
"His comments beat the dollar up pretty good," said Paul Spirgel, senior currency trader at the Royal Bank of Scotland.

HEADLINE: Looking Back in Central Europe

 BODY:
"When Americans say something is history, that means it's irrelevant," the Polish journalist Konstanty Gebert likes to say. "When we say it, it means just the opposite." The Communist past is still very much present in Poland and Germany, which have recently taken controversial measures to punish Communist officials and collaborators. Germany's conviction of three East German leaders for shootings at the Berlin wall and Poland's new law to bar secret-police collaborators from government jobs raise questions about both nations' commitment to the rule of law.
This week a Berlin court convicted three members of East Germany's Politburo of responsibility for shooting deaths between 1984 and 1989. The former security chief, Egon Krenz, was sentenced to six and a half years. Two others will serve three years. None had any role in writing the laws, but prosecutors argued they had been told of shootings and had praised border guards who killed fleeing citizens. About 100 people have been tried for such shootings. Defense officials were convicted for writing the laws, and some border guards have received short or suspended sentences. 
 Like many other trials of former East German officials, these have been legally questionable. Many politicians and legal scholars see them as ex post facto justice, punishing people for acts that were not criminal when committed. German courts have ruled that the border policy was so unjust that an exception can be made. While international law would make such an exception for crimes like genocide, few scholars would say that border shootings qualify. But if highly indoctrinated young border guards have been convicted, their leaders should be held responsible as well.
Poland has just instituted a screening law designed to keep people who collaborated with the Communist secret police out of government jobs. The law requires top government officials and political candidates to declare whether they were informers. Later, a panel of judges will review the secret police files. Those who lied will be barred from office for 10 years.
The law is somewhat better than the controversial screening law in the Czech Republic. The Polish law will allow judges to take into account whether people were forced to inform by threats to themselves or their families. But it echoes many of the injustices of the Czech version. The screening judges in Poland must be approved by the justice minister, which could lead to a repeat of the politicization that occurred in 1992. That year a right-wing Government gave Parliament a list of 64 politicians supposedly named as informers in the files. A parliamentary investigation found that the list contained the names of many government opponents -- including Lech Walesa -- but in only 10 of the 64 cases was there real evidence of collaboration.
That episode also revealed that the files are full of holes. They contained signatures of supposed informants forged by secret police recruiters, who needed to meet a quota. Other people in the files who were pressured into collaborating gave the secret police no harmful information.
Before the screening courts start their work, the Polish Government must devise mechanisms to deal with the ambiguities of collaboration and the flaws of the files. But it should also ask why it is still worrying about informers. Poland is right to continue to prosecute Communist-era criminals, such as those who shot protesters. But informing was not a crime, and bad behavior under Communism is no longer any guide to whether a person is a market-oriented democrat today. Poles who worry that informers are sabotaging their nation should contemplate the spectacular progress Poland has made toward political and economic health.

HEADLINE: 4 Rocks on Mars Confound Scientists With Unexpected Elements

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

 BODY:
In the first major surprise of the mission, mineral studies by the little roving vehicle on Mars have revealed at least two distinct kinds of rocks on the planet, and neither bears a clear resemblance to volcanic rocks on Earth or meteorites presumed to come from Mars, scientists reported yesterday.
The findings have left planetary scientists confused, waiting for more data and looking for explanations of how the rocks were formed and what they imply about the planet's geologic history. Project officials said that both the Mars Pathfinder spacecraft and its rover Sojourner appeared to be in good health. 
 Of the four rocks so far examined in detail at the landing site, two contain much higher amounts of the common element silicon than are present in Mars meteorites, and the other two have more sulfur than is found in terrestrial volcanic rocks. Yet, all four rocks give the appearance of being volcanic.
Dr. Thanasis Economou, a University of Chicago geochemist who is a member of the Pathfinder science team, also said there were puzzling differences in composition between the soil and rocks at the site. The soil contains chromium not present in the rocks, and much higher concentrations of sulfur and chlorine. But silicon and aluminum are more abundant in the rocks.
"So far, it's a problem," Dr. Economou said at a news conference at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., where the mission is directed. "There seem to be two distinct rock populations at the site, but we can't explain any of the differences."
Other geologists suggested several possible explanations. Perhaps the rover's spectrometer for determining surface chemistry was detecting only dust coating the rocks, not the rocks themselves. The dust, a mixture of material from far and near, could yield puzzling chemical traces. Or the sulfur concentrations, geologists said, could be a sign of past water reactions.
Another Chicago geologist, Dr. Robert Clayton, said in a telephone interview: "I don't know what it means. But if you take the analysis at face value, it means Mars geology is a lot more complicated than we previously thought. It makes Mars an even more interesting planet."
As a specialist in meteorites, Dr. Clayton determined from trapped gases that the meteorite ALH84001, which landed in Antarctica, came from Mars. Scientists a year ago reported possible evidence of signs of past life in the Martian meteorite.
Dr. Clayton said that it was not clear how the chemical differences between the rover's samples and meteorites could be reconciled. He defended his research on the Martian origin of several meteorites, but conceded that he must now "keep an open mind" on whether they are indeed Martian.
Among the new photographs made public yesterday were views of clouds visible just before sunrise at the landing site. Scientists said the wispy clouds contained icy water particles and had a blue tint.
Despite communications problems and other minor setbacks, project scientists said, the remote-controlled rover is ready to complete the analysis of several more rocks in the next week in a boulder-rich area nicknamed the Rock Garden.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Slip a Bit In Light Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities dropped slightly in light trading yesterday. Still, bonds' price levels continued to attract buyers, despite a poor Treasury auction of new five-year notes.
"The market is in the last throes of summer vacations and the impact on trading cannot be emphasized enough," said David Ader, director of fixed income for Technical Data. "Conditions are very thin. There is a tremendous amount of apathy, and as a result a lot of volatility. The weakness we've experienced has made the auctions easier to digest and brought in some interest." 
 Yesterday, the price of a 30-year Treasury bond fell 1/32, to 96 16/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.65 percent, from 6.64 percent on Tuesday.
Bonds rose early in the day, bolstered by carry-over buying from Tuesday and by a firmer dollar. The only negative, according to John Canavan, a market analyst with Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, was speculation that the German central bank might raise some interest rates.
"It added some pressure to bond prices in the morning," Mr. Canavan said, "which fell further on the results of the auction."
The Treasury auctioned $11.5 billion of five-year notes yesterday, and the notes were awarded at the high yield of 6.253 percent, more than the 6.23 percent that had been expected.
Some analysts said the auction might have suffered from investors' reluctance to buy ahead of economic data to be released this week and next, including today's report on revised second-quarter gross domestic product and weekly labor data.
The auction, Mr. Canavan said, "shot us down to the day's low."
Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of fixed income at J. W. Charles Securities of Boca Raton, Fla., said yesterday's session was no different than those preceding it.
"What we're seeing in the market is a classic case of interest-rate paranoia," he said. "You have people sitting on edge of their seats, waiting for one bad number to come along. The disappointing note auction was not the real reason the market sold off, but it probably gave investors the impetus to sell.
"Market participants are from the old school and it's hard for them to believe that the economy can grow with low unemployment and little inflation. So everyone is waiting for something to happen. This is as good as it gets and we should accept it and revel in it."
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new five-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Price . . . 99.987
High Yield . . . 6.253%

HEADLINE: NORTH KOREANS QUIT ARMS TALKS OVER DEFECTIONS

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27

 BODY:
North Korea withdrew from long-scheduled negotiations over its exports of missiles today in an angry protest against the Clinton Administration's decision to grant asylum to two North Korean diplomats.
The negotiations, which were to have begun this morning in New York City, were called off abruptly late Tuesday night after North Korea protested the Administration's decision to take in the diplomats, who defected over the weekend with the help of American intelligence agents, and who are already being interviewed, according to Administration officials. 
 The defections also appeared to throw into question whether broader talks including North Korea, South Korea, the United States and China to negotiate a formal end to the Korean War would take place. For now, those negotiations, known as the "four-party" talks, are scheduled to resume in New York on Sept. 15.
North Korea's Government in Pyongyang called on the United States to turn over its Ambassador to Egypt, Chang Sung Gil, and his brother, Chang Sung Ho, who was a trade official at Pyongyang's mission in Paris. It denounced the two men as criminals who were facing charges back home in connection with leaking state secrets and "economic corruption."
Li Gun, North Korea's deputy representative to the United Nations, called the Administration's decision to grant asylum and its role in the defections "a grave insult" that showed "hostility" toward his country. In addition to disrupting the missile talks, he said, the American actions would have "a serious effect" on the broader peace talks.
"The U.S. offer of shelter to the criminals seriously damaged the climate and prevented our Government from resuming the talks," Mr. Li said in a telephone interview.
The Administration sought to play down North Korea's decision, suggesting the defections would not have to permanently derail the long effort to entice North Korea out of its diplomatic isolation through a series of negotiated agreements.
On Martha's Vineyard, where President Clinton is vacationing, the White House expressed disappointment at North Korea's withdrawal from the talks. A spokesman, Barry Toiv, said the Administration nonetheless hoped that North Korea would remain committed to negotiations.
"While this decision by the North was not unexpected, it is nonetheless disappointing," he said. "We see no linkage between the defection and missile talks, and we believe it is in North Korea's interest to remain engaged in the talks."
However, the Administration appeared to have no second thoughts about the defections, which officials are describing as a potential intelligence coup, offering rare insight into North Korea's foreign policy and its arms sales in the Middle East.
"The alternative of turning down a bona fide plea for asylum from a state like North Korea is pretty unthinkable," an Administration official said.
When asked at a news conference today whether the Administration still considered it wise to grant asylum at the cost of disrupting delicate negotiations with North Korea, the State Department's spokesman, James P. Rubin, replied simply. "That's easy," he said. "Yes."
Mr. Chang is the first Ambassador to defect from North Korea and the highest-ranking North Korean ever to defect to the United States, rather than to South Korea.
As Ambassador to Egypt, holding one of North Korea's most important diplomatic posts, Mr. Chang would have had direct knowledge of arms trading with countries like Egypt, Iran and Syria, officials said.
In particular, the Administration is eager to know more about the sale of ballistic missiles, which it considers dangerous and threatening to allies in the region, like Israel. Mr. Chang might also shed light on the extent of North Korea's cooperation with China in the proliferation of missiles and missile technology.
North Korea has developed its own variations of Scud missiles, first designed by the Russians, and sold them around the world. In 1993, it tested its latest version, the Nodong I missile, which has a range of more than 1,000 kilometers and raises special concerns in the Administration.
North Korea has agreed in principle to join the Missile Technology Control Regime, a voluntary set of export controls to limit sales of ballistic missiles that can deliver 1,000-pound warheads more than 180 miles. With few other viable commodities to export, however, North Korea has relied on arms sales for hard currency.
The Administration officials said North Korea's secretive Government might have left Mr. Chang out of some decisions. One official, who like all the others spoke only on condition of anonymity, said it was not yet clear "to what extent he was privy" to his country's dealings. A Pentagon official added, "We may be hopeful and expect that he knows more than he does."
Negotiations with the North Koreans have moved in fits and starts. An early effort to begin the peace talks with South Korea, China and the United States, was postponed last fall when a North Korean submarine carrying commandos ran aground off South Korea's coast. In February, the defection to South Korea of Hwang Jang Yop, a former member of Pyongyang's ruling body, brought diplomacy to a halt for a while. After each case, however, talks resumed.
"Our diplomats are determined," Mr. Rubin said at the State Department today. "They're in it for the long haul."
In the case of this week's talks, North Korea's delegation, led by Li Hyong Chol, a director in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, had already arrived in New York for the talks when they were ordered to return home around midnight on Tuesday.
The official response came from Mr. Li, the diplomat at North Korea's mission to the United Nations. While it was tartly worded, a senior Administration official said, it did not include any mention of withdrawing from the four-party peace talks, as Mr. Li's public remarks today did.
That official and others said the Administration still believes that North Korea's desperation and isolation, worsened by economic collapse and natural catastrophes, would ultimately bring Pyongyang back to the negotiating table.
"All I can say is that we believe those talks are in the interests of both sides," Mr. Rubin said.

HEADLINE: Pledge to Stay in City Wins Bear Stearns a Tax Break

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration announced yesterday that it had granted Bear Stearns & Company a $75 million tax break to stay in New York for the next 50 years, although the global investment bank acknowledged that, unlike many Wall Street firms, it had never threatened to leave the city.
Bear Stearns, which has scoured midtown Manhattan for a new home for more than two years, plans to build a technologically advanced, 1.1-million-square-foot tower on a block bounded by Madison and Vanderbilt Avenues and 46th and 47th Streets. After 20 months of on-again, off-again negotiations, the investment bank signed a 99-year lease on Tuesday for the site near Grand Central Terminal, where a vacant, soot-covered building now stands. 
 Under the terms of what the city described as a "corporate retention deal," Bear Stearns would get $45 million in sales tax exemptions -- helping it buy office furniture, computers and other equipment when it moves into the new building -- in return for keeping its 5,800 employees in the city for the next 50 years. The firm would get up to $30 million more in sales tax exemptions if it created at least 13,300 new jobs in that period.
Bear Stearns currently occupies space in midtown, at 245 Park Avenue at 47th Street and 575 Lexington Avenue at 51st Street, and in Brooklyn and Whippany, N.J.
"Bear Stearns is very important to New York City's financial community," Mayor Giuliani said. "Whenever you see a development like this it's a sign of the city moving in exactly the right direction."
Asked at a news conference at City Hall whether Bear Stearns had gotten the $75 million tax break after threatening to leave New York, the Mayor responded that it was a "silly question," adding: "It doesn't matter. I don't really care."
James E. Cayne, chief executive of Bear Stearns, then answered the question: "No," he said.
"The Mayor and the Governor have made New York a business-friendly place. We didn't threaten to leave," Mr. Cayne said later in a telephone conversation. "We're not going down that road. Other companies do it. We've been in New York 75 years. This is our home."
The agreement is the 33d corporate retention deal signed by the Giuliani administration since 1993. The administration says the program has saved 77,880 jobs from leaving the city in return for over $600 million in tax breaks. But budget watchdogs, conservative anti-tax groups and liberal politicians have denounced the tax breaks as tantamount to "corporate welfare."
"A company with the earnings of Bear Stearns doesn't need the helping hand of the taxpayers," said Thomas Carroll, the president of Change-NY, the state's largest taxpayer organization. "The problem with this approach to economic development is that it always focuses on the companies with the biggest brand names and best political connections. The small and medium-sized companies, which are responsible for more job growth, are often left in the dust."
During the recession in the early 1990's, city officials argued that the incentives were necessary to persuade corporations not to abandon the city. But midtown vacancy rates, which had soared as high as 18 percent, are now at about 10.6 percent, the lowest since 1986, according to Cushman & Wakefield, one of the largest brokerages in Manhattan. In the past year, the average asking rent for office space in midtown Manhattan rose about 6.6 percent to $38.09 per square foot.
Now, city officials argue that the city economy is so robust that the real estate market has tightened up to the point that companies cannot find large blocks of prime office space and cannot afford new construction without city subsidies. "You couldn't get this building built without these incentives in today's market," said Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. "The Mayor now has a commitment from Bear Stearns to stay here for 50 years. We didn't have that two days ago. And New York City will get a major development. The Mayor's package makes that possible."
The Bear Stearns site has a star-crossed history that dates back to the 1980's real estate boom. In an alliance with some Arab investors, Credit Suisse First Boston and the developer G. Ware Travelstead bought the site in 1982 for what was originally described as the tallest building in the world. But the project failed to gain city approval and the site lay fallow.
In December 1995, Bear Stearns thought it had struck a deal with First Boston to buy the site for $55 million. But First Boston's partner, the al-Babtain family of Saudi Arabia, upset the plans when it suddenly took control of the property.
After several futile attempts to strike a deal with the al-Babtains, Bear Stearns began looking elsewhere for a new home. The company considered building a tower on a site known as Rock West, at Seventh Avenue and 50th Street, and renewing its lease at 245 Park Avenue. Neither option bore fruit. Once again, Bear Stearns resumed negotiations with the al-Babtains. The two sides sealed a deal after Bear Stearns doubled its price and Abdul Wahab S. al-Babtain agreed to grant a long-term lease granting full control of the property to the investment bank. According to one person involved in the negotiations, the current value of the deal is more than $100 million.
The project will be developed by Fred Wilpon, a director of Bear Stearns and the owner of the Mets, and Gerald Hines, the Houston-based developer. Under the city's zoning rules, the developer would be allowed to put up a smaller building. But Bear Stearns plans to purchase additional development rights from nearby Grand Central Terminal, if the city approves the final plans.

Stocks Eke Out Gains After Early Losses
Blue-chip stocks rose for the first time in a week as the Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.11 points, to 7,787.33, overcoming an 84-point drop. Small stocks, as gauged by the Russell 2000 index, did slightly better.
Stocks were buffeted by an unusually large number of computer-guided buy and sell programs, traders said. But big oil companies received a lift from an analyst's recommendation that investors increase their holdings of the stocks. [D8.] 

Treasury securities prices dropped slightly amid a poor Treasury auction of new five-year notes. The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.65 percent from 6.64. [D18.]
 
Lawyers Win. But Consumers?
Insurers accused of duping customers into buying unnecessary or overrated policies are adopting a settlement strategy from other industries, giving consumers discounts on future services instead of cash. While lawyers do well under these arrangements, critics say they are simply marketing gimmicks for the insurers. [A1.]
 
Matsushita Profit Surges
Matsushita of Japan, the world's largest maker of home electronics products, said that quarterly net income rose 42 percent. [D9.]
 
Arguments in Trade Case
The computing director of the weather laboratory that touched off a high-tech trade fight said that the lab had decided last year to buy Japanese supercomputers because an American maker, Cray Research, could not deliver machines that were fast enough. Cray says the Japanese were dumping them -- that is, selling them below cost. [D2.]
 
Anti-dumping laws, remnants of an era when imports mattered little to Americans' standard of living, are intended to give domestic producers an edge over foreign rivals. Thanks to the tilted playing field, consumers stand to lose -- as shown by a case in which Louisiana crawfish growers seek sanctions against Chinese competitors. Peter Passell: Economic Scene. [D2.]
 
I.B.M. Thinks Small
I.B.M. is bringing out what executives are describing as their first comprehensive worldwide advertising campaign aimed at owners of small businesses. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D6.]
 
Florida Settlement Raises Question

Tax Break for Bear Stearns
New York City has granted Bear Stearns a $75 million tax break to stay in New York for the next 50 years, though the investment bank acknowledged that, unlike many Wall Street firms, it had never threatened to leave. [B6.]
 
Dollar Gains Ground
The dollar rose on policy makers' hints that interest rates in Germany and Japan would not rise soon. [D15.]
 
Dow Jones in Derivatives Deals
Dow Jones said that it had licensed Bankers Trust and Merrill Lynch to offer contracts that will enable investors to make bets on the direction of the Dow industrials. [D8.]

HEADLINE: As Washington (D.C.) Loses Power, Outlook Is Up

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
The announcement generated little fanfare in the District of Columbia, beyond the city's finance department. But there, it was worthy of a man-bites-dog headline.
On Aug. 7, two days after President Clinton signed the 1998 budget bill, which included a $1 billion bailout of the District over five years, Standard & Poor's put the city on "credit watch with positive implications," a signal to investors that its lowly B rating for general obligation bonds could improve in the next few months. 
 "That shows things are moving in the right direction," said Anthony A. Williams, the District's chief financial officer, basking in the glow of a little positive news.
For residents of the nation's capital, such news has been hard to come by. For the third September in four years, the schools will open late, this time by three weeks, so roof and safety repairs can be completed. Just 2 of 34 street-cleaning machines are in working condition, and garbage has piled up on many streets and alleys, because more than a dozen garbage trucks are inoperable.
And many city agencies, including those for tax collection and housing, are still untangling problems that Mr. Williams says have cost the city tens of millions of dollars a year through waste, fraud and mismanagement. As one example, the city last year lost $55 million in Federal grant money for housing, sewers, parks and day care by not spending it within the allotted time.
But Mr. Williams, as well as experts in municipal finance, economists and local developers, contend that after years of decline, the District has bottomed out.
They say change is well under way -- not just because of the Federal bailout but also because part of the budget bill expands the powers of the city's two-year-old financial control board, allowing it to run every major agency of the city government. That authority was once held by the Mayor and City Council.
While Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. has led the jeers against the bill, saying it "raped democracy and freedom," city officials, economists and developers say it is integral to any meaningful turnabout in providing confidence to residents and investors that city agencies will be managed properly, at least over the next few years.
"The economic issue is driving the bus right now," said Dick Heidenberger, a restaurateur and real estate developer who is turning a vacant downtown apartment building, now a crack house, into a restaurant.
"The potential is there for so many business opportunities," Mr. Heidenberger said, "and it will only get better.
"The writing is on the wall for Marion Barry. I know he inherited a lot of the mess, but he made a lot of the mess. For me, the control board was an absolute positive."
After the President signed the budget bill, the control board moved swiftly to replace members of the Mayor's cabinet and install a new chief financial officer in each city agency, all of whom answer to the control board, not the Mayor. The legislation also gives cabinet heads broad new authority to dismiss any employee for cause, a power added to the measure to satisfy residents' complaints that many city agencies are unresponsive to citizens' needs.
Further, the control board is now searching to fill a position no other major American city has -- chief management officer -- who would be, in effect, the city manager, coordinating the agencies and reporting directly to the control board.
While the control board is viewed by Mr. Barry and some other residents as the worst intrusion on home rule since Congress granted it almost 25 years ago, others say the shift will accelerate economic developments already under way. Among them are these:
*Job growth in the District's private sector has grown every month this year, compared with the same same period in 1996, according to a monthly survey conducted by Stephen Fuller, a professor of public policy at George Mason University in Northern Virginia. For May and June, the most recent months for which statistics are available, the increase was 8,800 jobs.
*Construction of the MCI Center, an indoor arena for the city's professional basketball and hockey teams being built on the fringe of downtown, has begun attracting new retail development to the area. Mr. Heidenberger said the building he planned to develop was one of many facing the MCI Center that are to be renovated.
*Thousands of Federal employees working in Northern Virginia are scheduled to be moved soon to new quarters in the city, at the Navy Yard and the Government's second-largest building, after the Pentagon -- the new Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center on Pennsylvania Avenue.
*The District has taken in $50 million more than expected this year through more aggressive tax collection, largely from properties sold to satisfy debt. Mr. Williams predicted that the additional money would help cut the annual deficit to its lowest level in years, $74 million, for the fiscal year ending on Sept. 30. Two years ago, it was $334 million.
*The Standard & Poor's credit watch was the first change in the District's bond rating since April 11, 1995, when a BBB rating was dropped to B, the equivalent of junk bond status. The District's rating had fallen steadily, from A in 1984.
"It's too soon to make a direct connection," said Mr. Fuller, referring to the expanded powers of the control board and the city's economy. "But there are signs. A number of things have broken out before on their own steam that are not tied to the rescue package, but the rescue package won't hurt."
Mr. Heidenberger, the developer, predicted that with the construction of the arena, and plans for a new downtown convention center and opera house, Washington could experience the kind of rebirth that occurred 15 years ago in Baltimore, where investors turned a drab downtown into a rainbow of new hotels, restaurants and specialty shops.
"Things are happening that predate the Federal action," said Philip Dearborn, president of the Greater Washington Research Center. "But that may have a value reassuring people that the city is going to be managed and will survive. With it or without it, the city is on a good track."

HEADLINE: More Questions About Incentives To Get Those on Welfare to Work

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27

 BODY:
It seems like an idea that no one could fault: let welfare recipients keep more of their benefits when they get jobs, and more of them will get jobs. Indeed, the idea has so much appeal that at least 30 states are now trying it as part of their new welfare programs.
But decades of research have shown that such financial incentives do little to coax people from welfare to work. And a study released today -- seeming to show new promise for the policy -- may have inadvertently reawakened doubts about it, even as it is being embraced from New York to California. 
 The study was conducted by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a nonprofit group in New York City that for the past decade has played an influential role in welfare policy. It examined the effect of these incentives, known as earnings disregards, on three groups of welfare recipients in seven Minnesota counties.
For two of the three groups, the incentives had the same effect they have had in the past: they did little to encourage people to work. In fact, for one group, welfare recipients who had generous incentives earned less from work than those who did not receive the incentives.
But when tried in a third group -- in combination with mandatory work requirements -- the incentives did increase earnings and reduce poverty.
Pointing to that finding, Judith Gueron, the president of the research group, said the study held out new hope for the efficacy of the incentives.
"The conventional view is that they don't make much difference," Ms. Gueron said. "I think that view is being challenged here."
But critics of the financial incentives continue to argue that they do as much or more harm than good. By allowing more workers to collect welfare, they say, the incentives may encourage more people to come on the rolls. Similarly, by allowing poor people to collect welfare after they get a job, the incentives encourage longer stays on the rolls. Since states now impose lifetime limits on the number of months the poor can collect benefits, those longer stays could inadvertently lead some poor people to use up their eligibility faster.
In an era of time limits, this could unintentionally lead the poor to exhaust their eligibility more quickly.
The critics say that the study, rather than vindicating the incentives, undermines them in its fine print. Even the group that increased its employment collected an additional 8 percent in welfare benefits.
"The study tells us what we've always known, that earnings disregards are not an effective tool in promoting self-sufficiency and reducing dependency," said Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group in Washington.
The dispute serves as a reminder that state programs often pursue disparate, and even conflicting, goals: raising overall income, raising earned income, and reducing welfare receipts. It is difficult to do all three at once. By allowing people to more easily combine welfare and work, for instance, the incentives may raise overall income. But they may also increase reliance on welfare.
Welfare analysts have held out hope for the incentives since at least 1967, when Congress first passed rules allowing recipients to keep some of their earnings without having their welfare checks correspondingly reduced.
In 1981, however, President Reagan sharply reduced the incentives, arguing that workers should work -- not collect welfare. Critics argued that the changes would lead many people to quit their jobs and rely solely on welfare. But subsequent studies, including a comprehensive one by Prof. Robert Moffitt, now of Johns Hopkins University, found that the incentives had little effect one way or the other.
By the early 1990's, a new enthusiasm for the incentives arose among supply-side conservatives like Jack Kemp who believed in the power of economic incentives. Other conservatives, like Mr. Rector, argued that incentives alone, without work requirements, were too weak to change behavior.
The Minnesota study began in January 1993, under a waiver from the Federal Government that long pre-dated last year's welfare law.
Among those studied was a group of "new applicants" who had received benefits for less than 18 months. Those given the financial incentives were slightly more likely to be employed than members of a control group. That is, 78 percent of those with the incentives had jobs, versus 73 percent of those without the incentives.
But those with the incentives earned 6 percent less, and collected 27 percent more in cash welfare and food stamps. Their total income rose 7 percent. But it still remained low, just $14,600 in 18 months.
Taken together, that is, the incentives seemed to make little overall difference in the lives of the poor -- a finding consistent with past research.
The same incentives were tested on a second group of recipients, this one considered "long-term recipients." Here, too, they seemed to have little effect.
It was only for a third group that the incentives seemed to have an effect. But this group faced both the "carrot" of the incentives, and the "stick" of modest work requirements. For this group, the results seemed more robust. Those employed rose by 39 percent compared with a control group. Total income rose by 13 percent. And the percentage of those in poverty fell by 16 percent.
Ms. Gueron had that group in mind in promoting the program. When combined with work requirements, she said, the incentives "can both promote work and reduce poverty, which has been an elusive goal."
But Mickey Kaus, another critic of earnings disregards, said the results that the group attributed to the combination of carrot and stick may simply have come from the stick alone -- the work requirements.
"The carrot alone flopped," Mr. Kaus said. "The carrot and the stick worked. Why didn't they also test the stick alone, the work requirements?" Ms. Gueron said previous studies found that such an approach did less to reduce poverty than the mix of policies tried in Minnesota. But Mr. Kaus said the research group was making the financial incentives look overly promising.
"Earnings disregards," Mr. Kaus said, "are one of those palliatives designed to get around the need to get rid of welfare."

Mayoral Campaign Focuses On Public School System
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew -- who enjoys a warm relationship with Mayor Giuliani, a Republican -- and Ruth W.

But for years, school bathrooms have been used in overcrowded districts throughout the city as classrooms and as offices for teachers and counselors. B3
 
3 Charged in Pager Scheme
Sensitive information sent to the pagers of top police and fire officials was intercepted by a news tip service, prosecutors said, in a case that exposes a new vulnerability for millions of people who depend on pagers, especially newer models that send not just a phone number, but a short message. The information included the location of top police officials, the deployment of special units such as the bomb squad and the condition of injured police officers and firefighters, Federal prosecutors said. They charged three men with illegally intercepting communications, a charge that carries penalties of up to five years in prison. B1

167 Arrested for Gang Activity
In the first public acknowledgment that the Los Angeles-based Bloods and its rival gang, the Crips, now operate in New York, Federal investigators and the city police announced the arrests of more than 167 suspected gang members who were rounded up from the streets and city jails. They are accused of selling drugs and committing armed robberies, and may be implicated in five homicides and several shootings. Using the city's jails as a beachhead, the Bloods gang has entrenched itself in New York and its hundreds of members have committed at least 135 random slashings on city streets as part of their initiation rites.

HEADLINE: For Plaintiffs, More of Same in Insurance Accords

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
A funny thing is happening on the way to the courthouse, as class-action lawyers and the insurance industry mop up some of the worst sales abuses heaped upon consumers in recent years.
While lawyers are walking away with upward of $150 million in cold, hard cash for representing customers who said they had been duped into buying policies that may have been unnecessary or overrated, millions of policyholders are being offered something far less tangible to settle class action lawsuits. 
 They can take their chances of getting cash through arduous arbitration or they can take a package of low-interest loans and discounts on a handful of insurance, annuity and mutual fund products. In short, they would be ponying up more cash to do new business with the same institutions that let them down.
The insurers and the plaintiffs' lawyers are celebrating these deals, some of which still await court approval, as being worth billions of dollars to consumers and a brilliant way to end the litigation. But critics of the settlements argue that the discounts are nothing more than a marketing gimmick for the insurers -- a low-cost way to hold on to their customers -- and a way for lawyers to collect large fees by inflating the settlements' value.
This is only the latest variety of a series of settlements criticized for handing consumers scrip in lieu of cash. People who thought that they had overpaid for airline tickets because of price-fixing wound up with a small discount off the price of another trip. Owners of leaky Mustang convertibles got a $400 coupon toward the purchase of a new Ford. Contact lens wearers who said they were overcharged by Bausch & Lomb were given a little cash and certificates for more products.
Now the coupon craze is being embraced by life insurance companies, including the New York Life Insurance Company, the Prudential Insurance Company of America, the Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Company and the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company.
While the details of each settlement differ, the deals usually consist of a low-interest loan to cover the premiums on an existing policy and a discount on the purchase of a new product. (In some cases, policyholders might qualify for a small enhancement of the cash value of an existing life insurance policy, without putting additional money down.)
But in most cases the insurers have confined the price breaks to a narrow universe of so-so products while insisting on the broadest possible release from liability for past and future claims.
"I think it's a brilliant concept," said Melvyn I. Weiss, a prominent class-action lawyer in New York whose firm, Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, served as lead counsel in many of the cases that have resulted in noncash settlements. "It's a great solution to policyholders; it's a great solution to the company."
But critics, who include consumer advocates, state regulators, academics and even some plaintiffs' lawyers, are not so sure.
The settlements are "being copied because plaintiffs' lawyers want fees, and the defendant knows it's a wonderful way to buy peace," said Michael Malakoff, a Pittsburgh lawyer who is seeking a reversal of the Prudential settlement reached last September on the ground it shortchanges Prudential's victims.
A lot of the problem lies in the settlements' sheer breadth. Unlike other coupon settlements, which are typically limited to the people who bought the car with the faulty design or were taken advantage by the unfair pricing practices, these settlements are much more sweeping in nature. They include anyone who bought a life insurance policy when the deceptive sales techniques were being employed, sometimes for more than 15 years. As a result, the critics say, the people who were actually deceived could end up with much less than if they were the sole beneficiaries of the settlement, and people who do not yet know they were harmed may also come up short. The very fact that the insurers are willing to be so expansive and include all potential claimants, critics argue, is a sign that these enhancements do not "cost" the companies much at all.
"It's a marketing tool for the defendants and a cheap way to buy out of liability," said Susan Koniak, a visiting law professor at Cornell University.
The liability that so concerns the industry giants arises from three types of unsavory sales practices aimed at generating commissions that have become the focus of scandals and class-action lawsuits in recent years.
Some cases involve "churning" -- pressuring customers to use the cash value of their old policies to buy new ones no better than the ones they replaced. Other cases accuse agents of overstating how much policies would earn in the late 1980's when interest rates were in the double digits, sometimes going so far as to offer "vanishing premium" policies, where the income was eventually supposed to cover the annual premiums. When interest rates fell, policyholders were hit with bills they had never expected. The third category of complaints involve policies that were inappropriately billed as investment or retirement vehicles.
To be sure, some people who were deceived will end up getting cash. All the settlements give policyholders a brief window of opportunity to opt out to pursue their own lawsuit, an option few people may even realize they have. The settlements also offer cash to those who can prove that they were harmed. Under the Prudential settlement, the largest of its kind and which involves nearly 9 million customers who bought 10.7 million policies between 1982 and 1995, the insurance company has agreed to pay out at least $410 million in cash relief and could eventually pay out more than $1 billion. About 1.1 million policyholders have indicated that they want to go through arbitration, according to the company.
For the bulk of customers, the plan's architects had alternative relief in mind. Hence, at Prudential, a package of low-interest loans and discounts on whole-life insurance, annuities and some in-house mutual funds that by some estimates might be worth another $800 million. "When we looked at the kinds of problems people were having, people were just disappointed in the performance of the product," said Paul Lang, a vice president of policy owner relations for Prudential, explaining why the company did something for them, too.
Certainly, the company has not made it easy for people who want cold, hard cash to get it. Prudential, for instance, requires policyholders to complete a 19-page claim form if they choose arbitration, one reason why consumer advocates urge anyone interested in arbitration to seek the help of a state insurance department, a lawyer or financial adviser rather than go it alone. "I think you need expert advice," said J. Robert Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America.
What is more, critics put little value on the package of discounts and low-interest loans being offered to consumers as part of these settlements. "It is not relief at all; it does not remedy the harm done," said Gary Betz, special counsel to the Attorney General in Florida.
The package in the New York Life settlement, which was reached two years ago and was the first insurance deal of this type, represents "minimal or token compensation for class members," agreed Joseph M. Belth, editor of The Insurance Forum newsletter. Short of arbitration, it offered "no benefit to an individual who desires to avoid further transactions" with a company that may have misled them.
Consumers tend to agree. In the case of New York Life, for example, only 4,000 people out of the 3 million who were eligible opted to take a discounted annuity or life insurance policy. Only 500,000 out of the nearly 9 million covered by the Prudential settlement expressed an interest in one of their products, about a fraction of the one million or more initially estimated.
Besides luring fewer takers than initial projections, these settlements will cost the companies much less than the economic value assigned to them because the insurers will be bypassing their high-cost sales forces.
New York Life, for example, offered to knock half off the first year's premium on new insurance policies covered by the deal, meaning it should net the same as if an agent had made the sale at full price. That is one reason it estimates it will only spend $65 million to deliver $250 million in promised benefits. The deal was structured that way, according to Robert J. Hebron, vice president and associate general counsel, so that the company, which is owned by its policyholders, would not be "robbing Peter to pay Paul."
From the perspective of the policyholders, where the money is coming from is irrelevant, Mr. Weiss argues. But it is hard to argue that the settlements will do much to inhibit the insurers from misbehaving again.
And consumer advocates would certainly be happier if the discounts could be sold for cash or applied to any of the insurers' products.
"Is it better than nothing? Yes," said Peter Katt, a life insurance adviser in Kalamazoo, Mich., who has clients who are Prudential policyholders. But he and other financial advisers argue that the discounts being offered are no better than what is available from other companies if consumers bother to shop around.
The discounted annuities and insurance policies can generally be matched by buying from a low-cost company in the first place, while the discounted mutual funds that are being offered, at least in the case of Prudential and the Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Company, which has also reached one of these settlements, tend to have high expenses and be mediocre performers. Though Prudential says it may yet alter the deal, policyholders can only buy "B" class shares in the the seven funds now eligible for the discount. This class carries steep annual marketing fees that would often outweigh the value of the initial discount after four years' time.
Only one fund, the Prudential Diversified Bond Fund, has been a top performer at least in the last year, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund research company. The rest were beaten by most of their peers over the last three years, including Prudential Municipal Fund-Intermediate Series, which placed close to the bottom of its group.
The dozen funds Phoenix is offering its policyholders also have high yearly marketing fees. Most of those funds have been poor performers as well, like the Phoenix Growth Fund, which trailed its peers the last year.
The insurance companies' eagerness to offer millions of policyholders these deals suggests they may do more for their bottom lines than they let on. Steven S. Oscher, an accountant retained by Florida to look into the Prudential settlement, said in a report that the increase in sales of insurance, mutual funds and annuities that Prudential will enjoy from the discount program "may ultimately allow Prudential to underwrite the payment" of the arbitration program.
Prudential denies it would ever come out ahead. "This wasn't a sales campaign," Mr. Lang said. "It was solely designed to help people who thought they didn't have what they wanted."
Maybe so. But the settlements may do more to help the insurance companies and class-action lawyers who created them. As two of the New York Life policyholders complained in court in a written objection to the settlement, "We don't see the law firm taking its compensation in the form of a negligibly favorable annuity from New York Life the way it would have its clients do."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "The Prudential Deal at a Glance"
In the settlement reached last September, nearly nine million policyholders were told they could seek arbitration or sign up for the discounts with no questions asked.
 
ARBITRATION (Estimated cost upward of $410 million)
 
About 1.1 million policyholders indicated that they want to go through arbitration. After filling out a 19-page claim form, they will be assigned a score of 0, 1, 2 or 3. Those who score 0 will get nothing. Those who score 1 get whatever discounts they would have otherwise received outside of arbitration. All others would either receive a cash award, have their policy reinstated if it lapsed or have future premiums waived. Policyholders have the option of appealing to an independent reviewer.
 
THE DISCOUNT PROGRAM (Estimated cost up to $800 million)
 
About 490,000 people have indicated that they are interested in participating in this program.
 
Anyone with an existing policy that has a premium due may be eligible to take out a low-interest loan priced at Prudential's short-term cost of borrowing. They may also choose one of the following:
 
A whole life insurance policy -- Prudential will contribute 50 percent of the first-year's premium, 25 percent of the third-year's premium, 25 percent of the fifth-year's premium and 15 percent of the seventh-year's premium.
 
An annuity -- Prudential will contribute 2 percent of the initial payment for smaller annuities; 3 percent for larger ones. Prudential will contribute another 2 percent of the initial payment at the end of the second year and another 1 percent at the end of the third year.
 
A mutual fund -- Prudential will waive 4 percent of the purchase price on the B class shares for any one of seven mutual funds. These B-shares carry some baggage, though, in the form of higher-than-usual marketing fees in the early years. (pg. D4)
 
Table: "Bartering to Satisfy Dissatisfied Policyholders"
 Virtually every major life insurance company has been sued by policyholders who said that their agents had engaged in deceptive sales practices. Agents have been accused of churning policies or pressuring customers to cash out their existing policies to buy new ones, selling vanishing premium policies in which the earnings were supposed to be sufficient to pay for the premiums within a short period and inappropriately calling some policies investment or retirement vehicles.
 The insurers either denied the accusations or argued that these practices were not widespread. But many, including those below, have chosen to settle the lawsuits by offering policyholders a choice of arbitration or discounted products. Table lists five examples of litigation against several insurance companies. (Sources: Lawyers; company documents; court filings)(pg. D4)

HEADLINE: Going Down A New Road, Then Back;
New-Media Executives Often Lose Their Way

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
For nearly two years, Stephen A. Weiswasser has worked in Los Angeles but lived in Washington. The coast-to-coast commute has been brutal, but he said he was determined not to uproot his family for his job.
Today, that looks like a shrewd move. The company Mr. Weiswasser joined, Americast, has shut down two divisions, laid off more than a dozen of its 100 employees, and throttled back its ambitions to develop a futuristic television service for its five telephone company backers. 
 And Mr. Weiswasser himself may soon negotiate to leave the company, according to several executives there. "I have a contract and I plan to live up to it," said Mr. Weiswasser, who was recruited to run Americast after a decade in senior posts at ABC. But he acknowledged that "things are not rolling out as fast as we had hoped."
If Mr. Weiswasser does leave Americast, he will join an elite but growing fraternity: new-media refugees. These are prominent executives who traded their careers in conventional media companies for the glamorous but treacherous world of new media. New media, which encompass everything from interactive television to the Internet, offered these people the tantalizing prospect of creating something new and perhaps even striking it rich.
But three years after the new-media wave first swept the industry, it has left some woozy players in its wake. After struggling with balky partners, financial losses and the vagaries of technology, many of these executives found that the new frontier got old very quickly.
Some, like Howard Stringer of the Sony Corporation and Walter Isaacson of Time magazine, have returned to old-line media jobs. A few, like the former AT&T executive Robert M. Kavner, are still laboring in the new-media vineyards, trying to realize their dreams on a more modest scale. And one executive, Paul Sagan, has dropped out altogether, moving to Switzerland.
Of course, each of these men had his own reasons for jumping into -- or back out of -- new media. But there are enough common strands in their stories to illuminate a basic truth: while digital technology is enabling companies to start all sorts of new-media ventures, the profits have been elusive.
Whether it is a World Wide Web site like Time Inc.'s Pathfinder, or a television service like Americast, turning an idea into a business is tricky. Some companies are struggling even to figure out why they are in this business. For Time Warner, it may be a logical extension of its print publications. But other companies, including the Baby Bells, may simply be fighting a rear-guard action -- afraid that if they do not get into the business, someone else will.
"We all operated on a flush of hype that perhaps blinded us to the difficulties of the business," Mr. Weiswasser said. "Now we're all wiser. It is harder than we thought it was going to be."
Americast embodies many of the woes that afflict new-media ventures. The company was started in 1995 as a joint venture of the Walt Disney Company and five telephone companies -- Ameritech, BellSouth, GTE, SBC Communications and Southern New England Telephone -- with the lofty goal of creating a television service that could be delivered over telephone wires.
The partners pledged $100 million a year over five years to develop the building blocks for such a system: an interactive device to help viewers navigate through hundreds of channels of programs, a set-top convertor box, and some original, interactive programming.
And they lured Mr. Weiswasser from Capital Cities/ABC, where he had held several weighty positions, including general counsel and executive vice president of ABC News.
But problems crept into the venture from the start. One of Americast's phone-company backers, SBC, announced it was no longer interested in the television business. And some of the other phone companies delayed their plans to offer video services so they could concentrate on other businesses, like long-distance service.
Moreover, Disney's aggressive television programmers came into conflict with Americast over which company should control the programming and marketing for the venture, according to executives involved in the dispute. Several weeks ago, the partners essentially backed Disney -- shutting down those divisions and moving the activities from Americast to Disney.
Mr. Weiswasser insisted that Americast would continue to supervise the development of the service. And he said the phone companies were still committed to offering video to their customers over time. But with Americast losing its role as a programming company, Mr. Weiswasser would seem to have little incentive to stay with the venture.
What lessons has he learned from the experience? "It is important," Mr. Weiswasser said, "that the partners coming into a venture are absolutely sure that they understand and agree on each other's mission and role."
The same lesson could be applied to Mr. Weiswasser's former competitor, Howard Stringer. Mr. Stringer, who was once president of CBS, left the network in late 1994 to run a similar programming venture, Tele-TV, which was backed by Bell Atlantic, Nynex and the Pacific Telesis Group.
Partly, Mr. Stringer was lured by the challenge of doing something fresh after 30 years at CBS. But he also feared that with CBS about to change ownership he was not likely to remain president for long.
As it happens, he might have lasted longer at CBS than at Tele-TV. After the venture's first year, two of its backers -- Bell Atlantic and Nynex -- simply decided that investing heavily in television was no longer critical to their future. But they were initially loath to admit their retreat, so Mr. Stringer was forced to spend a restless year at the office with little to do, waiting for his employers to buy out his contract.
"Americast and Tele-TV were deterrents to keep the cable industry out of the phone business," said Michael J. Wolf, a partner in the media practice at Booz, Allen & Hamilton. "When the cable companies decided not to get into that business, the phone companies didn't care anymore."
Looking back, Mr. Stringer said Tele-TV's backers were also understandably impatient because the digital technology they wanted to use was proving to be too expensive to deploy in their phone networks.
"The problem is that you're running on the theory of the technology before the technology proves itself," he said.
Mr. Stringer finally wriggled out of Tele-TV last May with a severance deal that industry executives estimate was worth more than $8 million. Now he is the president of the Sony Corporation of America, where he is coordinating Sony's effort to get into digital television.
The fickleness of partners also torpedoed Mr. Kavner, another new-media executive. As executive vice president of the AT&T Corporation, Mr. Kavner oversaw the company's multimedia activities. In 1994, he was approached by Michael Ovitz, the legendary talent agent, to help him get into the nascent business of new media.
Drawn by the glamour of Hollywood, Mr. Kavner left AT&T's Basking Ridge, N.J., headquarters for Mr. Ovitz's chic quarters in Beverly Hills, Calif. Among other things, he helped Mr. Ovitz to broker the deal that created Tele-TV.
But barely a year after Mr. Kavner came aboard, Mr. Ovitz stunned the entertainment industry by leaving his company, Creative Artists Agency, to join Disney as its president. Mr. Kavner knocked around C.A.A. for another year, helping to finance several small technology companies. But with Mr. Ovitz gone, the grander projects simply vanished in the smog.
Through some serendipitous financial dealings, Mr. Kavner finally landed at the helm of the On Command Corporation at the end of 1996. On Command, which was cobbled together from the assets of Spectravision, is the nation's largest pay-per-view service for hotel rooms.
Until now, it has largely subsisted by offering adult films to traveling businessmen and other guests. But Mr. Kavner has big plans for On Command, and they have a distinctly new-media tincture. He intends to bring Internet service into On Command's 920,000 rooms, offering viewers everything from on-line games to electronic shopping.
Mr. Kavner has few illusions that cyberspace will supplant pornography. "But if you offer people a wide, more interesting, set of choices, they will buy it," he said.
He'll soon find out. Though On Command had only $147.5 million in 1996 revenue, Mr. Kavner has found a business in which one can measure success clearly -- by the revenue per room that its services generate. That clarity is sorely lacking in other new-media ventures, particularly those involving the Internet.
Two of Time Warner's most promising executives briefly grappled with this problem. Under Walter Isaacson and later Paul Sagan, Time Inc. New Media developed one of the most elaborate sites on the Web, called Pathfinder, which encompasses many of Time Inc.'s magazines and other publications.
Mr. Sagan, who helped start Time Warner's New York 1 cable news service, said he was frustrated as president of the new-media division because it was hard to determine whether Pathfinder was successful.
"With New York 1, we measured success by how often we were cited in the media," he said. "With on-line services, you have 'hits,' which don't really mean anything. So you were always grabbing at clouds."
Time Warner sells about $10 million worth of advertising a year on Pathfinder, according to executives with knowledge of the venture, but it still loses about $10 million a year. Mr. Sagan said Pathfinder, like most magazine start-ups in the old media, was not supposed to turn a profit in its early years. And he is frustrated by critics who label the venture a failure.
His predecessor, Mr. Isaacson, said Pathfinder was among the top five Web sites, measured by the number of visits and ad revenues. And despite its losses, he said it cost "a lot less than the hundreds of millions of dollars News Corp. spent with MCI or Microsoft spent on various things."
Notwithstanding these explanations, neither Mr. Isaacson nor Mr. Sagan spent much time in new media. Mr. Sagan resigned after only a year to fulfill a longtime dream of taking his family overseas for a year of travel in Europe. Earlier, Mr. Isaacson was plucked out of the job after two years to fulfill his longtime ambition of editing Time magazine.
Despite its aggravations, both men said they had no regrets. Mr. Sagan, who moved to Geneva this week, has signed a consulting contract with the World Economic Forum to help the Geneva-based foundation make better use of the Internet.
Mr. Isaacson, meanwhile, has made the information revolution a prime editorial focus at Time. "This is the biggest story of our time," he said. "Having been there in the trenches, I've got a much better feel for it. I've felt with my own fingers the power of the Web."
Yet for all his enthusiasm, Mr. Isaacson said his foray into new media left him more optimistic about the future of the old media. "A lot of newspapers and magazines are threatened," he said. "But I came back with more respect for the power of magazines to tell rich tales."

In recent years, several prominent executives in old media businesses like television and publishing were lured away to take jobs in the new interactive media ventures. But so far, profits have been elusive and most have returned, sadder but wiser, to their roots.

Protecting America's shores from those Chinese crawfish.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
ANTI-DUMPING laws, remnant of an era when imports mattered little to Americans' standard of living, are intended to give domestic producers an edge over foreign rivals. And thanks to the tilted playing field, consumers pay more for everything from cement to honey.
Few cases illustrate the point better than Louisiana's crawfish growers' suit against their Chinese competitors, likely to be decided tomorrow by the quasi-judicial United States International Trade Commission. Indeed, few so clearly make the point that the real thrust of anti-dumping laws is to limit foreign competition. "Most anti-dumping cases are nasty," said Greg Rushford, publisher of the Rushford Report, a newsletter on trade policy. "This one is super-nasty." 
 Crawfish, freshwater crustaceans that are used in jambalaya, etouffee and all manner of other Creole dishes, used to come almost exclusively from Louisiana. Fresh whole crawfish command premium prices from local gourmets, while the frozen tail meat ends up in a thousand restaurants across the country. But since weather problems severely disrupted production in 1994 and 1995, the state has lost its market dominance. Some 80 percent of the frozen variety now come from private farmers in Jiangsu Province, China.
Last year the Louisiana businesses that process raw crawfish persuaded the State Legislature to appropriate $350,000 to petition the Commerce Department for protection, charging that Chinese farmers were selling crawfish below cost. That might seem a bit counterproductive for the state government. "Louisiana taxpayers are, in effect, paying a lawyer in Washington to drive up the price of their gumbo," Mr. Rushford noted."
But it is certainly no odder than the Commerce Department's response. Because China is not a member of the World Trade Organization and is officially viewed as a "nonmarket economy," the department was not required to rely on the actual cost of production to determine the "fair" price of crawfish grown in ponds by Chinese farmers.
Instead, it used the cost of fish caught at sea in "comparable" economies with free markets -- India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. Transport costs within China were estimated from a 1994 newspaper report on trucking costs in India. And for good measure, the bean counters threw in some numbers on the cost of Spanish imports of live crawfish from Portugal.
Absurd? Of course. But legal, according to Lawrence White of New York University's Stern School of Business. "Loony Tunes assumptions" are built into the anti-dumping laws in order to give domestic producers maximum advantage, said Mr. White, the former chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division.
The calculations got the Commerce Department's Import Administration, which generally looks to protectionists in Congress rather than the White House for inspiration, where it wanted to go. The agency has set anti-dumping duties ranging from 85 to 201 percent of the price the Chinese charge, implying that Chinese crawfish farmers have been dumb enough to sell their product for just one-third to two-thirds of production costs.
For the anti-dumping duties to go into effect, the International Trade Commission must also rule that Louisiana producers have been "injured" by Chinese sales. And while the commission is also inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to special-interest pleadings, it has historically been more willing to take the interests of consumers into account, too.
To try to sway the commissioners, lawyers for the Chinese exporters are arguing that the anti-dumping petition was the culmination of a failed campaign by Louisiana business to run up the price of crawfish and to persuade the Chinese to cooperate in cartelizing the market. They introduced a letter from a Louisiana import company, New Phoenix/Sterling, to China's Ambassador to the United States, asking Beijing to lean on crawfish producers to limit exports to three million pounds annually.
"As long as China is working with New Phoenix/ Sterling on the above mentioned base, Chinese crawfish can be in the market for a long time without facing the anti-dumping threat and lose the $10 million/year business," wrote Eugene Ji, the company's president.
The International Trade Commission (or the courts) will have to decide whether the motives of importers are germane to the legal issue of injury. But this relatively minor trade brouhaha does neatly illustrate the core asymmetry built into America's anti-dumping laws. Ford can charge any price to grab market share from Chrysler, unless the intent is to put Chrysler out of business. But foreigners are held to a different standard -- one that puts the Commerce Department in the position of setting and enforcing minimum prices when the low-cost producer is not American.
"The laws invite attempts to monopolize" that would never be tolerated in a purely American industry," Mr. White concluded.

Bond Prices Surge on Favorable Reports About Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities rose strongly yesterday, after the Commerce Department reported that inflation pressures were not building in the second quarter. Securities were also bolstered by an afternoon report citing unnamed Federal Reserve economists as saying strong growth was not really a problem as long as inflation remained tame.
Traders said the market was helped along, as well, by end-of-the- month index buying. 
 Yesterday, the price of a 30-year bond surged 31/32 , to 97 15/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.57 percent, from 6.65 percent on Wednesday and the lowest level in more than a week.
Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, said he was amazed at how much credence market participants put in the report from the unnamed Fed economists.
"Today's data generated a wide variety of crosscurrents for market investors," Mr. Chan said. "On one hand, many investors were relieved to learn that very little damaging information was gleaned from the real gross domestic product report, the widely most anticipated report of the day, while the report on initial unemployment claims first encouraged some caution by investors."
First-time jobless claims dropped by 16,000, to a seasonally adjusted 323,000 in the week ended Aug. 23. Analysts had expected a 7,000 decline.
Mr. Chan said that the positive sentiment in the market stemmed from a huge upward revision in business inventories, which convinced investors that the large inventories might slow future production and, hence, dampen some of the potential inflationary pressures.
Traders also said that investors were seeking the relative safety of short-term Treasuries, because of the turmoil in the stock market.
Other data released yesterday included the Conference Board's help wanted index for July, which was unchanged at 88. Mr. Chan explained that the index remains near its highs for 1996 and still continues to suggest that labor remains fairly tight.
Prices of Government securities were bolstered after a revision in second-quarter G.D.P. to 3.6 percent, lower than the 4 percent some had expected but in line with the 3.5 percent most were expecting.
Also a couple of other minor reports registered declines, which convinced even more investors that moderation was the key rule of the day.
Kenneth J. McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, an economic forecasting firm, said the G.D.P. report gave little reason for the Fed to want to increase interest rates. "Domestic demand is growing at a moderate pace, and the evidence does not yet suggest a strong rebound in consumer spending in the third quarter," he said. "Over all, the Fed has to be extremely happy with this report. The economy grew at a 4.4 percent annual rate in the first half of the year, yet inflation by any and every measure has declined."
Yesterday the Government sold $25 billion of 13-day cash management bills at an average rate of 5.47 percent, which was anticipated. From time to time the government sells cash management bills through auction to meet its short-term cash needs outside the regular borrowing schedule.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 13-day cash management bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Discounted Rate . . . 5.47%

Dollar Falls Against the Mark But Rises a Bit Against the Yen

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the German mark yesterday, hurt by losses in the American stock market and by nagging concerns about a German interest-rate increase.
But the dollar posted modest gains versus the Japanese yen, helped indirectly by renewed focus on Japan's weak economy and the mark's sharp gains against the yen. 
 The dollar was quoted at 1.7961 marks late in the day, down from 1.8025 on Wednesday. It rose to 119.12 yen, from 118.88 yen on Wednesday.
Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, the German central bank, said late on Wednesday that the bank was closely watching a rise in German import prices and that it remained an open question whether the bank would move on interest rates any time soon.
But Mr. Tietmeyer tempered his comment by saying he was happier with the dollar's exchange rate now than he was 10 days ago, when the dollar traded at roughly 1.85 marks. A weak mark drives up the cost of imported goods in Germany.
"They don't see incipient inflation as a big concern, but they do see a relatively strong competitive position of the mark, which is helping exports, but at the same time creating imported inflation," said Diego Giurleo, a vice president at Royal Bank of Canada. "That is what the Bundesbank is looking at right now."
Mr. Giurleo called a rate increase "not totally unlikely" given the concern over imported inflation, though such concern is offset by other fundamentals like Germany's high unemployment, a problem that higher rates would would only aggravate.
Prospects for higher interest rates in Germany joined with a struggling Japanese economy to foster strong buying of marks for yen, traders said. The mark hit a two-month high against the yen, and the dollar rose, too.
Traders said the dollar was held back by a drop in American stocks, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 92.90 points, to 7,694.43. Some investors also continue to book profits from the dollar's sharp gains earlier this year.
"There's so much profit in dollar-mark right now that the long-term players are going to get concerned, just like in the equity market, about just when is a good level to take profits," Mr. Giurleo said.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Furman Selz is joining ING, as takeover candidates dwindle.

BYLINE: By Peter Truell 

 BODY:
COMMERCIAL banks continue to prowl Wall Street for acquisitions, trying to increase their nascent investment banking businesses. In the latest deal, ING Group, the Dutch insurance and banking company, said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Furman Selz L.L.C., a privately held New York securities firm, for $600 million in cash.
ING is one of the largest European financial companies, and has grown aggressively through acquisition. It has made little secret of its ambition to build substantial American investment banking and fund management businesses through both growth and acquisition. It was a disappointed suitor in the recent sales of two other securities firms, Dillon, Read & Company of New York, which is going to the Swiss Bank Corporation, and Montgomery Securities of San Francisco, which is being acquired by Nationsbank. 
 Several other big banks, including Fleet Financial Group, BankBoston and Societe Generale of France showed interest in buying Furman Selz, according to people involved in the sale, and analysts generally expect more such sales of securities firms in the coming months.
Analysts generally seemed neutral about ING's acquisition. "This isn't really big enough to make a difference to ING, but it is big enough to get an investment banking and equity business started in the U.S.," said John Keefe, an independent New York financial analyst who characterized Furman as "a hard-working, fairly creative small company that serves middle-market companies." Mr. Keefe, in common with other analysts, said the price seemed high but noted that few acquisition candidates were left for the many banks interested in entering the New York securities markets.
Like other recent buyers of securities firms, though, ING sought to play down the $600 million price tag, adding that the amount of money that will change hands now is considerably lower. Under its agreement with Furman Selz, ING will pay $333 million now, and the remaining $267 million in three years. That later payment includes $100 million to be distributed to key employees in incentive bonuses. Thus, ING says, the net present value of the purchase is $425 million.
"We want to expand in the U.S. investment banking market and particularly in equity research and underwriting," Cees Maas, ING's chief financial officer, said. The Furman acquisition would almost double ING's presence in the American investment banking market.
Still, ING's stock fell yesterday, despite the fact that the company also posted financial results for the first half of the year that exceeded analyst forecasts.
ING reported net income of 1.94 billion guilders, or $960 million, for the six months that ended on June 30, up from 1.51 billion guilders, or $748 million, in the corresponding period a year earlier. But in Amsterdam, ING's shares fell 3 guilders, to 90.5 guilders, yesterday; the American depository receipts fell 56.25 cents, to $45.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.
As for Furman Selz, Edmund A. Hajim, the firm's chairman, said that there was little overlap between the two companies, adding that he expected no layoffs or cost-cutting. "We're very excited," he said. "This is a new era for Furman Selz. We feel we have found the right partner."
The acquisition will not affect Furman Selz's planned move to a new headquarters at 280 Park Avenue from the current offices at 230 Park Avenue, Mr. Hajim said.
ING has a good record for making its acquisitions work. It has, for example, made a considerable success of its 1995 purchase of Barings, the London investment bank. Barings, which at the time was reeling from huge losses attributed to a trader in Singapore, became the flagship for ING's global investment banking ambitions. The ING Barings investment banking subsidiary now has 1,300 of its 9,000 employees in the United States, with offices in New York, Atlanta, Chicago and Los Angeles.
ING has also been buying American insurers. Last month, it acquired the Equitable Companies of Iowa for $2.2 billion in cash and stock, and has further acquisitions in mind. Aad Jacobs, ING's chairman, said yesterday that the company still had some $2.5 billion to $3 billion available for acquisitions, and indicated that ING was interested in buying a big European bank. ING officials would not disclose what banks it had in mind, but the company is clearly interested in expanding in the Continent's major economies.
"Our next step is to prepare for the further integration in the European markets, and to strengthen our position in the European banking market," Mr. Maas said.

HEADLINE: Loretta Blum, 64, a Luminary of Fashion in Texas

BYLINE: By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO 

 BODY:
Loretta Blum, a fashion retailer in Dallas for more than 20 years, died on Saturday at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. She was 64 and lived in Dallas.
The cause was a stroke, said Bud Knight, a friend and former colleague. 
 At the time of her death, Ms. Blum was operating the Loretta Blum Boutique in Preston Center Plaza. She had no business partners or immediate family, and the boutique will close on Saturday after a memorial service for Ms. Blum.
Ms. Blum became prominent on the Dallas fashion scene with the opening of the first boutique bearing her name in 1973 in the Highland Park area. There she sold the designs of Emanuel Ungaro, Valentino, Krizia, Oscar de la Renta, Scaasi and Franco Moschino, among others. Her clientele, Mr. Knight said, was "the Dallas woman who had a passion for fashion, as she did."
She also opened an Ungaro boutique next door to her main store, a Miss B shop for the younger customer, and a Christofle boutique. Her shops flourished during the Texas boom years of the 1970's and 1980's but succumbed to the economic downturn in the late 80's. Ms. Blum managed to hold on until 1992, when she closed her businesses.
The next year she returned with a boutique in the Lester Melnick store. In 1994 she opened the current Loretta Blum shop.
She had worked as a buyer for Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue before going into business for herself.
Ms. Blum was born in Kehoka, Miss., attended Ohio State University and graduated from the Tobe-Coburn fashion school in New York City.

In East Village, a Spirited Pace for Rental Project Development

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
With strong demand for rentals in Manhattan continuing, development activity is spreading into the East Village, where a nine-story apartment building is under construction and a seven-story structure has just opened for leasing.
"These two buildings are evidence that the rental market is moving back into fringe neighborhoods," said Brian G. Edwards, director of leasing at the Halstead Property Company, pointing to the residential activity in the downtown financial district and in the West 30's and 40's. 
 One of the rental buildings in the East Village, the seven-story Hudson East, at 225 East Sixth Street, started leasing last week. The building occupies part of the site that was the home of the Fillmore East, the storied rock concert hall, and later the Saint, a discotheque. The 86-unit project is being developed by the Hudson Companies of Brooklyn.
The other project, with 85 units, is under way at 94 East Fourth Street. The nine-story building is being developed by Bettina Equities of Manhattan.
The new buildings join a few other rental projects and a spate of renovations that have taken place in recent years in the East Village. Brokers say the area, known for its counterculture character, is becoming an appealing address for young professionals seeking a less costly alternative to neighborhoods like Greenwich Village and SoHo.
Estimates from Community Board 3, which guides growth in the area, are that about six other projects are also in various stages of development in the East Village. The projects could produce more than 200 low-income to market-rate residences, said Susan Vaughn, the board's chairwoman.
Also boding well for the East Village is the economic activity around it with, for example, the continued revival of Union Square and the resurgence of the Lower East Side retail area, where restaurants and retail outlets -- including Tahari and Kenar, which sell women's fashions -- are opening along main corridors like Orchard Street.
In the last year, the upper floors of eight five-story buildings along Orchard Street, long used for storage, also have been converted to about 128 apartments and others are planned, said Matthew A. Bauer, executive director of the Lower East Side Business Improvement District.
The rental market in the East Village is tight, with the vacancy rate under 5 percent, and rents are rising, brokers said. Rents in the area are $1,500 to $1,800 a month for one-bedroom units and $2,200 to $2,500 for two-bedroom apartments, Mr. Edwards of Halstead said. Those rents, he added, are still 10 to 15 percent lower than rents for comparably sized units in established areas like central Greenwich Village and the Upper East and West Sides.
Igal Feibush, a principal of Citi Habitats, a Manhattan residential brokerage concern, said the East Village also has the advantage of being accessible to the commerical cores of midtown and downtown while maintaining a sense of neighborhood.
Cathe Le Blanc, managing director of the rental division at the Corcoran Group, another brokerage concern, said, "What it comes down to is if developers offer the product at a price renters cannot get elsewhere, there will be a draw."
Of the 86 units in Hudson East, the newly completed rental building, most have one and two bedrooms, although there are a few studios and three-bedroom models. Eighty percent of the 438- to 1,556-square foot units are renting at market rates, which start at $1,700 a month for studios, $1,950 for one-bedrooms, $2,350 for two-bedrooms and $3,300 for three-bedrooms, said Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, a residential brokerage company that is the project's leasing agent.
The remaining 20 percent will be subsidized and offered to tenants whose annual incomes are $13,700 to $22,050, depending on family size. Monthly rents for those units are $332 to $510.
Since leasing began at Hudson East, deposits have been taken on more than 60 percent of the market-rate units. "The popularity of the East Village, the shortage of new product and the strength of the city's rental market are the primary driving forces," said William Fowler, a Hudson principal.
Nearby, the Fourth Street building is rising on the site of the old Anderson Theater. Plans call for 85 studio to two-bedroom units, with 400 to 900 square feet each, and 12,000 square feet of first-floor retail space, said Sy Churgin, a principal of Architects Design Group, the project's architect.
The builder last spring redeveloped the four-story building that housed the theater's Second Avenue entry and lobby by adding a fifth floor and creating eight apartments, Mr. Churgin said. The rest of the theater, boarded up for the last two decades, was razed to make way for the new rental building, which is to be completed next spring, he said.
Officials at Bettina Equities, the building's developer, declined to give information about rental rates.

HEADLINE: Bad News Bearers

 BODY:
As usual, Joseph Kennedy didn't get it quite right. The Massachusetts Congressman announced yesterday that he had decided against running for governor. All over Washington, spinmasters will be laughing about how Mr. Kennedy blew a chance for a media age triple play. He could have announced bad news on a Friday, in August, just before a national holiday. Instead he marches out on a Thursday, leaving plenty of time for the high-audience news shows and a weekday paper. Duh.
Look, it's all right with us. Those Friday bombshells are a pain at deadline. They are also a calculated insult to the voters, reflecting the politicians' view that few confessions are so heinous, few blunders so stupid as to be remembered for two whole days. Washington does not believe in much these days, except that soft money is good and that negative news dies fast over a weekend. 
 Dropping news late on a Friday afternoon is a bipartisan Beltway institution. But history will record that it was the Reagan Administration that turned an occasional tactic into a strategic weapon. In 1982 it chose a Friday to announce that Bob Jones University could retain its tax-exempt status despite powerful evidence that it discriminated against blacks. President Reagan used a Friday in 1983 to inform the public that he had ordered 2,000 marines to the Mediterranean to protect the 1,370 marines already ashore in Lebanon. Six months later, in what was regarded by the Democrats as an admission of failure, Mr. Reagan informed Congress -- on a Friday, of course -- that they were coming out.
President Bush invented what reporters called "stealth veto days," which tended to be Black Fridays for the little people. Legislation that authorized higher taxes for millionaires, allowed federally financed abortions, provided additional benefits for the unemployed and required unpaid leave for new parents all fell to the veto pen in the fading light of several Fridays. Right after Tiananmen Square, Mr. Bush used a Friday to lift trade sanctions against two Chinese companies.
The Clinton Administration has built on the lessons of the G.O.P. Most of its incriminating Whitewater news has been dropped on Fridays, including embarrassing admissions about Hillary Clinton's billing records, tax returns dealing with the Clintons' Whitewater investments and, of course, those really lucky commodity trades.
Friday was "don't ask, don't tell" day. The Travelgate report suggesting that there may have been a little politics involved in the messy sacking of the White House transportation staff came out on the Friday before the Fourth of July. Maybe this year will be different. Or maybe, as you read this, somewhere in Washington or perhaps on Martha's Vineyard, employees of your Government are arming fax machines for a 4 P.M. launch. Just in case, let's go to DefCon 4.

HEADLINE: Robert Switzer, Co-Inventor Of Day-Glo Paint, Dies at 83

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Because Bob Switzer fell off a loading dock as a teen-ager six decades ago, Allied troops were not accidentally bombed by their own planes during World War II, boxes of Tide detergent glow on supermarket shelves and black light is big at rock concerts.
Mr. Switzer, who died on Aug. 20, and one of his two brothers invented fluorescent dyes, paints and penetrants that today are marketed under such names as Day-Glo and Magnaflux. Mr. Switzer, who was 83, died of Parkinson's disease at his home in Shaker Heights, Ohio, his daughter, Ann Switzer Swander, said. 
 During the Depression, Mr. Switzer was attending the University of California at Berkeley on a scholarship and had a job unloading crates of food from rail cars for the Safeway grocery store chain when he fell and hit his head on a rail.
Months later he awoke from a coma, his vision blurred. The family doctor recommended a darkened room during recuperation, which led to an interest in ultraviolet light, his youngest brother, Fred, said.
One day in 1934 the youth, who was then 20 and had his health back, and the middle brother, Joseph, who was 18 and a chemistry student at Berkeley, took a black light into the storeroom of their father's drugstore looking for naturally fluorescent organic compounds.
Soon they envisioned brightening up Joseph's amateur magic act and started mixing fluorescent compounds with shellac in the family bathtub, tests that their mother quickly ordered be moved out of the house. Their experiments yielded the first fluorescent paint, which they applied to a mask and headdress, creating for an audience in a darkened auditorium the illusion that a dancer went one way while her head floated off in another direction.
"They immediately realized the economic potential in entertainment and that there would be other opportunities," Brian Switzer, Robert Switzer's son, said.
Soon the brothers were in Cleveland creating all sorts of products, including bright fabric panels that troops in North Africa used to identify themselves as friendly to Allied dive bombers. The material also allowed warplanes to operate at night from aircraft carriers in the Pacific, a capability not enjoyed by the Japanese Navy, whose planes had to land on their carriers before nightfall.
The brothers developed fluorescent inks that bombardiers used during blackouts and fluorescent penetrants to find hidden flaws in machined parts, such as engine pistons and rockets' liquid oxygen tanks.
After the war the two older brothers created their own company in Cleveland, which they eventually named the Day-Glo Color Corporation, and their "coldfire" fluorescents brightened everything from swimsuits to Tide boxes to Hula-Hoops to traffic cones. They also developed fluorescents for the fire retardants that aerial tankers drop on forest fires, allowing the next plane to know where its load is not needed.
Fluorescents differ from ordinary paints in how they are affected by light waves. Ordinary paint absorbs some of the spectrum from white light and reflects the rest; thus, red paint absorbs blue and green wavelengths and reflects red.
Fluorescent paint, however, absorbs energy from short wavelength light (including ultraviolet light) and then re-emits the energy by converting it into photons of longer wavelength. Thus, ultraviolet light goes in and its energy is converted into visible light emitted by the chemicals in the paint, creating the bright fluorescent quality.
Lawrence A. Caughlin, who was for years a Day-Glo executive, said that Mr. Switzer "was a serious, unassuming man who despite his wealth often wore the same checked coat with pants that didn't match and a bow tie, and he didn't care."
Mr. Switzer was also scrupulous about complying with environmental laws, often spending more money than was required to meet the legal minimum standards for pollution control, Tom Gray, the company's longtime counsel, said.
Mr. Switzer's brother Joseph died in 1973. In 1985, with no one in the family interested in the complex chemistry needed to help the business grow, Mr. Switzer retired and Day-Glo was sold, with part of the proceeds being used to create the Robert and Patricia Switzer Foundation, which finances the Switzer Environmental Fellowships and a related program that are administered by the San Francisco Foundation and the New Hampshire Community Foundation. Over the last 11 years about 200 fellows, most of them graduate students in environmental sciences, have received $10,000 grants.
Jane Rogers, a grants officer at the San Francisco Foundation, said that "what Bob saw as an executive of an environmentally regulated company, and as a lifelong environmentalist, was that nobody had the science to answer the questions that arose about regulations. He wanted to advance the environmental science fields by producing practical problem-solvers in those fields as opposed to theoretical researchers."
In addition to his wife of 61 years, Patricia; his son Brian of Strongsville, Ohio; his daughter, Ann Switzer Swander of Ross, Calif., and his brother Fre of Fullerton, Calif., Mr. Switzer is survived by another son, Dr. Paul Switzer of New Bern. N.C.; seven grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.

HEADLINE: Despite New, and Criticized, State Budget, S. & P. Raises Bond Rating

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 28

 BODY:
A major Wall Street firm raised its gauge of New York State's creditworthiness by a notch today, a move that offered a tempered endorsement of Gov. George E. Pataki's fiscal policies.
Even with the improvement, New York remains one of the two lowest-rated states, and analysts say the change is unlikely to have much effect on the cost to the state of borrowing money. 
 The firm, Standard & Poor's, raised its rating for the state's general obligation bonds, the bellwether that is considered a broad gauge of the state's fiscal health, from A-, the lowest rating of any state, to A, tied for the lowest with Louisiana. The firm had downgraded New York's rating in 1990 and 1992. (The highest rating is AAA.)
The timing of the rating change seems paradoxical, coming just after completion of a $67.4 billion state budget that was roundly criticized by independent budget monitors, including credit agencies.
The budget increases spending at double the rate of inflation; it spends $1 billion more than the state will take in for the year; it promises huge tax cuts and spending increases in future years, and it was a record 126 days late.
In fact, the rating shift had little to do with the new budget, said Robin Prunty, a director at Standard & Poor's. The company's report on the change praised just one feature of the budget: its setting aside of more than $900 million to cover expenses next year. Instead, she said, the new rating was prompted by the relative frugality of Mr. Pataki's first two budgets and the flood of revenue the state has received from the nearly three-year-old stock market boom, which produced a $1.4 billion surplus in the last fiscal year.
"The new rating is a reflection of changes that have occurred over a multiyear time frame," Ms. Prunty said. She added a note of caution, saying that recent tax and spending measures signed by the Governor "do pose some risks in the years 2000 and beyond, and that's still a concern to us."
Analysts said that the change was unlikely to affect the state's cost of borrowing money, but Mr. Pataki seized on it as evidence that he has brought some measure of restraint to a state known for late budgets, high spending and large debts, releasing a statement that said, "Our policies continue to pay dividends for the taxpayers of New York State."
The other major municipal credit rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, has given New York the second-lowest rating of any state, ahead of Louisiana. Renee Boicourt, vice president of Moody's, said the firm was unlikely to change its rating of New York's bonds in the near future.
The Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit group that monitors the city and state budgets, took issue with the new credit rating, in light of the new budget. "We look at a budget with a $1 billion deficit, a budget that gives you a $5 billion deficit in 2002, as a disaster, not something to be rewarded," said Cynthia Green, vice president of the commission.
A government agency's credit rating is the primary factor in determining the interest rates it must pay when it sells bonds, which is the way it borrows money. Past changes in the state's credit rating have raised or lowered the price of borrowing by as much as 2 percent, a difference of millions of dollars a year.
But Wall Street analysts said today's move would probably have little or no effect in the bond market because several factors had long moderated Standard & Poor's low rating of New York bonds.
One reason is that Moody's, which uses a different scale, rates New York's general obligation bonds at A2, which is equivalent to an A from Standard & Poor's, so today's action merely brings the two into agreement.
Also, for three years, Standard & Poor's has softened its New York credit rating by attaching to it a "positive outlook," an indication that the firm thought the state's condition was more likely to improve than not.
If there were a change in the interest rate the state paid, it could be particularly significant now, because the Governor and the Legislature have agreed to put on the November ballot a $2.4 billion bond issue, one of the largest in state history, for school construction and rehabilitation.

HEADLINE: Ball Fields For Housing: A Trade-Off Is Contested

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
For all its social problems, like drugs, poverty and unemployment, Harlem has always had one asset lacking in other parts of Manhattan: lots of available, unused land. Over the last 30 years, as landlords abandoned properties, the city turned some of them over to youth baseball leagues, leaving the neighborhood with an unusually large number of diamonds compared with other parts of the borough.
But lately, as Harlem has enjoyed the fruits of economic revival, the city has decided to take back some of that land for housing development. It is a trade-off that some feel the city should not be making, given the scarcity of recreational alternatives for the children of Harlem. 
 The latest dispute concerns the city's plan to build 30 affordable homes on a parcel of city-owned land on 100th Street between First and Second Avenues. Yesterday, some 150 community leaders, along with parents and players from two East Harlem leagues that would be affected, gathered at City Hall to denounce the move.
For the last six years, the 3.5-acre plot has been home to Harlem RBI New York, a nonprofit agency that runs baseball programs and after-school tutorial programs for 300 children. The city's plan could also temporarily close down another field, where 600 children in the East Harlem Little League play, opponents say.
"Nine hundred children are more important than 30 homes, which people in East Harlem cannot afford," said Richard A. Berlin, the executive director of Harlem RBI.
Housing officials say that the city has offered the leagues alternatives: leaving one field at the same site, and relocating the other, to a site 16 blocks away. But the groups have been reluctant to accept the trade-off, citing distance, interrupted play and crowding.
The 100th Street plot was originally cleared for low-income housing 30 years ago. But three lawsuits against the city kept it from development.
In 1991, a group of community volunteers cleaned the garbage-strewn lot and raised $1 million from the private sector to put in the baseball fields, a popular recreational oasis in the neighborhood.
Yesterday, even the threat of rain could not stop the children from their games there. While waiting for lunch of barbecued hot dogs and chips, Christopher Cespedes, 10, Frankie Ortiz, 12, and Isac Asencio, also 12, were anticipating their runs around the bases.
"If I don't play here, I'll be alone at home," Christopher said. "I don't want to stay home."
But earlier this year, the lawsuits against the city were resolved, freeing the land for development.
Richard T. Roberts, the Commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said all the youth leagues understood that their agreement with the city to use the land for baseball was only temporary.
"The site has always been a housing site," Mr. Roberts said. "The city now has the authority to move forward with housing development. They should have consulted with us before putting in all the money."
Mr. Roberts said his agency has offered to convert one of the two Harlem RBI ball fields into a permanent one, next to the new housing. The agency would also relocate the other field, to 111th Street between Park and Madison Avenues, he said: it would expand the lot, now home to a ball field used by the East Harlem Little League, so two fields could be accommodated.
His agency is also working with the Parks Department to add two more ball fields in East Harlem, one in Mount Morris Park, the other on a strip of park land on 96th Street and Second Avenue, near the High School for Cooperative Education, Mr. Roberts said.
"We recognized that the recreational space and the ball field issue is an important one, and we're trying to work through it," Mr. Roberts said. "We're trying to identify sites and figure out how these things will be financed. We're serious about it."
But both Mr. Berlin and Olga Seda, who is on the board of East Harlem Little League, say they are unconvinced about the deal.
Mr. Berlin said that the 100th Street site would be too crowded for both a ball field and the housing development.
And, he added, there is no guarantee that the swap would not disrupt the playing season.
Work to expand the 111th Street field would, in the meantime, shut down the field used by the East Harlem Little League, Mrs. Seda said.
They also said that neither the Housing Department nor the Parks Department has come up with concrete plans to pay for the additional ball parks.

HEADLINE: New Jersey and New York Plan Harbor Cleanup

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

 BODY:
The Governors of New York and New Jersey joined with Federal environmental officials yesterday to unveil an ambitious plan to help restore and protect New York Harbor, the rivers and streams that empty into it, and the ocean waters stretching from Montauk Point, N.Y., to Cape May, N.J.
It is the first time that both states have agreed on a comprehensive regional approach to clean up the harbor and ocean waters. The plan, which is the culmination of almost eight years of discussion and debate, will cost billons of dollars and take almost two decades to implement fully. 
 Although the plan does not impose any new regulations or include any new state or Federal dollars, it will serve as a blueprint and a guide for government officials and environmental groups reviewing existing regulations and looking to spend dollars on the cleanup.
Both New York and New Jersey have agreed to implement 75 percent of the report's 380 specific recommendations, which vary from tightening limits on copper and mercury levels from municipal wastewater plants to preserving habitats for shore birds and other wildlife in Jamaica Bay and the Arthur Kill off Staten Island.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and Gov. George E. Pataki reached agreement on the plan in the spring, but unveiled it yesterday during a news conference at Battery Park City, with New York Harbor and the Statue of Liberty as a backdrop.
"Our estuary and ocean waters will be healthy because we are going to work together, New Jersey and New York and the Federal Goverment, to build on the successes we have already achieved individually," Governor Whitman said. "And the results of this partnership will be impressive."
Governor Pataki said he was confident that the plan would lead to significant improvement in water quality and natural habitat. "You'll see a resurgence in the waterfronts of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Staten Island and New Jersey."
Since 1992, the two states and the Federal Government have made tremendous strides in cleaning up the harbor and waterways. Steps have also been taken to reduce the amount of debris washing up on beaches. But serious problems persist.
The fish and shellfish population, which continues to decline, is often found to be contaminated. Beaches are sometimes closed to swimmers because of high bacteria levels in the water.
The most costly recommendation in the plan is for both states to address the biggest source of fecal bacteria in the New York Harbor Harbor area and the New York Bight: combined-sewer overflows. The Whitman administration has pledged to spend more than $1.1 billion to improve municipal systems in which combined sewer and storm drains discharge raw sewage into the waterways during heavy rains. New York City is to spend up to $5 billion to make similar improvements.
The plan does not offer a solution, however, for what some environmentalists and economists say is the most pressing problem facing New York Harbor today. And that is what to do about the mud, tainted with industrial pollutants, that is dredged from the harbor to deepen shipping channels and help maintain the harbor as a world-class port.
Beginning on Sept. 1, the dredged mud can no longer be deposited in a century-old dump six miles east of Sandy Hook, N.J., because of stricter Federal environmental standards. Officials from both states, which share the economic benefits of the harbor, are still trying to come up with a long-term plan to find a new dump for the more than 3 million tons of tainted mud dredged each year.
But the new plan is aimed at reducing some of the pollutants that now flow into the harbor from the silt-laden Hudson, Hackensack, Passaic and Raritan Rivers. For the first time, state and Federal officials said, there is a strong commitment by both states to enhance monitoring of toxic chemicals in the waterways, and to track down and eliminate the sources that they are coming from. The toxic chemicals not only contaminate fish and shellfish, causing restrictions on consumption, but also contaminate the sediment, limiting the options for its disposal.
The new plan, covering 26,000 square miles of ocean and estuary, also covers the preservation and restoral of habitats for wildlife. As an example, the plan recommends the construction of fish ladders to help species like herring and shad make their way upstream to spawn.
Dennis J. Suszkowski, science director for the Hudson River Foundation, praised the plan. "It is very important because it is a long-term commitment to cleaning up the harbor and the estuary," he said. "There are a lot of problems that are out there that have not been resolved."
But Benjamin Longstreth, a spokesman for the Baykeeper program of the American Littoral Society, based in Sandy Hook, N.J., said he believed that the plan could have gone further.
"The real key is going to be the implementation of it," he said. "It could make great strides towards improving the health of the harbor and the estuary."
Jeanne M. Fox, regional administrator for the U.S. Department of Environmental Protection, called implementation of the plan "quite a challenge."
"However, I am confident that with the commitment from the states, local governments, and others," Ms. Fox said, "we will achieve our objectives for a vital environment and a vital economy."

HEADLINE: North Koreans Seek Famine's Antidote in U.S.

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: KENYON, Minn., Aug. 26

 BODY:
Choe Kang Ryong was a long way from the scorched cornfields, ruined rice paddies and hungry, skeletal children of North Korea. Alone and silent, he stood for a little while today on the edge of hundreds of acres of healthy corn, food for the plump hogs of the Cannon Valley Cooperative. Wading into the dense bumper crop that closed over his head, the slender North Korean reached down to crumble the soil. He felt the girth of a strong green stalk.
"They seem to like the farm," a co-op manager remarked to an American colleague. 
 Mr. Choe is director of seed production and management in the Agricultural Commission of North Korea. For a week, he and five colleagues -- two livestock specialists, a crop production official and two economic advisers to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Pyongyang -- are touring America to see how and why farming works the way it does here.
Their visit, organized by a North Korean-born American seed expert from Minnesota, Pilju Kim Joo, is a first. When Dr. Joo, an agricultural consultant who has been visiting North Korea regularly since 1994, proposed the trip, it was a gamble. But to her surprise, Pyongyang responded quickly and affirmatively.
North Korea is desperate. Two years of floods, a summerlong drought and decades of economic mismanagement by a totalitarian leftist Government that thought it did not need the outside world has left North Koreans malnourished and facing famine -- and the crisis has not yet bottomed out, international aid organizations say. Seventy percent of the North Korean corn crop may already be lost, raising fears about how millions of people will feed themselves this winter.
The officials on this trip told of useless irrigation pumps disabled by an absence of spare parts, deforested and eroding hillsides planted with the wrong crops, cutworms devouring fields because there are no pesticides and seed corn of such low quality that it is sowed in practice patches from which green survivors are later transplanted to the real cornfields. Double cropping -- planting one grain in summer and another in winter on the same field -- is still experimental.
This week, notebooks in hand, the North Koreans have scribbled their way through a goat farm, a pig nursery, genetics laboratories, seed stores, grain elevators and dairies. They have plowed on foot through thigh-high prairie grassland to ask questions and take notes on a herd of beef cattle grazing on ranch land beyond where the dirt road ends. They also staggered through the Minnesota State Fair.
Next stop is Missouri and after that Georgia, where another Korean-American, Park Han Sik, director of the University of Georgia's Center for Global Issues, will be the host.
Mr. Choe, 54, had one word today for what he's been seeing. "Impressive," he said as he traveled along another spacious freeway to another neat Midwestern town under its shade trees. He also had a word for himself: "Envious."
In a week when North Korean diplomatic defections were in the news, the agriculture team is traveling largely unattended, although it is assumed that at least one of them is watching the others.
North Korea and the United States do not have diplomatic relations, but the visitors were issued American visas in Beijing. The Clinton Administration has pledged about $100 million in emergency food aid to North Korea, $55 million of which in grains being distributed by five agencies: Amigos Internationales, CARE, Catholic Relief Services, Mercy Corps and World Vision. Dr. Joo is a consultant for the last two groups.
Dr. Joo, a former seed company executive who is now vice president of Agglobe Technologies, a consulting firm in Minneapolis, had to raise the money for the North Koreans' visit to Minnesota from private sources. She also collects money and donations of seed and other farming material and equipment for the North Koreans because trading with North Korea is prohibited by an American embargo.
The North Koreans said they were given 10 days' notice that they were going to the United States, news that shocked their families, one said. North Koreans are more accustomed to trips to Cuba and Vietnam or other third-world nations. Mr. Choe remembers going to Ghana to teach traditional farming methods. Until the early 1970's, when the North Korean economy began its steady decline, Dr. Joo said, North Koreans compared their living standards favorably with those of South Korea. The gap is now huge.
Here in Minnesota, Mr. Choe and his teammates have collected a lot of statistics, an impressive reading list and a few books from teaching institutions and farmers' shelves -- all in English, a language only one of the officials reads. They all acquired baseball caps from the University of Minnesota, a gift from Kent Crookston, head of the department of agronomy and plant genetics, who opened his laboratories to them.
The North Koreans have asked a lot of questions that dance around the one important lesson of this visit that may be most difficult to absorb: Minnesota's green wealth has its roots in independent farming families, in self-help cooperatives and lately in private research paid for by seed and pharmaceutical companies. Government may have a role -- at the University of Minnesota, the Koreans learned about land-grant colleges -- but not the role they know.
North Korea has a rigid state economy. An official tried to explain its relation to agriculture today during a conversation about the American cooperative movement and the very different North Korean cooperative farm, where production goals and methods are determined by the Government. "We have no private farmers," he said. "We have cooperatives. Of course, the farmer joins voluntarily."
The North Koreans asked many questions about productivity: "How many people does it take to raise this many pigs?" "How many farmers work on this field?"
Often the answers seemed to puzzle them: "A guy and his family." "The farmer and maybe two sons."
Dr. Joo, 60, who grew up in South Korea after the Korean War and came to the United States as a student in 1962, says that the North Korean worker is as good as any in Asia, with a strong work ethic and easy grasp of new technologies. The North Koreans are just short of many things. One of them is an understanding of what makes economies take off.
"A centralized economy is good up to a point for poor countries," she said. "Then you need human desire -- the drive for a superior life style, a better life. Growth comes with desire."
Dr. Joo, who received a Ph.D. from Cornell, said that for the moment, North Koreans are limited to carrying out the policies of the founding "Great Leader," Kim Il Sung, or his son and heir, Kim Jong Il.
In what were almost literally his last words before his death in 1994, Kim Il Sung was reported to have urged greater productivity in agriculture and the greater use of livestock "to turn grass into milk and meat." That left a good deal of room, and the North Koreans are apparently no longer afraid to interpret.
Mr. Choe, for example, talked today about how impressed he was with the ingenuity demonstrated by Vincent Maefsky of the Poplar Hill Dairy Goat Farm in Scandia, Minn., who had designed his own mechanical milking system for maximum efficiency. Through interpreters, Mr. Maefsky, who was born in Brooklyn, convinced Mr. Choe that bringing grain and grass to the goats rather than taking the goats out to pasture meant that more goats could be raised more efficiently in a relatively small space.
Dr. Joo said that she and her husband, Young Don Joo, a South Korean-born livestock trader in the Midwest, were members of the last generation of Koreans to remember the country whole, before the Korean war in the 1950's, and she makes a point of bringing young Koreans from North and South together whenever she can. This week, she invited a South Korean researcher at the University of Minnesota, Huh Ho Kil, to talk to the visitors on his specialty, soil. He didn't realize until just before the lecture that his audience would be North Koreans.
"I couldn't believe it; I had never met North Koreans," he said later, when he and a few South Korean agronomy students joined the visitors at the Joo home for a Korean dinner prepared with the help of Korean restaurants and a Korean American professor of veterinary science who wanted the visitors to feel at home in Minneapolis. The atmosphere was relaxed, the conversation only gently probing. There were drinks, toasts and general merriment. Both sides said later that Korea would someday be reunited and that they were eager to know their estranged neighbors.
Over lunch that day, Dr. Huh had struck up a conversation with the North Korean party's soil specialist.
"I looked at them and talked with them," Dr. Huh said. "And I saw in them something of me."
"They did not have horns," he said, laughing and holding fingers up over his ears. "They did not have horns."

HEADLINE: Alabama G.O.P. Governor Sees a Different New South

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: MONTGOMERY, Ala.

 BODY:
As Republican governors have taken control of statehouses around the South, their most exalted models have been Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, two former Governors who built broad support by moving aggressively to improve education and to recruit industry.
But here in Alabama, a state with a history of go-their-own-way governors, Fob James Jr. is defiantly bucking the pattern. While other governors open their treasuries to industrial prospects, Mr. James has attacked big tax breaks and other economic incentives as "corporate welfare." While others emphasize education, Mr. James has suggested shrinking the state's expansive university system by 10 percent. 
 Ask Alabamians how they regard Mr. James these days, and they are likely to revisit his February threat to use the National Guard to block a court order demanding the removal of the Ten Commandments from a Gadsden courtroom. Or they may mention the 34-page letter he recently sent to a Federal judge arguing that the Constitution's Bill of Rights did not apply to the states.
They will chortle over his Fob isms, like this summer's recommendation that state workers study the Waffle House chain, the Governor's favorite restaurant, as a model for government efficiency and consistency. "They're all good," Mr. James told the state personnel board. "That's the thing I like about it. There ain't no surprises."
Concerned that Mr. James's style and his emphasis on states' rights are only accentuating Alabama's image as a backwater and discouraging economic development, the state's industrial recruiters have grown increasingly critical of the Governor. And only a year before he faces re-election, Mr. James is beginning to alienate the state's normally Republican business leaders.
One little-known Republican businessman, Lewis Leslie McAllister Jr., a manufacturer of shower doors, has already announced a primary challenge. A more prominent Republican, Winton Blount 3d, a former chairman of the Business Council of Alabama and of the State Republican Party's finance committee, is considering running.
There are other signs of disunity. Republican lawmakers recently rejected the Governor's call for a slight decrease in college financing in a special legislative session. When Mr. James wrote his letter challenging the Federal courts' jurisdiction over the states, Alabama's Attorney General, Bill Pryor, a fellow Republican, quickly declared that the Governor's views "do not state the legal position of the State of Alabama."
And while most political analysts believe Mr. James will be difficult to defeat next year, 49 percent of 407 Alabamians questioned in a recent poll, including 30 percent of Republicans, said they would vote for someone other than Mr. James. The poll's margin of sampling error was plus or minus five percentage points.
Such intraparty dissent is becoming more common as Republicanism gains momentum in the South. In South Carolina this year, Gov. David Beasley, a Republican, called for the Confederate battle flag to be lowered from atop the State Capitol, only to have legislators from his own party quickly bury the proposal.
Some political scientists see such fractures as signs of the maturation of Republican politics in the South. In Alabama, the party now claims six out of eight state constitutional officers, both United States Senators and five out of seven members of Congress.
"It shows the growth of the Republican Party in one way because they have the luxury of some disunity now," said William H. Stewart, the chairman of the political science department at the University of Alabama. "They feel they can afford to speak out without giving advantage to the Democrats."
To Alabamians who remember Gov. George C. Wallace, Mr. James's brand of populism has a familiar feel, even if his defense of states' rights is rooted in religion rather than race.
In late June, Mr. James wrote Judge Ira DeMent of Federal District Court, asking him to reverse a decision that struck down a 1993 state law intended to restore voluntary prayer to Alabama schools.
In his letter, Mr. James argued that the Supreme Court had overstepped its authority in separating church and state.
"The Supreme Court recognizes no authority greater than itself," he wrote. "Not the Constitution. Not the Almighty. In the name of separation of church and state, the Court seeks to rule the church. It tells the believing community -- the church -- where and when they may not pray. How dangerous a situation when human government steps over this line."
Judge DeMent responded by reminding Mr. James that the Supreme Court's primacy on constitutional interpretation was established in 1803. The Governor's request, he wrote in denying Mr. James's motion, "threatens to erode this principle and, consequently, poses a serious threat to our system of democratic self-government."
The Governor, an Episcopalian, has made no secret of his belief that religion has a role in public life. His legal adviser, Bill Gray, came under attack last year after it was disclosed that he questioned judicial candidates about their religious preferences and churchgoing.
And when one state judge ordered another state judge to remove the Ten Commandments from his courtroom wall, Mr. James said he would call out the National Guard to defend the tablets. If the Supreme Court eventually orders the removal of the tablets, Mr. James said in a recent interview, "I won't obey that order unless I have a call from the President to do it."
To many prominent Alabamians, Mr. James's positions on the Bill of Rights and the Ten Commandments were final straws.
"Why he does some of these things is beyond me," said David G. Bronner, a political independent who served as Mr. James's finance director in a previous James administration and is now chief executive officer of the state's public employees pension fund. "He focuses on things that, at best, the public may like to hear but in reality do not do much for a poor state. It has a lot of the same synergies of the Wallace era: get people all riled up and not accomplish anything."
In the interview, the 62-year-old Governor, who was born Forrest H. and inherited a family nickname, made it clear that he was not much concerned about his state's image. An All-American halfback at Auburn University who made a fortune by manufacturing plastic-coated barbells, Mr. James said that industrial prospects looked far more carefully at the bottom line than at the outside perception of a state.
"Maybe they think people come in because of the way the government combs its hair," Mr. James said of the state's economic development recruiters. "I think it has to do with return on investment."
As for his critics, Mr. James said: "They can keep squawking. I like for those kind of people to squawk, the louder the better."
Even Mr. James's opponents do not question the earnestness of his commitment to the issues he has embraced. And they acknowledge that his stands appeal to a large segment of Alabama's electorate.
Merle Black, an Emory University political scientist and an authority on Southern Republican politics, said Mr. James and his ideological soul mate, Gov. Kirk Fordice of Mississippi, had adopted a "hard right, almost primitive Republicanism aimed at attracting huge majorities of white voters who are primarily concerned with cultural issues."
The instinct to give those voters what they want, Mr. Black suggested, may explain Mr. James's reintroduction of chain gangs for state inmates, his support for voluntary school prayer, his expenditure of $3,000 in state money to send biology teachers a book on creationism and his encouragement to teachers to give troublesome students "a pop on the fanny." Speaking to pastors last November, Mr. James offered this solution to the problem of youth violence: "A good butt-whipping and then a prayer is a wonderful remedy."
In one of his few racially charged stands, Mr. James has asserted that it was a mistake four years ago for the state to accede to a state court's ruling that the Confederate battle flag be lowered from atop the State Capitol.
In the interview, Mr. James said he was not convinced that the flag offended the state's black population.
"Does it?" he asked. "Maybe it does. Maybe it doesn't. I don't know that."
He added: "I think it's a sick form of political correctness for everybody to act like they're offended because history is portrayed like history was."
When confronted with criticism of his economic development efforts, Mr. James points to the state's unemployment rate of 4.5 percent, the lowest in 20 years and among the lowest in the South. The national unemployment rate in July was 4.8 percent. Mr. James also notes that new industrial investment in 1995, his first year in office, was nearly $3.8 billion, the highest in 14 years.
But industrial recruiters in Alabama attribute that spike to Mr. James's predecessor, James E. Folsom Jr., who lured a Mercedes-Benz manufacturing plant to Vance, Ala., with nearly $300 million in government incentives. In 1996, investment dropped to $2.6 billion. And Thomas A. Harris, senior managing director of Merchant Capital, an investment banking firm in Montgomery that underwrites industrial bond deals around the South, predicted that investment would drop by at least another $1 billion in 1997.
When the Economic Development Association of Alabama surveyed 400 members at its July meeting about their most pressing concerns, a majority listed Mr. James's inattentiveness to recruiting industry as their top complaint.
Economic development officials say that while Mr. James will make calls to prospects when asked, he rarely takes the initiative. And by the Governor's own admission, he has "trashed" the state's incentive program by eliminating a number of provisions, including one that allowed relocating companies to keep state taxes they normally would have paid.
That move, the development officials said, was the equivalent of unilateral disarmament for a state like Alabama. They accuse the Governor of squandering a unique opportunity to capitalize on the Mercedes deal by using the auto maker's decision to put a plant in the state as a marketing tool.
"We're not even talking to the prospects because they're not coming," Mr. Harris said. "That's the problem. It's hard to swing at a pitch when you're in the dugout."
Mr. James has switched parties twice, from Republican to Democrat in the early 1970's, before his first successful run for Governor in 1978 (he served one term and chose not to run again), and then back to Republican before winning again in 1994. With the business community grumbling, that rootlessness may make it more difficult for Mr. James to caulk the growing fissures in his party, political scientists said.
And Q. Whitfield Ayres, a Republican pollster in Atlanta, said many of Mr. James's stands on social issues were harmful to the party because they "evoke all the most negative stereotypes of the Old South."
There is nothing wrong with Republicans talking about social issues, Mr. Ayres said. But Mr. James is talking about them, he said, "in a way that makes it easy for the anti-Southern snobs to say, 'See, nothing's changed.' "

HEADLINE: Low Inflation Seen Amid Solid Growth In Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28

 BODY:
The economy grew at a 3.6 percent annual pace during the spring, far higher than the 2.2 percent rate estimated a month ago, the Government said today. Even with the more robust growth, inflation remained subdued during the second quarter.
The report on gross domestic product -- the total output of goods and services within the nation's borders -- was the latest to show the economy continuing to grow robustly despite earlier predictions of a sharper slowdown from the first quarter's 4.9 percent annual rate. A report last week showing a marked narrowing of the nation's trade deficit in June also pointed to a pickup in economic strength. 
 Today's G.D.P. revision was the sharpest in three and a half years. The Commerce Department gives three G.D.P. estimates each quarter as more information becomes available. The final second-quarter revision is due on Sept. 26.
What was remarkable about today's data was that despite the higher estimate of growth, the G.D.P. deflator, a measure of inflation followed by many on Wall Street, increased at a 1.5 percent pace in the second quarter, up slightly from a previous calculation of 1.4 percent and the lowest since 1964.
The signs of moderate inflation and relief that the revised growth number was not closer to the 4.9 percent annual rate recorded in the first quarter of 1997 prompted a rally in the bond market, pushing yields lower. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a benchmark for consumer and corporate loans -- fell to its lowest level in more than a week.
Despite the relief that growth was not faster, a case is building for the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates to prevent unsustainably rapid growth from reviving inflation, analysts said.
The economy "is just whirling along," said M. Kathryn Eickhoff, a New York consultant, "way over the speed limit."
Federal Reserve policy makers next meet on Sept. 30.
"I think they're going to be concerned," Ms. Eickhoff added, about an economy growing perhaps twice as fast as growth in the labor force and productivity allow even if inflation, a lagging indicator, remains tame.
Paul W. Boltz, an economist at T. Rowe Price, mostly agreed, although he pointed to a huge buildup in inventories seen in the report, which will restrain growth in coming months. Inventories rose in the second quarter at a $77.7 billion annual rate instead of a rate of $66.8 billion -- the fastest pace since 1984. A backup in goods means that production could slow later in the year unless consumer spending picks up.
Indeed, today's report, Mr. Boltz said, "explains how the unemployment rate was able to drop as much as it did," to 4.9 percent for the April-June period from 5.3 percent in the first quarter.
But John Ryding, a senior economist at Bear, Stearns, contended that a new era had arrived, one in which strong growth and low inflation can coexist indefinitely.
Low inflation has been a result in part of "how much corporations are focusing on costs and putting the savings into investments" in new equipment, he said.
Business raised such investment at a 23.8 percent pace during the second quarter, today's report showed, up from the initial estimate of 20.4 percent and more than triple the first-quarter increase. This also represented the biggest surge in 14 years.
But the chief contributors to the 1.4-point, or $25.4 billion, revision in G.D.P. were exports of goods and services and inventories. Each of these was $10.9 billion higher, on an annual basis, than first estimated, with the inventory surge the biggest since the summer of 1984.
Personal spending was raised $2.1 billion through the revision, but that growth was still less than one-fifth of the increase in the first three months of the year.
As for the related inflation, the price index for gross domestic purchases rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter instead of the six-tenths of 1 percent estimated a month ago. This was far less than the 1.9 percent first-quarter pace, mainly reflecting a sharp drop in energy prices.
In its first estimate of corporate profits for the spring quarter, the department reported that growth slowed to 1.9 percent from 4.3 percent for profits from current production but rose 1.6 percent from six-tenths of 1 percent when gauged by current-production cash flow.
Confirming that the labor market remains tight, the Labor Department reported today that first-time applicants for unemployment benefits fell by 16,000 last week, to 323,000, a larger decline than expected. The four-week moving average, however, climbed 12,250, to 320,750.
The Conference Board's index of help wanted advertising was unchanged at 88 in July, remaining in the upper part of a narrow band over the last three years.

HEADLINE: Girl, 2, Slain For Crying, Officials Say

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
A 2-year-old girl found battered, unconscious and hemorrhaging internally in her Brooklyn home on Wednesday was beaten to death, apparently because she would not stop crying, investigators said yesterday as the child's mother and her boyfriend were charged with her killing.
An autopsy showed that the victim, Brenda Pena, suffered fatal lacerations of the pancreas, liver, small intestine and other organs and bled internally, as a result of "multiple blunt impacts to the torso," said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the New York City Medical Examiner's office, which ruled the death a homicide. 
 After a day of questioning, the girl's mother, Irene Loriano, 21, of 563 Crescent Street in East New York, and her boyfriend, Donald Coad, 21, of 108 Avenue D in Manhattan, were taken to the 75th Precinct station in Brooklyn and booked on homicide and other charges.
Investigators said both had made statements indicating that Mr. Coad had become enraged and beaten the girl Wednesday morning because she would not stop crying. When Brenda fell unconscious, the investigators said, someone in the household called the police, and the Emergency Medical Service took the child to Brookdale Hospital Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead on arrival.
In the tragic lists of fatal child abuse in New York City, where the perils of growing up in households tormented by alcohol, drug abuse and other problems are legion, the most common evil may be the senseless battering of infants by mothers' boyfriends, often because of a child's crying, officials say.
"It's fairly common," said one investigator, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "There's often a history of domestic violence, and it extends to a child. Men have this power."
It was unclear if drugs or alcohol had any role in Brenda Pena's death. And while some investigators said there were no signs of long-term abuse of the girl, other officials said that doctors at Brookdale had found bruises on her body in various stages of healing. These bruises did not necessarily indicate long-term abuse, but doubts remained.
However, the family had not come to the notice of child-welfare officials. "There was no prior report of abuse or neglect regarding the mother or this child," said Maggie Lear, a spokeswoman for the city's Administration for Children's Services, which began an inquiry. She said that Brenda's 4-year-old brother, who has been placed in foster care, showed no signs of abuse or neglect.
Brenda Pena, who was born in February 1995, lived with her mother, brother and an aunt in a neighborhood of well-kept, two-story brick houses. Neighbors, stunned at news of her death, recalled a little girl who frequently played with other children in a yard behind the house on Crescent Street, or toddled along with her mother to the store.
At 11:20 A.M. on Wednesday, a caller, described only as a member of the victim's household, brought the police and an Emergency Medical Service team to the family's first-floor apartment. They found Brenda unconscious; her torso, arms and back were streaked with dark bruises. "She had been very badly beaten," said an official familiar with the investigation, who also insisted on anonymity.
The medical team administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation at the apartment, investigators said. But efforts to save her life were unsuccessful.
After making statements yesterday, investigators said, Mr. Coad was charged with three counts of homicide -- one of intentional killing, one of causing the girl's death by depraved indifference and one of causing the death of a person under 11 by depraved indifference. The charges carry varying penalties, up to 25 years to life in prison.
Ms. Loriano was charged with criminally negligent homicide, an accusation that she failed to protect the child in a deadly situation, a Class E felony with a maximum penalty of four years in prison. Both suspects were charged with endangering the welfare the child, a misdemeanor.
Little was known yesterday about the nature or duration of the mother's relationship with Mr. Coad. A woman who said she was a sister of Mr. Coad said in a brief telephone interview that he had never before been in trouble, though he was an unemployed school dropout.
Asked if her brother had a temper or was subject to angry outbursts, the woman said: "Only if somebody wears his pants." Asked what she meant, she said, 'You know, if you put on my shirt, I get angry."

Yale Appointee to Lead Local and State Affairs

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
Yale University yesterday named Bruce Alexander, an expert in urban real estate ventures and redevelopment, as its vice president and director of New Haven and state affairs.
Mr. Alexander, a Yale alumnus, retired in January 1996 as senior vice president and director of new business for the Rouse Corporation, having served 15 years as director of the company's commercial development division. 
 Mr. Alexander was responsible for Rouse's retail and mixed-use properties throughout the United States. Among the projects developed under his direction were the South Street Seaport in lower Manhattan, Harborplace in Baltimore, Grand Avenue in Milwaukee, Pioneer Place in Portland, Ore., and Riverwalk in New Orleans.
"This appointment reinforces this administration's commitment to the economic and human development of the city and region," President Richard C. Levin of Yale said in announcing the appointment.
Yale, in recent years, has been working on revitalizing the city by drawing in retail outlets and encouraging Yale faculty and staff to purchase homes in New Haven.
Mr. Alexander, who graduated from Yale in 1965, is the founding chairman of the university's New Haven urban advisory committee and is a member of the Yale Corporation's buildings and ground committee. He will assume the new position in May.

Serbs Fight NATO Troops; 2 Americans Are Hurt
In Brcko, Bosnia and Herzegovina, hundreds of angry Serbs confronted American peacekeeping troops who were trying to wrest control of the town's police station from forces loyal to Radovan Karadzic, the wartime Bosnian Serb leader. Two American soldiers were hurt. A1 

 The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, tried to end speculation that American troops were preparing to join a NATO mission to apprehend major war crimes suspects in Bosnia, insisting again that American soldiers are be ill-suited for the role. A6
 
Tensions at Zionism Centenary
The recent disputes over money from Nazis and Holocaust victims stored in Swiss banks loomed over a conference in Basel to mark the 100th anniversary of Zionism. Hate mail sent to the vice president of the Swiss Jewish Federation reflects a deterioration in Switzerland's relationship with Jews, Israel and America since the Swiss handling of the money became an issue. A1
 
Rabin Considered Ceding Golan
In secret talks in 1994, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel told the American Secretary of State that he could consider a peace with Syria in which Israel would withdraw to pre-1967 borders, effectively ceding the Golan, a former Israeli official said. Mr. Rabin's purported willingness to discuss such a plan went well beyond what has widely been understood to have been his position. A3
 
Suspicious Blast in Russia
The Clinton Administration said Russia may have detonated a nuclear weapon on a remote Arctic island in spite of its support for a moratorium on nuclear tests. The officials said "a seismic event" took place on Aug. 16 near Novaya Zemlya, a nuclear testing site. Moscow denied the suggestion that it had tested nuclear weapons. A7
 
U.N. Restricts Angolan Rebels
Frustrated by years of fruitless efforts to lure the Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi to cooperate with the Government of Angola, the Security Council voted to impose an international travel ban on all senior officials of Mr. Savimbi's organization. The Council also voted to prohibit flights to areas under rebel control and banned certain contracts for the Savimbi forces. A8
 
France Admits 2d-Rate Status
France, in a rare admission that it was a second-ranking power, would accept the global supremacy of the United States "without acrimony," Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine told an annual conference of French ambassadors, though he said the nation would oppose Washington when legitimate interests were at stake. While Mr. Vedrine said Paris should maintain an open and friendly dialogue with Washington, his remarks were an unusual admission for France, which often portrays itself as a rival in world diplomacy.

Affirmative Action Ban Begins
California's ban on preferences went haltingly into effect almost a year after voters approved a sweeping end to affirmative action programs in the state. With issues of the law still to be decided by state appellate courts and the United States Supreme Court, the day was marked by protests and quiet celebration, but also by a great deal of confusion.

Newt Gingrich, Paleontologist
Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, took one of his oddest detours ever from politics, interrupting a two-week-long national tour to fulfill a lifelong fantasy -- digging for dinosaur bones -- which he pursued with such dogged determination that he refused to leave a private ranch just east of Bozeman, Mont., until he came up with a find.

Scientists Find a Sun in Flux
Scientists have discovered immense "rivers" of hot, electrically charged gas flowing beneath the surface near the polar regions of the Sun, a surprising phenomenon that could help them understand sunspots and other disturbances that often cause electromagnetic storms and power failures on Earth. In their analysis of observations by a European-American spacecraft, the scientists also have determined that the entire outer layer of the Sun, to a depth of at least 15,000 miles, is slowly flowing from the equator to the poles.

Police Charge 'Zoo Crew' With Running Drug Ring
Many people in the poor sections of Newark saw the "Zoo Crew" as young, community-minded entrepreneurs who, in addition to bringing shiny new businesses to boarded-up blocks, donated money for basketball clinics for neighborhood children. But authorities said an 18-month investigation had shown that the Zoo Crew was, in fact, a drug gang that used its businesses as fronts for a "sophisticated and lucrative" street trade in cocaine and heroin. Armed with arrest warrants, some 200 law-enforcement agents raided 13 locations and arrested 21 people, seizing cash, weapons and thousands of vials of heroin and cocaine. A1

Deal Spotlights New Shrewdness in Detective Business

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
Jules B. Kroll has made a career of directing delicate and confidential investigations. Most often his clients have been foreign governments, major Wall Street firms and the biggest corporations.
But for several months this year, he engaged in a quiet operation for perhaps the most important clients of all: he and his colleagues. The operation ended with Mr. Kroll's backing away from a merger deal with an old friend and going with another suitor who had offered considerably more money and authority. 
 Mr. Kroll shook hands with his friend Derek V. Smith last December on a plan to fuse Kroll Associates, the world's leading business investigations firm, with Mr. Smith's big insurance data collection organization, which was about to be spun off from the consumer credit checking company, Equifax Inc. In April, they publicly announced their intentions.
But beginning early in the year, Mr. Kroll was courted relentlessly by Thomas O'Gara, an Ohio entrepreneur who made a small fortune building bombproof, bulletproof limousines and wanted to be a big player in the more glamorous side of the corporate security industry. By all accounts, Mr. Kroll, whose firm tracked down Saddam Hussein's hidden fortune and helped redo security at the World Trade Center after the bombing in 1993, repeatedly told Mr. O'Gara that he expected to go through with the deal with Mr. Smith.
But Mr. O'Gara did not take no for an answer, and Mr. Kroll never entirely closed the door. After several meetings and phone calls with Mr. Kroll and his bankers this summer, Mr. O'Gara, chairman of the company, and his brother Bill, who served as chief executive, sweetened their proposal with an offer to put Mr. Kroll in charge of a new combined company to be called Kroll-O'Gara.
The final deal represents something of a coming of age not only for Kroll Associates but also for many in the investigations industry that Mr. Kroll pioneered. "Corporate entities are starting to understand the value of what Jules does and what we do," said Terry Lenzner, a former Watergate investigator and founder of Investigative Group in Washington.
Three days after the O'Garas made their final pitch, Mr. Kroll, over dinner at an East Side restaurant, told Mr. Smith the original deal was off. "It was probably the most difficult dinner of my life," Mr. Kroll said the other day at his glass and steel office tower on Third Avenue near East 56th Street in Manhattan.
Mr. Smith, while disappointed, said he had no hard feelings and planned to continue working with Kroll. "I respect Jules," he said through a spokeswoman.
One question that remains, however, is whether Kroll, whose subcontractors have sometimes been accused of skirting the edge of propriety in the firm's quest for valuable intelligence, can continue to operate as successfully as part of a public company.
"Lawyers have told us we would not get their business if we were publicly held," said Bart M. Schwartz, a former Kroll executive who now runs the competing Decision Strategies International in New York. "They feel that a publicly held company is more likely to be the subject of lawsuits and, therefore, because of the discovery process, more likely to be required to give up confidential material. There are many more authorities looking at a public company."
For years, Mr. Kroll, a master negotiator and salesman, has been trying to figure out how he could join forces with another company. In 1992, he sold a 22 percent stake in the firm to American International Group, the insurance giant. But he still needed what he called plasma -- money to expand his global empire. And he wanted to be able to cash in on his life's work without giving up control. He had been unable to reach agreement with other investigative firms. And last December, he broke off talks with the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand partly over the issue of control.
The planned merger with Mr. Smith's company, for all its advantages for Mr. Kroll and his 42 managing directors, was still not ideal. While Kroll would have its own identity, Mr. Kroll and his colleagues still worried that they would be swallowed up. The proposal from the O'Garas, Mr. Kroll said, was more of "a merger of equals."
In some ways, it was even better. Instead of Mr. Kroll's becoming a subordinate, as usually happens when a company is bought, the O'Garas agreed to give up their own titles at the O'Gara Company to grant Mr. Kroll the post of chairman and chief executive. And instead of scratching for expansion money, as he had for years, Mr. Kroll, by joining with a company that had just gone public, would obtain much easier access to capital markets.
"It's kind of a lifetime dream come true," Mr. Kroll said.
The merger will create one of the world's biggest investigations and security companies. Combined, the company will employ more than 950 people in 39 outposts worldwide and will have annual revenues, analysts said, of more than $200 million in 1997, nearly three times the take for Mr. Kroll's company last year. Once the deal is completed, Mr. Kroll's personal wealth will jump nearly $50 million.
With American companies venturing into new global markets and mergers and acquisitions popping along at a record pace, the corporate security and intelligence business is soaring. Corporations are hiring investigators and security experts to dig into the backgrounds of business rivals and potential partners and are asking for help navigating the twisted byways of the global economy.
Following Mr. Kroll's lead, several dozen white-collar investigative firms have sprung up in recent years, creating an industry with hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenues. The investigators are part of an even bigger business in corporate and personal security, which includes everything from providing guard services and antiterrorist driving schools to producing James Bond-style hardware, including the armored cars and battery-powered, 5.5-pound satellite telephone kits O'Gara produces in Cincinnati and a half-dozen plants around the world.
Kroll is still the biggest name in the business, but it faces increasing competition from several of the Big Six accounting firms, which have begun providing some of the same services and have hired away prize employees from Kroll and other firms.
Mr. Kroll, a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan, commanded respect from the start with his choice of top-of-the-line operatives. He recruited former Federal and state prosecutors; agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Internal Revenue Service, and former diplomats and Congressional aides -- men and women with advanced degrees, board-room manners and dogeared passports.
In pinstripes and expensive shirts, Mr. Kroll has become the model for a new generation of sleuths far different from the Mickey Spillane characters of old with their rumpled trench coats and who spied mostly on wayward spouses. They do not carry guns or brag about flirting with death. They meet most clients in the restaurants of Paris rather than the back alleys of Phnom Penh.
And they are supplying a service that barely existed not that long ago. They deal with clients who a decade ago would probably never even have thought of ordering a background check on a potential joint-venture partner, but who now run the risk of shareholder lawsuits if they do not take just such precautions.
"With globalization has come a whole new cadre of scam artists," said Michael J. Hershman, the president of Fairfax Group Ltd., a competing firm just outside Washington which only last week merged with Decision Strategies.
To bring Kroll under its wing, O'Gara is paying 6.75 million shares, which valued the transaction at $81 million given the stock's starting bid price of $12 a share when the deal was announced on Aug. 7. That was $11 million more than Mr. Smith's firm was offering. The stock was changing hands at $14.125 yesterday.
O'Gara is also kicking in another $14 million to wipe out Kroll's debt. As the owner of about 60 percent of the investigative firm, Mr. Kroll is getting about 4 million shares, putting him on par with Thomas O'Gara, who had previously been far and away the biggest shareholder in the O'Gara Company.
Thomas O'Gara first met Mr. Kroll in 1990, when he sought Mr. Kroll's help in recommending his armored cars to Kroll clients. Having no way to evaluate the cars, Mr. Kroll declined. Nevertheless, Mr. O'Gara kept in touch.
Last fall, the O'Garas, whose customers pay up to $150,000 to have their cars turned into rolling vaults, raised $17 million in an initial public offering. By March, they had bought a small American-owned investigative agency in Mexico, a French armored-car maker, a distributor of satellite communications equipment in England and a counterterrorist training company in Virginia.
And, by then, Thomas O'Gara was in hot pursuit of Kroll. When Mr. O'Gara first laid out his proposal, he recalled, Mr. Kroll said that he was "well down the road" with Mr. Smith and expected "the deal to be done."
But Mr. O'Gara never went away. When he learned that Mr. Kroll had a speaking engagement in Aspen, Colo., and was taking his wife along, Mr. O'Gara sent his corporate jet to New York to pick them up. When Mr. and Mrs. Kroll climbed aboard they were greeted by Mr. O'Gara's investment banker, Jeff Brausch from J. Jeffrey Brausch & Company, near Cleveland. On the way to Aspen, the plane stopped to pick up Mr. O'Gara.
The plan with Mr. Smith was that his division at Equifax would go public as a company called Choicepoint. Kroll Associates would become one of five divisions of Choicepoint. Mr. Kroll, 56, would be president of the division and would report to Mr. Smith, 42. He would also have a seat on the Choicepoint board. A formal contract was never drawn up, though, and at the end, several loose ends remained.
The game began to swing in Mr. O'Gara's favor one week before the dinner with Mr. Smith when Mr. Kroll agreed to meet the brothers at O'Gara headquarters. In what he calls his best shot, Mr. O'Gara flashed on a big screen his proposed name for the new firm: Kroll-O'Gara. Immediately beneath that, it read: Jules Kroll, chairman. It was the first time, Mr. O'Gara said, that the company name and titles had come up. The O'Gara engineers and managers briefed Mr. Kroll, and when they were finished, Mr. O'Gara said, Mr. Kroll turned to him and responded, "I'm knocked out."
The last big piece fell into place at a meeting at the offices of Kramer, Levin, Naftalis & Frankel, the law firm representing Mr. Kroll, on Sunday, Aug. 3, three days before the dinner with Mr. Smith.
"That was when Jules made it known," Bill O'Gara said, "that he wanted to be C.E.O." No problem, the O'Garas replied and, they figured, the deal was essentially done.
As to whether going public will make some clients reluctant to deal with the firm in the future, Mr. Kroll disagrees. Since word began circulating that Kroll was going to merge with somebody, he said, "business has done nothing but increase."

HEADLINE: Divorce And Our National Values

BYLINE: By Peter D. Kramer; Peter D. Kramer, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Brown University, is the author of "Listening to Prozac" and the forthcoming "Should You Leave?"

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I.

 BODY:
How shall we resolve a marital crisis? Consider an example from the advice column of Ann Landers. An "Iowa Wife" wrote to ask what she should do about her husband's habit, after 30 years of marriage, of reading magazines at table when the couple dined out. Ann Landers advised the wife to engage her husband by studying subjects of interest to him.
Readers from around the country protested. A "14-Year-Old Girl in Pennsylvania" crystallized the objections: "You told the wife to read up on sports or business, whatever he was interested in, even though it might be boring to her. Doesn't that defeat the basic idea of being your own self?" Chastened, Ann Landers changed course, updated her stance: Reading at table is a hostile act, perhaps even grounds for divorce. 
 When it comes to marriage, Ann Landers seems a reasonable barometer of our values. In practical terms, reading the sports pages might work for some Iowa wife -- but we do not believe that is how spouses ought to behave. Only the second response, consider divorce, expresses our overriding respect for autonomy, for the unique and separate self.
Look south now from Iowa and Pennsylvania to Louisiana, where a new law allows couples to opt for a "covenant marriage" -- terminable only after a lengthy separation or because of adultery, abandonment, abuse or imprisonment. The law has been praised by many as an expedient against the epidemic of divorce and an incarnation of our "traditional values."
Whether the law will lower the divorce rate is an empirical question to be decided in the future, but it is not too soon to ask: Does covenant marriage express the values we live by?
History seems to say no. American literature's one great self-help book is "Walden," a paean to self-reliance and an homage to Henry David Thoreau's favorite preacher, Ralph Waldo Emerson, who declaimed: "Say to them, O father, O mother, O wife, O brother, O friend, I have lived with you after appearances hitherto. Henceforward, I am the truth's. . . . I must be myself. I cannot break my self any longer for you, or you."
The economic philosophy we proudly export, fundamentalist capitalism, says that society functions best when members act in a self-interested manner. The nation's founding document is a bill of divorcement. Autonomy is the characteristic American virtue.
As a psychiatrist, I see this value embedded in our psychotherapy, the craft that both shapes and expresses the prevailing common sense. In the early 1970's, Carl Rogers, known as the "Psychologist of America," encapsulated the post-World War II version of our ideals: A successful marriage is one that increases the "self-actualization" of each member. Of a failed union, he wrote: "If Jennifer had from the first insisted on being her true self, the marriage would have had much more strife and much more hope."
Rogers was expressing the predominant viewpoint; for most of the past 50 years, enhanced autonomy has been a goal of psychotherapy. Erik Erikson began the trend by boldly proclaiming that the search for identity had become as important in his time as the study of sexuality was in Freud's. Later, Murray Bowen, a founder of family therapy, invoked a scale of maturity whose measure is a person's ability to maintain his or her beliefs in the face of family pressures. The useful response to crises within couples, Bowen suggested, is to hold fast to your values and challenge your partner to rise to meet your level of maturity.
But autonomy was a value for men only, and largely it was pseudo-autonomy, the successful man propped up by the indentured wife and overburdened mother. (No doubt Thoreau sent his clothes home for laundering.)
The self-help movement, beginning in the 1970's, extended this American ideal to women. Once both partners are allowed to be autonomous, the continuation of marriage becomes more truly voluntary. In this sense, an increase in divorce signals social progress.
It signals social progress, except that divorce is itself destructive. So it seems to me the question is whether any other compelling value counterbalances the siren song of self-improvement.
Turning again to psychotherapy, we do hear arguments for a different type of American value. Answering Erikson's call for individual identity, Helen Merrell Lynd, a sociologist at Sarah Lawrence College, wrote, "Nor must complete finding of oneself . . . precede finding oneself in and through other persons."
Her belief entered psychiatry through the writings of her pupil, Jean Baker Miller. A professor of psychiatry at Boston University, Dr. Miller faults most psychotherapy for elevating autonomy at the expense of qualities important to women, such as mutuality. To feel connected (when there is genuine give-and-take) is to feel worth. Miller wants a transformed culture in which mutuality "is valued as highly as, or more highly than, self-enhancement."
Mutuality is an ideal the culture believes it should honor but does not quite. Ours is a society that does a half-hearted job of inculcating compromise, which is to say that we still teach these skills mainly to women. Much of psychotherapy addresses the troubles of those who make great efforts at compromise only to be taken advantage of by selfish partners.
Often the more vulnerable spouse requires rescue through the sort of move Ann Landers recommends, vigorous self-assertion, and even divorce.
Mutuality is a worthy ideal, one that might serve as a fit complement and counterbalance to our celebration of the self. But if we do not reward it elsewhere -- if in the school and office and marketplace, we celebrate self-assertion -- it seems worrisome to ask the institution of marriage to play by different rules.
What is insidious about Louisiana's covenant marriage is that, contrary to claims on its behalf, it is out of touch with our traditional values: self-expression, self-fulfillment, self-reliance.
 The Louisiana law invites couples to lash themselves to a morality the broader culture does not support, an arrangement that creates a potential for terrible tensions.
Though we profess abhorrence of divorce, I suspect that the divorce rate reflects our national values with great exactness, and that conventional modern marriage -- an eternal commitment with loopholes galore -- expresses precisely the degree of loss of autonomy that we are able to tolerate.

HEADLINE: Swedish Scandal

 BODY:
Sweden's self-image is built around its humane social welfare system at home and its promotion of racial harmony and economic development in the third world. That makes the revelation of a decades-long Swedish policy of coercing welfare recipients into racially motivated sterilizations all the more jarring, to Swedes and Americans as well. Nothing can undo the human damage already inflicted. But Swedish authorities must move swiftly to uncover the full story, acknowledge official responsibility and decently compensate the surviving victims.
A leading Swedish newspaper, Dagens Nyheter, reported this month that Social Democratic governments between 1935 and 1976 coerced some 60,000 women into being sterilized. Labeled genetically or racially "inferior," they were threatened with loss of benefits and separation from their existing children if they refused. Typical victims were the very poor, the learning disabled and people with non-Nordic or mixed ethnic backgrounds. 
 Responding to public and political pressure, Prime Minister Goerran Persson has pledged a thorough investigation. It must unflinchingly expose the true facts of this episode so that the present generation may learn from its elders' mistakes.
Destructive forays into eugenics have been all too common, in America as well as Europe. More than 60,000 people regarded as mentally deficient were involuntarily sterilized in this country in the first six decades of this century. Racial minorities were disproportionately targeted. No society seems immune from racism, bureaucratic abuse of the weak and the pseudo-science of social Darwinism.
Sweden's once-lustrous reputation has already been battered this year by revelations of wartime iron exports that fed Hitler's military machine and of postwar Swedish hoarding of the German gold, much of it looted from Nazi victims, received in payment. A Swedish inquiry is now looking into the issue of wartime relations with Germany as well.
By responding honestly and generously on the sterilization scandal and the gold issue, Stockholm could begin rebuilding its lost international credit. It could also set a good example for other countries confronted with evidence of indefensible behavior in the recent past.

HEADLINE: The New Indo Chic;
Beyond Yoga, Curry and Nehru Jackets Into Film, Publishing and Body Painting

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
Ever since the Beatles popularized Hinduism and Nehru jackets in the late 1960's, Indian cultural artifacts have had a vague currency in the American imagination. But lately, India and its inhabitants are indisputably chic.
With 50th-anniversary celebrations this summer of India and Pakistan's freedom from British rule, perhaps the starkest example of Indo chic can be found in the new popularity of literature out of India and its diaspora. Flip through a major American magazine, for instance, and you are likely to encounter a photo of Arundhati Roy, gazing dreamily, beckoning the reader to open her debut novel, "The God of Small Things," published with much fanfare this year by Random House. Or consider the unexpected success of a recent issue of Granta, entirely devoted to writings on India: the British journal sold twice as many newsstand copies as it ordinarily does in this country. 
 Indo chic is not limited to the highbrow, however. Consider the kitsch appeal of Bollywood cinema, Bombay's flourishing movie industry. Or among American teen-agers, the madness over the ancient Indian and North African art of body painting known as mehndi, now sold in do-it-yourself kits at Urban Outfitters.
But why all the fuss now? Does this Indofrenzy, as the University of Chicago anthropology professor Arjun Appadurai calls it, signal a kind of cultural renaissance on the subcontinent, in literature, art and film? Or is it that Americans are just craning their necks East and taking notice?
The answers are as varied as the subcontinent itself. The Indian-American writer Shashi Tharoor says that although Indians have long produced good books in Indian languages (the country has more than a dozen) and some have written in English, only recently has there been a bumper crop of English writings by Indians there and abroad. (This has prompted the British Indian writer Salman Rushdie to proclaim -- audaciously, in the view of his critics -- English writing to be the finest work being produced in India today.)
Mr. Tharoor, the author of "India: From Midnight to the Millennium," was recently featured on the Web site of amazon.com, the Internet bookstore, as part of a package on Indian literature. "India's literary scene," the headline asserted, "has never been richer." It is the company's first such display on India and with 2,000 "clicks" a day, one of the most popular items on the Web site.
"We knew this was something on people's minds," said the company's vice president and executive editor, Rick Ayre. "Indian writing is surfacing today in a big way, and it's something we would like to make readers aware of."
But the literary explosion, Mr. Tharoor said, does not explain the sudden attention other aspects of Indian culture are receiving. "Americans are noticing Bollywood because Americans are noticing India," he argued. "It's true of music. It's true of fashion. I think Americans are just taking notice."
To be sure, America's fascination with India isn't new. Thirty years ago, many Americans regarded India as a place of snake charmers and sage swamis, as a destination for an entire generation of flower children.
But today's Indo chic is fed by another set of desires. "It is a different kind of moment of cultural appropriation than in the 60's," said Nicholas Dirks, an India specialist who directs the Columbia University anthropology department.
For one thing, he said, from Los Angeles to New York, there has been a flurry of cultural events all summer to celebrate the anniversary of India's independence from British rule 50 years ago this month. Moreover, immigrants from the Indian subcontinent are now, for the first time, a visible part of the American landscape (there were nearly one million of them at last count) and their music and masala and mehndi are now readily available in every major city in the United States.
Finally, India scholars note, India's economic and political relationship to the United States has changed radically since the last round of Indo-mania in the mid-1980's when the movie "Gandhi" was released. For the first time since it threw out the British East India Tea Company, India has embraced market capitalism, avidly promoting tourism and seeking American foreign investment. With the end of the cold war, India is aggressively seeking to be a part of the global economy. Look at the way Indian culture is being bought and sold in this country, said Professor Appadurai, who also directs the globalization project at the University of Chicago.
"India is now the jewel in a new U.S.-centered crown whose key elements are capital, leisure and high technology," he said.
 
Art Exhibitions Throughout the U.S.
Indo chic seems to be everywhere. In the art world, several high-profile exhibitions of Indian art have opened recently in museums from New York to Washington to San Francisco. And the Asia Society in Manhattan, which has long promoted the arts of the subcontinent, has witnessed a surge of interest in tours to India by its high-end donors.
Promoters of South Asian classical music report increased attendance at concerts, prompted in part by the crossover success of the late Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, the Pakistani vocalist. Even the British-Asian musical punch, which combines North Indian pop music with hip-hop and reggae, has quietly begun to penetrate the Manhattan multi-culti set.
As American cinephiles turn their gaze from Hong Kong action films to the flashy movie musicals of Bombay, a Seattle distributor is bringing Bollywood classics to national retail outlets, like Blockbuster Video. More English-language films directed by Indians are being released in the United States Zeitgeist Films was sufficiently impressed with the popularity of Mira Nair's "Kamasutra" to distribute "Fire," another English-language film about two Indian housewives in love.
Even a few years ago, "Fire" would have been considered a risky venture in this country, an obscure tale in search of a mainstream audience. But the movie has opened in theaters in New York and nine other cities nationwide. "Now, I'm seeing it as less risky," said Nancy Gerstman, a president of Zeitgeist. "There seems to be a great deal of interest in all things Indian. It's just a huge trend."
Understanding what Indo chic is requires understanding what Indo chic is not. For the most part, Indo chic is not about South Asians in America. Though most of them live outside India and many live in the United States, their experience is generally not the subject of the dozen or so books by Indian authors that have recently hit the shelves, or are about to.
The exceptions are Meena Alexander's novel "Manhattan Music" (Mercury House) and Chitra Divakaruni Bannerjee's "Mistress of Spices" (Anchor), which was packaged with a bundle of Indian spices.
 
An Aura, Removed From Harsh Reality
Indo chic, especially in art, tends not to be modern, says Vishakha N. Desai, vice president for cultural and interdepartmental programs at the Asia Society. In spite of the recent explosion of contemporary art in India, the bulk of Indian art in major American museums today is centuries old. Nor does Indo chic, for the most part, concern any of the other countries of the Indian subcontinent. (The Pakistani singer Mr. Khan's popularity is an exception.)
Celebrations of independence from British rule have all but ignored Pakistan, which was born during the independence years in a violent struggle pitting the subcontinent's Hindus against its Muslims. And according to its critics, Indo chic obscures the persistent problems of the subcontinent, from AIDS to foreign debt to radical religious fundamentalism.
"As more U.S. companies are interested in exploring the Indian market, there is also an effort to promote a more positive image of India in the media," said Sucheta Mazumdar, a history professor at Duke University. "And this inevitably turns to romanticizing and orientalizing India."
Gita Mehta, whose latest book of essays, "Snakes and Ladders," was published this year by Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, put it this way: "It's easier to deal with mehndi than to deal with reality."
Many Indian-Americans and students of Indian culture are of mixed minds about this latest round of Indo chic. On the one hand, it is a boon to South Asian artists, writers and musicians. Robert Browning, the executive director of World Music Institute, who has sponsored South Asian music concerts in this country for the last 25 years, has seen a surge of interest in his shows over the last few years. And literary agents representing Indian writers report a more enthusiastic market for their clients today.
But some critics see within the new literary Indofrenzy a kind of nostalgia for a lost world. "India is again a place where the triumph of English, as a language, a literature and a way of being" can be celebrated, argued Dr. Appadurai. "If the monkey is so brilliant, can the organ grinders have been so bad?"
 
Still Yearning For Understanding
 Still others say they hope the new fascination with India will foster a deeper, more serious understanding of the place and its people. "It is the bane of our existence," said Ms. Desai, a native of India. "All of us who care about promoting India have an opportunity to connect. But it does play into the idea of India as the land of exoticism, mysticism, alternative life styles. India has always played into that."

HEADLINE: Growth Slows For Incomes; Spending Up

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29

 BODY:
Personal income grew at a slower pace in July than it did a month before, while spending rose at the fastest pace since January, suggesting that the economic expansion will continue well into next year.
The Commerce Department said today that personal income increased one-tenth of 1 percent in July after having climbed six-tenths of 1 percent in June, a figure unchanged from the initial report. It was the weakest showing since October, and mainly reflected a drop in hours worked. 
 Consumer spending rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in July. June's increase was revised to two-tenths of 1 percent from three-tenths of 1 percent. July's gain was the largest since a 1.1 percent advance in January.
The savings rate fell to 3.7 percent in July from 4.3 percent in June.
The increases in income and spending were close to analysts' expectations.
Trends in income can portend future business activity because they indicate how much consumers will be able to spend. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's output of goods and services.
"Consumers are firmly determined to spend more in the months ahead," said Anthony Chan, chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio. The decline in the July savings rate underscored that point, he said.
Consumer spending is likely to accelerate further in the months ahead, partly because sales of residential real estate continue to be strong, and people who buy homes tend to buy goods to furnish or refurbish them. Indeed, a separate report today showed that sales of new single-family homes unexpectedly rose for the third consecutive month in July, evidence that low mortgage rates continued to attract buyers.
Also, consumer confidence is running at some of the highest levels since the late 1960's, and unemployment is likely to remain below 5 percent of the labor force for an extended period, according to corporate executives and economists.
July's slowdown in income reflected a drop in the average number of hours worked and a shorter average workweek. That slowdown stemmed in part from the annual shutdown of auto plants to retool for the new model year. Businesses have also gone to great lengths to contain labor costs, restraining wage growth.
The Commerce Department also said today that disposable income, or the money left over after taxes, increased one-tenth of 1 percent in July after having risen half a percent during June.
In the home sales report, the Commerce Department said sales nationwide rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in July, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 817,000. June's gain was revised to 5.2 percent, to an 810,000 rate, down from the initial report of a 6.1 percent increase, to 819,000, just shy of an 11-year record.
However, all of the July gain came in the West, where sales were at their highest level in almost four years. Other regions registered declines.
Sales rose 11 percent in the West, to 253,000, the highest annual rate since November 1993. They dropped 5.1 percent in the Midwest, to 149,000; 2.5 percent in the South, to 348,000, and 4.3 percent in the Northeast, to 66,000.
Today's home sales report also showed that a measure of consumer demand, the supply of homes for sale nationwide, was unchanged in July at an annual rate of 287,000. The inventory of vacant homes held steady at a 4.3-month supply; a level above six or seven months suggests real estate markets are saturated.
The average price of a new home decreased 1.2 percent in July, to $176,400, from $178,500 in June, while the median price rose 2 percent, to $146,700 from $143,800.
The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 7.36 percent in the week ended Aug. 1, the lowest level in more than a year. Since the beginning of the month, rates have climbed only a little, rising to 7.58 percent in the last week.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Owners Take First Shot Against the D.H.

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
As the designated hitter nears the end of its 25th year of existence, baseball's club owners yesterday made their first official effort to eliminate it.
Looking ahead to possible realignment of the major leagues, Randy Levine, the clubs' chief labor negotiator, proposed to union officials a phaseout of the designated hitter and, as a tradeoff, the addition of a 26th player to each team's roster. The union officials did not jump at the chance to eliminate the d.h., even in several years. 
 "We said they had a better chance of convincing the National League to adopt it than convincing us to abandon it," Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said afterward.
The American League introduced the d.h. in 1973 in an effort to add hitting to the game. It has since spread throughout all levels of baseball, everywhere except the National League.
N.L. owners have steadfastly resisted the elimination of hitting pitchers, contending that their game creates more scintillating strategy than the game with the d.h.
Major League Baseball has played with those two sets of rules, even in the World Series. At the meeting yesterday, Levine and his delegation told Donald Fehr, the head of the union, and his aides that the d.h. was divisive and should be eliminated because it is highly unlikely the National League will ever adopt it.
The position could be phased out over a number of years, the owners' representatives proposed, so that existing designated hitters, like Paul Molitor of Minnesota and Edgar Martinez of Seattle, could finish their careers as d.h.'s.
In exchange, the management delegation said, the owners would create 30 new roster spots, which is double the number of jobs the d.h. provides. The timing of the start of the 26-man rosters would be subject to negotiation, as would the number of years it would take to phase out the d.h.
The union has long opposed eliminating the d.h., in part because it is, on average, a high-paying position. But Orza said continuation of the d.h. went beyond simple economics.
"It's not a union issue," he said. "The issue is the good of the game and the game is better when players are producing runs. The d.h. produces more offense. Why wouldn't you want more offense when the people want more offense?
"All sports have moved to this idea: when on offense, put your best offense together. You're trying to produce as much offense as possible."
The Molitors and the Martinezes, Orza added, have been some of the best hitters in the game.
"We've had so many wonderful d.h.'s," he said. "Why phase them out of existence? The next Paul Molitor right now is 11 years old. In 30 years, why shouldn't the game have the benefit of that type of player?"
The owners need the players' approval to eliminate the d.h. If they cannot secure their approval, they would have to continue using the position in one of the leagues, however they are realigned.

HEADLINE: The Sticky Side of Privatization;
Sale of U.S. Nuclear Fuel Plants Raises Host of Conflicts

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
There is big money in nuclear energy. While most nuclear-power plants in America may be economic albatrosses, the little-known Government-owned enterprise that supplies the bulk of their uranium fuel is highly profitable.
So profitable that Washington has already incorporated into the budget the billions it expects to bank when the United States Enrichment Corporation, which has operated with considerable autonomy since 1993, is sold to private investors early next year. It will be the largest divestiture of a Federal production operation ever attempted. But the road from here to there is tortuous. 
 For one thing, transferring the corporation to private hands raises thorny issues ranging from the wish to preserve a domestic source of uranium fuel and the need to secure global stockpiles of bomb-grade uranium from nuclear terrorists. "The sale is not just about maximizing value," said a senior Administration official who requested anonymity.
For another, the Government must soon choose whether to sell USEC in one piece, or to parcel out shares in a public offering. That has touched off a quiet game of backbiting among potential acquirers, USEC's union and USEC's current managers, with Washington caught in the middle.
A half-dozen big American corporations with experience in nuclear power, including Lockeed Martin, Westinghouse Electric, General Atomics, Allied Signal and Babcock & Wilcox, are reportedly pondering bids. But the catch they are eyeing has so many question marks -- a sagging market for the product, outmoded technology and reliance on cheap electricity that will probably be cut off in eight years -- that the estimated value is low compared with its current earnings.
USEC, which operates plants in Paducah, Ky., and Portsmouth, Ohio, for enriching uranium to reactor-grade strength, reported earnings of $250 million on revenues of $1.578 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30. That was down from $304 million in 1996, but largely because USEC spent more on research in 1997. J. P. Morgan, USEC's financial adviser, estimates that the projected profits translate into a market value of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion -- the equivalent of $3 billion for Uncle Sam, since the privatized corporation would also pay income tax.
If offers from bidders deemed worthy fall short of that range, the Treasury Department and USEC's White House-appointed board will have to decide whether to accept the most attractive offer, or to allow USEC to sell shares through a public offering. "It should all be over in six months -- maybe even less," said a senior Administration official.
One rumored high-profile bidder has dropped out of the race. "We have absolutely no interest in acquiring the Enrichment Corporation," said Bruce Bunch, a spokesman for General Electric.
Others are sitting on the fence. Don Washington, speaking for Babcock & Wilcox, said the company was not prepared to talk about its plans. And Westinghouse was equally noncommittal. "Of course we're interested," said a spokeswoman, Mimi Limbach. "But we won't be making any decisions until we see the specs."
Lockheed Martin, the giant military contractor whose subsidiary now operates USEC's plants, remains an obvious candidate. It has formed an alliance with Allied Signal and General Atomics to buy USEC. And while the companies will not divulge specifics, Bill Corcoran, a spokesman for Allied Signal, confirmed the consortium's strong interest. "We're looking closely at it," he said.
But potential rivals have been quick to point out that Lockheed Martin has long been at odds with USEC's current managers over a failure to meet productivity and safety targets in its operating contract. By the same token, they note that in the early 1990's a General Atomics subsidiary was shut down by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for safety reasons.
Certainly the most unusual player in the acquisition game is Pleiades Group. The consortium is headed by a former Commerce Secretary, Robert A. Mosbacher; advised by a former Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d, and provided legal counsel by Mr. Baker's son, Jamie. The Pleiades chief executive, a Russian-American named Alexander Shusterovich, acknowledges his close working relationship with Viktor Mikhailov, the head of Minatom, the Russian competitor to USEC.
While official Washington will not comment publicly on the suitability of Pleiades to own USEC, there is opposition from the national security establishment. USEC controls technology that could be used to produce bomb-grade uranium. Moreover, USEC serves as the "executive agent" for the 1993 deal in which Washington agreed to buy 500 tons of bomb-grade uranium from Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry, or Minatom, after it had been blended down for use as commercial reactor fuel.
Pleiades points out, however, that Washington has considerable experience in protecting sensitive technology where military contractors work with foreign corporations. And Naseer Hashim, the Pleiades senior vice president, argues that the Russian connection should be viewed as an asset, not a liability. "Pleiades, unlike other American owned enterprises, has cultivated its capacity to engage in constructive dialogue with Minatom," he said.
To bolster its credibility, Pleiades promised the labor union at the enrichment operations, the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers, a seat on USEC's governing board if Pleiades is allowed to buy the company. And the union president, Bob Wages, accepted, perhaps to settle scores with USEC's current managers. William Timbers, the president of USEC, "does not have the best interests of the workers and facilities at heart," Mr. Wages told a reporter for Nuclear Fuel, an industry weekly.
Whoever takes over the enterprise, the debate over USEC's key role in the swords-to-plowshares agreement is unlikely to go away. Richard A. Falkenrath, executive director of Harvard's Center for Science and International Affairs, argues that it creates "an inherent tension" between the public objective of getting as much surplus bomb material out of Russia as fast as possible and the wish of USEC to maximize profits from it own production of nuclear fuel. Tim Ryan of J. P. Morgan, USEC's financial adviser, acknowledges that the overhang of surplus Russian uranium could reduce the future profitability of USEC.
But the Clinton insiders who made the decision to go forward on privatization do not seem perturbed. "USEC's willingness last year to nail down the terms for delivery of the first 150 tons shows that an independent enrichment company can put national security first," said one former Administration official.
The more important question from the perspective of investors is whether USEC can continue to prosper. For much of its current vitality derives from cost advantages that will not last forever.
It makes up for its inherent efficiency deficit -- the gaseous diffusion separators now consume as much electricity as a large city -- with cheap energy from private power contracts that will all expire by 2005. "Without low-cost power, USEC can't make money with gaseous diffusion," said Tom Neff, a senior research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Moreover, USEC is hardly alone in the business of separating U-235 from nonfissionable isotopes of uranium. Two European consortiums, Eurodif, owned by the Governments of France, Spain, Belgium, Italy and Iran, and Urenco, owned by Britain, the Netherlands and Germany, were created in the 1970's to reduce Europe's dependence on what was then an American monopoly in the non-Communist world. And Russia's Minatom has become a major exporter. Since all three competitors' operations were built long after USEC's plants were completed in the 1950's, they largely employ centrifuges to separate the uranium isotopes -- a major cost advantage.
USEC does own exclusive rights to exploit atomic vapor laser isotope separation, a technology developed at the Federal Government's Lawrence Livermore Laboratory that uses just 5 percent as much electricity as gaseous diffusion. If the isotope separation technology stumbles, though, and an attractive electricity contract cannot be renegotiated, USEC would probably have to turn to centrifuges -- a technology largely controlled by competitors.
Indeed, Pleiades is apparently betting that the future lies in centrifuge-based joint ventures with the Russians. And Louisiana Energy Systems, a consortium backed by Urenco and a handful of American nuclear utilities, has applied for a license to build new centrifuge capacity in the United States.
From this perspective, betting on USEC is mostly a bet about the future of uranium separation technology. Current estimates of USEC's market value amount to little more than the positive cash flow it can expect before the cheap electricity runs out. If atomic vapor laser isotope separation works and USEC remains the cost leader in the industry, it could well become a cash cow.
And at least some observers think USEC is making a good technology bet. "The view here is that we're further along than is generally recognized," said Mr. Ryan, the financial adviser to USEC.

HEADLINE: Asian Stock Damage Has Wider Effects

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
With declines of 5 percent or more in Hong Kong and Indonesia, Southeast Asian stock markets continued to tumble yesterday as the tremors from a summerlong plunge began to be felt in world markets.
But the plunges in Asia are not expected to cause significant damage in markets in the United States and Europe, or in Latin America, the world's other core of emerging markets. And whatever fallout there is should be less severe than that from the Mexican peso crisis that led to a $50 billion international bailout in 1995. 
 "If the market in the U.S. is going to come down hard," said David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, "it will because the market is overvalued and interest rates are going up. Asia will be part of the process, but not a major part."
Still, many American investors have become worried enough to take millions of dollars out of mutual funds that invest in Asia. Cash flows out of Asia funds, including those that invest in Japan, have been running $110 million to $115 million a week for the last four weeks, according to AMG Data Services.
This retreat by American investors began when market turmoil erupted in July with the floating of Thailand's currency, the baht, and a 16 percent devaluation.
The devaluation process was set in motion by currency speculators, who were betting that unbalanced economic policies that favored growth left the Government unable to defend the baht. The problems in Thailand, and the speculative attacks on national currencies, spread to the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia. The Thais now have a $16 million assistance package backed by the International Monetary Fund, and the Philippines is also getting I.M.F assistance.
Recent downturns in the stocks of multinational companies like Coca-Cola, Gillette, General Electric and McDonald's may be accelerated as investors worry that their earnings will be eroded by the sharp rise in the value of the dollar against Asian currencies in the last month or two.
And in the last week, the declines in stock markets in Asia have begun to drag down the markets in countries that are not thought to have the major economic problems faced by Thailand and its neighbors. That selling was mostly generated by investors' uncertainty and efforts to hedge Thai and other losses by taking profits elsewhere in Asia.
The Hong Kong stock market, Asia's second largest after those of Japan, dropped about 5 percent yesterday and is down 9 percent in the last two days. Markets in Latin America have also had a bad week. But the declines in both regions have been aided by drops on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.4 percent for the week.
"It has already had an impact on the way people see the markets," said Lawrence J. Brainard, global head of emerging-market research at Chase Securities. "Investors have become more cautious; they're sensitized to risk."
But Mr. Brainard argued that there should not be a major reverberation from Asia to Latin American because the economic policies of Latin American countries are more committed to stability than growth. In addition, he said, Latin American officials have learned from the Mexican peso crisis.
Yesterday, Southeast Asian stock markets all fell sharply. Among these, the Kuala Lumpur composite index in Malaysia fell almost 1 percent and is down 11 percent for the week. The Malaysian Government set off sharp selling through much of Asia when it introduced rules Wednesday night to limit the short-selling of stocks. In selling short, an investor borrows the stock and sells it in hopes the price will fall and he can buy it back at a lower price.
But the surprise ruling just seemed to aggravate the situation, as investors sought to protect themselves from losses there by selling stocks elsewhere, like in Hong Kong.
The Stock Exchange of Thailand fell 1.9 percent yesterday and is down 10 percent for the week; in Indonesia, the Jakarta composite index plunged 6.9 percent and 14 percent for the week, and the SES all-share index of Singapore dropped 1.4 percent and 5.9 percent all week.
The plunges in Asia helped push markets in Latin America lower. In Brazil, the Bovespa index of Sao Paulo fell 5.8 percent yesterday and 7.1 percent for the week. The Bolsa index in Mexico City dropped 2.9 percent and 7 percent for the week. Argentina's Merval index fared better, down 3.74 percent yesterday but shedding only 1.29 percent for the week.
John Lipsky, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, said the most important impact in the United States from the Asian turmoil would be on inflation and growth, rather than in financial markets. He said the sharp rise in the dollar against the Thai baht, up 40 percent since July 1, and other Asian currencies would make imports from these countries cheaper, adding to the downward pressure on inflation. But, at the same time, he said, the slower growth in these countries will mean that American export sales will slow.
The most immediate stock effect could come on the popular multinational stocks that until August had helped lead the stock market higher all year.
But many of these companies, said Elizabeth J. Mackay, chief investment strategist at Bear, Stearns & Company, depend on sales in Asia. Slower growth there will cut sales, and the rise of the dollar will reduce their value when they are translated back into dollar earnings.
"Maybe the market is saying something," she said, alluding to the recent decline of the big stocks. McDonald's was taken off the Salomon Brothers' recommended list yesterday in part because of the Asian impact.
Money has been flowing out of mutual funds that invest in Asia for the last nine weeks, according to Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services.
In Asia funds, excluding those for Japan, the outflows peaked at an average of $185 million a week during the four weeks ending on July 16, just after the Thai currency devaluation. For the four weeks ending on Aug. 27, the average outflow has been $120 million.
T. Rowe Price Associates' $1.3 billion New Asia Fund has seen substantial outflows in the last two months, Steven Norwitz, a Price spokesman, said.
Investors with clear recollections of the Mexican peso crisis are running for cover, he added.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said at a meeting yesterday in Jackson Hole, Wyo., that Thailand's economic problems underscored the need for better economic data, which, he said, could have helped avert the crisis.

HEADLINE: A Durable Operation On Too Solid Ground

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
For years, even as rivals like First Union and Nationsbank gobbled up banks across the country and moved into Barnett Banks Inc.'s backyard, Barnett prided itself as being "Florida's bank."
The claim was not without justification. With 660 branches across the state and assets of $42 billion, Barnett, based in Jacksonville, had the biggest share of a market that by most measures is a banker's paradise because of its healthy economy and affluent consumer base. 
 "We characterize it as being trapped in heaven," Allen L. Lastinger Jr., Barnett's president and chief operating officer, said in an interview earlier this summer.
Analysts have little but praise for the company, which was founded in 1877 by William B. Barnett and is the largest, oldest independent bank in Florida.
"It was a very coveted franchise," said Henry C. Dickson, an analyst with Smith Barney.
But if they have a quibble, it is that Barnett, which vigorously guarded its independence, took too long to broaden its vision beyond the borders of the state.
"They were a land-locked bank," said Thomas A. Hanley, an analyst at UBS Securities, "and they went into nonbank expansion rather late."
"I don't know if they should have expanded outside the state in the 1980's as First Union and Nationsbank were doing and become a bigger powerhouse in the Southeast," he added. "But if they had an Achilles' heel, that was it."
Indeed, it is only in the last few years that Barnett expanded its horizons in a bid for faster growth.
While keeping the Barnett name and banking operations in Florida, the company has been buying and building a network of consumer lending operations throughout the country the last two years.
"If we had had this conversation two years ago, I would have said they were a good banking company and a somewhat sleepy corporation," said Moshe A. Orenbach, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
"But in the last two years they have sharpened their focus."
Barnett did this only after spending much of the early 1990's dealing with a raft of problems that crimped its earnings, problems that included bad commercial real estate loans, a questionable credit card portfolio and the cost in time and money of consolidating its fragmented banking operations within Florida.
Most recently, in April it spent $670 million to buy Oxford Resources Inc., the nation's largest independent auto leasing company, with a customer base in 21 states. And early in 1995, Barnett purchased the Equicredit Corporation, a consumer finance company that has offices in 41 states.
"The company is evolving into one with a customer-centric focus and away from a Florida-centric and county-centric focus," Mr. Dickson, the Smith Barney analyst, said.
But, as Mr. Hanley suggested, they did not move fast enough, a fact Charles E. Rice, the company's long-time chairman and chief executive, acknowledged yesterday in a conference phone call with analysts and reporters.
Mr. Rice said Barnett did not have the breadth and reach required to compete with organizations like the Nationsbank Corporation and the First Union Corporation in the future.
Recognizing that, Mr. Hanley and others give Mr. Rice credit for picking a perfect moment to sell, and getting an extremely handsome price for shareholders in the process.
"The timing was right to sell," said Stephen A. Hansel, president and chief executive of the Hibernia Corporation, a New Orleans bank holding company.
Referring to the repercussions the combination will have in the state, Mr. Hansel, who spent more than two decades at Barnett, said the acquisition "makes Florida a banking colony, which is really sad in a way." "But," he added, "that is the way of the world."

HEADLINE: Dow Concludes Rough Month By Dropping 72.01 Points

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
July giveth and August taketh away.
That was the story by the end of trading yesterday, after all the gains made in July, the year's best month for the Dow Jones industrial average, were surrendered in August, its worst monthly setback in seven years. 
 Yesterday, the Dow lost 72.01 points, or just under 1 percent, in another choppy session, to close at 7,622.42. For the month, the blue-chip average lost 600.19 points, or 7.3 percent. And from its Aug. 6 high, the index is down 7.7 percent -- its biggest setback since March and April, when the Dow lost 9.8 percent. Still, the Dow is up 18 percent since the start of the year.
"In effect, we had a speculative run-up in July, and in August it was just taking off the fluff," Elizabeth J. Mackay, chief investment strategist at Bear, Stearns, said.
There were two reasons, Ms. Mackay said: Interest rates stopped going up, and indeed backed off, and several blue-chip companies, including Coca-Cola and Gillette, came out with negative earnings news.
"When two marquee names of the new Nifty Fifty warn of slowing earnings growth, that causes investors to say, 'Hey, wait a minute, those share prices are high,' " she said.
Technology and smaller-company stocks, however, extended a monthlong run of outperforming the blue chips. The Russell 2000 rose 1.84, to a record 423.43 yesterday, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 6 points, to 1,587.32. In August, the Russell index gained 2.2 percent, while the Nasdaq was flat.
Still, yesterday's session seemed to be a microcosm of the month of August. The day began with McDonald's warning of an earnings slowdown, the third Friday a blue-chip company gave such a warning this month. Weakness in the bond market also helped pull down the Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which closed down 4.20 points at 899.47.
In a shortened session ahead of the holiday weekend, the bond market gave back many of the gains made a day earlier on renewed inflation jitters. The Government said new-home sales rose a robust nine-tenths of 1 percent in July and consumer spending jumped eight-tenths of 1 percent.
As a result, bond prices fell. The price of a 30-year Treasury bond declined 14/32, to 97 1/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.60, from 6.57 Thursday. A month earlier, the yield stood at 6.30.
The dollar showed some strength against the Japanese yen and the German mark. The dollar closed at 120.80 in New York, up from 119.12 Thursday. The dollar was quoted at 1.8095 marks, up from 1.7961. The British pound rose to $1.6200 from $1.6155.
Although some Wall Street analysts discounted yesterday's session, noting that volume was light and many traders and investors had taken off early for the holiday weekend, the disparity between large-cap and small-cap stocks continued. Analysts said discomfort with the high price-to-earnings ratios of some of bluest of the blue chips had finally begun to shift some allegiances in the market.
While Coca-Cola and Gillette have both lost about 20 percent from their highs in recent weeks, many stocks with lower price-to-earnings ratios have been bid higher.
"You're finally starting to see what every bull market has had, a broadening out," Barbara Marcin, senior equity portfolio manager at Citibank Global Asset Management, said. "You're starting to see the small-cap stocks beating the large-cap stocks."
Ms. Marcin said that investors had finally tired of paying high prices for companies like Coca-Cola, and that it was a healthy sign that investors were now choosing better values. The shift in buying, she said, might also benefit portfolio managers, a large majority of whom have underperformed the S.& P. 500 index.
"It's the first month in a very long time in which it has been easier to beat the indexes," she said. Of course, portfolio managers have beaten the S.& P. 500 by suffering less. While the average United States equity fund was down 1.96 percent in August, according to Lipper Analytical Services, the S.& P. 500 lost 5.7 percent.
Ms. Marcin said some of the excesses in prices might have been trimmed because of a decline in the bond market. As interest rates rose, valuations began to look even frothier, she said, particularly after July's sharp run-up in prices, when the Dow gained 7.2 percent.
And so, while the blue chips stumbled, several battered issues gained. AT&T, one of the dogs of the Dow this year, gained about 6 percent in August, making it the Dow's best-performing issue. And McDonald's, which had fallen 15 percent since July 30, actually rebounded on yesterday's earnings news, gaining 9/16, to 47 5/16.

HEADLINE: Biggest Southeast Bank Buying Florida Giant for $15.5 Billion

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Spending more for a bank than any company has in history, the Nationsbank Corporation said yesterday that it would acquire Barnett Banks for $15.5 billion in stock.
Barnett, which dominates the rapidly growing Florida market, has long been seen as the most attractive banking franchise in the country and it attracted heated bidding when it started to auction itself off last week. 
 With its winning bid, Nationsbank, based in Charlotte N.C., will become the nation's third-largest banking company, with $290 billion in assets, after Chase Manhattan and Citicorp. Based on stock market valuation, Nationsbank will be worth about $57 billion, a very close second to Citicorp, which is worth $59 billion.
Barnett is one of the great success stories in banking, growing over the last 20 years from a tiny Jacksonville bank to 660 branches that control 20 percent of the Florida market today.
Still, regional banks are losing ground to a handful of increasingly nationwide banking companies. The huge consolidation that has swept through the industry in recent years -- and that has seen Chase Manhattan merge with Chemical, First Interstate with Wells Fargo, and U.S. Bancorp with First Bank System -- has made the remaining banking giants more powerful, with marketing muscle and cost efficiency that regional banks cannot hope to match.
The top 10 banks now control 32 percent of the nation's deposits, up from 19 percent at the end of 1990. With this deal, Nationsbank alone will have 4.8 percent of the deposits. Federal law limits one bank to have no more than 10 percent of the country's deposits.
The prospect of the giant companies -- epitomized by Nationsbank -- dominating banking coast to coast led Barnett to sell.
"Over the next few years we could be very viable, but beyond that we would be in a disadvantaged position," Allen L. Lastinger Jr., Barnett's president, said at a news conference yesterday afternoon.
To make the acquisition pay off, Nationsbank said that it would eliminate $915 million a year in costs, about 55 percent of Barnett's total expenses. That implies that perhaps half of Barnett's 19,500 jobs would be eliminated.
Officials of both companies declined to say how many jobs would be cut. They said both companies would institute a hiring freeze immediately and that many of the jobs eliminated would be among Nationsbank's 88,000 positions because some processing functions will be moved to Florida from other states and some of the branches closed in Florida will be among the 400 that Nationsbank has there.
"This is a management that knows how to cut costs, sometimes brutally," said Thomas A. Hanley, an analyst with UBS Securities. "I would expect that the pattern would be the same at Barnett."
Barnett chose a time to sell, analysts said, when bank stocks have been at record highs.
Analysts expect that these high prices will cause other successful regional banks that have been trying to maintain their independence to instead choose to put themselves up for sale in coming months.
And the banks that lost the bidding for Barnett -- said to include Banc One, First Union, Suntrust and Wachovia -- will be among the companies eagerly trying to buy other banks that become available.
Nationsbank will exchange stock worth $75.18 -- based on Thursday's closing price -- for each Barnett share. That represents a 43 percent premium to the price of Barnett's shares before word of the deal began to leak out Thursday. It is also a valuation that would have been seen as absurdly high even a year ago.
"At 4 times book value and 24 times earnings, this is the highest price ever paid for a bank," Mr. Hanley with UBS Securities. Still, he contended that Nationsbank would be able to make the acquisition pay off and be left with a powerful franchise in the Southeast. "This looks to be an outstanding deal," he said.
Since Nationsbank already has 12 percent of the deposit market in Florida and Barnett has 20 percent, the deal would put Nationsbank over the 30 percent maximum share allowed under Federal banking law. Nationsbank expects to sell about $3.5 billion in deposits to comply with the regulations, with most of the divestitures in the Tampa Bay area, where the combined bank would have more than a 40 percent share.
Nationsbank first exploited a loophole in laws that had prevented banks from moving across state lines to buy a bank in Tampa in 1981. It has grown rapidly since then through a series of adroit mergers. Led by the savvy and ambitious Hugh L. McColl Jr., Nationsbank built its reputation for merger mastery as a bottom fisher, buying big distressed banks at what turned out to be very low prices. But as the market has bid up bank stocks and the healthy economy wiped away loan problems, such bargains have been harder to find.
Nationsbank increasingly has come to the conclusion that it can afford to pay high prices for banks because its superior computer systems and products allow it to increase the profitability even of well- run banks.
In 1995, it bought BankSouth for $1.6 billion, giving it the dominant share in Atlanta. And in 1996, it bought Boatmen's Bankshares, a St. Louis company with the leading franchise in seven Midwestern states, for $9.5 billion.
The valuation of those deals shows how rapidly prices have been bid up for banks. Nationsbank paid 2.4 times book value for Bank South and 2.7 times book for Boatmen's. The other deals this year have been at much higher levels. First Bank System paid 3.4 times book for U.S. Bancorp in March. And last month the First Union Corporation agreed to pay 3.5 times book for the Signet Banking Corporation of Richmond. The book value of a company is its assets minus its liabilities.
Nationsbank has also been active in buying nonbanking companies. In June, it agreed to buy Montgomery Securities, the San Francisco brokerage firm, for $1.2 billion.
Charles E. Rice, the chairman of Barnett, will assume the chairman's title at Nationsbank next April when Andrew Craig, the former chairman of Boatmen's, retires. Mr. McColl, as Nationsbank's chief executive, remains fully in control.
Mr. Rice owns 448,000 shares of Barnett, worth about $33 million, and he has options on another 496,000 shares.
Nationsbank's stock fell $3.5625, or 5.6 percent, to $59.75 yesterday. That reaction was more muted than the 8 percent hit that the company's stock took after the Boatmen's acquisition was announced on the day before Labor Day last year.
Yesterday, Barnett's stock jumped $13.3125, to $68.125.

HEADLINE: Cuban Military, Long a Political Force, Takes Role in Economy, Too

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Aug. 29

 BODY:
Having ended its mission to spread revolution abroad, Cuba's military is undertaking a new mission at home: promoting support for the Castro Government during hard times.
The armed forces, probably Cuba's most powerful institution, has dropped its habitual secrecy to rally the nation during its economic crisis, when many people are grumbling about how hard it is even to feed their families. 
 Since 1989, when the collapse of the Soviet bloc cut off crucial aid and training, the military has played a larger role in Cuba's economy, starting farms, businesses and construction crews. Now it is playing a larger political role as well.
"The military is basically showing that it is behind the Government," said Wayne Smith, a Washington academic and formerly the chief American diplomat in Havana. "While it is considered an important force for reform, it is loyal to Castro and will not break ranks."
For the first time, officers are giving Government-approved interviews to Cuban journalists for books and magazine articles, mostly about the country's revolutionary past. Most notable was "Secrets of Generals," a collection of interviews with 41 officers.
Despite the title, the book revealed no military secrets -- just a rare glimpse into the background of the men who fought alongside Fidel Castro to overthrow the dictator Fulgencia Batista four decades ago.
Gen. Harry Villegas, a member of the party's politburo, delivered much the same message in two recent books about fighting alongside Che Guevara, who was killed by Bolivian troops in 1967 while trying to export Cuba's revolution.
In 1992, Mr. Castro announced that Cuba would no longer provide military help to insurgent groups abroad. At the time, the military was bruised by a 1989 drug-trafficking scandal that led to the execution of a war hero, Maj. Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa. Several military leaders defected.
In 1990, as Communism fell apart in the Soviet Union itself, bringing lasting economic hardship, Cuba's troop strength was cut from an estimated 180,000 -- roughly the size of the military in Mexico, a much larger country.
In December the armed forces staged their first sizable parade in a decade. With Mr. Castro and other heroes of the 1959 revolution looking on, veterans of the uprising marched past in Revolution Plaza.
So far, Cubans seem to appreciate the newly open military.
"There is a new policy to tell people about what happened over all those years," said an electrical engineer in Havana who refused to give her full name. "Before, those military leaders never appeared or spoke in public, except during political acts."

Nationsbank to Acquire Barnett for $15.5 Billion
Nationsbank agreed yesterday to acquire Barnett Banks for $15.5 billion in stock, creating the nation's third-largest banking company behind Chase Manhattan and Citicorp. The combined entity will have assets of $290 billion. 
 Barnett, which dominates the rapidly growing Florida market, has long been seen as the most attractive banking franchise in the country and it attracted many bidders. News of the deal was greeted favorably on Wall Street, where shares of Barnett rose 24.3 percent yesterday. [Page 1.]
 
Barnett prided itself on being a bank devoted solely to the state of Florida, but that may have been its Achilles' heel. Analysts say that the bank took too long to broaden its vision beyond the borders of the state. [36.]
 
Personal Income and Spending Rise
Americans' personal income increased one-tenth of 1 percent in July, while consumer spending rose eight-tenths of 1 percent, suggesting that the economic expansion will continue into next year. [39.]
 
Jury Award Is Reduced
A Federal judge ruled yesterday that ABC and two of its employees should pay the Food Lion supermarket chain only $315,000 in punitive damages, rather than the $5.5 million a jury had awarded in January as punishment for an investigative report that used hidden cameras to show unsanitary practices in the handling of meat and poultry. [1.]
 
A Laxative Is Pulled From Shelves
The maker of the laxative Ex-Lax, Novartis Consumer Health, is withdrawing from the market all versions of the drug containing phenolphthalein, citing concerns by Federal health officials over the ingredient. [8.]
 
Debt Inquiry by G.E. Unit
GE Capital is investigating whether it illegally collected credit card debts from more than 17,000 customers who filed for personal bankruptcy. [37.]
 
Giving Power to Agriculture
One week after the biggest meat recall in the United States, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has proposed legislation that would broadly strengthen his department's powers over companies found to have produced tainted meat and poultry. The measure would give the Agriculture Department authority to order the recall of a contaminated product. The department can now only try to persuade a company to do so voluntarily. [1.]
 
Trader Ousted at First Boston
Credit Suisse First Boston's London office has dismissed an employee for unauthorized options trading that caused losses of about $10 million and referred the matter to British regulators. [45]
 
Election Overseer Might Leave
The Federal election overseer who annulled Ron Carey's re-election as president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters has said privately that she intends to resign, officials involved in monitoring the union have said. The overseer, Barbara Zack Quindel, had at first been praised by both Mr. Carey and his chief rival, James P. Hoffa, for her neutrality. But she has since been criticized. [8.]
 
El Nino Talk Sends Wheat Prices Up
Wheat prices climbed to their highest level in more than three months on fears that the El Nino weather pattern will cut overseas crop production. On other markets, coffee and soybean prices rose. [45.]
 
Duncan Hines on the Block
Procter & Gamble is accepting bids for its Duncan Hines line of baking mixes, which it says does not fit with its strategy of market-leading food and beverage brands. [37.]

HEADLINE: Clothes Shoppers Waiting on the Brink of a Break

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
On the eve of New York's second tax-free holiday on clothing this year, Lisa Leonard is taking stock of her 4-year-old son's wardrobe. Winter jacket? Last year's is a little tight. Pants? He needs more. Turtlenecks? Those, too.
"It's definitely an incentive," said Mrs. Leonard, a special-events coordinator for Walt Disney World, pausing on the Upper West Side yesterday as her son Jesse dozed in a stroller. "We'll put a list together of the things he really needs and take advantage of the tax break. When you spend $50 on clothing and then look at the tax, you say, 'Whoa.' " 
 Welcome to Round 2 of the weeklong apparel tax repeal. Despite Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's intense lobbying to get rid of the state and city sales taxes on clothing this year, the State Legislature voted to postpone a repeal for two years. But shoppers are still getting a bone to placate them, in the form of a respite from sales taxes on certain items of clothing starting on Monday.
"It's a gift to the people," said Sheldon Silver, the Speaker of the State Assembly and a Democrat from New York City who had pushed, unsuccessfully, to repeal the state and city taxes this year.
The good news is that this time around, the seven-day break, which runs Monday through next Sunday, coincides with back-to-school week, a time when parents need to do a lot of shopping anyway. (The earlier tax break, in January, came as many people were depleted, financially and physically, after the holidays.)
But not everyone is happy. Unlike the last reprieve, the tax-free week does not apply to footwear and also lowers the ceiling for each exempt article of clothing to $100, from $500. Some shoppers say they are irritated because the repeal will not take the sting out of bigger purchases, like a winter coat or a suit, and shoe store owners are crestfallen.
"We're very disappointed," said William Rood, the controller of Harry's Shoes on Broadway at 83d Street on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. "My personal opinion is that footwear is a greater necessity in the streets of New York than clothing is."
Harry's is "making a political statement," however, by discounting all nonsale shoes that sell for less than $100 by 8 1/4 percent, Mr. Rood said.
All but 3 of New York's 62 counties have agreed to participate in the tax-free week by waiving their local sales taxes on clothing in addition to the state's tax break. In New York City, consumers will save 8 1/4 percent -- 4 percent from the state, 4 percent from the city, and one-quarter of 1 percent levied by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
For years local retailers have complained that they were losing business to New Jersey and surrounding states, where clothing is not taxed. The weeklong tax hiatus in January was a chance for the city and state officials to gauge the benefits of a permanent repeal, and for the most part they deemed it a success.
Charles Millard, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, said sales on apparel and footwear from Jan. 18 to Jan. 24 were 73.6 percent higher than the same week the year before. And apparel sales for the month of January rose by 29 percent from the year before, while nonapparel sales also rose, by 12 percent.
"When you cut tax on apparel it will increase shopping on clothes and other items as well," Mr. Millard said. "You have many facts that may not compel this conclusion but certainly lead us right toward it."
A study by the city's economic development agency said the city could add 11,000 retail jobs as a result of a permanent repeal of the sales tax on clothing priced under $100 and estimated that retail sales would increase by $570 million a year.
In January, there was some confusion leading up to the tax-free week, since some retailers were uncertain about what was tax exempt and what was not. This time, the state issued lists well in advance, with scores of categories and their status. Aprons, shawls and hand muffs are exempt, for instance, while shower caps, golf gloves and children's costumes are not.
Store owners were preparing yesterday for what they hoped would be a surge in shopping next week. Daffy's, a discount apparel chain with stores in the New York region, scrambled to fill up the racks of childen's clothes in the city.
"I pulled children's merchandise from our stores in Philadelphia and New Jersey and sent it into our New York stores," said Elida Behar, a children's apparel buyer for the chain. "I have high hopes. Our customers are very price-sensitive, and if you're buying $300 to $400 worth of clothing it makes a big difference."
Even high-end children's clothing shops on the Upper East Side, where parents often spend $1,000 in a visit, were confident that the tax-free week would draw additional customers.
"Everybody loves a bargain," said Paulina Vegas, the manager of Jacadi, a boutique at Madison Avenue and 91st Street that sells French-made apparel for boys and girls. "People can take the savings on the taxes and buy another blouse."
Indeed, some shoppers said the tax exemptions would mean more clothes in their closets rather than extra money in their wallets. Darlene Rodriguez, a junior at Louis D. Brandeis High School in Manhattan, said she was waiting for the week to start before spending $300 on her back-to-school wardrobe. "It's great," she said, checking the fall fashions at a Gap store, "because then you can buy more things."

HEADLINE: Poll Detects Widespread Skepticism About Proposed Tobacco Deal

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29

 BODY:
Americans are highly suspicious of the proposed tobacco deal, saying it would not achieve even the prime objective of reducing teen-age smoking unless cigarette prices rise much more than expected, an Associated Press poll shows.
More than half of those surveyed say the deal is not worth the main concession that cigarette makers demand, a ban on class-action lawsuits. Two-thirds expect tobacco companies to sell as many cigarettes as ever. 
 Seventy percent say the price of a pack of cigarettes would have to rise by more than $1 -- much more than expected under the deal -- to significantly curtail teen-age smoking.
The telephone poll was conducted Aug. 20-24 by I.C.R. of Media, Pa., among a random sample of 1,003 adult Americans in all states except Alaska and Hawaii. The margin of error was estimated at plus or minus three percentage points.
Congress and President Clinton are to begin grappling with the proposed deal next month, and such poll findings are bound to figure in the debate.
"This reflects a huge amount of cynicism and skepticism about tobacco," said Scott Harshbarger, the Massachusetts Attorney General, who insists that the public is missing the deal's good points.
If the debate remains as polarized as it is today, Mr. Harshbarger said, "We will miss an opportunity that may not come again, and tobacco wins."
The findings present a dilemma for the deal's supporters, who would like to toughen some provisions but without causing tobacco companies to back out.
Critics of the proposed settlement seized on the poll's findings.
"The American people have it right," Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, said in a statement. "They're not against a settlement; they're against a bad settlement. It's exactly this kind of public opposition to the deal that's going to force Congress to make significant changes."
The proposed deal would settle state lawsuits against tobacco companies by forcing companies to pay $368.5 billion over 25 years, curb advertising and marketing and pay fines if teen-age smoking does not fall by roughly 30 percent over five years. In return, the industry would benefit from the class-action ban and other legal protections, plus restrictions on pending Government control over nicotine levels.
Mr. Clinton has said he will stiffen the deal, demanding full Government regulation of nicotine. The poll found that 58 percent of Americans support such regulation.
Fifty-four percent of those polled said a deal was not worth the ban on class-action lawsuits. But smokers were split evenly: 39.5 percent said a deal was worth that concession, and 41 percent said it was not.
The proposal would force companies to raise cigarette prices by about 62 cents a pack. A pack now averages $1.74, including tax.
Eight in 10 Americans said a jump of even 75 cents would not cut smoking among teen-agers significantly. Seventy percent of those polled, and 61 percent of smokers, said prices would have to rise more than $1 a pack to accomplish that.
Jeffrey Harris, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said prices would have to rise from $1.15 to $1.50 a pack to reduce teen-age smoking by 30 percent. But even a small price increase would cut cigarette sales, he said.
Every 10 percent increase in price would reduce the number of cigarettes sold by 4 percent, Mr. Harris's calculations indicate.

HEADLINE: Odyssey of a Bosnian Serb: From Karadzic Ally to Foe

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Aug. 28

 BODY:
When the Bosnian Serb President, Biljana Plavsic, returned from talks with British officials in London at the end of June, she got a nasty surprise. Bosnian Serb police officers met her at the airport in Belgrade, ushered her into a waiting car and whisked her against her will toward the Bosnian Serbs' mountain capital at Pale, where her one-time political mentor, Radovan Karadzic, holds court.
NATO troops were alerted, and they intervened to prevent what officials believe was a kidnapping intended to intimidate and, presumably, silence Ms. Plavsic, who had already begun to turn from Dr. Karadzic's political stand-in to a bitter rival for power. 
 In the months since then, as the rivalry and the power struggle have deepened, so has the commitment of the American-led NATO force to backing Ms. Plavsic. In the last week alone, NATO forces have used armor and helicopters to help her extend her voice and influence in the Serbian enclave by taking control of police stations and media centers while fending off angry mobs of Karadzic supporters.
But in many ways she is an odd choice as a NATO partner, and a questionable hope as a peacemaker.
She rose to the Bosnian Serb presidency a year ago as an ideological partner of Dr. Karadzic, after NATO forced him to step aside because he has been indicted by an international war crimes tribunal on genocide charges. Indeed, she owed her rise in the governing Serb Democratic Party to Dr. Karadzic, and two years ago, as one of the most strident Serb nationalists, she bitterly condemned the NATO bombing campaign that shattered the resolve of the Bosnian Serb army and its dream of taking Sarajevo, the prize for which much of the war had been waged.
Now, even after having broken with Dr. Karadzic, Ms. Plavsic does not criticize him and his allies for the atrocities committed during the war, or for their radical brand of Serb nationalism. Her big complaint is that Dr. Karadzic and his allies are corrupt.
And she is clearly no match -- not yet, at least -- for Dr. Karadzic in raw power in the Bosnian Serb community. As in her escape from the kidnapping attempt, success in her recent efforts to take control of broadcast outlets and police stations have depended, in the end, on the backing of NATO forces willing to confront Serbs loyal to Dr. Karadzic.
A 67-year-old former biology professor, Ms. Plavsic may already owe her life to NATO. A Western diplomat described the incident at the airport this way: "We suspect the idea was to take her to Pale where she would have been committed to psychiatric treatment or simply disappear, perhaps in what would have later been described as a suicide. The car, however, entered Bosnia at the wrong border crossing and did not meet up with its escort. NATO troops, who had been alerted to halt the kidnapping, were able to intervene."
The ride from the airport appears to have been a pivotal event in Ms. Plavsic's metamorphosis. A few days later, on July 2, she made a stunning announcement over Bosnian Serb television that was tantamount to a declaration of war on Dr. Karadzic and the Pale leadership, denouncing them for amassing tens of millions of dollars from the control of cigarette and gasoline sales and for running a state "in which the budget does not actually exist, where police are involved in smuggling and stealing from their own state and where a majority of the population is living in abject poverty."
She went on to call for the Minister of Interior, Dragan Kijaca, a close Karadzic ally, to resign.
That speech triggered the current power struggle between Pale and the western Bosnian city of Banja Luka, where Ms. Plavsic has her offices.
Ms. Plavsic and NATO seem to have little love for each other, but it is clear that NATO needs her as much as she needs NATO. If NATO forces are to withdraw as scheduled from Bosnia in June 1998, they must break Dr. Karadzic's grip on power. And Ms. Plavsic, whatever her views on nationalism, is the only Bosnian Serb political leader now willing to defy Pale.
The arguments she musters for opposing Pale are economic. She and those around her contend that unless the economy is rescued from its downward spiral and the corruption of senior Serbian officials, the Serbian enclave will disintegrate.
"My struggle against the leaders in Pale is a struggle to save the Serb Republic," she said recently.
Ms. Plavsic, who now refuses to answer questions about the Serbian "ethnic cleansing" campaign and atrocities committed during the war, describes herself as a "pragmatic nationalist." But while she still opposes the arrest of Dr. Karadzic, who was twice indicted by the war crimes tribunal in The Hague on genocide charges, she says she will honor the Dayton agreement and cooperate with the international community. Her refusal to condemn Serbian behavior during the war, however, leaves many outsiders skeptical.
"The international community does not back Plavsic," said a Western diplomat. "It backs what she champions. She says she is for the Dayton agreement, democracy and against corruption. To the extent she carries out these reforms, we support her. If she backs away from these principles we will take stock again."
Ms. Plavsic, who is deeply religious in addition to being a fierce nationalist, joined Dr. Karadzic's Serb Democratic Party in 1990 and left Sarajevo in April 1992 to join the rebels in the mountain town of Pale just outside Sarajevo. She was one of the few rebel Serb leaders who never belonged to the Communist Party.
During the war she was one of two vice presidents of the Serbian enclave. She frequently toured the front lines, often in a flowing fur coat, and oversaw the distribution of war relief aid to citizens. She was not involved in operational plans to prosecute the war or in planning the attacks on ethnic Croat and Muslim minorities that left tens of thousands of people dead and saw over a million people driven from their homes, Bosnian officials say.
She did, however, say during the war that Serbs were genetically superior to Muslims. She called for the division of Sarajevo, with most of the city going to the Serbs, since, she said, it was well known that Muslims liked to live piled on top of one another.
She also publicly rejoiced in the savage rampages through Muslim towns by the notorious paramilitary leader Zeljko Raznatovic, known as Arkan. When Arkan's militia drove the Muslims out of Zvornik early in the war, she arrived shortly afterward to congratulate him in front of television cameras, embracing and kissing him.
"I always kiss heroes," she said at the time.
Nicknamed the "Serbian Empress" for her imperial style, she opposed every peace plan drawn up by international mediators, including, at the time, the Dayton agreement, as "unfair" to the Serbs. She refused to shake hands with the Serbian President of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosovic, during his only visit to the Serbian enclave in 1993 because he had supported the Vance-Owen peace plan.
Mr. Milosovic has often told foreign diplomats that Ms. Plavsic belongs in "a lunatic asylum."
There were also moments during the war when Ms. Plavsic, who was briefly married and divorced, exhibited streaks of remarkable cruelty.
She ordered, for example, that a convoy of 78 Muslim children being evacuated from Sarajevo in April 1992 be taken hostage and held without food and water, until her brother was released from a jail in Sarajevo. When the Muslim authorities freed her brother and sister-in-law the next day, she ordered the children released.
She also said the term "ethnic cleansing" was the international community's way to describe what was "a natural phenomena."
Today, though, Bosnian Serb colleagues in Pale say that she seems to have remained honest in a world where war profiteering is believed to be widespread among her fellow officials. During closed-door sessions of the Bosnian Serb parliament, she denounced the senior officials for corruption, including Mr. Kardazic.
In July 1996 the international community brokered a deal with Dr. Karadzic to step down and withdraw from public life in return for participation by his governing party in the internationally monitored elections. Ms. Plavsic was elevated to the role of acting President and was named by the governing party to stand for the post of President of the Bosnian Serb Republic, evidently on the expectation that she would prove pliable. But Dr. Karadzic, following her election last September, did not relinquish his hold on power. He sent her to Banja Luka, where she had little to do and faded from public view. Ms. Plavsic smoldered there, and focused on her objections to the wealth amassed by the leadership while teachers, doctors and government workers received their small salaries months late or not at all. Early this year she started an investigation and recruited as an ally in Pale the former vice president and Shakespeare professor Nikola Koljevic, who had been shunted aside after the elections.
Mr. Koljevic, however, was found dead in his office in January with a bullet wound to his head. The official explanation for his death is that it was a suicide, but Ms. Plavsic and Mr. Koljevic's family say he was killed because of his support for Ms. Plavsic's anti-corruption campaign.
In one of the last meetings she attended with senior officials in Pale this spring, the Serbian member of the Bosnian tripartite Presidency, Momcilo Krajisinik, a close Karadzic ally who does not smoke, called for a break so Ms. Plavsic could go outside and have a cigarette. The word he used for smoke, however, also has a vulgar second meaning. As the party officials chuckled in amusement, Ms. Plavsic stormed out of the room.
The latest stage of the confrontation between Ms. Plavsic, backed by NATO, and Dr. Karadzic took shape two weeks ago when British soldiers, in an effort to prevent Ms. Plavsic's arrest by police officers loyal to Dr. Karadzic, seized all of the police stations in Banja Luka and disarmed the Karadzic supporters. Since then, NATO troops have been crucial in her effort to take over other police stations and television transmitters.

HEADLINE: 2 Communities Illustrate Debate Over Census

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: HARRISBURG, Pa., Aug. 27

 BODY:
One neighborhood is urban, largely black and poor. The other is suburban, virtually all white, and middle and upper class. But they represent two sides of the same coin, the yin and the yang of the problems the Census Bureau experiences in trying to carry out a modern-day count of the nation's population.
Statisticians estimate that in 1990, the Census Bureau counted too few residents on the Hill, the low-income neighborhood on the south side of this state capital, while it tallied too many in New Cumberland, a small bedroom community across the Susquehanna River from Harrisburg. 
 Census officials acknowledged the problems in its last survey, when nearly 10 million people were missed nationwide and 4.4 million were counted twice or were made up by frustrated census takers who could not gain access to homes, according to the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. And the Census Bureau has a remedy for the next scheduled head count, in 2000. It is called sampling, a method similar to that used in public opinion polls that extrapolates the characteristics of a large group by talking to a representative part of it.
If the bureau can use sampling -- a plan strongly opposed by Republican leaders in Congress -- it may avoid the problems that stem from situations like those of Cory Layton, who lives on the Hill. Mr. Layton, who is 20 and married and has two children, has not been getting along with his wife, Angel, who is 19. So he moved out of Hall Manor, the public housing project where they lived, and in with his mother, who lives in another part of the city.
If a census form was to arrive in the mail today, no one is sure who would list Mr. Layton. His wife said she definitely would not include him as living with her. And he strongly doubted that his mother would indicate he lived with her, if she bothered to fill out a census form at all.
"I don't care" about being listed, Mr. Layton said, standing in the doorway of his wife's apartment. "It's not affecting me."
Mr. Layton might not believe that such an oversight affects him directly, but if the Census Bureau could correct for it through sampling, the resulting revisions in its 60,000 census tracts could have a high-stakes effect on the national political map. The census is used to apportion seats in the House of Representatives and to draw Congressional and state legislative districts across the land.
And there is the rub. To Republicans in Congress, sampling has become a dirty word. They say it invites manipulation of figures for partisan purposes and insist that the Constitution requires an actual count of every resident.
What those Republicans rarely add is that many of those undercounted tracts, like the Hill in Harrisburg, are overwhelmingly Democratic and many tracts that were overcounted like the one in New Cumberland are solidly Republican. Republicans fear that adjustments for undercounts and overcounts could cost them Congressional seats.
The Census Bureau said the problems that occurred in 1990 might get worse if Congress, as it has threatened, forbade the bureau to supplement its count with estimates based on samples of the population.
"Every indication since 1990 suggests that the census-taking environment is likely to be even more difficult in 2000 than it was in 1990," the bureau wrote in a report to Congress last month. The difficulties stem from a rise in the numbers of two-income couples, who are often too busy to fill out the forms; immigrants with limited English and college students, who are often counted twice.
A plan by the Republicans to derail sampling earlier this year was put aside because it was stalling emergency flood relief for Midwestern states. But when Congress returns from its recess after Labor Day, the Republican leadership will try to forbid the Census Bureau to spend any money on preparations to use sampling.
Census officials say sampling is needed to help smooth out the discrepancies it has found in places like Harrisburg. Using mathematical models of the types of communities where miscounts are likely, bureau statisticians estimate that the official count of 5,658 people in the census tract on the Hill was short by about 5.4 percent. In contrast, the 3,991 people officially listed in the New Cumberland tract was reckoned to be about 2 percent too many.
Mr. Layton is emblematic of the people unlikely to be counted: inner-city males, especially black and Hispanic men, with only a tenuous hold on any permanent residence. In 1990, an estimated 14 percent of black men aged 30 to 34 were not counted, the highest undercounting of any group in the country.
"When boys start to get about 15 years old in many low-income communities, they start going from one house to another," said Alan Zaslavsky, a professor of statistics at Harvard University who serves on a panel to evaluate census methodology. "They are often too old to remain with the family discipline and they can't afford to stay in one place. They might live with an aunt one week, a grandmother the next." Demographically, the Hill is awash with people who are prone to be missed. The poor are much more likely to be missed than middle and upper income people, and the 1990 census indicated that 50.3 percent of the people living on the Hill had incomes below the poverty line.
Children are much more likely not to be counted than older people, and more than 41 percent of those living in the census tract on the Hill were under the age of 18 in 1990. Renters are more likely to be missed than homeowners. Nearly half of the residents in this inner-city tract rent apartments.
In contrast, New Cumberland has all the attributes of an area where everyone tends to be counted, and some groups tend to be overcounted. Women tend to be counted twice at a higher rate than men. Adult females make up 43 percent of the population of the New Cumberland tract. The elderly -- especially the retirees who spend part of the year in warmer climates -- are much more prone to double counting. Nearly 42 percent of the residents of the New Cumberland tract are 50 and over.
"The guy across the street from me has a house in New Cumberland," said John R. Murray, president of the New Cumberland Borough Council. "He also has a place in Florida. About a month from now he'll pack up and head down there for six months. Being an older population, we have a great many retired people in town and a lot of them do that."
Because census forms are sent to every address in the country, those with two residences receive two. Though the forms admonish the recipients to return only the one that has been mailed to their primary residence, many people, especially retirees with more time on their hands, fill out both. In 1990, this duplication was often not caught.
"Much of overcount is simply due to human error," said Eugene Ericksen, a professor of sociology and statistics at Temple University in Philadelphia. "There are computer matches that are supposed to catch duplications. But the problem can be as simple as bad handwriting or poor spelling."
Census officials said they would have enhanced computers for the 2000 census that would better identify duplication.
In the Hall Manor housing project, where 1,675 people are supposed to reside in 10 red-brick, two-story buildings, the problem is not people returning too many forms, it is people often not mailing back any at all. Distrust of authority abounds.
"Any outside people, any whites, or any people who seem to be of any kind of authority might not be welcome," said Betty Watkins, the manager of Hall Manor.
And sometimes the residents believe there are good reasons not to divulge information. The regulations at Hall Manor allow only those who are officially listed on the lease -- generally a mother and her children -- to stay in an apartment for longer than two weeks. Violating this rule could mean eviction for the legitimate tenant.
Thus, tenants would be hesitant to name boyfriends or family members who are illegally staying with them, even if the census form says the information is confidential.
"I sometimes let my sister or my brother or a friend of mine stay with me, if they don't have a place to stay," said Brigett Pattillo, 32, who lives with her four children and a husband who shows up every now and then."
Even if it does not use sampling, the Census Bureau hopes to reduce undercounting by making it easier for people to respond to the census. Special census forms, called "Be Counted" forms, will be available at public libraries, post offices and convenience stores. In addition, people can provide census information via an 800 telephone number.
Census officials acknowledge that these new methods could add to overcounting because there is no way of assuring that two or more people from the same household might not pick up the form and fill it out independently.
Officials hope to catch these duplications with the bureau's enhanced computer capabilities. And if an unreasonable number of "Be Counted" forms are returned from a given area, enumerators will be sent to double-check the information in person. But officials acknowledged that they did not yet know what constitutes a unreasonable number.
"We don't have an answer for that yet," said Peter Bounpane, assistant to the census director.
 
How Bureau Plans to Use Sampling in Its 2000 Census
The sampling that the Census Bureau wants to use to supplement the 2000 Census has been compared to the public opinion polls used in political campaigns. But while the underlying principle is the same -- extrapolating the characteristics (or opinions) of a large group by talking to a representative sample -- the bureau's plans are far more sophisticated.
The plans involve three sets of samples. The first would check a selection of houses in a given census tract that are presumed to be vacant. The second would check a proportion of residences from which forms were not returned. And the last would be a random sampling nationwide as a final check of the accuracy of their methods.
The United States Postal Service in 2000 will probably estimate that 5 percent of the 119 million residential addresses in the country are vacant, the bureau said. In past years, those addresses would not be sent a census form. But studies have shown that at least 11 percent of the homes the Postal Service said were empty, were, in fact, occupied. The bureau, rather than sending forms, would send counters to 1 in 10 of the houses that Postal Service records say are vacant. The number of those dwellings found to be occupied and the number of people living in them would then be used to estimate the population in housing units that were thought to be vacant across the country.
In 1990, the bureau repeatedly sent enumerators to the 35 percent of all addresses that did not return their mail-in census forms. In 2000, the bureau plans to send people to only a fraction of the households from which forms are not returned. The percentage visited would depend on how many households in each census tract -- a neighborhood containing about 1,700 households -- have mailed their forms in.
If 80 percent of the households in a tract have sent the form in, the bureau would visit 1 in 2 of those houses that did not respond. If only 30 percent of the addresses mailed the forms, census takers would visit 6 out of 7 of those dwellings that did not. The goal is to have a response either by mail or by visit from 90 percent of the dwellings in each of the country's 60,000 census tracts. Using the information gathered, the bureau would estimate the number and characteristics of the remaining 10 percent.
Finally, the bureau would randomly select 750,000 households nationwide, making sure that each state and all racial, age, economic and other demographic groups were represented. This sample would be used as a "quality control" to check the accuracy of the bureau's efforts and to make adjustments where necessary. STEVEN A. HOLMES

HEADLINE: FOOTBALL;
A Coaching Partnership Reshapes the Jets

BYLINE: By GERALD ESKENAZI 

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., Aug. 29

 BODY:
In many ways, the Jets team that was reconfigured this week, as it prepares for a new era that starts Sunday at Seattle, is the result of a joint venture: Bill Parcells, king for the millennium, with Bill Belichick sitting to the right of the throne. Of all the relationships between coach and assistant in the National Football League, none is as encompassing and significant as this one.
Belichick's title of assistant head coach does not begin to cover the job description. He was at Parcells's side when they looked at hundreds of tapes of players to pluck from the draft or free agency. 
 "Ninety percent of it here is the way it was with the Giants," said Belichick, known here as Little Bill. The two were on the Giants together from 1981 to 1990.
The sandy-haired, boyish Belichick is a reserved 45-year-old. On the field, he is effusive by comparison -- correcting and instructing. His defenses are smart and minimize mistakes.
He was the Browns' leader for five years, taking them to an 11-5 record in 1994, and then saw them collapse the next season once the decision was made to leave for Baltimore.
That was not his only head coaching job. Belichick was the Jets' head coach for a week back in February. That was the tumultuous time when the team was trying to get Parcells, who had severed his stormy relationship with the Patriots.
"When I became the Jets' head coach, there were a lot of things to be done and that had to be started," Belichick said. "I knew it was going to switch at some time. We did a lot that week -- bringing people on the staff, starting talks with players, arranging to hire the three holdover coaches."
But as soon as the Jets made their deal with the Patriots' owner, Bob Kraft, to get Parcells, Belichick yielded his head-coaching duties and shifted into his current role.
Belichick says he has no problem being an assistant after being the head man for five years.
"There's plenty of jobs to do," he said. "There are some things Bill asked me to do because of my experience. He's working 24 hours a day. I'm working 24 hours a day."
What's special about the relationship?
"The whole thing is building a mentality and commitment, not only to the program, but to each other," Belichick said. "It's thinking, 'I don't want to let anyone down.' "
Parcells explains the symbiosis more succinctly. "We both like football," he said. "We don't have much in common. Different backgrounds. But we've got one thing in common."
Belichick was raised around football in Annapolis, Md., where his father, Steve, was a longtime coach and scout for Navy. At Wesleyan, Belichick majored in economics and was contemplating a master's degree and perhaps a career in business, with football as a way to foot the freight.
"I was a senior in 1975 when Lou Holtz at North Carolina State was ready to get me as a graduate assistant," Belichick said. "But he lost the scholarship."
So Belichick went to work under Ted Marchibroda at the Baltimore Colts. Four years later, he became the Giants' special-teams coach and began his association with Parcells.
They were reunited last year at New England. Parcells made him the Patriots' assistant head coach. Kraft now talks of having wanted Belichick in the wings to replace Parcells in the event he left.
But when Parcells left, Kraft instead hired Pete Carroll, the former coach of the Jets. Why not Belichick?
"I had plans to talk to Bill Belichick about coaching," Kraft said. "But Parcells's departure had created such a whirlwind, a storm, and I couldn't talk to his people. We were just left in such turmoil and uncertainty, and I knew that Parcells would be taking the staff with him. We thought it was better to start fresh."
 
EXTRA POINTS
An indication of a team in transition: linebacker PEPPER JOHNSON, in his first season here, has been elected defensive captain, and quarterback NEIL O'DONNELL, in his second year, is offensive captain. . . . The Jets have fewer than 100 seats available, in scattered single locations, for their eight home games.

HEADLINE: Bill Won't Erode Native Americans' Sovereignty

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Senate Measures Would Deal Blow to Indian Rights" (front page, Aug. 27): 
 Accountability and equity are the central principles behind the two provisions I wrote. One would restore to non-Indian citizens the constitutional right to seek redress in a Federal court over civil grievances against an Indian tribe. The other creates a formula to prioritize the allocation of Federal financing to tribes based on economic need.
The tribes' sovereignty will in no way "erode" by giving citizens the right to bring civil suits before an impartial court. And what of the erosion of the constitutional rights of United States citizens currently denied due process? Moreover, my provision does not alter the substantive principle of tribal self-governance.
Under the current system of allocating Federal money, tribes that have grown rich from casino gambling and other enterprises are de facto denying the poorest tribes a fair share of Federal dollars. My provision would alter this discrepancy, not exacerbate the inequity.
I also take issue with the characterization that I have a long-running "dispute" with the tribes and seek to use my position to pursue a vendetta. True, we have disagreed in the past, and may in the future. But because there are two competing views about the proper legal relationship between non-Indians and Indians, and between the Federal Government and the tribes, it does not mean principle is being subjugated to my personal whims. Rather, it is an illustration of the democratic process at work.

HEADLINE: QUICK SIP;
Whipping Up a Prize-winning Dairy Drink

 BODY:
Josephine Lutz calls her creation Quick & Easy Nutritious & Delicious Refreshing Drink.
It is, indeed, all of those things. And it was special enough to win the grand prize in the 11th annual Jersey Fresh Dairy Recipe Contest. 
 The competition is sponsored by the state Agriculture Department and the New Jersey State Dairy Princess Committee, which seeks to to educate consumers about the importance of dairy products in the diet and the economic impact of the state's dairy industry.
Contestants were judged on how they used dairy products and fresh fruit from New Jersey to create something that looked good, tasted good and was good for you. Mrs. Lutz, who is from Sussex, stuck with the basics and came up with this recipe, which takes five minutes to make and serves four people:
1 1/2 cups milk (skim, low fat or regular)
1 1/2 cups New Jersey fruit in season (strawberries, peaches, blackberries, blueberries, raspberries or cherries)
4 full scoops of ice cream, frozen yogurt or plain yogurt (your choice, depending on how rich you want the drink to be)
 1/4 teaspoon vanilla
Sugar to taste
Dash of nutmeg
Whipped cream
Prepare fruit (stem berries, pit cherries or peaches, etc.) and slice.
Pour milk in blender, add fruit and vanilla; blend for approximately 1 1/2 minutes. Add ice cream or yogurt to fruit mixture; blend until smooth, about two minutes. Pour mixture in glass and top with whipped cream and a dash of nutmeg.
When Mrs. Lutz made the deluxe version of her recipe for judges in June, strawberries were in season. On Sept. 6, when she claims her $150 prize at the Somerset County 4-H Center in Bridgewater, farmstands should still have plenty of blueberries and peaches.
No matter what the season, and no matter how rich a drink she whips up, she likes to top it off with a cherry -- Jersey Fresh, if possible.

INTIMATE ENEMIES
 The Two Worlds
 of the Baroness de Pontalba.
 By Christina Vella.
 Illustrated. 426 pp. Baton Rouge:
 Louisiana State University Press.
 $29.95. 
 On Nov. 8, 1834, Stendhal wrote to a friend about a recent scandal that was the talk of Paris, commenting smugly: "I know the husband and the wife. Who was the indirect author-hero of all this mess?"
The "mess" in question was, even by contemporary standards, fairly spectacular: on the morning of Oct. 19, the 80-year-old Baron de Pontalba, dueling pistols in hand, burst into the sleeping quarters of his 40-year-old daughter-in-law (the future Baroness de Pontalba) and fired three shots into her chest. Perceiving that she was wounded but not yet dead, he pursued her through several rooms of their country estate, repeatedly shooting - but missing. Finally, he gave up, rewrote his will in favor of a military school and killed himself. The Baron's son, Clestin, took care of his wounded wife until it became clear she would recover. Then he served her with a summons - in the most recent of two decades' worth of lawsuits.
One suspects, with some reason, that Stendhal had his eye on the aristocratic scandal as material for a story. He kept several newspaper accounts of the incident in a file, along with biographical information about various members of the family. And he had already begun to ask the kinds of questions novelists ask.
He never used the story - at least not in any recognizable form - and its remarkable particulars languished in obscurity for more than 150 years. Now Christina Vella, a historian at Tulane University, has framed them in the form of a biography, meticulously reconstructed from court records, family papers, household accounts and government archives. She focuses on the Baroness de Pontalba, but at the same time ambitiously sets out to unravel the complexities of class, marriage, family economy, politics and the law, both in France and in Louisiana, spanning four generations of two families.
The Pontalba debacle begins in America. The Baroness was born Micaela Almonester (called Micael), daughter of the richest man in New Orleans and a poor but well-connected Creole mother. Her father, already 67 when she was born, died when she was 2. Micael's mother, having first married a man old enough to be her father, subsequently married a man younger than she, who succeeded in alienating a healthy part of her fortune. This matrimonial reverse may have made the widow Almonester (now Madame Castillon) cautious in negotiating her own daughter's marriage contract.
When the girl was 15, Madame Castillon's cousin, Joseph Delfau de Pontalba, the Baron, wrote from France to suggest an alliance between Micael and his son, Clestin. He sent his wife and son to New Orleans to conclude the business, and the couple returned to France after their marriage, both mothers in tow. Micael's dowry was substantial, but Pontalba was apparently disappointed to find that only about a third of it was to be paid immediately. The rest, Madame Castillon stipulated, would come in increments over time. Vella argues convincingly that by standards of the period, there was nothing out of the ordinary in the marriage contract, but the Baron de Pontalba nevertheless dramatically averred that the bride had "arrived despoiled." The real insult, one suspects, was that her mother had dared to pose conditions. To lay hands on the rest of Micael's dowry, the elder Pontalba had to sign over an equal sum to his son.
The wily Baron promised to give Clestin the money, then made him sign a secret agreement stating he would never under any circumstances ask for it. Clestin's 16-year-old bride came across the paper by accident one day, after which (as her lawyer later stated) "life became complicated." Baron de Pontalba's "complication" proved to be merely the first salvo of a guerrilla war that lasted nearly four decades.
Micael was still amenable enough at 17, however, to be persuaded to sign a paper giving up complete control of her money, real estate and possessions, as well as the right to represent herself in court. With this document in hand, her husband and father-in-law proceeded to attack her mother in court, challenging the distribution of the inheritance from Almonester. Under French law, the husband controlled a wife's dowry but not her inheritance.
Micael's mother, a superbly competent businesswoman who had greatly increased the inheritance since Almonester's death, fought back ably in court. But she was defeated on the home front: the Pontalbas removed her daughter to their country estate just as she was about to give birth to her first child, denying the eager grandmother access. Capitulating, Madame Castillon signed over still more of her American property: all the houses on the left side of what is now New Orleans's Jackson Square. As a condition, however, she stipulated that Clestin surrender the power of attorney Micael had assigned him.
Clestin and his father seem to act as a single malevolent force in the endlessly protracted legal wranglings, but despite this, there is evidence that between the son and his wife there was considerable affection. Even after Clestin blackmailed her into signing over half of the assets Madame Castillon had protected with a legally watertight will, Micael wrote to her notary: "My husband is too devoted to me not to love me always; they can't take away the friendship which is in the depths of his heart for me." She gave birth to five children in five years. Only two died - a fairly good rate of survival for the times.
It is interesting to speculate whether Micael's capacity for taking independent action grew as a result of the extreme measures her husband and father-in-law adopted to exert control over her every action, or whether her character gathered strength of purpose despite them. At any rate, after 20 years of marital life, Micael finally decided it was "urgent for her to become enlightened as to her own rights." The lawyer she consulted informed her that her husband had no claim to any of her property in America (except that specified in the original marriage contract), but that she would have to go to Louisiana to reclaim her rights.
Micael's departure for New Orleans set off the chain of events that led to her shooting. The legal system in France held that a woman who abandoned her husband's household could be stripped of all assets - including the right to act as mother to her children. While Micael was away, the Pontalbas obtained a judgment against her, giving her two months to return. When she did, on the last possible day allowed by the court, her relatives began devising exquisite tortures to drive her away. The entire household was instructed to pretend she was invisible; even guests were warned not to address a word to Micael. She proved as indomitable as her enemies, however, and in the end her clever father-in-law was driven to the crudest possible of remedies.
Incredibly enough, after the shooting a French court once again ordered Micael back to her husband's chateau. But Clestin's sense of invincibility now led him to commit a fatal error. The couple's eldest son had paid the journal that reported on the juiciest of trials not to publish the transcript. Clestin, however, now the Baron, paid the same journal a matching sum to print his lawyer's arguments but not hers. Clestin was so pleased with the results of this strategy that he engaged a publisher to print the one-sided transcript in a little rose booklet, to be distributed to 500 friends. People began to shun the Baroness.
Shooting wasn't sufficient cause to obtain a separation for Micael, but the loss of reputation was. Her husband had failed in his duty to protect his wife's good name, and the court punished him by granting her complete autonomy. She still had two bullets in her chest, but, at 41, she finally had her freedom.
The mere fact of Micael's survival, both emotional and physical, was remarkable enough, but the career she now began was perhaps equally surprising for a woman of her time. She inherited her parents' affinity for building and astute business instincts, and their "passion for contracts, pricing, drawings and all the reckoning associated with construction." She began by demolishing an 18th-century Paris mansion whose wainscoting, paneling and other appurtenances she admired, instructing an architect to design a house for her that would incorporate these elements. She had to sue the architect to get what she wanted. But the magnificent house she built is now the American Ambassador's residence in Paris.
Serving to a large degree as her own architect on the next project, the Baroness also built two huge apartment buildings in New Orleans, on either side of Jackson Square. They may well have been the most ambitious buildings of their kind up to that time in America, cleverly combining architectural elements from several different vernaculars. Certainly their innovative use of iron grillwork set a style that defined the look New Orleans came to be known for.
In the end, it was Micael who survived. Whether or not she prevailed is open to question. After several years of separation, her husband called her back to take charge of his affairs, then slowly lost his mind. Did she become his prisoner, then, in a different sense? She spent last 23 years of her life taking care of him - and never built another building.
Vella interlards the telling of Baroness de Pontalba's story with discussions of the position of women in France and in America in the 19th century, strategies of upward mobility, political practices of Napoleon and his successors, the history of the Paris Commune and countless details of the material lives people a century and a half ago negotiated their way through.
In general, this approach adds greatly to the biography's interest - with one glaring exception. The book begins with a very long summary of early New Orleans history and the politics of the Spanish court (it was a Spanish possession then), wandering through subjects that contribute little to our understanding of the Baroness's life. The reader would do well to skip through these encumbering initial chapters.
Christina Vella has done a spectacular job of excavating the historical record but, as she herself points out, "the documents of Micael's and Clestin's marriage are clumsy guides to a complicated relationship" because they leave "much to be imagined and presumed." We long for a novelist who could explore the intricate workings of motivation, who could trace the seesawings of power and control, who could ask the tricky question of who the "author" of this family's story finally was.
Stendhal may have been too busy with other projects to take up the Pontalba scandal as a subject - he was, after all, working on another novel at the time. But there may have been another reason he shied away: the too-muchness of it all. Henry James would have thought so. He worked from "the stray suggestion, the wandering word . . . any more than the minimum of which spoils the whole operation."
Too-muchness has never been an impediment to serialization, however. And public consideration of the Pontalba doings might offer up an interesting historical corrective to current notions about family values. We tend to blame the demise of the manners and traditions of the extended family and community for the epidemic of violence and abuse that seems to plague the end of the 20th century. But here is abuse and violence flowering in the most traditional of societies, where family values held firm to a degree we can hardly imagine now. Even if we could, would we want to go back to the world we have lost?

 We cannot help being interested in the ecological effects of the rampant increase in human beings. The moral status of this growth is paradoxical. Our plundering of energy-rich fossils laid down by previous life-forms made possible the technological innovations of the Industrial Revolution. Whatever aspersions one may cast on the "naturalness" of such plundering, it has become a lifeline, continuing to fuel the agricultural-industrial complex that supports most of this planet's increasingly urban population. Governments desire growth -- slow growth -- as a provider of jobs, a way to stoke the global economy. People concerned with global ecology, however, deride the ideology of growth and point to the trail of natural destruction it has caused. Health and happiness, they insist, can be had only by going back to nature, studying it for the secrets of a sustainable technology and living within a more-than-human richness that was the norm until nature became afflicted by the cancer of humanity. Unfortunately, like many middle-class intellectual polarizations, the debate between ecological conservatives and economic liberals is too much about taking sides and preaching to the converted and too little about listening to other views.
Two recent books, "Kinship to Mastery: Biophilia in Human Evolution and Development," by Stephen R. Kellert, and "Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature," by Janine M. Benyus, add to the debate. The sophisticated, almost pro-growth angle of Benyus shows the great potential profitability of copying some of nature's time-tested, nonpolluting, room-temperature manufacturing and computing technologies. The colors of Benyus, a splendid Stevensville, Mont., science writer with a grasp of several sciences, contain far more shades of green than of chrome. Rhetorically at least, the ultimate attraction of technologies like the three-billion-year-old photosynthesis that scientists are now trying to "biomimic" is that the techniques nature has evolved are more sophisticated and efficient, less disruptive and destructive than the Promethean pyrotechnics that have made humanity the new kid on the evolutionary block. Like someone who has made a fortune trading fast-growing speculative stocks but must now provide for her retirement by switching to safer, lower-yielding bonds, if we don't switch to safer modes of sustenance we will take a major hit, perhaps even extinction, because the logic of ecology suggests that the fossil-fuel economies that have got us this far will soon be bankrupt.
That may be correct. The artful science of living nature makes the old physics of regular celestial motions, once believed to be perfect and divine, look robotically stupid in comparison. Science, whose great early advances came in uncovering the relatively predictable activities of inanimate objects, has lately found success in examining more complex and chaotic structures, the shiniest example of which, of course, is life. The social critic Walter Benjamin pointed out that sometimes the extreme case, not the average, is exemplary. And the theoretical biologist Robert Rosen suggests that biology may be the more generally instructive science, and physics a local application of it.
Modern science, like law, requires a preponderance of evidence to convince us. In "Kinship to Mastery," Kellert, who teaches environmental studies at Yale, uses a method that is the antithesis of that -- he tells anecdotes: a boy brought back from despair at the death of his father by the gift of a dog from his sister; a parrot-toting prisoner who becomes an expert on psittacines; a yuppie couple whose marriage is saved by a trip to an island off Nova Scotia, and whose son grows up in a new New York that emerges "at the forefront of a new environmental covenant" and has, for example, a " 'biopark' established along an abandoned industrial shoreline in the South Bronx" to excellent effect. Unlike the often seen, numbingly impersonal statistics on the biological decrepitude of our planet, these anecdotal fictions strike home personally. Kellert's vignettes wake us up to smell the flowers -- the ones that are left.
Benyus shows once and for all the utter technological superiority of would-be "lower" life-forms: the underwater superglue made by mussels; a spider's dragline silk that, ounce for ounce, is five times as strong as steel and five times as impact-resistant as bulletproof Kevlar; and bears and chimpanzees that collect medicinal herbs. Imagine an undiscovered planet in our solar system consisting of intensely advanced life-forms that had perfected waste management, parallel shape-based molecular computing and the processing of nanotechnological materials billions of years ago. That planet is our own. Benyus has had the wit to recognize nature's own genius and make scientists' attempts to copy it the theme of a popular book.
Amusingly, however, when she talks about the "living, breathing examples of sustainability" held up by proponents of biomimicry as natural models that we humans should now emulate, she uses a technological metaphor: at this crucial juncture in our evolution as a species, natural technology is "lighting the runway home." This can be read as an unconscious nod to the petroleum-based colossus involved at many levels in the printing and distribution of books, and to the fact that any truly powerful program devised to subvert the present "unsustainable" ecological impact of humans is likely to employ the very technology (like petroleum-fed global transportation) it criticizes.
These two valuable and stimulating books bring us to a brutal question. How will we get back to nature? Benyus evokes a simple ecological "canon" she says can be used as a template for our technology. A natural system should run on sunlight. It should use only the energy it needs. It should fit form to function. It should recycle everything. It should bank on diversity (but after fire, nuclear explosion and other crises, certain organisms grow wildly, priming the area for followers). It should curb excess from within (all right, but excess creates the luxury that leads to innovation, and new problems). And it should be beautiful (why not?).
This is a noble list. What needs to be clarified, however, is the larger evolutionary perspective. The ecological "canon" of emulatable processes displayed by nature cannot be conflated with nature per se. We are about to embark on an often-traveled ecological adjustment made by many organisms that, finding a formerly unused resource, grow wildly and then are forced to deal with the spoils, in every sense, of their victory. The energy from the sun that runs through all life is a Pandoran excess that cannot be closed up and kept tidy. The global environment, like Rome in its senescence, will always be open to organisms evolving new ways to plunder it. Like other pioneer species, but on a larger, global scale, we must now temper our populousness and promote a greater biodiversity of which we are only a smaller part, not because of any intrinsic evil but because of the dangers, mostly to ourselves, caused by our own fabulously innovative growth.
Billions of years ago, when cyanobacteria tapped into water as a source of hydrogen, the free oxygen they produced as waste was no evolutionary breath of fresh air. Rather, the reactive gas burned the tissues of all organisms that had not evolved to tolerate or use it, especially the creators, who found themselves in the midst of the gas. Our puritanical environmentalism needs a Swift to kick it. Nietzsche, who disparaged the use of mechanical rather than natural metaphors, observed over a century ago that "power makes stupid." Our ability to tap into Earth's resources to power our own growth has brought us to something even more annoying than the brink of collapse of population or standards of living; it has brought us face to face with our own stupidity. Books like these are valuable reminders that in the long run moderation pays.

HEADLINE: The Stealth Chancellor

BYLINE: By Sara Mosle; Sara Mosle, an editor of the New York Times Book Review, writes frequently about education.

 BODY:
On a Tuesday afternoon in April, in a dingy conference room on the 10th floor of the office building of New York's central Board of Education, Rudy Crew, the city's schools chancellor, sat at a dark wood table with two dozen parents and community activists to discuss, among other things, the trouble with Terence. The child, a student at P.S. 329 in Coney Island, was supposed to be in the third grade, but the school had pulled him from his class midyear and, without his family's consent, put him in a "nongrade" section, where he would be exempt from the citywide reading tests in May. Terence's aunt, who felt that the class was little more than a dumping ground, was extremely upset. The assembled adults, all poor blacks and Latinos who lived within the otherwise white, middle-class district, had reason for cynicism: for decades, their children's schools, which served the neighborhood's towering housing projects, had been among the worst in the district.
The New York City schools enroll more than one million students -- by far the most of any system in the country -- and Crew is ultimately responsible for their overall performance. But most parents are concerned only with how their children are doing in their neighborhood schools. One of Crew's biggest challenges as chancellor has been negotiating between the aggregate and the anecdotal -- or in more human terms, between the system's needs and Terence's. 
 The boy's troubles were intimately tied to Crew's broader school reforms -- chiefly, his highly publicized campaign to have all students reading at grade level by the end of the third grade (a feat currently accomplished by less than half of the city's third graders). In the past, such a call would have been only that: a plea that district superintendents would have been free to ignore. But because of historic legislation that Crew quietly helped to push through the State Assembly four months earlier, the city's 32 community school districts now have to jump when Crew gives an order.
The evening of the meeting, Crew learned that the law had received the blessing of the justice department in a much-anticipated ruling. When the news officially broke, he was racing over the Brooklyn Bridge in his chauffeured black Chevrolet. He asked his driver to turn up the radio, stuck his head out the window and repeatedly shouted, "Victory to the children."
Listening to the parents' concerns, Crew was sympathetic, but he also bluntly informed them that many of their children were probably lagging significantly behind their more privileged classmates. And he challenged them to consider how a school -- and a system -- should respond to such children.
"Let me separate out a few things here," Crew said. While he acknowledged that removing Terence from his classroom "without any dialogue with the home" was "highly irregular" and "unforgivably wrong," he added: "There are some kids whom we should not be moving on, whom we ought to be helping by causing them and their parents to work at home, by having after-school programs, by having Saturday academies and mandatory summer school, by having literacy-school volunteers, by having an extended day and an extended year, so that they can catch up with some of their counterparts. I'm not going to lower the standard, but I am going to try to provide the means for your children to reach it."
In other words, as Anthony Alvarado, a former chancellor and one of the city's district superintendents, says, Crew is trying "to move public education from an aptitude-based system to an effort-based one." By the end of the session, the parents were applauding loudly.
Crew has been something of a stealth Chancellor. When he arrived in New York in November 1995 from Tacoma, Wash., where he was a popular superintendent, few expected that he would have much impact on a system that has nearly twice as many teachers -- some 65,000 -- as Tacoma has students.
At 46, he has a face and physique as broad as Muhammad Ali's and a fighting style not unlike the boxing champion's: Crew has floated like a butterfly and stung like a bee. In his first year and a half on the job, he studied the system and searched for weaknesses. Then last fall he delivered a series of reforms like so many punches. First, he took over several chronically failing schools and placed them in what he called "the chancellor's district," where he sent teams of educators to work with existing staffs to help turn around their educational programs. Next, he implemented his major literacy campaign. After that, he released budget report cards on every school in the city, which gave parents a wealth of information, for the first time, about their children's schools: how much money they had and how it was spent in addition to the usual information, like average test scores and attendance. Then Crew provided a detailed budget for the Board of Education and, in the process, proved that central headquarters was no longer the money sinkhole that many critics had claimed. Previous chancellors could not even tell how many people were on the payroll.
After that, Crew unveiled a plan to overhaul the city's byzantine special-education program and announced that he was finding funds to restore arts education to all schools. In December, he announced that New York would be the first urban system in the country to adopt citywide the New National Standards, a core curriculum designed by a nonpartisan, nonprofit group in Washington. Then, in the knockout punch, the state legislature passed the governance law, which reversed some 30 years of educational practice in the city by making district superintendents directly accountable to the Chancellor. The schools hadn't even let out for Christmas.
Suddenly, Crew was the city's most politically successful chancellor in a quarter-century and the country's most important urban educator. Guy Molinari, the Staten Island Borough President, says he would back Crew for Mayor in 2001. (Crew denies having such ambitions.) Depending on the poll, anywhere from 53 to 62 percent of New Yorkers approve of the job he is doing -- extraordinary numbers for the head of a school system that a majority of people regard as failing. Because of this popularity, Crew has emerged as a pivotal player in this year's mayoral election. When Ruth Messinger, the leading Democratic candidate, tried to distance herself from Crew in an obvious attempt to criticize Mayor Giuliani's education record, she found herself under attack. (She did not return repeated phone calls requesting an interview for this article.) Giuliani, who is not exactly renowned for his eagerness to share the political limelight, immediately brought out a radio advertisement in which he tells a mother who thanks him for "fighting back to save our schools" that she should thank "another Rudy, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew." Instead of just tinkering around the edges, Crew has left the impression that he is taking on the entire system.
Creating one or even a dozen good schools has never been difficult. "Most urban systems," Crew says, "have demonstrated the capacity to reform single schools in individual communities." As a nation, we are not exactly smarting for educational models: we have "alternative" public schools and charter schools and "choice" schools and for-profit schools and home schools that have all succeeded in every kind of community, using every kind of approach. Taken together, they support any one of a number of contradictory conclusions about school reform.
But in any particular system, these models have never been able to achieve a critical mass. For instance, the charter-school movement, although almost a decade old, has created only 700 public schools out of 85,000 nationwide. Since 1992, the Edison Project, a for-profit outfit, has reportedly raised $100 million to set up just 25 schools and has yet to turn a profit. In Milwaukee, where a voucher system has become the latest reform du jour, the pilot program accommodates only 1.5 percent of the student population. "Those who would welcome the abolition of the current system," Crew says, "have never demonstrated an ability to bring in its place a system that works on the massive scale that the public schools do now."
The challenge for urban educators isn't building more pilot programs, but finding a way to replicate -- or in education parlance, to "scale up" -- select reforms to create an entire system that works. "The real issue," Crew says, "is not some points-of-light theory in which I create five schools and go out and show them to everybody and say, 'Look at what I'm doing here in New York City!' The real question for urban America is, Can you replicate it, can you do it in a cost-effective way and can you create the organizational culture that gives rise to it on a scale that impacts the lives of every child in the system?"
It is worth pointing out that no one in the history of American education has ever succeeded in fashioning a big-city school system that works for all children. The belief that there was once a golden age in public education is as prevalent as it is false. As Ramon Cortines, Crew's predecessor as Chancellor, puts it: "Schools didn't even track dropout rates until the early 1960's. We are attempting to care about students that we have never cared about before."
While a vast majority of parents are perfectly content with their children's schools, the dismal performance of a handful of urban districts has undermined the nation's faith in the system as a whole. Consequently, whether Crew can succeed at scaling up his reforms may well determine the fate of public education in the next century.
"We don't have a lot of time," Crew says, "which is why I feel this incredible urgency. I think we have 10 years, tops, to turn the system around before the public gets fed up and begins to replace it with something else." Richard Elmore, a professor of education at Harvard, is even more dire. In places like Chicago and Boston and Los Angeles and D.C., he says, "the system could well migrate out from under us within the next five years." In short, the country's message to educators like Crew is a little like Rhoda's to New York in her television sitcom: "Public education, this is your last chance."
Politically treacherous and almost incomprehensibly huge, the New York City public school system has defeated half a dozen chancellors in just the last decade. Outside Crew's office at the Board of Education, a 12-story, Depression-era building in downtown Brooklyn, there is a harrowingly long hallway lined with black-and-white photographs of Crew's predecessors: Cortines, who was ousted by Giuliani; Joseph Fernandez, who was fired by his own board; Richard Green, who died after only 14 months on the job; Nathan Quinones, who was forced to retire early, and so on, back to the turn of the century. Once, when I was riding around with Crew, his wife, Kathleen, who is a student readmission officer at John Jay College, called to ask how his day was going. Crew replied dryly, "They haven't fired me yet."
Nationally, the average tenure of the head of a big-city school system is three years. "Imagine if you were a major corporation and had that kind of turnover," says William Thompson, the president of the seven-member board that is officially Crew's boss. As Richard Mills, the State Commissioner of Education puts it, "We can't afford to have Rudy Crew end up on that wall!"
Before Crew was hired, the city had been buffeted by a series of fiscal crises that forced cuts of more than $1 billion from the Board of Education's projected spendings. Several of the city's worst-performing districts had been plagued for years by political patronage and corruption: auctioning off principalships, voter fraud, drug dealing, embezzlement. Only 5 percent of eligible voters typically bothered to turn out for school-board elections.
A protracted and acrimonious debate over condom distribution and multicultural curriculums had distracted the city from the far more pressing issues facing most teachers and students in their classrooms. Giuliani seemed to take an almost visceral dislike to Cortines, and soon the two were embroiled in an ugly battle over who should control the system. "Most people thought that the Mayor was being very unfair to Ray," says Sandra Feldman, the president of the American Federation of Teachers. "Yet simply having that kind of conflict -- the constant sniping, board members at each other's throats -- was itself a big problem."
Crew's obvious and unexpected ease with the Mayor has been both a blessing and a burden -- which was evident on the morning of April 1. As Crew was shaving in his Brooklyn Heights brownstone, he received an urgent call from Burt Sacks, the executive for community school district affairs at the board. "He was whispering on the phone!" Crew later recalled. "He was saying: 'The Mayor's advance people are here! The Mayor's not supposed to be here! You better get down here -- quick!' "
As an April Fools' joke, Crew and Giuliani had decided to swap places at their morning cabinet meetings. A few hours later, Crew was sitting in the Mayor's office, his feet propped up on Giuliani's desk, and was giggling like a mischievous choirboy as he twirled a fat cigar he had swiped from the Mayor's private stockpile.
Back at the board, the "other Rudy," as educators in the city like to call the Mayor, was scaring the wits out of half of Crew's staff. Giuliani later described the scene: "I told everyone not to worry, that the police were not surrounding the building. I think they were a little relieved when I said that." When Crew returned to the board, the Mayor was still there, and as he re-enacted the moment of dropped jaws and shocked faces, the two men fell on each other in fits of laughter.
Not everyone was amused. A couple of board members complained that the Chancellor was appearing too cozy with Giuliani in an election year. The friendship between the Rudys has helped to inoculate the Mayor against charges that he has neglected the city's schools and has even led some educators to doubt Crew's abilities and motives.
Crew denies that he's carrying political water for the Mayor. "Giuliani and I disagree on a lot of issues," he says. Crew has strenuously opposed, for instance, the Mayor's efforts to turn school security over to the police. (The board employs its own division of unarmed guards.) And he has refused to cooperate with the Mayor's pet plan to send 1,000 of the city's students to parochial schools. (Giuliani has had to raise private funds for his program.)
But Crew defends his relationship with City Hall. "I believe the Mayor's interest in this system is real," he says, "and that his support of me is real." Giuliani controls the budget, and it's important, Crew says, that he spend time at the board to see how it operates. As Alvarado puts it: "Rudy Crew has been extraordinarily successful politically. He has managed to win some trust and respect for the system as something that is worth investing in." About the April Fools' joke, Giuliani later confessed, "I had never been to a staff meeting at the board, and after the joking and kidding around, I listened to what Crew's team was doing and trying to achieve, and I have to tell you, I was impressed."
Asked how he would respond to the prank's critics, Crew replies wearily, "I would tell them, 'It was a joke.' "
Crew's typical day begins, or ends, depending on how you look at it, around 3 in the morning. Crew is a chronic insomniac, and although he tries to go to sleep as soon as he gets home each night around 9 or 10, he has a hard time staying asleep and is frequently up again, prowling about in the wee hours or calling family members out West. (Crew has four children from an earlier marriage and is still close with them and their mother.) He is usually back at the board at 7 A.M., where his first official act is, sensibly, making coffee.
Like many former Northwesterners, Crew is a coffee snob. He brings in his own ground beans and makes a large pot for the office. He then puts on some music: Coltrane or Rollins or Wynton Marsalis. Crew's father was a clarinet player who once toured briefly with Duke Ellington. Crew grew up in Poughkeepsie and as a child often accompanied his father to jazz clubs in Harlem. For years, his father, who died in 1980, also worked as a night security guard at I.B.M. and his photo ID card and badge hang over Crew's desk.
Crew's mother died when he was 2. To help make ends meet, his father rented out the top two floors of the family row house. Crew attended a Catholic elementary school and public junior high and high school. "My father was a stern taskmaster," Crew recalls. Like his father, Crew is diabetic, and everything he did as a child -- from what he ate to how he performed in sports -- was done with a certain precision. "My father had high expectations for me, you might even say cruel expectations. But he cared deeply about how I did in school, how I did in sports, and I basked in that attention."
With his father on the road, Crew was frequently left in the care of family or friends. "I got to meet a lot of people who were in transition," he says. "They were people whose lives had, in one form or another, been severely hurt by a lack of education, by their being fundamentally illiterate."
One of the women who looked after Crew was a housecleaner named Gloria Connelly. "I used to go to these places with her," Crew recalls, "and I learned to iron, to clean." Connelly, who had attended segregated schools in the South, never learned to read or write. Young Rudy bought her a large-lettered primer and in time taught her to read. "In college, I remember getting the first letter she ever wrote," he says.
Crew was the first male in his family to go to college and was among the first blacks who integrated Babson, a small business college just outside Boston, in the 1960's. He became president of the black students' union, wrote poetry and even had some of it published in the radical journal Ramparts. To make money, he cleaned houses, using the skills Connelly had taught him. He was looking forward to the end of such jobs but says, "I didn't know what to do with that piece of myself that just wanted to help people."
It was at Babson that Crew, who had always doubted his intellect, realized he could boost both his academic achievement and his capacity to learn through sheer effort. For a child who had grown up poor, the understanding was a revelation, one that has clearly shaped his thinking as an educator.
Crew had planned to become a buyer at a men's clothing store but changed his mind after working summers coaching inner-city children at a small school in the country. He got a master's in urban education, and later a doctorate in school administration, both from the University of Massachusetts, where he became friends with another education major, Bill Cosby. (The two remain close.) And slowly Crew began to see how he could use his earlier training in his new profession. "My background in economics and management," he says, "gave me a very different metaphor for understanding public education."
The business mind-set hasn't always served education well. In the first half of this century, schools were designed on the "factory model," in which thousands of students traveled through enormous, anonymous high schools like products on an assembly line. In keeping with the times, Crew's model is more service oriented; he wants education to be consumer driven, responsive to the needs of individual parents and students, but on a broad scale, which requires a large and talented work force and some means of quality control or accountability. And he tends to approach problems with a bottom-line kind of pragmatism. "Rudy really does believe that the way you do a job is just to do it," says Harry Spence, Deputy Chancellor for Operations. "He just refuses to get distracted by all the politics and partisan bickering."
One of Crew's first jobs was teaching high-school social studies at a school in Pasadena, Calif., in the mid-1970's. Ramon Cortines was his superintendent, and Crew still expresses fondness for his former mentor. "His office was right over my classroom," Crew recalls. "We got along famously. Ray is a great educator." (Except to offer general praise, Cortines declines to talk about his successor as Chancellor.) When Crew arrived in New York, he learned that Cortines was still in the city. "I tried to have a conversation with Ray," he says, "but I never got to see him." Instead, Cortines left his old protege a cool note. "It said something like, 'I think you will find the children of New York City to be extremely deserving,' " Crew recalls. "I choose to believe that the situation was simply too painful for Ray. I felt bad for him."
Working in schools in predominantly disadvantaged areas, Crew was quickly promoted from the classroom to the principal's office. In time he became an assistant to the superintendent of the Inglewood schools, near South-Central Los Angeles. "It was a rude awakening about the central office," Crew says. "There was no connection to kids. There was no connection to anything. I felt like an empty suit." After a few more years in the California school system, he returned to Boston.
The year was 1987, and the city was still reeling from its bruising battle over busing and desegregation. Crew was the deputy superintendent for instruction, and although he would go on to be the superintendent of the Sacramento and Tacoma school systems, the job was in many ways a dress rehearsal for being Chancellor in New York. "Boston is a small city that passes for a larger one," Crew explains. "It has major-league politics, a major media outlet and all the major educational issues. It's where I grew my political instincts."
Bill Thompson remembers first hearing about Crew from people who had known him in Boston. "He was regarded as the hottest African-American superintendent in the country," he says. Yet as Thompson, who is black, points out: "It's amazing, but he has never become 'the African-American Chancellor.' He's transcended that kind of tag." With his impassive face, Crew often comes across as stiff and bureaucratic, particularly on television, but in private or before small groups, he is gregarious and warm. "Rudy is just a big kid," says Chiara Coletti, his executive director of public affairs. Walking into the Board of Education, he is not beneath trying to catch Thompson in the revolving doors. He is constantly clowning around with his driver, Mike Taylor, and his main security guard, Mark Rampersand, who are frequent guests at his Sunday barbecues. "Sometimes," Rampersand says, "when he's getting home late at night, we'll park his car a block or two from his house and talk for an hour or so about his life outside of his job. He's a real person."
Crew has an uncanny ability to cater his speech -- "How are you doing?" quickly becoming "Howya doin'?" -- depending on his audience. I have watched him impress a small group of white businessmen at a fancy luncheon at Lutece and empathize with poor black parents from a school in Brooklyn.
"In most of America, there is a marginalization that comes with being black," says Harry Spence, a patrician-looking Bostonian. "But I think Rudy has turned race to his advantage, not in a cynical sense, but in the way he is able to relate to so many different people, across so many divides." Crew ties this ability to his goals as an educator. "It is my greatest hope for children that they learn the ability to adapt, the art of being comfortable in their own skins, regardless of their circumstances or environment. It's important to know the streets, but it's just as important to know corporate board rooms, and the language of those two places is very different."
When Crew got the call to come to New York from Tacoma, he was reluctant to move. He had just bought a house and had recently married Kathleen. He had a boat for fishing, a horse named Dundee and 22 rosebushes in his garden. Judith Rizzo, who worked with Crew in both Tacoma and Boston and who is now New York's Deputy Chancellor for Instruction, was with Crew as he agonized over the decision. "He knew that if he really believed what he'd always said about how public education could work for all students," Rizzo says, "then he couldn't decline the opportunity to prove it on the country's biggest educational stage."
one of Crew's strengths as chancellor has been his willingness to acknowledge the problems in public education. Unlike so many career educators, he is not defensive about the system. "We have not always figured out how to meet our own expectations," he says, "partly because those expectations have been fluid. There was a moving target that did not allow constancy of dialogue with a public that kept saying: 'Give me better schools. Give me safer schools.' "
As Crew readily admits, the threat of vouchers has inarguably provided the stimulus for change. "These reports about school performance are not new," he says. "What is new is that the system is finally having to recognize that the consequence of not meeting those expectations is extinction."
The problem with model programs like vouchers isn't that they don't work (they usually do) but that their successes almost always depend on factors that cannot be endlessly reproduced: limited numbers of particularly talented and dedicated educators who are drawn to new and innovative programs; savvy parents who search out such schools for their children; the students themselves, who, in turn, are better motivated because they have attentive parents; additional funds or services, usually in the form of grants, that some educators are able to win from the finite number of philanthropically inclined businesses or foundations; even the media scrutiny that such models typically come under, which acts as a check on incompetence or abuses.
As Crew will tell you, the biggest challenge facing most urban superintendents is simply attracting, and retaining, sufficient talent. Under the new school-governance law, for instance, Crew can hire and fire district superintendents. In a happy coincidence this spring, contracts for 27 of the city's 32 superintendents came up for renewal, just as the Justice Department was confirming the Chancellor's new powers. Crew was presented with a unique opportunity to shape leadership in the school system for years. But, as Crew despaired in April, "that's actually an extraordinarily high number of people to have to hire at one time. There simply isn't that kind of talent out there."
All professions, including education, must compete for quality recruits, and the most difficult urban districts, including New York's, have long suffered from chronic teacher shortages. While some people will always be idealistic enough to work long hours for little pay in overcrowded and dilapidated conditions, there is little to suggest that a voucher program alone would inspire some 65,000 such candidates to emerge, suddenly, from the woodwork in New York. Although voucher proponents like to talk about "market forces," they seem to forget that teachers are also subject to them.
The failure of the old system of school governance was largely due to the problems posed by scale. The system that Crew inherited and that chancellors have been trying to regain control of for years dates back to the 1960's. At the time, "community control" was a rallying cry of the left. In 1969, after a bitter battle between an experimental community school board and the teachers' union, the State Legislature decentralized the system into the current semiautonomous school districts, which have been run by locally elected boards. The aim, which is similar to that of vouchers, was to give parents more control over the curriculums and budgets in their children's schools. But as is often the case in school reform, decentralization played out with unintended consequences.
In some districts -- in typically wealthier, more stable communities -- decentralization worked well. But in poorer districts, where students could least afford bad schools, the new system resulted, more often than not, in mismanagement and corruption. The reason was simple: in many of the city's most impoverished communities, schools are often the only decent employer. Consequently, locally elected boards are often under tremendous pressure to dole out jobs to family members or political cronies who can then be counted on, for reasons having little to do with education, to return their benefactors to office. Far from reducing the inequities among richer and poorer districts, decentralization tended to exacerbate them.
In a few places, like district Four in East Harlem, decentralization worked as it was supposed to: freed from board restrictions, accomplished educators like Deborah Meier set up innovative schools. But abilities like hers did not exist on a scale sufficient to transform the entire system. As the perennially low turnout at school-board elections revealed, decentralization did not inspire poor families to take control of their children's schools; political machines and profiteers filled the void.
Under the old system, even criminal board members were seldom voted out of office. A chancellor's attempt to dismiss them was usually overturned by the courts. Some superintendents had what amounted to lifetime tenure; they oversaw the same dismally performing districts for decades. Several boards were marked for years by dysfunction, and meetings in some districts ended in brawls. At the central board's monthly public hearings, parents were known to turn up in costumes and become belligerent.
Chiara Coletti likes to tell a story from the first few months of Crew's tenure as Chancellor. Her office is adjacent to the conference room where Crew sometimes meets with wayward boards. One evening, a shouting match erupted from behind the closed door. Aghast at the board's childish behavior, a booming voice suddenly rose above the others. "Will you people look at yourselves?" The voice was Crew's.
Democracy, of course, is never tidy, but a sane system would offer some check on the looniness, which is what the new law does, by giving the Chancellor veto power over the appointment of superintendents and, by extension, over the hiring of principals. In some ways, Crew is hoping to make schools more autonomous. He is implementing school-based budgeting, in which principals and teachers have far greater discretion in using school funds. But in return for such freedom, Crew has insisted on holding schools strictly accountable for how students perform on standardized tests.
Unlike previous chancellors, Crew has not got hung up on advocating particular ways of teaching. So long as schools can prove that their students are learning, he doesn't care if their approach is back-to-basics or touchy-feely. Crew has set clear guidelines, in a kind of franchise approach, about what he expects children to know and when he expects them to know it. Beyond that, he believes that the board's role is solely to assist schools in achieving their performance goals and to intervene swiftly and decisively if they fail, instead of letting failure persist for years. He has not been shy about using his powers.
Less than a week after the Justice Department ruled in favor of the governance package, Crew flexed his muscles in District 28 in Queens. The district, whose reading scores are low, stretches from the white enclaves of Forest Hills to the immigrant communities of Jamaica. Both the board and the district had been divided for years along racial lines. The previous summer, the district's superintendent announced plans to retire, and at first the board went along with the new rules for selecting a superintendent. But in February, the district consulted with several lawyers and, apparently believing that the governance bill would soon be overturned, the board, alone among the city's districts, refused to abide by the new law and returned to the old procedures, which gave it far more sway over the final selection. Throughout the spring, the board and Crew's office exchanged faxes over the district's noncompliance as Crew made his displeasure known.
On the morning of April 2, the day after Crew learned that the Justice Department had ruled in his favor, he asked Burt Sacks to send a fax to Lynn Gross, the board's president, in which he ordered the board to cease operating under the old selection rules. Sacks also called Gross at home and told her about the ruling and alerted her that the fax was coming. For two days, District 28 continued to interview potential superintendents in violation of the new law. Again, Sacks faxed the board a warning that its actions were placing it in jeopardy. Finally, on the Friday of that week, Crew requested a meeting with the board for the following Monday night.
I attended the session. Gross had neglected to inform the minority members of her board about the meeting until earlier that day. Frustrated that she had tried to circumvent them, they sat at one end of
the conference-room table, while Gross, her lawyer and two other white board members sat at the other. For an hour or so, Gross appeared to dissemble. She was asleep when Sacks called. She was too sleepy to understand what he was saying. She didn't get the first fax. She didn't get the second fax. (She later produced affidavits from her board's secretaries saying that the fax machine had been jammed.) She didn't understand what the faxes meant. She hadn't had time to consult her lawyer. She wasn't required to call board members over the weekend. It takes a long time to call nine people. And so on.
Crew was unimpressed. "You know," he said, "you've got a lot of work to do. You've got test scores that are horrible. You've got a gulf that divides who's learning and who's not in your district that's as wide as this table. You've got principals to hire. You've got textbook allocations with a May 14 deadline. And I will not allow this work to suffer because of what I consider to be a lot of game-playing. This is about children's lives. You can help them or you can play this game -- 'I got the fax; I don't think I did.' It's time for one person to make a call."
In the past, such a meeting would have simply led to more meetings. A chancellor had no real authority
to discipline a recalcitrant board, no matter how poorly it or its schools were performing. But Crew had the power to dismiss the entire board. Instead, he chose to make a surgical strike. The next day he called another meeting with Gross and told her: "I am firing you, effective today. I believe that you are impeding the work of this board and that by your actions as president you have put your board and the children in your district in jeopardy. You can fight me on this, but I can tell you right now, I'm going to win. My advice to you is that you should simply walk away with the dignity that usually comes to people after such situations are over and after your long years of service. You've been on this board for 17 years, but your work here is done."
In the months that followed, Crew would wield his new authority in other districts suffering from long-term mismanagement, like District Five in Harlem and District Eight in the South Bronx. In June, he told District 26 that he was rejecting the board's nominee for superintendent, Claire McIntee, a principal in the district. The move baffled the board's members and many educators in New York: after all, the board, which oversees one of the city's best districts, had been successfully selecting superintendents for 30 years. Crew later said that he felt McIntee lacked administrative experience; she was going from running a school with 300 students to a district with 15,000. One parent observed at the time that Crew had gone from a system in Tacoma with about 32,000 students to a system with 1 million.
"I think Rudy made a mistake," says one board official, who insisted on anonymity. Crew worked out a compromise whereby McIntee would serve under a one-, rather than three-, year contract, which he could then choose to renew after he'd had a chance to judge her performance. "There are some cases where I've really dug in my heels," Crew says. "But this was a case where the board asked for, and I gave consideration to, additional information. This is not some Attila-the-Hun world we live in. There has to be some give and take."
Although much was made of Crew's bowing to political pressure, he actually came under far more pressure to rehire Gross, according to Bill Thompson and the Queens board representative, Carol Gresser. After Crew dismissed her, Gross appealed the decision before the entire board and lost in a 3-to-4 vote. "We determined that the Chancellor had not acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner," Thompson says. Gross is now taking her case to court. Ann Hill, Gross's successor as president, believes that Crew was motivated by racial reasons. Gross, for her part, says: "If you take a person with an unblemished record, it seems so totally unreasonable to me that I be removed. It's like getting a life sentence for a parking ticket." But Crew was tired of excuses from the president of a board that had administrated failure for years. He wanted, he says, some accountability.
Although governance has given Crew the leverage he needs to shape the leadership in the city's schools, he still must address what goes on in most classrooms. Driving his agenda has been an almost relentless focus on boosting early childhood literacy and establishing a common curriculum in the city's schools. No one, of course, would argue against having standards, but what they should be, and how they should be measured, has prompted vociferous debate. Crew finds such arguments a dodge. "People have spent way too much time," he says, "talking about the test: 'Here's the test. Is it a good test? Is it not a good test? We ought to have a different kind of test or no test at all.' In the last decade and a half, we have been there and done that."
The really serious work, says Helaine Doran, a director at Acorn, a community-based organization in Brooklyn that has been critical of Crew's efforts, is "providing equal course work for all kids." In one study, the organization found that in several of the city's poorest neighborhoods as few as 30 eighth graders were taking Sequential I Math or Earth Science -- prerequisites for upper-level work.
Crew doesn't defend such shoddy offerings or insist that poorer children can't pass the tests that wealthier students can. Rather, he has worked to provide disadvantaged students with additional opportunities to catch up with their more privileged classmates. He has, for instance, established the Math and Science Institute, a successful after-school and Saturday program to help poor black and Latino students gain admittance to the city's elite high schools, where they are currently underrepresented. His point hasn't been simply to boost scores but to help students master the material that has never been offered in their neighborhood schools.
This spring, Crew requested an additional $2.2 million from the Mayor to expand the program. But as Doran complains: "It's a drop in the bucket. You've got something like 10,000 eighth graders, and this money will serve 200 students in Manhattan. Our members feel like this is a middle-class agenda and that it's not serving our kids."
Money, although hardly forthcoming, isn't the only obstacle. More challenging courses require better teachers and equipment. It's a little unrealistic to expect students to do well in chemistry or biology if their teacher hasn't mastered the subject or their schools don't have labs; yet many of the city's high schools lack such basic resources.
By setting high standards, Crew is also creating a perhaps unrealistic expectation that he can reach them overnight. Last fall, he predicted that his emphasis on reading would boost scores among third graders by 5 or even 8 percentage points on citywide tests. This spring, when those scores went up, but not that impressively, Crew came under attack.
Even some board members, like Carol Gresser, expressed disappointment in the results. Crew seemed stunned by the criticism. "We were all pretty depressed," Thompson says. In fact, students' performance in reading was the best in a decade, and, more important, the scores went up in every district in the city, including the Chancellor's, which comprises New York City's 13 lowest-performing schools. What's more, this improvement occurred in a system that, for all its problems, already does well nationally. "People hold up Chicago as some tower of change, and they can't even read in Chicago!" Thompson says. "Something like 22 to 24 percent of students are reading on grade level. In New York, the level is twice that." If nothing else, Crew has managed to halt the downward spiral. If he made a mistake, it was perhaps in overpromising.
Overpromising has always been the strength -- and weakness -- of American education. "The public's expectations are not too high," Crew insists, but here is where he may be wrong. If America is ever to succeed at educating all of its children well -- a goal akin to ending poverty -- it will have to relinquish its belief in a silver bullet that will magically, and inexpensively, halt the nation's educational "crisis," a crisis that has existed since the time of Horace Mann.
What Crew needs now he will almost certainly never have: time and money enough for his reforms. With the city battling chronic budget shortfalls and taxpayers in no mood to invest in a new public works program for education, Crew can do only so much. As his third anniversary as Chancellor nears this fall, he has to wonder how much longer he can survive. He has already outlasted most of his recent predecessors.
Even some of his reforms suffer from the problems besetting the system at large. To develop his own talent, for example, Crew has created a Superintendents' and Principals' Institute. At a session in the spring, the scene was an almost comic replica of many classrooms. Sitting up straight in the front row, listening attentively and raising their hands like the ears of little bunnies, were Alvarado, Lester Young and Jim Mazza, who have been among the city's most successful superintendents. At the back, slouching in their chairs, whispering to one another and occasionally rolling their eyes, were several superintendents from the city's worst-performing districts.
Scaling up reform is hard work, requiring simultaneous battles on many fronts, and will require decades, not years, to succeed. At best, Crew can hope for incremental improvement in the system. This may not satisfy the demands of an impatient public, but it is a radical goal. If Crew can replicate the growth he achieved this spring for the next decade, he will increase the percentage of third graders reading at grade level by some 50 percent. It would be the most spectacular rise of student achievement in American public education in a century.
"Whenever I hear people talking about how we should dismantle the public school system," Crew says, "it always makes me think of how we have lived in a nation with a democracy that for the most part has been imperfect. And yet we don't talk about dismantling democracy. We talk about using the constitutional mechanisms to create a more perfect union. And that's what I'm seeking -- to create a more perfect school system."
In April, Crew toured several of the city's schools as part of Principal for a Day, an annual city event in which civic leaders go into schools to learn more about the system firsthand. Although in most places the program is an unobtrusive and popular success, at the schools Crew visited he invariably encountered a media herd and celebrity handlers, which were accompanying the more famous of the principals on their rounds: Tipper Gore, Johnnie Cochran and Crew's friend Bill Cosby.
Secret Service agents, talking into their sleeves, rebuffed the legitimate aides-de-camp of lesser officials. Competing advance teams chest-butted in the hallways. Cameramen staked out strategic ground with their portable klieg lights. Photographers pointed long lenses at any hapless child who happened to wander into their line of fire. Journalists squabbled with P.R. people over who had access to which politicians. Giuliani abruptly canceled an appearance at one school after learning that Ruth Messinger was there. In his place, he sent Ninfa Segarra, one of two mayoral appointees to the Board of Education, but security guards, deeming her insufficiently important, turned her away at the door. She left in a huff.
"What a zoo," I muttered to myself as I followed Crew out of one school. He turned on me with visible vehemence and said: "Wasn't it, though? I feel like taking a shower."
One of the places we visited was P.S. 47, a school for special-education students on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Recently renovated, the school sparkled. Walls were freshly painted. Students worked quietly in their classrooms. The adults instinctively began to whisper. We were joined by the principal for that day, the real principal, several other administrators, a couple of teachers and Crew's bodyguard and driver.
But as we approached a woodshop class, we detected a commotion. Inside, a teen-age girl with black hair, pale skin and black glasses was wailing, "I don't care if we have visitors!" as her embarrassed and panicked instructor tried, under his breath, to get her to please be quiet. Who could blame her? At her door stood a gaggle of adults whom she had never seen before, who were upsetting her usual schedule and keeping her from her prized turn at the wood saw. Made uncomfortable by her cries, they were pretending that she didn't exist, which of course made her wail only that much louder.
All of the adults, that is, except for Crew, who immediately strode over to the girl and began talking to her about her project. It was a small moment, but it was an impressive one all the same. I know plenty of educators who would have declined this opportunity to fail at calming a child in front of an audience that included a reporter. He had no assurance that he could placate the girl -- after all, her own teacher could not -- and he might have easily moved his relieved entourage on to another classroom. Instead, he confidently seized what educators like to call "a teachable moment" and was soon assisting the girl at the saw while the other students gathered round. Having lost their shyness, they insisted that Crew look at their projects, too.
Crew's challenge is now to take such moments and multiply them a millionfold in the city's classrooms every day. As he left the room 20 minutes later, everyone, including the girl, was smiling broadly.

 CORRECTION:
The cover article of The Times Magazine today explores Chancellor Rudy Crew's attempt to transform New York City's school system into a model for the nation. The article notes that Ruth W. Messinger, a can didate for the Democratic nomina tion for mayor, has distanced herself from Dr. Crew. But it does not report that she and the Chancellor ex changed accusations last week about injecting politics into education; that dispute occurred after the magazine had gone to press.

Political Violence Taking A Toll on Kenya Tourism

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya

 BODY:
MORE and more tourists have canceled trips to Kenya's white-sand beaches and wild-game parks this month as accounts of armed gangs wreaking havoc and murdering police officers on the Indian Ocean Coast have hit the news.
The violence, around the port city of Mombasa, has claimed at least 42 lives since Aug. 13. It is the latest in a series of blows to Kenya's tourism industry. 
 Since May, the images coming out of this East African country have been uniformly scary: pro-democracy protesters fighting street battles with the police, baton-wielding soldiers clobbering a defenseless clergyman during a riot, demonstrators hurling stones at cars and looting stores. But until recently, most of the political violence had not touched the game parks and beach resorts that attracted most of the 770,000 tourists who visited the nation last year.
In mid-August, however, Kenya's political crisis took a nastier and more unpredictable turn. Although no tourists were attacked, the State Department is warning Americans to avoid the coast. Britain, Germany, Belgium and Italy have told their citizens to use extreme caution and avoid troubled areas.
The warnings were apparently heeded by many international travelers, who spent $465 million here in 1996, making tourism the biggest industry in Kenya. In mid-August, hundreds of vacationers from Europe canceled trips to Mombasa at the last minute. A charter jet from Italy, for instance, landed in Mombasa with only 98 people when more than 200 had bought tickets.
In general, people planning a once-in-a-lifetime safari or looking forward to a peaceful African beach holiday might want to consider postponing their trips until after Kenya's elections later this year, when the situation will probably cool down, diplomats say. "I'm starting to think this could really spin out of control," said a diplomat, insisting on anonymity.
For those who cannot wait, the major game parks in the north and south of the country are still insulated from the capital and the coast, where most of the violence has taken place. And on the coast, the police and tour operators maintain that they have set up measures to insure protection at the major hotels or resorts.
In Mombasa, for instance, tour companies have a 24-hour communications war room to warn hotel owners and bus operators by radio of trouble spots. Tourists are being moved in convoys between the airport and the resorts.
Still, the heightened security has eroded the relaxing atmosphere most vacationers crave. For several days, hundreds of tourists in the big resort hotels north and south of Mombasa were trapped while the police fought gun battles with armed gangs along the coast highway.
The current wave of violence began on Aug. 13, when more than 100 men armed with guns, machetes and clubs attacked a police station in Likoni, just south of Mombasa, then went on a rampage through a section where many people from inland tribes live. Seven police officers were killed, along with eight others.
Then, well-organized gangs, apparently drawn from the ranks of unemployed men along the coast, razed businesses, homes and kiosks belonging to people from other parts of Kenya, and lynched dozens of people. On Aug. 19, gangs burned down more than 300 kiosks belonging to residents in Malindi, 70 miles north of Mombasa.
The raids have seemed more like ethnic wars than traditional tribal clashes. Leaflets have appeared in Swahili, saying: "The time has come for us original inhabitants of the coast to claim what is rightly ours. We must remove these invaders from our land."
The Government has arrested more than 400 people, including two local political leaders with connections to the ruling party.
But the raids may have been the first volley in a long struggle. President Daniel arap Moi, the 73-year-old patriarch who has been in power since 1978, has blamed opposition politicians and civil rights advocates for stirring up tribal hatreds. Opposition leaders maintain that Mr. Moi's own agents have instigated the violence and that he plans to cynically use it as an excuse to forestall constitutional reforms and postpone elections.
By law, Mr. Moi must call elections before the year ends. But opposition leaders and civil rights advocates have said they will not participate unless a raft of electoral and civil-liberty reforms are enacted.
It is still possible to visit Kenya and avoid trouble spots. Tourists who decide to come should be cautious; traveling with one of the well-established safari operators rather than on one's own is also advisable. But they acknowledge limitations.
"We can't guarantee the tourists and the world 100 percent security," said Rehab Mwendwa, the vice chairwoman of the Mombasa and Coastal Tourist Association. "Only the Government can do that."

HEADLINE: Art Center Built on Community's Teamwork

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER 

 BODY:
IT took a village to raise an arts center.
A local pediatrician stuffed envelopes, a first grade teacher did calligraphy, a computer consultant solicited merchants and a dentist gave tours after hours. Older residents volunteered, and a construction engineer who loved music did anything he could to help. 
 Lawyers, doctors, accountants and business people as well as musicians, actresses, painters and sculptors built the Great Neck Center for the Visual and Performing Arts. The center is a comprehensive arts school, gallery and performance center above the Squire movie theater on Middle Neck Road in Great Neck Plaza. The grand opening celebration on Sept. 6. will honor the film maker Francis Ford Coppola, who attended high school in Great Neck.
The nonprofit center has 40 teachers and 1,000 students. Several private music, art and dance instructors folded their existing schools into the roster of classes.
On a recent weekday morning, Natasha Frischer, choreographer of the Ballet Romantique, a dance troupe, led her students at the barre in one of the center's two dance studios. After 10 years of teaching privately in Bayside and Great Neck, she said she jumped at the opportunity to join the community effort.
Arts councils in towns from Huntington to Riverhead act as arts administrators and coordinators and resource and outreach centers for dozens of cultural organizations. The Long Island Arts Council in Freeport also dispenses New York State grant money. Organizations like Friends of the Arts in Locust Valley enrich cultural life through classical, jazz and chamber music presentations and do outreach in schools. The Seymour A. Berger Center for the Arts at the Roslyn Jewish Community Center runs classes for children and adults in fine arts and children's musical theater, and runs a concert series with a Jewish theme.
The Great Neck center is unique, said its executive director and founder, Regina Gil, because "it is a clearinghouse for the arts within our own mandate." The Town of North Hempstead does not have an arts council.
The Great Neck center runs outreach programs at High Street Community Center in Manhasset in cooperation with the North Hempstead Economic Opportunity Council and with Alzheimer's and pediatrics patients at North Shore University Hospital.
Fall course offerings include cartooning, book illustration and latex mask making. Students will examine musical theater and learn about television sports coverage. A jazz improvisation class will be led by a quartet of recording and performing jazz musicians.
Come November, the center's first annual national juried art show will be judged by Milton Esterow, editor in chief of Art News magazine. A klezmer jazz concert with Andy Statman is also scheduled in November.
The mayors of the villages of Great Neck Plaza and Saddle Rock, the Great Neck parks commissioner and the superintendent of Great Neck schools are among the 25 volunteers on the board of directors.
The center is the fruition of Ms. Gil's dream. An artist, teacher and founder of the Artists Network of Great Neck, Ms. Gil is commissioner of cultural affairs for Great Neck Plaza. The daughter of Holocaust survivors, she was born in a displaced persons camp and raised in the Bronx after an odyssey through Caracas, Venezuela, and San Antonio.
As a girl, she sketched images from television, won a citywide art contest at the age of 10 and attended the High School of Music and Art in New York City.
She moved to Great Neck in 1976 and became involved with the North Shore Community Arts Center, which subsequently closed.
"I waited," she said, "assuming a community like this which was legendary for culture and education wouldn't tolerate an absence of a cultural arts center in its town for very long. For 15 years I waited and it didn't happen. When I finished raising my children I basically said, 'Let's see what I can do.' "
The school opened in 1995 in the basement of St. Paul's Episcopal Church off Grace Avenue. It was one of only 13 art centers in the country to be accepted as an affiliate of the Kennedy Center's Partner in the Arts Institute last year.
The Great Neck Arts Center's new quarters became available when the former East Coast headquarters of United Artists sold the building at 113 Middle Neck Road to RD Management of Manhattan under the name Middle Neck Associates. To accommodate the art center's desire to own the facility, the building is being converted into an office condominium. The arts center paid $320,000 for the 6,000-square-foot space. With no Federal money available, $200,000 was raised privately this year.
Showing the center to a visitor recently, Ms. Gil pointed to what she calls the mystery door at the end of the hallway. The 5,000 square feet behind that door has been the offices of The Long Island Jewish World newspaper for 14 years. When the lease is up next July, Ms. Gilhopes to have the additional $180,000 to buy the space to use for performances.
"As a countywide office business based in Great Neck, I would have liked to have had the opportunity to buy the condo'ed space," said Jerry Lippman, owner and publisher of The Jewish World, when asked about Ms. Gil's plans.
The recently renovated Squire movie theater complex and retail shops, whose ownership will remain under Middle Neck Associates, said Richard Birdoff, a principal, are also in the building. Several retail tenants left when the building changed ownership.
Mr. Birdoff said: "They were looking for a home. There's a good synergy between the movie theater and the arts center. There were a lot of positives to working with them and having them in the building. We're philanthropic. I think we did a very good thing and a positive thing for the community that you wouldn't necessarily do in the pure business world."
The village eliminated three parking spaces from the Maple Drive parking lot at Ms. Gil's request. Apocket park was designed and landscaped at the center's entrance at the rear of the building so that students would not have to enter between parked cars.
Mayor Robert Rosengarten said: "Those dollars come from a special fund that has been earmarked for fauna and trees. It came from revenues of several developers over and above the budget. It did not come from revenues of taxpayers."
To stock the center, loose change was collected in cans at a local bank towards the purchase of a piano, art books were donated to start a library and money was collected for a kiln for ceramics.
Ms. Gil said: "My goal is for the art center to be a centerpiece of the town, not just physically but emotionally."

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
Housing at Atlantic Center Nears a New Phase

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
OVER the last three weeks Margaux Jones-McDuffie interviewed more than 50 people who were interested in taking the two apartments she had for rent in her three-family town house in Atlantic Center, the new mixed-use community under development in downtown Brooklyn.
She and her husband, William McDuffie, and their four children have lived in their duplex on Fulton Street at Carlton Avenue for two years, but their rented apartments recently became vacant. So she advertised, and the response was overwhelming. 
 "I never saw so many lawyers looking for an apartment," she said. More than 20 percent of the 150 respondents were either lawyers or law students. And the vast majority were roommate households -- almost always two employed people in their 20's.
In the end she chose two pairs of roommates, all women -- a teacher and a union organizer on the second floor, and a dancer and an administrative worker on the third.
What is most striking is the rent she's getting -- more than $1,000 a month for each of the two-bedroom apartments. Almost all the applicants had combined incomes of $75,000 to $80,000, which is higher than the maximum $53,000 a year in household income that was the eligibility limit for buyers of the three-family buildings in the first two residential phases of Atlantic Center.
This is both a sign of the strengthened rental market and a favorable commentary on the Village at Atlantic Center, as the housing component of Atlantic Center is called. It is a housing opportunity coming into its own for both home buyers and renters on former urban renewal land.
Now the City Planning Commission is on the verge of acting on proposed revisions for the third phase of residential development. Approval by the City Council is also required. These changes tell a tale of the changed environment in which housing production is proceeding these days. House prices are going up -- because subsidy levels are going down -- but the house itself is unchanged from the earlier phases.
Gone is the ambitious plan of Rose Associates in the 80's to develop a condominium community of 650 apartments in mostly four-story brownstone-like buildings, with a large central community park that the condominium association would maintain. Skidmore Owings & Merrill's New York office did the master plan. A crescent-shaped street around the park at the center of the site was a key feature of the plan. To prepare for it, the city demapped a portion of the existing South Oxford Street.
But the office market and the condominium sales market had already collapsed by the time construction might have begun. On the commercial side, the plans for two large office towers never materialized, and Forest City Ratner, the Brooklyn development company, took Rose's place as the developer. Forest City proceeded to develop 400,000 square feet of stores where offices had been contemplated. It also took on the Manhattan firm of Swanke Hayden Connell Ltd. to redesign the residential section, with Carl R. Meinhardt as the design architect.
After examining alternative housing plans, Forest City turned with city encouragement to the New York Housing Partnership's program for moderate- to middle-income home development. The Hudson Companies, a Brooklyn developer experienced in Partnership housing production, was brought in as the builder. The decision means fewer housing units over all, subsidies to make prices affordable, and an income limit on buyers, though not on renters.
Ultimately there will be anywhere from 417 to 450 dwelling units, all in three-family buildings. Each house has one space for parking at the rear. Typically, renters live in the upstairs apartments and the first floor and a lower level, which has windows at the rear only, is the owner's duplex.
The first 53 houses were built and occupied off Fulton Street in 1994 and 1995 as Phase One. They sold for $225,000. Last year the 54 houses of Phase Two started in construction. They sold for $235,000. Families are currently moving in.
The coming Phase Three, with 32 or possibly 40 more houses, completes the turn away from the original Rose plan. The crescent-shaped street loop that was appropriate for midrise housing and the planned park is inappropriate for the rigidly rectangular lots needed for town houses.
The Department of Housing Preservation and Development proposes to remap South Oxford Street as it had been before, a through street from Atlantic Avenue to Fulton Street. Most of the Phase Three houses will flank South Oxford Street and the parallel South Portland Avenue.
Under the new plan, the Parks Department will maintain a city-built park, diminished from 42,000 square feet in the Rose plan to 22,000 square feet. The Parks Department would also take over the city-owned property just south of the park, where Richard Northern has run the South Oxford Tennis Club on short-term leases since 1981.
THERE are four courts operated by the club. The main building is leased to many nonprofits for public events. Mr. Northern says that he and his partners hope to stay on the site and expand the business. City officials say that the property will probably be left undisturbed and run as a Parks Department facility.
Another part of the revised plan is to change the zoning to allow for a broader range of commercial use on the corner of Atlantic Avenue and South Portland Avenue. Originally, there were to have been stores all along Atlantic Avenue. Instead, commercial uses have been consolidated at the western corner of the urban renewal land. On the vacant land facing the stores' loading docks Community Board 2 favors additional housing, but the housing agency wants a flexible commercial zone.
Architecturally, the residential section is emerging with little of the panache of the original design. In that design, higher residential density as well as higher contemplated sale prices made it possible to bring in greater design elements for a higher-income buyer.
Nevertheless, the design standards at the Village at Atlantic Center exceed the routine. There are orange-red all-brick fronts, cornices that mimic historic styles, bay windows on some buildings, and precast details. The site is adjacent to the Fort Greene Historic District, and the New York State Historic Preservation Office approved the design.
For buyers like Cheryl Washington, a 33-year-old school teacher at P.S. 81 in Bedford-Stuyvesant, they are the buy of a lifetime. Ms. Washington said she had saved assiduously over 10 years to be able to buy a house, often working three jobs at a time, in school, after-school tutoring, and adult classes at night.
Two weeks ago she moved into a new house on Cumberland Street, with her sister Karen, who works for Con Ed, taking one upstairs apartment and her mother taking the other. They had lived for 30 years in public housing in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
"I'm ecstatic that it finally happened," Ms. Washington said. "I tried for Phase One but I wasn't accepted. I needed to persevere. The main reason was that I wanted to get my Mom out of the project." She needed to save $22,000 to make the house affordable, she said.
But in Phase Three, buyers will probably need more money. In the earlier phases a Federal Urban Development Action Grant was available, which cut the sale price by $30,000 a house (or $10,000 a unit). In addition, there were grants from the state and the city totaling $75,000 a house. The state and city are expected to continue the subsidy in the Phase Three, but there will be no Federal subsidy.
According to Alan R. Bell, a principal in the Hudson Companies, income limits for buyers will have to be raised to about $70,000, and house prices will probably be in the range of $270,000 to $275,000. He hopes to able to start construction in the fall, with first occupancy beginning in December 1998. The Hudson Companies, with offices in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn, does its own marketing.
Despite the higher prices, the higher rents obtainable will help make the houses affordable to buyers, if they have enough savings and an acceptable credit record.
"They're modern buildings, real clean, and only three apartments a building," said Sarah Johnson, a 24-year-old Vassar graduate who works as an organizer for the United Farm Workers union and is moving next month with her schoolteacher roommate into an apartment in Ms. Jones-McDuffie's house at a rent of about $1,000 a month. "And I like the idea of having the landlord living right in the building," she said.

HEADLINE: Losing Business, Gaining Business

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
FINALLY, Leon Fassler, the co-owner of Kings Electronics in Tuckahoe, threw up his hands and decided the time had come to relocate. Citing prohibitive costs to rebuild his outmoded factory, along with high property taxes and other expenses, Mr. Fassler announced recently that he would move the company to South Carolina after 45 years in Westchester.
Harold Feinleib, president of Aperture Technologies in Valhalla, is also leaving. His young and growing software development concern is bursting at the seams, he said, explaining that a commercial landlord in nearby Stamford made him a deal he could not refuse: more office space at a lower rate. 
 Property taxes and high rent are not the main reasons for the move out of the county by Simplex Knowledge of White Plains, a developer of Internet products. That company is relocating to lower Manhattan to have better access to computer-savvy workers schooled in the latest technologies, Patricia Martin, a co-owner, said. "That kind of a labor force," she said, "simply is not here in Westchester."
On the plus side of the ledger, however, two major employers have recently made heroes out of business leaders like Terence J. Masterson, the executive director of the Westchester Partnership for Economic Development, a public-private organization.
Mr. Masterson pulled many of the strings that persuaded the Nine West Group, a women's shoe company, to move its headquarters to the county and persuaded Prodigy Services, the nation's first online service, not to leave White Plains.
"You win some; you lose some," Mr. Masterson said last week, peering out from behind a stack of documents and business clippings on his desk. His organization, a privatized version of the county's former Office of Economic Development, is charged with attracting new businesses to Westchester and retaining existing ones.
But with a limited number of attractions in its basket of incentives for businesses, the county is losing some companies to better deals offered elsewhere, Mr. Masterson conceded.
Still, companies like Prodigy looked far and wide to move and then decided to stay -- discovering after all that the grass is not necessarily greener in places like Connecticut, which it had considered.
And companies like Nine West are moving in, despite higher property taxes and other expenses in the county, saying they could not be more pleased with Westchester's school systems, its high quality of life, major highways and proximity to New York City -- attributes that Margaret S. Soter, Westchester's business liaison, called compelling.
Although the range of business incentives is limited, at least in the case of Prodigy and Nine West there were enough plusses to persuade the companies to choose Westchester over Fairfield County. Alex DelCielo, executive vice president of operations for Nine West, described state and county officials as very aggressive in luring the shoe company from Stamford to White Plains, although he would not disclose details of the incentive package.
But Charles A. Gargano, chairman and Commissioner of Empire State Development, the state's umbrella organization for economic development, said the state package amounted to about $1.8 million, along with some personal cajoling from Gov. George E. Pataki.
The first group of Nine West employees has just moved in to the 336,000-square-foot building on Westchester Avenue that was formerly occupied by Nynex, and the others are to arrive by November. In all, the move is expected to bring 1,400 new jobs to the county.
In Prodigy's case, there was a $50,000 training grant for employees, a $25,000 export development grant and a guarantee for the new landlord that the state would pay up to $500,000 the first year and $300,000 the second year if the Internet service provider, which has experienced financial difficulties in recent years, could not pay the rent. The retention of Prodigy means that about 450 jobs will remain in the county.
Barry D. Kluger, Prodigy's senior vice president for communications, said that even though Connecticut was similarly persuasive in trying to lure the company there, "White Plains always was our first choice."
But in the case of Kings Electronics, the state and county incentive packages were obviously not sufficient to counter South Carolina's offer -- a new factory at a reasonable price in Rock Hill and a training program for workers through a college there, among other things.
"I don't know where South Carolina gets its money," Mr. Gargano of Empire State Development said.
From Mr. Fassler's point of view, it was a matter of wanting to stay in Westchester but not being able to afford to do so.
"For one and a half years, we explored the options, until finally prudent business judgment dictated that we move out," Mr. Fassler said.
The costs of refurbishing his existing 89,000-square-foot factory, a former ice warehouse, were too high, and "it came to a point where adding on only exacerbated the existing inefficiencies," Mr. Fassler said. The company manufactures precision components like cable connectors used in broadcast television studios, among other things. His move means a loss of 300 jobs to the county.
The move by Aperture Technology means a loss of 60 jobs, and Simplex Knowledge, while it employs only 5 people, now is in a major expansion mode, Mrs. Martin said.
Mr. Masterson at the Westchester Partnership for Economic Development, said he was heartened by recent developments under Governor Pataki's administration that have allowed Westchester to develop a more user-friendly environment for businesses.
"For a long time, we kept seeing companies slipping out of our hands," Mr. Masterson said.
In the last several years, the corporate tax surcharge and other business taxes have been eliminated, and more than 400 government regulations have been simplified.
The surcharge on the corporate franchise tax and on gains from transfers of commercial real property values at $1 million or more were similarly disposed of.
Also gone are the gross receipts tax on trucking and railroad companies and the petroleum business tax on fuel used by commercial enterprises, railroads and utilities. Workmen's compensation costs have also been reduced.
And while those changes have represented steps in the right direction, most business leaders agree that New York in general and Westchester in particular still have a long way to go.
For starters, utility costs remain especially high in Westchester, with Con Edison charging businesses 10 cents to 12 cents a kilowatt hour, said Jim O'Toole, a spokesman for the company. In the northern counties of the state, other utility companies negotiate rates as low as 7 cents to 9 cents a kilowatt hour.
Outside of New York, energy rates drop to 3 cents to 5 cents a kilowatt hour.
High property taxes likewise place Westchester at a disadvantage, running $3 a square foot on commercial buildings, which translates to $1.5 million in taxes yearly on a 500,000-square-foot building. By contrast, Connecticut in some cases waives property taxes for new businesses.
In Westchester, Mrs. Soter, the business liaison, said the county's Industrial Development Agency can offer loans to new companies, sales tax exemptions on major office supplies, deals that include payments in lieu of taxes and up to 25 percent discounts on electric rates for the first 10 years.
"We do have some tricks up our sleeve," she said. "Still, the cost of doing business in Westchester remains high."
Another drawback for Westchester is a state law that prohibits counties -- as opposed to cities like New York or Buffalo -- from offering cash grants as enticements to new businesses.
Meanwhile, vacancy rates in the county remain staggeringly high, with more commercial space being returned to the real estate market than absorbed, according to a market report issued by Insignia/Rostenberg-Doern, a corporate real estate service.
At midyear the office vacancy rate in White Plains was 30.81 percent, up from 26.7 percent at the end of the first quarter of this year. Countywide it was 17.07 percent, up from 16.65 percent at the end of the first quarter.
But commercial rental rates for Westchester are significantly lower than in other areas, observed William V. Cuddy Jr., managing director of Insignia/Rostenberg-Doern. Class A and B properties in the county rent for an average of $20.90 a square foot, compared with Stamford, where the same types of properties are $30 to $40 a square foot, and rents in Midtown Manhattan range from $33 to $45 a square foot.
Despite the higher rents in Greenwich and Stamford, vacancy rates there are only 11 percent.
Westchester was hit by the downsizing of large Fortune 500 companies in the early 1990's and has not fully recovered.
"Slowly but surely," Mr. Cuddy said, "landlords are backfilling those large blocks of vacant real estate with small- and moderate-sized companies."
Throughout the rest of the state, Mr. Gargano said, the state was trying to make a comeback. Admitting that New York still came out the loser in some incentive wars -- South Carolina is an example -- he promised that the gains of the last several years would prove to be just the beginning.
"There's more to come down the pike," he said, referring to new incentives for businesses.

HEADLINE: Where Has WSTC In Stamford Gone?

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
WHETHER it's providing a breaking local news story or giving school lunch menus for the day, a radio station is an integral part of a community, especially when it's the only one in town.
That was the case with WSTC in Stamford for 56 years. Its reporters would be seen checking the blotter at police headquarters or stopping at the Stamford central fire station to read the fire log for the night before. They would turn up at events to tape interviews and then hurry back to the station's studios on Atlantic Street. And when a controversial issue was being debated by the city's Board of Representatives, the station often would broadcast the hearing from gavel to gavel, sometimes into the early hours of the morning. 
 "During the big ice storm in the late 1970's, John Roman, our news director, and I were on duty for 46 straight hours," recalled Don Russell, who was the station's morning man for many years and its best-known broadcaster.
But since April Stamford has been without the presence of an AM radio station for the first time since September of 1941, just months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. That month, WSTC -- which last fall had been consolidated with WNLK-AM in Norwalk and WINE-AM in Danbury into the Fairfield County Newsradio Network -- moved, along with its FM stations, into a building in the Staples Shopping Plaza on Westport Avenue in Norwalk.
The move, like the earlier announcement that WSTC was being consolidated with WNLK and WINE, was distressing to many Stamfordites. "We were very disappointed at their leaving, and we encouraged them to relocate and stay," said the Stamford Mayor, Dannel P. Malloy. "We even offered them the use of our economic development office in the hope that they'd stay. Their leaving is a significant loss to the city."
Mr. Russell, who was with the station, on and off, for about 40 years, went further. "Here we have the biggest potential market, and the fastest growing city in the state, and they pick this time to leave," he said. Mr. Russell, now the general manager of Connecticut Public Television and Radio/Fairfield County in Stamford, added: "I think it's terrible. And many people I talk to, tell me they miss the personal touch now that the station has been combined and has left town."
But executives of Atlantic Star Communications, which owns the three combined AM station, along with their FM stations, say that Stamford will not be without an active AM radio presence for long.
"We definitely will keep a studio in Stamford and have some news originate there," said Bill Hess, regional vice president for programming and operations for Atlantic Star. "For example, we did some of our broadcasting on the Alex Kelly trials from our old Stamford studios, and we still broadcast a show called 'Emerging Society' from Stamford."
That show, and any other broadcasts emanating from Stamford, will now come from new studios that Atlantic Star moved into in August in the Landmark Square building. "We eventually plan to have a news staffer in Stamford," said Peter Mutino, the station manager for the Fairfield County NewsRadio network.
But not for now. Nor has there been a news staffer at the Stamford studios since the network moved in April, without any announcement of the shift. Indeed, Stamfordites unaware of the move, as most of them apparently are, still may call WSTC (and Fairfield County NewsRadio) at its old location and get a ring -- but no answer.
Callers in the Danbury area who phone WINE-AM will have their calls answered, at least during the daytime when a news staffer, Tony Savino, is on duty, along with a parttime newscaster and reporter. Mr. Savino, whose studios are in Brookfield, just outside of Danbury, said he reports for work at 4:15 A.M. Monday through Friday. In the Stamford-Norwalk area, the broadcast anchors in the Norwalk studios report on happenings. "The primary reason we relocated our news studios and sales offices to Norwalk is economics," said Scott Bacherman, the president of the Northeast region of Atlantic Star. "We were able to secure a very good longterm deal. Beyond that, it's better operationally and economically to put all of our operations under one roof. At the same time, we're going to maintain our obligation as a Stamford radio station."
To some observers, the "Fairfield County NewsRadio" title is something of a misnomer, if indeed not downright misleading. The round-the-clock broadcasting schedule includes far more talk programming than it does news. There is an all-news block from 5:30 to 9 A.M. Monday through Friday, followed by a midday report from 11:30 A.M. to noon. From 3 to 7 P.M., "The Afternoon Report" with David Smith, includes interviews, discussions of issues and news, traffic and weather reports.
Otherwise, apart from local newscasts that range from 30 seconds to 6 minutes, along with network news broadcasts, the Fairfield County NewsRadio format consists of syndicated programming. On Satudays and Sundays, apart from local news on the hour and half-hour, the format includes non-news shows involving gardening tips, a "Shop and Save" program and several syndicated talk shows.
The Fairfield County NewsRadio programming also includes broadcasts of Boston Red Sox baseball games. Red Sox games in Yankee country? The station had no choice if it wanted to broadcast baseball games, since the Yankees and the Mets already have radio outlets in the Fairfield County area.
"Regardless of who's playing, baseball is popular on radio," said Mr. Hess. "And you're always going to have baseball fans, who while they may not root for the Red Sox, do root for teams that play the Red Sox. And, of course, Mo Vaughn of the Red Sox is from Norwalk."
Moreover, Mr. Mutino says, "Advertisers have warmly embraced them, and the sale of time for the games has exceeded expectations."
Starting this fall, Fairfield County NewsRadio also will broadcast Boston Celtics basketball games and, later, both men's and women's UConn basketball games. "And this fall, we'll also do high school football," Mr. Hess said.
In a way, that fragmentation of broadcasting will be the only link to the past when the three stations had distinct identities.
Mr. Hess said the network did plan to add more news personnel. At present it has five fulltime news staffers and five parttimers working out of the Norwalk studios, compared with four fulltime staff members and one parttime worker last fall.
"We have far more people out now than we did at the start," Mr. Hess said. "And we're covering important meetings and other events. But as for covering entire meetings, as was sometimes done in the past, my sense is that it's a better use of air time when you get the key people in a controversial issue together for a forum-type program where they can discuss the issue."
Mr. Hess also said he thinks that the talk shows on Fairfield County NewsRadio can help keep listeners tuned in. "People don't stay with all-news stations for a long period of time because much of the programming can be repetitive," he said. "Talk shows, when they're interesting, can keep people listening."
One possible addition to the existing format could be local talk shows. "Our main objective now is to build a real good local news operation covering Fairfield County from Greenwich to Westport," Mr. Hess said.
Mr. Mutino, the network station manager, said advertising revenues have increased by about 30 percent since the three stations were combined (the three FM stations have retained their individuality).
John Roman, a former news director at WSTC-AM who spent 30 years with the station as a newsman, lamented the fact that the station had in a physical sense left Stamford. "But then AM radio isn't like it used to be," he said, "and one reason is because the local retail dollar for advertising just isn't there like it was."
He continued: "Back in the 60's and 70's, and even before that, the station's commercial anchors were local banks, car dealers and locally owned stores. But the local banks are gone and so are practically all of the stores and a lot of the car dealers. Now you have the malls and a lot of chains, and those stores don't spend much money on AM radio stations."
Mr. Roman, who left WSTC in 1995, recalled how his news staff totaled as many as 13 people. "And in the 1980's, we did three hours of news and talk in the morning and then in the afternoon there was another three-hour block of news," Mr. Roman said. At least, he said, Fairfield County NewsRadio is "doing more than anybody else in the state as far as news goes."
Officials of the new network were heartened by the Arbitron ratings for this past spring, which showed that WSTC's share of the audience had increased since last fall, albeit very slightly. The ratings of WINE in Danbury increased almost imperceptibly while the Norwalk rating dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point.
The really bad news, though, is that the ratings of all three AM stations were higher for the spring of 1996 when the three AM stations still operated independently.

HEADLINE: Economy Diversifies, Regaining Momentum

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
TEN years after a stock market crash marked the beginning of the end of an earlier boom, Long Island is climbing toward a new economic peak that has economists, planners and businesses gushing.
Key indicators portray a regional economy that has emerged with new vitality from a long recessionary period in which defense manufacturing, the economic engine of the mid-1980's and the region's greatest source of strength since World War II, declined precipitously. 
 Experts say that what has evolved is what the region had hoped for: a more diversified, stronger regional economy based on high technology industries and expanding service sectors, with the prospect of growth in high-paying manufacturing jobs.
Pearl M. Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association, said no indicator was more important than a recent net gain in manufacturing jobs, the first since 1986.
"And these," Dr. Kamer pointed out, "are not jobs flipping hamburgers."
She added that an influx of new retailers, including the recently opened Nordstrom store at Roosevelt Field, and plans for new and expanded regional malls, were also positive signs.
"The reason these retailers are coming is that we have so much purchasing power," she said.
The region's challenge, she said, would be educating a new work force with skills for the high technology industries that would power the region's economy.
"The Long Island economy is in the best shape it's been in since the mid to late 1980's," said Irwin L. Kellner, president of Kellner Economic Advisers of Port Washington and a professor of economics at Hofstra University.
"Defense and aerospace wound down as factors," Dr. Kellner said. "But they have been replaced by computer hardware and software, biotechnology, health care, tourism, and growth in business services like accounting, law and financial consulting. In many respects, it is a healthier economy."
The region's high cost of living, while not declining, has been held in check as local governments and school districts, compelled to cut spending during the long recessionary period, continue to limit property tax increases.
Local schools, often accounting for more than half the property taxes a typical Long Island homeowner pays, have held budget increases to 2 or 3 percent in many districts. Budgets were defeated this year in only seven of the Island's 126 school districts. The new state budget, school officials said, also deals generously with the region.
Alice F. Willett, the executive director of the Nassau and Suffolk School Boards Association, said districts were gratified by state aid levels this year but also had "grave reservations" about future financing.
"If the economy doesn't continue on its rosy path, then the state may have to pull back on some of its promises," Ms. Willett said. She said school officials were particularly concerned about financing for meeting higher minimum academic standards and for Gov. George E. Pataki's initiative to give school tax relief to senior citizens.
But if there were clouds over the horizon, the present looks sunny to Long Island's county governments, whose use of the sales tax continues to provide revenues while eliminating the need for property tax increases.
As the regional economy has strengthened, carried by the record stock market advances, low interest and near-record low unemployment, strong sales tax revenues reflecting consumer confidence and strong retail sales have relieved the counties of the specter of fiscal crisis.
In Nassau, county property taxes have been cut or frozen for five years, county officials said. County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, who is running for re-election this fall, has pledged to cut taxes again in next year's budget.
In Suffolk, where revenue shortfalls and job furloughs rocked county government at the start of the 1990's, property taxes have also been flat for five years, with costs for county police accounting for increases offset by declines in other spending including for social services.
"The sales tax is now our major revenue source," said Frederick B. Pollert, the director of the Budget Review Office for the Suffolk County Legislature. "The difficulty is, when you become dependent on one major revenue source, particularly one that is sensitive to overall economic trends, you are vulnerable."
On virtually every front, the economic news has been positive. Unemployment in July was 3.9 percent in Nassau and 4.8 percent in Suffolk, "right in the range of the historic lows of the 1986-1987 period," said Gary E. Huth, an associate economist for the New York State Department of Labor.
"The fact is, there's a labor shortage," said Lee E. Koppelman, the executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board. "It's a very good time for Long Island. We have finally overcome some of the problems of the recession."
Mr. Koppelman said the construction industry, another casualty of the recession, had been revived. Construction of new homes and offices was up, he said, "and we have seen more government spending on highway construction this year than in the last five years."
Some economists and experts in commercial real estate continued to predict the return to premier office buildings on speculation, a practice that ended in the late 1980's.
"Rental fees for class A office space are now in the $26- to $28-per square-foot range," said Dr. Kamer. "Most industry watchers believe that when it reaches $30 you are going to have a new round of office construction."
Ronald S. Cooper, a managing partner of Ernst & Young, an accounting and business service firm, said business clients appeared to be expecting continued strength in the regional economy. "I won't call it euphoria, but there seems to be a much higher level of confidence in their futures," Mr. Cooper said. "I am very bullish on Long Island."
Stock prices, rising to levels that would have been hard to imagine a decade ago, continued to spill money into a region where Wall Street is a significant employer, and where investment is as much a part of the Long Island life style as shopping for many people.
The real estate market has continued to rebound. Real estate brokers said there was demand for expensive homes in some of the most wealthy communities in the country, many on the North Shore of Nassau County, where sales rise and fall with the fortunes of the stock market.
Housing prices were beginning to approach levels of the late 1980's, but lower mortgage interest rates continued to make homes more affordable.
Demographers predict that Long Island's population will remain stable in coming years. But even without the demands for new housing rising population brings, construction of second homes has increased sharply on eastern Long Island, where areas of Southampton, Riverhead and Southold have been under intense building pressure.
In the Northville hamlet of Riverhead, a long-dormant housing development on bluffs overlooking Long Island Sound was revived with a massive clearing of trees that were reduced to wood chips heaped in towering piles. Town officials suspended the developers' permit after finding violations.
Environmentalists said the project, called Maidstone Landing, had destroyed songbird and animal habitats and was an example of the excesses rapid development was bringing the last remaining rural areas of Long Island.
"Especially in boom times, you have to be careful or greed can undercut planning and produce land use excesses that everybody on Long Island will pay for after the bloom is off the rose," said Richard L. Amper Jr., the co-founder of East End Forever, a group advocating preservation of farms and open space.
As the 10-year anniversary of the 1987 stock market plunge arrived, economists said the stock market and interest rates set by the Federal Reserve would affect Long Island more than many other parts of the country because of high levels of personal investment and Wall Street-related employment.
"I think the Fed may think twice before raising interest rates because of the nervousness of the stock market," said Mr. Kellner, who noted that the 1987 plunge followed closely on a Federal Reserve decision to raise interest rates.

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Mortgage Brokers And Lenders

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
BORROWERS are often told that going to a mortgage broker is a no-lose proposition. The broker's fee, the reasoning goes, is more than justified by the broker's ability to get a loan at a lower interest rate than the customer could get on his own. And usually that's the case.
But while brokers may often get better deals for their borrowers, they don't always get the best deal. 
 In fact, brokers have a financial incentive not to get the best possible deal for borrowers, because of a practice called yield spread premium pricing. Yield spread premiums are payments brokers receive from many lenders for arranging loans with a higher interest rate than the lender is prepared to accept -- terms somewhere between the wholesale rate lenders offer brokers and the retail rate available to direct customers.
"A lot of brokers are making a lot of money on yield spread premiums," said Richard J. Russell, president of Richland Equity Resources, a Manhattan mortgage broker. "It's legal as long as it's disclosed. But this is all about disclosure."
Mortgage brokers get better rates, he said, because they prepare the paperwork and deal in volume with lenders. For example, a borrower who goes directly to a lender might obtain a $150,000, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 8 percent with the payment of one point -- one percent of the mortgage amount -- to the lender.
If that borrower went through a mortgage broker, he might get the same mortgage at 7.5 percent by paying one point to the broker instead of the lender.
The benefit to the customer would be one-half of a percentage point in interest -- a difference of more than $100 a month in mortgage payments and more than $18,000 over the life of the loan.
But if the broker negotiated the mortgage at 7.75 percent -- plus the point to the broker -- instead of 7.50 percent, making it more valuable to the lender, the lender may compensate the broker with a yield spread premium. And while the amount of the payment varies from lender to lender, it would not be unusual, Mr. Russell said, , for a broker to be paid one or more points for delivering such a loan to a lender.
The customer gets a lower interest rate than he would have if he had gone to the bank directly, the lender gets a higher rate and the broker gets more money. So everybody wins, right? Well, not exactly.
"It is ludicrous to believe that any fully informed borrower would pay a mortgage broker for any other purpose than to obtain a loan on the best terms possible," said John G. Hall, a Staten Island lawyer who is chairman of the Real Property Section of the New York State Bar Association.
Mr. Hall said that whenever a broker gets a yield spread premium from a lender, it's a good bet the broker's customer is not getting a loan on the best terms. In New York, he said, brokers must disclose in writing and at the time of application that they may be paid a fee by the lender in the form of a yield spread premium. (Such fees are generally expressed in points or fractions of a point, again representing a percentage of the loan itself.) Just making that disclosure, however, provides little useful information to the customer.
"The broker tells the customer: 'You don't have to worry because you're only paying one point; the rest are being paid by the lender,' " Mr. Hall said, adding that the broker often doesn't disclose that to receive those extra points, he must deliver a loan at terms more favorable to the lender than the lender would otherwise require. "Even with adequate disclosure," he said, "consumers cannot be expected to be savvy enough to know that the broker is not working in their best interest."
In most cases, Mr. Hall said, the amount the broker is being paid will usually not be known until the lender issues the mortgage commitment. At that point it is too late for the borrower to do anything. "What do you do?" Mr. Hall said. "Apply to another lender with only two days left on your mortgage contingency and 15 days left until closing?"
Most borrowers, he said, simply go through with the deal without fully realizing the impact a yield spread premium may have had on their interest rate. And even when a specific reference to a yield spread premium is noted on the closing statement, the reference is still unlikely to be understood by many borrowers. Mr. Hall said that a typical reference on a HUD-1 form -- the closing statement required by the Department of Housing and Urban Development under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act -- might read: "YSP paid from Lender to Great Mortgage Brokerage Corp. -- $2,000 P.O.C."
The term "P.O.C.," Mr. Hall said, refers to a payment made "outside of closing." Since such payments have no effect on the amount the borrower has to bring to the closing, they are often ignored.
Eric Gonchar, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that in his experience, most deals involving brokers also involve yield spread premiums.
"It's on almost every HUD-1 that we do," Mr. Gonchar said, adding that the payment of such premiums has become a hot topic in the mortgage industry as the result of a ruling by a United States District Judge in a Virginia case earlier this year.
The judge ruled that the payment of yield spread premiums violates the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act because such payments are not compensation -- which is permitted under the act -- but are referral fees -- which are prohibited. The ruling, now being appealed, is the first to question the legality of yield spread premiums. Mortgage industry experts, however, view the case as an anomaly and expect it to be reversed on appeal.
"Yield spread premiums are nothing more than a payment by a lender to a broker for the services rendered by that broker," said E. Robert Levy, executive director of the Mortgage Bankers Association of New Jersey, a trade organization in Springfield.
In fact, he said, yield spread premiums are what make it possible for brokers to arrange "zero-point" loans for cash-strapped borrowers. In such cases, he said, the borrowers accept a mortgage with an interest rate that is higher than the current market rate. Doing so enables the lender to pay the broker a yield spread premium of several points, thereby making it unnecessary for the broker to charge the borrower.
"If starting tomorrow, there were no more yield spread premiums," Mr. Levy said, "there would be no more zero-point loans either."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
In a Busy Life, Taking Time To Hear What People Say

BYLINE: By Melinda Henneberger; Melinda Henneberger writes about politics from Washington.

 BODY:
As Bill Bradley headed to the shore on Friday for the walk at the beach that has been a New Jersey tradition since 1980, a kind of town meeting-in-motion along the water's edge, the former Senator just didn't sound like a guy gearing up for the run of his life.
Perennially mentioned as a possible Presidential contender, he is not among those who are overtly mulling a challenge to the Vice President, like his fellow Democrats Dick Gephardt and Paul Wellstone. Along with a slew of Republicans, they are already traveling in key states, staking contrast-and-compare positions and eagerly seeking press attention. All are demurring sweetly, saying they have no immediate designs on the Presidency -- and leaving no doubt about their ambitions. 
 But Mr. Bradley is doing none of the above. He seems pleased to have "moved from life in 15-minute segments to more of a free flow" since leaving elected office.
In an interview in Manhattan last week, over a breakfast of berries and herbal peppermint tea -- he seemed almost alarmed ('Oh, no!") when a waiter offered him real coffee -- he spoke with great enthusiasm about the pleasures of this new chapter in his life. He was just back from his longest vacation in 18 years, two weeks in England, Scotland and Greece, where, he said, "I reached a level of relaxation you couldn't reach in the Senate."
He's exercising more regularly than he has in years, going for a "three or four times a week endorphin fix" and has become a fan of the Women's National Basketball Association, which he said he likes even more than the men's game because "more teams in the W.N.B.A. play real team basketball."
In these last days of summer, he's been reading some fiction, Louise Erdrich's "Love Medicine," along with a biography of Elvis, and enjoying taking in theater and concerts with his wife, Ernestine. She just had another good check-up, five years after a mastectomy, and their 20-year-old daughter is in college.
The question of whether he will run for President seems to weary him. "I am where I've been for a while. I haven't ruled anything out, but I'm involved in all these other activities and all of them are interesting."
To list just a few of these, he's working in media, doing two-minute segments for the CBS Evening News, and on an A & E series called "Uncommon Americans." He's also taken jobs in business, as J. P. Morgan's senior adviser on geopolitics, and in academia, at both Stanford University and the University of Maryland at College Park.
He's spent time thinking seriously about the problems facing children, and about ways to support their working parents with after-school programs. And now he's "trying to think through where the economy is headed, not in macro but real-life numbers and trying to figure out how we get good jobs for good wages."
"The children thing I have a pretty good handle on," he says. "The economics is more complicated."
He's also working with his friend the former Republican Senator Alan Simpson to encourage campaign finance reform. And he has not altogether abandoned political life, either. On this year's beach walk, he'll be campaigning for Jim McGreevey, the State Senator who is running for Governor, and for other New Jersey Democrats.
When he left the Senate, Mr. Bradley said he wanted to get out and do more of the kind of listening to Americans that he does on the annual beach walk, meeting them where they are.
And so far, he says, he's heard people feeling better about the economy but still insecure about the future.
The Clinton Administration, in his view, can take a bow for the strong economy, but must answer for why more hasn't been done to "get the middle moving and keep the bottom from dropping." He is proud of Mr. Clinton for speaking out on race, but deeply skeptical of recent changes in welfare.
"The welfare system was an embarrassment and needed an overhaul," he said, 'but not the abandonment of a Federal commitment" to the poor. He said he fears what will happen when the now-booming economy slows, but believes Mr. Clinton "did this in the heat of a campaign and will now try to clean it up with every passing year."
With all the activity in his life, Mr. Bradley says he never misses his old gig -- mostly because he feels he left at the right time, and in the right way.
As a member of the Democratic minority in the Senate, he says, he found himself spending much of his energy on the energy committee trying to "stop bad things from happening -- I was delaying, asking questions, offering amendments to amendments."
"I said, 'I know how to do this,' but the moment I felt comfortable I felt uncomfortable. It was time to push out."
And when he left, he said, he let himself feel the loss of the only public office he ever held, and what he still calls the best elective job in the world. The night before they came for the furniture in his office of 14 years, he said: "I stayed and made phone calls, and had a good cry. I allowed myself to grieve."

Calypso Contestants Sing of Nostalgia and of Today's News

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
Scanty sang about the good old days, and Lady Venus about the power of women. Lady Guymine pitched a "granny fit." And Giant, who is blind, sang that "disability is not inability," proving his words with dance moves that propelled the crowd out of its seats.
The house was packed and steamy at the Tropical Reflections nightclub Wednesday night for the finals of the First U.S.A. Calypso Monarch Competition. Six hours after the marathon of words, music, humor, drums and dancing began, Scanty was the winner in the contemporaries category and Lady Guymine was queen of the veterans. 
 Calypso originated in Trinidad and Tobago, and most of the singers and audience did too, part of a Caribbean community that has grown in New York as economic opportunity has shrunk in the islands. Trinidadians have not lost their longing for home or their love of their culture, and so they had come to celebrate an art form, born out of slavery, that has become a symbol of a country's and a region's verbal proficiency, musicality and spiritual endurance.
The lyrics of calypso, said Hollis (Flash) Lashley, who along with a Trinidadian calypso king, Gypsy, was master of ceremonies, "mirror the social consciousness of a people, the hopes, dreams, feelings of the country." Calypso has always incorporated universal themes -- love, sex, nostalgia -- as well as pointed social commentary about race, class and politics in Trinidad. The challenge, Mr. Lashley said, is for calypsonians in New York to speak to life in America, and contemporary controversies, rather than just memories of their homeland.
There is ample material here, he said, given the club's location less than a mile from the spot where Abner Louima was allegedly beaten by the police en route to the 70th Precinct station house. A few calypsonians had wasted no time in weaving the incident into their repertory. Andrew Joseph, whose stage name is Buntin, appeared as a caveman, plunger in hand to punctuate lyrics on the barbarism that lurks beneath humanity's civilized veneer.
The contest was part of the lead-up to carnival, which will culminate with the annual West Indian Labor Day Parade down Flatbush Avenue tomorrow. Mr. Lashley noted that carnival had always offered a way to bridge divides among classes, races and sexes and release tensions among those groups "that otherwise might come out in antisocial ways."
But not all was serious. There were folk dancers brilliant with shine, color and sparkle, and plenty of ribald humor and double-entendres. Then there was Lady Guymine, who, with the energy if not the body of a gymnast, shed her hot pink lame robe during her second number and did the macarena in tights and a leotard. The crowd went wild, and to judge by her victory, apparently so did the five impassive judges. AMY WALDMAN

How to Fight Back If Your Credit Card's Rate Climbs

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
THEY are tiny slips of paper that can have a real bite. Millions of holders of Advanta credit cards have received them in recent months -- small notices inserted into their monthly bills advising them that their interest rates were being increased, sometimes to as much as 25 percent. For those with outstanding balances, that change could cost several hundred dollars a year.
For several years, credit card companies have increased rates for customers who miss payments or go over their credit limits. Now, with their losses rising from bad loans, some companies are raising rates for customers who just look potentially risky. 
 "You could be paying your credit card precisely on time and staying within your credit limit," said Robert McKinley of RAM Research, a credit card tracking company in Frederick, Md."If you missed one car payment or just took out too many other cards, that may be enough to trigger a 24.99 percent rate."
The Advanta Corporation is the most prominent of the increasing number of credit card issuers that have decided to "reprice" -- in industry jargon -- many of their accounts. Advanta, based in Horsham, Pa., has high loan losses and in April put itself up for sale. Other banks, including Capital One Financial of Falls Church, Va., have also been raising rates on accounts that they deem potentially risky.
Mr. McKinley and other credit card experts say consumers can fend off the rising rates in several ways:
* Read everything you receive from your card issuer. Most banks put rate and fee changes on separate pieces of paper inserted in their bills. Sometimes they print the notice on the statement itself.
* Keep copies of all terms and conditions. Issuers sign up accounts with so many different deals that they sometimes lose track of who got what. One Advanta customer said he was promised a rate of 9.9 percent, guaranteed not to change. When the bank tried to raise his rate to 16 percent less than a year later, he said, his copy of the initial offer allowed him to fight back.
* Be scrupulous in making minimum payments on time and in not exceeding your credit line. Card issuers may seize on the most minor infraction as an excuse to impose huge fees or rate increases.
* Consider freezing your account. In most states, you can reject an interest rate increase by writing a letter within a set period to the issuer and making no new purchases with the card. This gives you the right to pay your balance at the original rate.
* Call the bank and ask for a lower rate. Some companies will back down, at least partially, for customers who complain. If you think you have been treated unfairly, write a letter to a senior bank officer. If that doesn't work, complain to the bank's regulator. For nationally chartered banks, complaints may be made to the Comptroller of the Currency, a part of the Treasury Department. For state-chartered banks, write to the banking department in the state where the bank has its headquarters.
* Consider a different card. If you have other cards or other types of accounts with different banks, ask them if they will offer a special deal to move your balance to their card. Consider any low-rate offer you get in the mail, but check what the rate will be after the introductory period. Mr. McKinley says Wachovia, First Union, Key, USAA Federal Savings and AFBA Industrial banks all have cards with lower-than-average rates. Many of the lowest-rate cards, however, still have annual fees.
* Think about paying off your balance. Many people would be better off using savings or a lower-rate home equity loan with tax advantages to pay down card bills.
Finally, it may be prudent to have two or three accounts so that if one changes its terms you can freeze it and use another. But too many accounts may make you look like a bad credit risk, causing some card companies to send you that dreaded little slip of paper with the big rate increase on it.

Artists Arrive. Cafes, of Course, Follow . . .

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

 BODY:
Two young lovers lay flared out on the crushed velvet couch, strung out on their own hipness. He stared at a fan, contemplating infinity. She picked the polish off her nails. A typical night in the Village. Except this was Astoria, Queens. Archie Bunker land. First stop U.S.A.
Traditionally, this northwestern Queens neighborhood, which lies about a dozen good stone throws from Manhattan, has been a point of entry for Europeans looking to build the better life in America. More recently, young immigrant families from Romania, Central America and Pakistan have taken their places. 
 But there is also another type of immigrant carving out a piece of Astoria in the southern section of the neighborhood bounded by Broadway and 37th Avenue and 31st and Steinway Streets. They have not just arrived from overseas but from over the East River. They are the hipsters, the serious artists, the writers, the nouveau Manhattan Bohemes and our lovers on the velvet couch.
"People have gotten tired of living in the belly of the beast," said Monica Constantinides, a 32-year-old native of Cyprus who recently opened a spacious cafe across from Kaufman Astoria Studios, the TV and film production center, on 34th Avenue called Cafe Bar, a former carpet warehouse.
Live jazz is featured at Cafe Bar as well as a fully stocked bar and a menu of sandwiches and desserts. She also owns the velvet couch. "They are coming here because they are fleeing the tyranny of high rent, congestion and crime," Ms. Constantinides said.
Anchored by the Kaufman Studios, the American Museum of the Moving Image and their thousands of actors and artisans, the neighborhood has become an economically viable place to make business, make art and make a life.
"This area is the new horizon," said Joseph Pistilli of the Pistilli Realty Group, based in Astoria. Prices for a one-bedroom apartment or an artist's studio are typically half that of Manhattan, which is only a 10-minute train ride away. It is a rare mix of residential and commercial space. The artists have arrived and the restaurants, bars and clubs have followed. More than 10 establishments have opened in the area over the last two years. Gone is the old Croatian club. In is a new gay club, Crash, with a black and Latin clientele.
"That was unthinkable 10 years ago," said Patrick Poladian, a jazz pianist who is to appear at Cafi Bar this Wednesday night. "It used to be that the gays would get their heads kicked in around here."
Kaufman Studios has unspecified plans to expand. The newly refurbished P.S. 1, an exhibition and studio space in Long Island City, is scheduled to reopen in October. This may mean even more bars and more cafes.
Predictably, rents have risen nearly 30 percent in the last two years, Mr. Pistilli said, a barometer of the area's growing popularity. Sadly, some say, the bubbleheads in berets misquoting Nietzsche have also come.
"There is a problem about becoming too hip too fast," said Demetrius Manouselis, an architect and painter who has lived in Astoria for a decade. "I'd hate to see it turn into another East Village." CHARLIE LeDUFF

A Plea for New Jersey to Take Advantage of Its History

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
Even though George Washington and his soldiers set up three winter camps in New Jersey's hills, tourists who want to see where the Revolutionary War troops shivered in the cold are likely to think first of a trip to Valley Forge, Pa.
While other states lure millions of tourists to historic sites each year, New Jersey continues to neglect both its rich history and the history's economic potential, according to a recent report by the Task Force on New Jersey History. 
 But the task force members said money and jobs weren't the only benefits of doing more with the state's historic sites, from the 51-room mansion of the ironmaster Abram S. Hewitt to the barracks of mule drivers who worked on the Delaware and Raritan Canal.
"Our state is notorious as the target of jokes," the report said. "Outsiders see us, and we too often see ourselves, as simply a landscape of poor cities, shoddy strip malls and crowded highways. But it does not have to be that way. New Jersey has one of the richest and most vibrant histories of any state in the Union."
The group, which spent 18 months studying what could be done to promote the state's history, found many cases of neglect.
State-owned structures, like the tower erected to honor Thomas Edison's invention of electric light, are crumbling. Irreplaceable manuscripts are disintegrating because of inadequate temperature and humidity controls. And more than one-third of the state's public and private historic sites are open to the public less than 10 hours a week because of a lack of employees.
Dr. Barbara J. Mitnick, a historian and a resident of Morristown who was head of the task force, offered another example. At Ringwood Manor, the Hewitt family's former home, some pieces of furniture have deteriorated to the point that they are now losing their stuffing. "If you would go to that place, you would wonder how the state of New Jersey could do that," she said.
Task force members said they were also concerned about what students were learning in public school, where New Jersey history lessons are required. The task force said that when it asked 371 high school students to take a 15-question test on state history, the results were "devastating."
Only 22 percent of the 11th and 12th graders knew that a majority of New Jersey's voters had not supported Abraham Lincoln when he ran for President. Only 32 percent knew that Alice Paul was a women's rights advocate. And only 64 percent knew why New Jersey has been called the "cockpit of the Revolution": because more Revolutionary War battles took place in New Jersey than in any other colony.
In the report, delivered to Governor Whitman in June, the task force members recommended that more state money go to museums, historic sites, local historical societies and other groups dedicated to preserving New Jersey's past. They also recommended that the state sell more bonds to pay for historic preservation. Even though the New Jersey Historic Trust has given out more than $50 million since 1967, the last of its available bond money is to be awarded next year.
The task force also recommended that the state Division of Travel and Tourism do more to promote historic sites. Already, the travel and tourism market is one of the state's top three businesses, creating almost five percent of all jobs. But most of those visitors come to New Jersey either to visit friends or relatives, Atlantic City's casinos or the Jersey Shore.
Gene Herman, a spokesman for Mrs. Whitman, said the Governor was still reviewing the task force's recommendations. "The Governor is very committed to preserving historic sites," he said.
The report by the Task Force was not the first to criticize New Jersey's neglect of its history.
In 1846, an Episcopal Bishop, George Washington Doane, observed: "We have well nigh forgotten that we have a history. We have almost lost the very sense of our identity."
And 140 years later, Tom Dunkel wrote in an 1986 article in the New Jersey Monthly: "New Jerseyans have never been inclined to pamper the past. History bashing is commonplace. We seem to yearn for a heritage made of carefree, unbreakable plastic."
But the task force members said they were encouraged by a recent poll by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University that found that 65 percent of New Jersey residents polled favored an increase in state support of history.
"We're very optimistic that this is going to change," Dr. Mitnick said.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: MANHATTAN UP CLOSE;
Evicted Service Is Still Putting Copters in Air

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
When National Helicopter was evicted from the East 34th Street heliport on Aug. 13, the change seemed to fulfill Mayor Giuliani's April promise to reduce helicopter traffic over Manhattan by up to 40 percent by denying landing space to National, the city's largest operator of helicopter tourist flights.
But a spokesman for National, also known as Island Helicopter, said the company was simply shifting much business to heliports at West 30th Street and downtown. The company has long been at odds with City Hall over back rent and other issues, as well as being the focus of protests by community advocates, who contend that its flights are noisy and disruptive. 
 Unlike the East 34th Street heliport, which is owned by the city, the West 30th Street center is owned by the state and the downtown heliport, near Wall Street, is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. By law, those heliports must accept customers paying the required landing fees. A Port Authority spokesman acknowledged that National was using the downtown heliport, and a State Department of Transportation spokesman confirmed that National was using West 30th Street.
National estimated that it flew about 19,000 flights annually from East 34th Street, about a quarter of the total flown from the three heliports in Manhattan. A spokesman, Leslie Roberts, said the company hoped to fly an equal number of flights from the other two heliports, "but whether we can no one can predict at this time."
"We're dealing in a highly charged election year and people are being very cautious," he said.
Opponents disagreed. "National doesn't have the right to impose on the public whether it's an election year or not," said Joy Held, the executive director of the Helicopter Noise Coalition, a leading opponent of National and other helicopter companies. "What's happened to the Mayor's promise to reduce traffic by 30 to 40 percent? This is just musical chairs. They are going to slip through every loophole until we close the loopholes."
Ms. Held's organization has filed suit to close the East 34th Street heliport and advocates the closing of all Manhattan heliports.
The company's eviction from East 34th Street ended a decadelong legal fight. Under the plan announced in April, the Giuliani administration sought to evict National, move the 60th Street heliport operator, Johnson Controls, to 34th Street and close the 60th Street site. The Mayor's Office and the Economic Development Corporation, the landlord for the East 34th Street heliport, did not return telephone requests for comment. ANTHONY RAMIREZ

Reassurances, Despite a Bouncing Bull

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
WHEN Paul A. Volcker was chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in the late 1970's and early 1980's, he was invariably asked by reporters for an interest rate forecast.
"Interest rates will fluctuate," Mr. Volcker would invariably respond. 
 So, too, will stock prices.
But over the last few months, swings in stocks have grown increasingly wide, a development that has scared some investors and raised questions about the durability of the bull market.
This has happened before. Last summer, for example, prices of technology stocks fell sharply, and on July 15, 1996, the Dow Jones industrial average fell just less than 3 percent, prompting some pundits to say that one of the best stock market runs in history was over. The Dow finished that day at 5,349.51. This year, as traders went off to celebrate the end of summer on Friday, the Dow stood at 7,622.42.
While the recent swings may prick one's psyche, analysts cautioned investors not to interpret the moves as impending Armageddon.
"Financial assets can bob all over the place, but they do not collapse unless there is evidence the fundamentals are eroding," said Eric H. Sorensen, global head of quantitative research at Salomon Brothers. "Stocks are moving around more than they typically have, but the macroeconomic fundamentals still seem good."
Mr. Sorensen said that in the current environment investors might consider stocks with moderate price-earnings ratios, especially in the oil, paper, insurance and specialty retail sectors. "We think buying conservative stocks is probably more advisable now," he said.
STILL, rising volatility is worrisome, if only because people who are paid to study such things have no clear answers as to why it is happening now. And it is occurring after an extended period in which stock prices, while moving higher, did so within historically narrow bands.
"Over the last 100 years in the United States, when you have periods of fairly stable markets, prices usually go up," Mr. Sorensen said.
"Volatility tends to increase when we get what I call an information shock," he continued. "The last time that happened and caused a down market was in 1990, at the beginning of the gulf war."
In this century, Mr. Sorensen said, the average yearly range of change in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has been 13 percent. The end of the Persian Gulf war ushered in a period, which seems to have ended last year, in which the S.& P. 500 oscillated in a range of 8 percent to 9 percent.
"In the last six months or so, volatility has slowly risen to above 20 percent," Mr. Sorensen said, "and we haven't had a major selloff."
Abby Joseph Cohen, a managing director and portfolio strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, began advising clients to expect markets to become bouncier early in the year, if only because stock prices had been so stable for so long.
"What we are seeing now is much closer to normal," she said.
Investors who are alarmed by daily swings of 100 points or more in the Dow or 10 points or more in the S.& P. 500 should look at those moves in the context of the market's level, Ms. Cohen said.
"Using Dow points or S.& P. points, rather than looking at how much change the market has seen in percentage terms, magnifies the perception of volatility," she said. "With the averages at higher levels, it takes more points to move them."
"At current levels," said Ravi Singh, head of global portfolio trading at Lehman Brothers, "for the market to decline 10 percent would take a drop of more than 700 Dow points."
Indeed, the market averages' lofty levels, and uncertainty about the future, are probably the most important reasons stocks have been seesawing so much recently.
"There is not complete confidence in where the market is going," Mr. Singh said. "Add to that the usual amount of rotation within the market and other things that add to volatility, like progress to European monetary union and the upcoming German elections."
"This is not just an American phenomenon," he added, noting that on Thursday the Hong Kong stock market fell nearly 5 percent.
LASZLO BIRINYI, who has been analyzing stock-price volatility for nearly two decades, first at Salomon Brothers and now at his own stock research firm, said computer-driven program trading was having a greater-than-normal effect on price swings.
"We have always seen this in these periods when volatility picks up," he said, "because investors are confused or hesitant, and in that situation program trades seem to have more of an impact. Currently, the bulls are not that bullish, and the bears think the market could go a bit higher before correcting. In the land of the blind, program trading takes on a whole new dimension."
Mr. Birinyi said that for the last two months his analysts had tracked an average of about 15 program trades a day, roughly double the average for the year. Still, only in the last few weeks has volatility increased noticeably, he said.
According to his model, which tracks the daily high and low prices for the 30 Dow stocks, the swings during August have averaged 2 percent a day, up from an average rate of 1.41 percent for the first seven months of the year.
Nor does he see this as a harbinger. "I don't see how this is an indicator of what the market will do," he said.
Other analysts agree.
"The fundamentals appear to be reasonably sound, and we remain somewhat bullish on the market," said Mr. Sorensen at Salomon Brothers, adding that his view would change if something happened in the bond market.
Ms. Cohen at Goldman, Sachs said that after the drop in stock prices last summer, which was accompanied by a rise in volatility, she reviewed underlying fundamentals and concluded that what had happened was a "Wall Street problem, not a Main Street problem."
The current period has prompted the same examination, she said.
"Sometimes you look at the volatility and wonder if it is telling you something," she said. "Right now we are paying a great deal of attention to corporate profits, labor costs and the like. And we have not seen anything that has surprised us."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM;
Replowing A Garden, For Housing

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Mary Emma Harris still laughs when she recalls when the youngsters from Public School 76 struck oil. They were digging holes for trees that would help turn a small vacant lot opposite their school, on West 121st Street near Frederick Douglass Boulevard, into a garden.
Children yelled, "Miss Mary, Miss Mary, we struck oil," recalled Ms.Harris, a landscape developer from Greenwich Village who directed the children. Alas, the oil was oozing out of an abandoned tank. 
 The labors of Ms. Harris and more than 300 P.S. 76 pupils over the last four years have yielded something more precious than oil -- 1,500 square feet that the community calls the Children's Garden of Love. It has 12 trees and more than 30 bushes, including "butterfly bushes," so called because they are popular with Monarch butterflies.
The garden is to be demolished on Sept. 30, and replaced by a development of three-family homes. It is one of 16 community gardens in Manhattan to be replaced this year mainly by housing. All are in Harlem.
In the 1970's and 80's, the city let community groups plant gardens in vacant lots, with the understanding that the city could reclaim them for development. Officials of Green Thumb, the city agency that oversees the community-garden program, said there are 776 such gardens in the five boroughs covering 150 acres, equal to nearly a fifth of Central Park. Half of those gardens are set for demolition at some point,26 of them in the next few months.
Like other garden advocates, Ms. Harris said the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which oversees the city's urban renewal programs, should build on gardens only as a last resort.
Advocates say the agency should also make clear which lots are the sites of community gardens. "Too often the designation just says a lot is vacant," said Felicia Young, a member of the New York City Coalition for the Preservation of Gardens.
A spokeswoman for the housing preservation agency, Noel E. Jefferson, said it already develops community gardens as a last resort. The problem is community groups planted on sites that were already prime candidates for development, she said. As for a special designation for the gardens, Ms. Jefferson said, "I'm sure policy makers are not voting blindly." ANTHONY RAMIREZ

For a Projector Maker, Multiplexes Are a Ticket to Growth

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
FOR a sense of how the movie business is growing, consider Ontario Mills, a shopping mall in the flatlands 40 miles east of here. In addition to its dozens of stores, this huge emporium boasts an AMC megaplex with 30 screens -- and just across the street is an Edwards cinema complex with 22 screens.
The country is experiencing a movie theater building boom, and that is good news not only for people like Mel Gibson and Demi Moore, but also for Ballantyne of Omaha Inc. Ballantyne, though little known and based far from Hollywood, is the country's largest maker and distributor of movie projection equipment. Every time a megaplex goes up, Ballantyne is likely to get the orders for the projection booths -- the projectors and related equipment -- at about $20,000 a pop. (Indeed, Ballantyne's Sharp International division sold AMC the 30 projection booths at Ontario Mills. Other customers include Cineplex Odeon, Cinemark USA and Imax.) 
 Ballantyne recently raised fresh capital, expanded its factory, broadened its investor base and is poised to make a big acquisition, according to Arnold S. Tenney, its chairman, but he declined to specify potential targets. Many analysts find the company's stock, if not hot, at least an interesting way to play the theater building boom.
"This company really has the ability to grow pretty rapidly, and I think there could be a blockbuster acquisition," said Lawrence J. Horan, an analyst at Prudential Securities who recently began covering Ballantyne. Mr. Horan speculated that Ballantyne might go after its largest international rival, the projector maker Cinemeccanica S.p.A., a privately held Italian company.
Ballantyne's stock closed on Friday at $19.50, more than double its price at the beginning of the year, though down from its peak of $22.50 on July 30. Mr. Horan said he expected the price to reach at least $24 in the next year.
Ray Schleinkofer, who follows the company for Cowen & Company, which did its last share underwriting, said Ballantyne was "becoming a standard in that business, and they're a great play on the multiplex boom."
New theaters are opening rapidly, both in the United States and abroad, as uneconomical single-screen theaters close their doors. Sustained growth in the industry should help Ballantyne, which has roughly 65 percent of the domestic market for projection booths. The principal domestic competitor is Christie Electric.
According to the National Association of Theater Owners, a trade group, the number of screens in the country rose to 29,731 at the end of last year, from 23,814 in 1990. Another report, from Baskerville Communications, said that the number of screens outside the United States declined to 66,513 last year from 79,033 in 1990 because of closings. But it estimated that a construction boom would lift the number to nearly 76,000 in 2005.
Ballantyne's revenues, which were a bit more than $10 million in 1988, climbed to $51.7 million last year. Net income in the same period rose to $5 million from less than $1 million. Analysts predict revenues of $64 million this year, with perhaps $7 million in profit.
Mr. Horan of Prudential Securities said he expected Ballantyne's sales of projection booths to rise to 2,500 this year from 2,140 last year, and to 2,800 in 1998.
A key to Ballantyne's profitability is that its business has been requiring almost no new investment. The company recently spent about $1.5 million expanding its factory in Omaha, but it spends only about $500,000 a year on research and development, said Brad French, the company's chief financial officer.
"Projectors have not changed considerably from the way they were made in the 1920's," Mr. French said.
There have been efforts by companies like Sony to develop digital movie technology, but there are no products on the market, nor are any expected for some time.
John Wilmers, the chief executive of Ballantyne, said: "New technology is always discussed, but the issues are quality and economics. In the next 10 years, they're not going to change the way we show movies."
Mr. French said the company was increasingly shipping its projection booths to lucrative overseas markets. About 27 percent of sales now come from abroad, but that will grow to more than 50 percent in three years, Mr. French said.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Tenney said the company intended to grow rapidly or, if that failed, to sell off its small but profitable food service equipment business. Its larger focus for acquisitions, he said, would be in the areas of movie lighting or projection booths.
"We definitely have the cash, and we have the lines of credit," he said.
Ballantyne's largest shareholder is Arc International, a Canadian company of which Mr. Tenney is also the chairman. Arc took Ballantyne public in September 1995 and recently lowered its holdings from 50 percent to about 23 percent. That decision was difficult, Mr. Tenney said, because of Ballantyne's growth, but Arc needed the cash to pursue its main business -- the construction of skating rink complexes.
He said Arc would keep its remaining Ballantyne shares because of the expected growth, but some people are skeptical about how much higher the shares can rise.
Kevin B. Skislock, head of research at L. H. Friend, Weinress, Frankson & Presson Inc., said he was a great fan of Ballantyne, but he recently downgraded the stock slightly, to "buy" from "strong buy." He cited a recent slowdown in the growth rate for projector orders and the fact that the stock had already risen so much. He said he expected the price to climb no higher than $22 over the next 12 months.

Junk Here, Junk There: Hey, That's Big Money!

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
"There is nowhere else for the money to go." That's Martin S. Fridson, chief of high-yield research at Merrill Lynch & Company, explaining the rush of billions of dollars this year into C-rated and nonrated bonds, the bottom of the junk bond heap.
The appetite for junk's junk has been huge: at $9 billion, issuance of low-rated junk is running nearly 50 percent higher than last year at this time, according to Commscan Debtdesk, a financial research firm. And when dollar-denominated bonds of emerging-market countries are included, issuance of low-rated debt has nearly doubled, to more than $12 billion. 
 Most of it is taking the private-placement-to-sophisticated-investors route and is sold so quickly that rating agencies do not have enough time to evaluate the new issues. As of this week, Standard & Poor's had 48 issues already sold and still awaiting ratings. Most of these issues are expected to be given C's.
One money manager who is buying is Daniel Johnedis, fixed-income director in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for the Richmont Corporation, where he manages $100 million in high-yielding junk bonds.
"You get an extra 7 percent if you do your homework," he said, referring to the higher interest paid on low-rated bonds compared with investment-grade corporate issues. "So, why not? It is a lot easier to manage credit risk than interest-rate risk."
The demand for lower-quality credits is a byproduct of the same Goldilocks economy that has helped drive the stock market, despite its 3.4 percent slump last week, to perform better than expected this year. The belief that everything is working just right -- a growing economy with falling default rates -- is making money managers comfortable when they dip into the lower levels of credit.
"There is less chance now that these companies will default because it is a much better environment financially," Mr. Johnedis explained.
But the new issues data also indicate that while more low-rated and nonrated bonds are being gobbled up, the mix of the credit quality in the high-yield market has not shifted significantly in recent years. In 1996 and this year, the portion of C-rated and nonrated debt of the overall high-yield market has been 10 percent to 11 percent, below the levels of the previous three years.
"It is surprising that the quality of paper has held up as well as it has," Mr. Fridson said, adding that mutual funds have apparently been more picky than some have thought.
Jack Malvey, chief global fixed-income strategist at Lehman Brothers, thinks a "fundamental shift" is pushing money managers to take more risk. "You've got to have more of this lower-quality stuff," he said, or you cannot perform well anymore.
But the shift to more risk does not always pay off. Last year, the total return in the overall high-yield market, which includes double-B-rated bonds down though the C's, was 11.3 percent, according to Salomon Brothers' index, compared with 3.3 percent for investment-grade corporate bonds. So far this year, the overall high-yield return is lower, 8.7 percent, compared with 5.5 percent for investment-grade bonds, meaning there is less of a premium to be had for the extra risk. But the C-rated paper that many investors are chasing has returned 12.8 percent this year, up from 9 percent.
"This market is a market of extremes," warned Robert Waldman, head of corporate bond research at Salomon Brothers.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
For Those Who Like Coffee With Their Portfolio

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA MUNGER KAHN

 BODY:
THREE weeks of sliding stock prices have reminded many investors how unwise it can be to put all their eggs in one basket (or one market). In addition to the mattress, money market funds and bond funds, there is a new place Americans can shelter a chunk of their nest eggs: commodity mutual funds.
Actually, there is only one such fund, Oppenheimer Real Asset, but investing gurus say more are probably coming now that Oppenheimer has shown there is a way to jump the high hurdles set by Federal regulators. The fund, which opened on March 31, has attracted $62.1 million in assets, including $5 million from the fund's management company. 
 The fund will give small-time investors access to commodities investments that have historically been available only to the very well-heeled and sophisticated. The wealthy have favored commodity investments in part because they perform so differently from stocks and serve as a hedge against inflation.
The big question is whether amateur investors should take the plunge. And the answer from investment advisers seems to be yes -- but only if investors understand both the substantial risks and the unusual form of such a fund.
"I love the idea of the fund," said Don Phillips, president of Morningstar, the fund research company. He noted that he grew up in Texas in the 70's when oil prices were soaring and stock and bond prices were plunging. "It's important that funds be able to capture the performance of securities other than stocks and bonds."he said.
Commodity pools, which invest in futures and options, have a fairly long track record. "Pools of commodities are powerful diversifiers," said Roger C. Gibson, president of Gibson Capital Management in Pittsburgh and author of "Asset Allocation: Balancing Financial Risk" (McGraw-Hill, 1989). But he is a little concerned about the mutual-fund structure because it is so new, he said, adding, "I don't want to be the first in line."
UNLIKE a traditional commodity pool, which invests mainly in futures contracts, this fund invests heavily in commodity-linked notes that have a target maturity of 12 months or more, said Russell Read, who manages the fund. The notes are privately negotiated debt instruments issued by commodity producers like Exxon and Cargill or financial intermediaries like Goldman, Sachs and American International Group. The value of the notes is linked to commodity prices.
These securities help satisfy some regulatory concerns, but they also have tax benefits, Mr. Read said. Because the futures contracts expire every month -- and because Mr. Read does not want to take actual delivery of live pigs and 42-gallon drums of oil -- the fund would constantly have to roll over its entire portfolio, incurring substantial trading costs and creating short-term capital gains, which are taxed at ordinary income rates. If there are gains on the notes, they will be taxed at the lower capital gains rates.
The fund does use some commodity futures and options to move in and out of positions quickly and to take advantage of trading opportunities. But it is limited to a 5 percent position in commodities futures contracts when they are not being used to offset risk in the portfolio. The rest of the fund is invested primarily in short-term debt, like Government securities.
To capture the performance of commodities, Real Asset has lashed itself to the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, which is weighted to reflect commodities production around the world and thus is linked to global economic and business cycles.
The index tracks the prices of 22 commodities. Energy makes up the bulk of the index, at a 57 percent weighting. Agricultural goods like corn and wheat make up 22.5 percent, hogs and cattle 11 percent, industrial metals 7.5 percent and precious metals like gold are a bare 2 percent. Generally, the fund will not deviate from the allocation of key commodities in the index by more than 10 percent.
The premise behind the fund is that commodities provide an important source of diversification for portfolios of financial assets, particularly stocks and bonds. When commodity prices rise, stock and bond prices generally fall and vice versa. The best example of this occurred in 1973 and 1974, when high inflation drove stock prices down 41 percent, while commodity prices soared 114 percent.
Though inflation is low today, commodities would provide a hedge against its rise. The same factors that drive up producer and consumer prices, like wages, also cause commodity prices to rise, Mr. Read said.
Perhaps more important right now, as far as commodities investments' performance is concerned, is the rising demand for commodities from emerging economies like China's. "What's going to drive the returns is worldwide demand for industrial commodities," Mr. Read said.
Despite low inflation, commodities have not been a dud investment in the last decade. The Goldman Sachs index rose an average of 14 percent annually in the 10 years ended in 1996, lagging only slightly behind the 15.6 percent gain in the the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index for the same period. The reason for this surprising performance has to do with the premium that commodities producers often pay to investors who will hold often-volatile commodities over the long term.
The fund is a better vehicle for exposure to commodities prices than the typical natural resources stock fund, which invests in companies involved in commodities businesses, Mr. Read contends. If such companies are doing their job, they look to hedge away their exposure to fluctuating commodities prices so that they can lock in profit margins. The fund, on the other hand, tries to capture those increases in commodities prices.
In the five months since the fund's inception, it has provided investors with a total return of 3.1 percent, slightly less than the 4 percent increase in its benchmark index. By comparison, the S.& P. 500 has soared 16.8 percent in that time.
Underperforming the S.& P. 500 in a bull market is the least of this fund's risks. In fact, a reading of the fund's prospectus could send anyone "screaming to the hills," as Morningstar's Mr. Phillips put it.
The risks include a significant loss of principal; the manager's limited experience in investing in commodity-linked notes; significant fluctuations in the value of the fund's investments because the values of the underlying commodities, futures contracts and indexes are themselves extremely volatile; the lack of a secondary market for these privately negotiated notes, which means the fund may not be able to sell them or accurately value them, and the risk that the company with which the fund negotiates these contracts will not make good on the promise to deliver the value of these notes when they mature.
THAT'S not all. The prospectus notes that in 1995 and 1996, commodities prices did not provide strong diversification and moved in the same direction as stocks and bonds (or in Wall Street jargon, have not been "negatively correlated.") Notably, in the last week, while stocks slid, the fund was up 1.3 percent.
"It's true the prospectus is formidable," Mr. Read said, but the fund should be viewed in the context of a broader investment portfolio. "When used in combination with stocks and bonds, investors should enjoy significant risk reduction without compromising long-term returns," he said.
Furthermore, he said, the fund is not as risky as it might look -- and certainly less risky than a traditional commodity pool. It is far less leveraged, for one thing, which should make it about as volatile as a diversified American mid-cap stock fund, he said. While the fund also has some interest-rate risk, it is no more than that of a short-term bond fund, he added.
Mr. Read was the former director of quantitative research at Oppenheimer and was in charge of its risk management systems. He has been using commodity-linked notes in other Oppenheimer funds since 1993. "We know how they work," he said, pointing to the fund's high correlation to the Goldman Sachs index as a sign that the notes are being used and managed as intended.
Another issue is the fund's high expenses. It has a 5.75 percent front-end load and steep annual operating fees of up to 2.5 percent of assets. Those expenses are expected to fall as the fund grows, although they are likely to remain on a par with the typical stock fund, Mr. Read said. Right now, the average equity fund has an expense ratio of 1.4 percent.
STUDIES by Goldman, Sachs indicate that a 10 percent position in commodities in a diversified stock and bond portfolio significantly tamps down risk and provides better returns than a portfolio invested only in stocks and bonds. That is an allocation that Mr. Gibson, the financial adviser, is comfortable with. "I would not put in more than 10 percent," he said. "That's not enough to make you whole, but it will soften the downside" in any selloff.
It is not surprising that Mr. Read takes a more aggressive approach. Thirty percent of his own portfolio is in the fund. A 20 percent allocation to commodities makes sense for an aggressive investor, he said, "but I like the strong return characteristics of this asset class because of worldwide economic growth."

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
On Payday, Union Jobs Stack Up Very Well

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
WITH the teamsters' success in their two-week strike against United Parcel Service, and with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. training thousands of union organizers in a drive to reverse a quarter-century of declining membership, millions of workers will be asked over the next few years whether they want a union to represent them.
It is a complicated question, the answer to which rests on a jumble of determinations: Do you favor collective action or individual initiative? Do you trust the union's leaders? Do you want somebody else speaking for you in dealings with your employer? Do you think you will be dismissed if you sign a union card -- or that the company will send your job overseas if a union is organized? 
 But in one regard, the choice is simple -- and it is not the choice that most workers have made during the labor movement's recent decades in the economic wilderness.
From a pocketbook perspective, workers are absolutely better off joining a union. Economists across the political spectrum agree: Turning a nonunion job into a union job very likely will have a bigger effect on lifetime finances than all the advice employees will ever read about investing their 401(k) plans, buying a home or otherwise making more of what they earn.
Here is how the equation works, said Prof. Richard B. Freeman of Harvard University: "For an existing worker in a firm, if you can carry out an organizing drive, it is all to your benefit. If there are going to be losers, they are people who might have gotten a job in the future, the shareholders whose profits will go down, the managers because there will be less profit to distribute to them in pay and, maybe, consumers will pay a little more for the product. But as a worker, it is awfully hard to see why you wouldn't want a union."
Over all, union workers are paid about 20 percent more than nonunion workers, and their fringe benefits are typically worth two to four times as much, economists with a wide array of views have found. The financial advantage is even greater for workers with little formal education and training and for women, blacks and Hispanic workers.
Moreover, 85 percent of union members have health insurance, compared with 57 percent of nonunion workers, said Barry Bluestone, a labor-friendly economics professor at the University of Massachusetts.
The conclusion draws no argument even from Prof. Leo Troy of Rutgers University, who is widely known in academic circles and among union leaders for his hostility to organized labor. "From a standpoint of wages and fringe benefits," Professor Troy said, "the answer is yes, you are better off in a union."
His objections to unions concern how they reduce profits for owners and distort investment decisions in ways that slow the overall growth of the economy -- not how they affect workers who bargain collectively. Professor Troy points out that he belongs to a union himself -- the American Association of University Professors.
Donald R. Deere, an economist at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A & M University, studied the wage differential for comparable union and nonunion workers between 1974 and 1996, a period when union membership fell to 15 percent of American workers from 22 percent.
In every educational and age category that he studied, Professor Deere found that union members increased their wage advantage over nonunion workers during those years. Last year, he estimates, unionized workers with less than a high school education earned 22 percent more than their nonunion counterparts. The differential declined as education levels rose, reaching 10 percent for college graduates.
"It makes sense to belong to a union," Professor Deere said, "so long as you don't lose your job in the long term."
SOME analysts go further, waving off the concern that paying union wages drives companies out of business and costs workers their jobs. In a study of 633 businesses, which employed 7.7 million workers, Professors Freeman and Morris M. Kleiner of the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota found that 126 of the enterprises became insolvent between 1983 and 1990. The failures were almost evenly split between union and nonunion workplaces.
"People think that their risk in joining a union is that this stuff -- higher wages and more benefits -- will cost the company some money so there is some risk that you might lose your job," Professor Freeman said. "That risk turns out to be pretty much zero. Is a company with a union more likely to go out of business? The answer is no."
In other research, they found no significant differences in the rates at which unionized and nonunion manufacturers moved their operations overseas, Professor Kleiner said. Even so, many manufacturing jobs in the United States were lost in the 1980's as lower-cost foreign producers increased their sales in this country.
But again, from the individual worker's perspective, belonging to a union may provide a buffer against the vicissitudes of global competition.
"When the employer is on the edge and the union thinks the company can be saved," Professor Kleiner said, "the unions will make concessions to keep the enterprise going. During the 1980's, there were huge givebacks, such as two-tier wage structures. Look at Northwest Airlines, where the unions gave huge wage concessions to keep the company going, and at Chrysler, which is now thriving again."
Whatever economists may say, unions are no help to workers, said Jack D. Gulati, chief executive of Fidelity Technologies Group, a communications equipment maker in Reading, Pa., and himself a member of the elevator operators union in New York when he was a young man.
"Employees, at least in manufacturing, who want to get ahead can't if there is a union," said Mr. Gulati, acting as a spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business. The reason, he said, is that "unions negotiate for rules that get more and more confining to define jobs and protect seniority. So if we had a union, someone who is good on the electronics assembly line can't try the mechanical assembly line, and people in maintenance can't advance to assembly."
He said he did not think unions would succeed in expanding their membership, except for "opportunities created by abuses" in which businesses mistreat employees.
And Professor Troy said the findings by Professors Freeman and Kleiner might not tell the full story because unions "tend to organize at the most financially successful companies, and those regulated by the government," rather than in highly competitive industries in which it takes very little capital and skill to start a new company, like retailing and light manufacturing.
IN industries that cannot pick up and move (hotels, say, or asbestos removal) or where huge capital investments are required to enter the business (steel or automobiles), the premium wages and benefits negotiated by unions are like a tax on the owners' capital, said Barry Hirsch, an economist at Florida State University who studies income disparity.
"The union captures in wages and benefits part of what would be profits and investment in research and development," he said.
When such a "tax" is applied to some companies and not others, it can push the ones who pay it to the wall. That is one reason for a major shift in the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s organizing tactics. Rather than trying to pick off one company at a time, the labor federation's new emphasis is on organizing an entire industry's workers in a city at once.
That is what Local 78 of the Laborers Union did last year in the New York City asbestos removal business.
Most workers in the industry are immigrants from Poland and Spain, many of whom do not speak English. Wages were typically $12 to $14 an hour with no benefits and no overtime, said Pawel Kedzior, the Polish immigrant who led the organizing drive. Several workers said that 12-hour shifts were common; workers often labored weeks at a time with no days off.
After a work stoppage at the Exxon Building in Rockefeller Center in February 1996, the union won contracts with 40 companies. Both Mr. Kedzior and Salvatore J. DiLorenzo, president of the PAL Environmental Safety Corporation, said these companies handled the vast majority of asbestos removal in the city.
The contract raised the pay of the 1,800 covered workers to $18 an hour plus benefits worth about $4 an hour. For the worst paid, that meant an 83 percent increase in compensation. The workers must pay $20 a month in union dues -- an expense that employees contemplating an organizing drive should figure into their calculations, experts say.
"Now I can work 40 hours a week, not 60," one worker, Jan Pyziak of Brooklyn, said through an interpreter.
"I don't have to work every weekend, and I can be with my two children more," said a co-worker, Joe Campo of Coram, N.Y. "Now I only work weekends when I want. Having a union contract means a lot, especially having the medical insurance and the pension."
The contractors say they can pass on the higher labor costs, provided that the union organizes the entire industry in New York.
"There is no problem so long as every contractor is union, because then their bids are all based on the same costs," said Arthur Wolfman, a director of the Environmental Contractors Association. "The problem is that not all contractors are union, and that screws things up."
Nor are all unions equally effective. Unions exert the most influence when they have organized all or nearly all of an industry and when they have the capacity to shut down enterprises in a strike. Prof. Paula B. Voos of the University of Wisconsin estimated, for example, that supermarket workers in a metropolitan area could raise their wages by 2 percent for each additional 10 percentage points of the industry that was unionized.
But unions are vulnerable to automation -- especially machinery that managers can readily operate during strikes -- and to running conflicts with other unions.
And, of course, there is a real -- and immediate -- risk of losing one's job in deciding to become part of an organizing drive.
Richard Bensinger, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s director of organizing, estimates that one in 20 workers who try to form a union are dismissed. And while such retaliation is not allowed, more than 13,000 workers complained to the National Labor Relations Board last year about illegal discharges. Most of the complaints are settled by negotiation.
Professor Freeman said individuals considering whether to vote for a union in their workplace should examine the issue in the same way as an owner of capital would consider opening a factory or starting a production line.
"Ask yourself: 'Is having a union a good investment for me?' Examined that way, there is a striking parallel to the capital investor," he said. "The question is, 'Shall I invest, with lower risk but lower return, and therefore decide not to have a union? Or shall I take a bit of a gamble and hope that this union will be successful in winning me better wages, better benefits and more representation?' "
But do not count on the union putting the question to you in such terms.
Both Mr. Bensinger and his boss, John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said success in organizing more workplaces would rely less on people's desire for higher wages and benefits than on their demand for a voice in the workplace.
"I get rid of organizers who say 'I am here to get you $3 more an hour,' " Mr. Bensinger said, "because if you make that a single issue in organizing, the employers will just hand out big raises to beat the union."

HEADLINE: Supermarkets Get a Brand New Bag

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
DAVID McFARLAND makes daily jaunts to a grocery store two miles from his home, but not for bread or milk.
He goes to the Kroger supermarket in Alpharetta, a suburb north of Atlanta, to use the treadmills and stair-climbing machines in the store's fitness center. There is even a trainer with a degree in exercise physiology to guide him through his workouts. 
 Carmella Edelman has little use for the treadmills, but she has become a regular at the store for its cooking school, across from the aisle where Maybelline mascara and Stephen King paperbacks are sold. For about $30 -- food included -- students learn to whip up duck ravioli with brown butter sauce, chocolate-chip biscotti and other such delights.
Is your driver's license about to expire? You can renew it at the store's customer service counter. Other chains are offering sushi bars and shoe repair, or providing baby-sitting while harried parents shop.
All this, of course, is intended to lure people into supermarkets, and not just to tighten abs or teach customers to stir-fry. Once they're inside, the grocery store of the 90's is designed to get shoppers not only to buy toothpaste and cereal but also to fill their carts with high-margin convenience items like boneless, skinless, marinaded chicken breasts. Behind the scenes, meanwhile, store operators are working to shave pennies off the cost of stocking chicken-noodle soup and other staples that add little to their bottom lines.
The goal is to push razor-thin profits closer to 2 percent than 1 percent, which is about all that even the best operators have been able to achieve in the supermarket industry. That challenge is attracting some of the smartest money in the United States and Europe to a business rarely regarded as innovative. It is forcing supermarket operators to spend billions of dollars remodeling outdated stores and investing in technology. And it is driving already big chains into the arms of larger, more powerful merger partners.
THE food fight in Atlanta is a microcosm of what is happening across the country -- especially in growing cities where chains can plant huge superstores amid newly sprouted suburban subdivisions, in hopes of cashing in on robust economies, relatively cheap land and rapid population growth.
With profits so slim, the chase is do or die, and Atlanta's market is especially competitive. Some grocers in this city, which in the 1990's has had among the highest rates of store openings and new market entrants in the country, have already been driven out. And there are likely to be more casualties when the economy inevitably slows.
"The square footage that is going in there is just mind-boggling," said Bonni Zwickel, an industry analyst for First Boston, surveying the Atlanta market. "Second- or third-tier players just have to fall out at some point."
The reason for the industry's attempts to remake itself? Investors are demanding better returns at a time supermarket companies are losing business to unlikely competitors that now stock grocery items. Toys "R" Us sells diapers and baby formula. Wal-Mart is counted as the fifth-biggest supermarket chain in America. And many baby boomers would rather buy Boston Market's take-out meals than supermarket frozen dinners or -- of all things -- the ingredients to actually cook a meal.
"The line between grocery retailers and other kinds of retailers continues to blur," said Paul Bernish, a spokesman for the Kroger Company in Cincinnati, which at $25 billion in sales is the nation's largest grocery chain. "Without us taking action and becoming smarter ourselves, we face the possibility of losing our place in consumers' minds."
In Atlanta, the competition is visible in bickering over ads and promotions, battles for prime real estate and a proliferation of store concepts that may not pay off. What, after all, does Kroger really know about the fitness business? In the Alpharetta store, it did cruelly plant the gym just a few feet from the bakery.
Despite the risk that some of their efforts will flop, the dozen or so competitors here are undaunted. Kroger relies on service -- offering, for instance, dry-cleaning at some stores. A struggling local chain, Harry's Farmers Market, pulls in customers from 20 miles away with the most extensive product assortment in town, everything from fresh fish heads to $100-an-ounce balsamic vinegar. Winn-Dixie has positioned itself as the bargain shopper's alternative, advertising cheap wine and beef. Publix has simply bullied its way into the $6 billion Atlanta market, spending more than $300 million to open about 60 stores in five years.
The aisles are becoming crowded in other cities, too. In Houston and Dallas, Albertson's and Kroger have displaced Houston-based Randall's as the market leader by rapidly expanding with new or revamped stores. And Safeway, in which the New York takeover firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has a one-third stake, bought a leading chunk of the Southern California market last year when it acquired the Vons Companies.
Other deals include the purchase of Stop & Shop Companies by Ahold N.V., a Dutch company, and the acquisition of Kash n' Karry Food Stores by Food Lion. In addition, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts recently purchased the Bruno's chain, continuing its spree of buying undervalued grocery companies with strong turnaround prospects.
THE push to create larger regional chains is reshaping competition from Phoenix to Charlotte to Seattle, although parts of the Northeast have lagged behind the trend. The New York City area is an especially tough market that many operators avoid altogether because of its shortage of vacant land, high real estate and labor costs and zoning barriers.
Even in New York, though, there have been changes. Stop & Shop is adding amenities in stores in Westchester County, including banks, pharmacies and expanded bakeries in some stores. Pathmark Stores is also upgrading and expanding. The company is building a store in Harlem and has said it will add bank branches in dozens of its New York stores.
In the growth markets, however, consumers have come to expect even more variety, increased service and lower prices. While shoppers may judge the industry by the number of stores near their homes that have sushi bars, the real gauges of success have more to do with factors far from shoppers' view -- in produce coolers, warehouses and corporate offices.
For example, customers at Kroger stores in Atlanta may think it is a coincidence when cashiers hand them coupons offering 50 cents off their favorite brand -- and flavor -- of ice cream. But scanners that tally their food bills at the checkout counters are simultaneously analyzing what they buy. This technology, growing in popularity among the chains, is being rolled out at hundreds of Kroger stores.
The checkout data allow stores to instantly print coupons for items being purchased (or for similar products) and to electronically reorder merchandise as it sells. Because the promotions are linked to the inventory, fewer cases of soda collect dust in warehouses.
Kroger, citing competitive reasons, declined to say how much money it was saving through its technology investments and other cost-cutting measures. Industrywide, though, such improvements can make the difference between turning a profit or reporting a loss as supermarket sales remain flat.
THE industry's revenues, excluding sales from warehouse clubs and convenience stores, increased 11 percent last year, to $323.2 billion. But sales actually declined slightly after adjusting for inflation, according to Progressive Grocer, a trade publication.
At the same time, the industry's operating expenses declined last year to 96.95 percent of sales, from 97.90 percent in 1995, according to the Food Marketing Institute, a trade group. Minute as that may seem, it was substantial for an industry that counts its profits in fractions of a penny: it contributed $3 billion to pretax profits, helping net income rise to 1.2 percent of sales from 1.14 percent in 1995 and a low of 0.49 percent in 1993, according to the marketing institute.
Surprisingly, the value of supermarket stocks, which have always trailed the broader market, is still in the cellar. Food retailers' shares, as measured by the Standard & Poor's food retail index, rose 8.6 percent so far this year, versus the 21.4 percent gain for the 500 stocks in the broader S.& P. index. Part of the reason for the disparity is that the payoff from the big chains' costly investments is just beginning to show up on balance sheets; in addition, while supermarkets are becoming more efficient, many still suffer from heavy debts accumulated in leveraged buyouts during the 80's and early 90's.
The attraction is that even with skimpy margins, large, well-run chains can turn in respectable profits. Kroger's net profit margin, for instance, was just 1.39 percent last year, but that translates into a decent $350 million on sales of $25 billion.
Analysts say profitability should continue to edge up for the overall industry, between further cost-cutting and consolidations that are trimming purchasing, administrative, distribution and advertising expenses and giving grocers more clout with their suppliers.
The industry makeover and the increased competition is fine by Ms. Edelman, the Roswell, Ga., woman who attends the Kroger cooking school in Alpharetta. She frequents several stores, depending on her needs. For recipe ingredients after class, she shops at Kroger. "But actually, for my produce, I go to Harry's Market," she said.
Already, the struggle to win the loyalty of customers like Ms. Edelman is taking a toll on some grocers. Winn-Dixie, long the No. 2 chain in Atlanta, behind Kroger, fell last year to third place, the victim of an assault on the market by Publix, a Lakeland, Fla., chain closely held by its employees.
SIX years ago, when Ed Crenshaw, then a Publix executive vice president, pulled out his corporate credit card at a car rental agency in Atlanta, the clerk asked, "What is Publix?" and wanted to know if the name was spelled incorrectly.
"We knew we would have to do a lot of work to develop the brand up here," said Mr. Crenshaw, now president of the company. So when Publix, looking to expand after saturating its home state, blew into Atlanta in 1991, the company simply offered what it determined was missing: newer, cleaner stores, more service and fresher perishable goods. In just five years, Publix claimed 14.4 percent of the Atlanta market.
"We know how to make money," said Frank Hernandez, regional director for Publix in Atlanta. "Once you give people something of value, they will come back. We are not trying be something other than a food business, so we don't want to have a smorgasbord of things in a food store and then let customers forget about food and the essential things that we built this business on."
Customers say the approach is working. "I used to shop at A.& P., but I got disappointed with their produce," said Veronique Maitre, a translator who was shopping recently at the Publix store in Alpharetta. "They were out, or it didn't look good."
Another shopper, Marie Vitalo has become a regular at Publix even though there is a Winn-Dixie store about a block from her house in Smyrna.
"I like a clean, big store," said Ms. Vitalo, who works in accounting.
Winn-Dixie, meanwhile, is determined to use pricing to win back customers like Ms. Vitalo. The parking lot of its Alpharetta store, which competes with two nearby Krogers and one of Wal-Mart's Sam's Club warehouse stores, is festooned with a large blue-and-white banner promising "Lowest prices in town." Inside the store, signs and tags create a virtual sea of markdowns. The signs announce 40 percent off greeting cards, 50 percent off sunglasses, 15 percent off national-brand snack chips and 20 percent off school supplies. Some signs ask simply: "Why pay more?"
"We are in a transition and have been for many years," said Mickey Clerk, a spokesman for Winn-Dixie, based in Jacksonville, Fla. "Customers are stretched for time as well as for money, and what they want to do is find everything they want at the lowest prices they can in one place that is convenient for them. We were convenient before, but we didn't have the complete variety that today's customers want."
So the company is closing stores throughout its system that are less than 30,000 square feet and replacing them with larger ones -- some up to 70,000 square feet -- with room for floral departments, pharmacies and bigger delis.
A strategy of low prices and big investments may not seem like a smart game plan in one of Winn-Dixie's most competitive markets. But the chain has the resources to wait for weaker operators to fold; meanwhile, it continues to improve its stores to be more competitive with Kroger and Publix.
Some competitors, though, have simply left or are struggling to keep up. Four years ago, Big Star, one of the retail arms of Fleming Companies, the giant food wholesaler, sold its Atlanta stores to A.& P. and left the market. Yet A.& P., which has been slow to upgrade its network of older stores, is barely clinging to sixth place in the market.
"We were really consolidating," said Michael Rourke, a senior vice president of A.& P. "A lot of stores we acquired were not up to today's standard and had to be closed."
Grand Union and Piggly Wiggly supermarkets have also sold their Atlanta stores to other competitors, while Harry's Farmers Market, with five stores, hangs on, but has lost more than $23 million in four years.
Even the market leaders have some housecleaning to do. An older Kroger store in the fashionable Buckhead section of Atlanta has dated fixtures and lacks the amenities found in the Alpharetta outlet.
Such shortcomings are becoming less tolerable to Atlanta-area shoppers. Mr. McFarland, who works out at the "cardiotheater" in the Alpharetta Kroger, said he had noticed an overall improvement in the area's supermarkets in recent years, as more companies moved in.
Besides the gym, which is run by Australian Body Works and costs $5 a visit for walk-ins, Mr. McFarland uses the pharmacy and the Nationsbank branch at the store. The added services have turned him into a Kroger regular when it comes time to shop for groceries.
"You don't want to have to make two stops if you don't have to," said Mr. McFarland, 43, a wine supplier. And he has the sense that packing more into his busy schedule will become even easier as Kroger and the other grocers continue to offer not just better cuts of meat and more brands of cereal, but additional services as well. They have to, he figures, "to keep up with everybody else in the neighborhood."

To lure shoppers, supermarket chains are building ever-larger stores that include departments and services intended to appeal to busy consumers. Once inside, the reasoning goes, they will fill their carts with the convenience items that generate the most profit.

SETTLEMENTS
Tobacco, Cars and Implants
 
Leading cigarette makers agreed to a $11.3 billion settlement of a smoking-related lawsuit brought by Florida officials and agreed to undertake a sweeping slate of public health moves there -- including tearing down billboards near schools and removing vending machines accessible to children -- regardless of the fate of the proposed national tobacco settlement. There was settlement news elsewhere, too: The Mitsubishi Motor Corporation of America said it had agreed to settle a sexual-harassment lawsuit with 27 women; terms were not disclosed. (Mitsubishi still faces a much larger suit filed by the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.) Dow Corning said that it was willing to pay $2.4 billion to settle the more than 300,000 claims that have been filed against it in regard to silicone breast implants. And H. Wayne Huizenga's Republic Industries, the nation's largest car dealership owner, reached a preliminary agreement with Toyota that would allow it to buy more Toyota dealerships. But Republic is still feuding in the courts with American Honda.
 
THE MARKETS
Bad Month for Blue Chips
 
Large-capitalization stocks in August turned in their worst monthly performance in seven years, with stocks like General Electric, Merck, McDonald's, Gillette and Coca-Cola sliding 10 percent or more. The Dow has lost 7.1 percent, and the S.& P. 500, 6 percent, since both reached record highs on Aug. 6. The Nasdaq held up better, falling just 2.6 percent in that time, while the Russell 2000 Index of small stocks rose 0.5 percent. Fidelity Investments, meanwhile, has decided to close its flagship Magellan fund to new investors. With $61 billion in assets, the fund, which was made famous by Peter Lynch, is roughly 50 percent larger than the next-biggest fund, Vanguard Index 500. Mr. Lynch's successors have found so large a ship tough to navigate. As of Sept. 30, the fund will accept new investments only from current shareholders or from participants in retirement programs that include Magellan as an investment option.
 
THE ECONOMY
The Boom Goes On
 
The economy grew at a robust 3.6 percent annual pace in the spring, far higher than the 2.2 percent rate estimated earlier, the Commerce Department reported. But even so, inflation remained subdued in the second quarter. And consumers, it seems, see few problems ahead. The Conference Board reported that its index of consumer confidence rose to 129.1 this month from 126.3 in July, bouncing back near the 28-year high seen in June. That confidence was reflected in consumer spending, which rose 0.8 percent in July, the most since 1.1 percent in January, even though personal income edged up only 0.1 percent.
 
WALL STREET TOURISM
Let's Ride the Roller Coaster!
 
Lower Manhattan is swarming with camera-carrying tourists, whose brightly colored T-shirts and shorts contrast vividly with the pin-striped suits and rep ties that otherwise abound in the financial district. They are making reservations weeks in advance to see the $140 billion in gold ingots stacked in the vault of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, posing for pictures in front of the big bronze bull on Broadway and lining up as early as 8 A.M. on weekdays to snag one of the 3,000 tickets given away to see the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Anyone know of any bargains on souvenir stocks?
 
DOCTORS
Cutting Back the Supply
 
Seeking to alleviate a growing glut of doctors, the Government agreed to expand nationwide a New York program that offers financial incentives to teaching hospitals to admit fewer doctors to their residency-training programs -- something like paying farmers not to grow crops. "Unlike most aspects of the free-enterprise system, an oversupply of doctors does not lead to more competition and less cost," said Chris Jennings, a senior White House health aide. "When you get more physicians, you get more medical testing and other costs that drive up the price of health care." And what do workers often do when they feel threatened? Vote to unionize. The Union of American Physicians and Dentists plans to join forces with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s second-largest affiliate.
 
READER'S DIGEST
Will Charities Suffer?
 
The Reader's Digest Association, suffering from a slump, cut its dividend, and institutions nationwide fear they will feel some pain. The New York City Opera is bracing for a possible loss of $1 million, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art is planning for a $6 million drop. Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia also fears a loss, as do many more organizations. Lila and DeWitt Wallace, the founders of the Reader's Digest, gave shares of their prosperous company to charitable foundations to benefit these and many more causes. But in recent years, the Digest's readership has aged, and its stock price has fallen.
 
CITY FOLK
Personalizing Urban Renewal
 
Richard L. Huber, the new president and chief executive of Aetna, is a Harvard-educated multimillionaire. But he lives in a Hartford neighborhood around the corner from a methadone clinic, a couple of blocks from homeless shelters and down the street from a crime-ridden housing project. He has bought almost a quarter of the buildings on his street, Charter Oak Place, and has embarked on a crusade to turn things around. Neighbors describe Mr. Huber and his wife, Roberta, as a two-person urban renewal team. But Mr. Huber disputes those who call him a bishop for the 90's, in a reference to the moniker given business executives a generation ago who helped run Hartford with a sense of noblesse oblige. The Hubers say they are city folk who would not think of living in the suburbs.
 
MERGERS
Banks, Drugs and Radio
 
Nationsbank agreed to acquire Barnett Banks for $15.5 billion, the largest bank merger in American history. The merger will pay Barnett shareholders $75.18 a share, a 37 percent premium to market, and create the nation's third-largest bank. Cardinal Health agreed to buy the Bergen Brunswig Corporation for $2.41 billion in stock and to assume $386 million of debt; the purchase -- at a premium price -- would create the nation's biggest drug wholesaler, with 31 percent of an annual $64 billion market. Bidding to become the nation's largest operator of radio stations, Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, the Dallas buyout firm, agreed to acquire SFX Broadcasting for $1.2 billion in cash and to assume SFX's $920 million of debt.
 
CIGARETTE SMUGGLING
Big Companies Deny a Role
 
The largest tobacco companies are selling billions of dollars of cigarettes each year to traders and dealers who funnel them into black markets in many countries, say law enforcement officials and participants in the trade. In the last decade, the worldwide volume of cigarette smuggling has tripled, as American brands in particular have enjoyed booming demand abroad, where taxes can be high on legal imports. The companies deny encouraging smuggling, but two sales managers for Brown & Williamson Tobacco pleaded guilty to aiding smugglers. Further, one of Europe's biggest cigarette traders, Michael Hanggi of Switzerland, said that he had been buying Winstons from R. J. Reynolds Tobacco for 15 years and had resold many of them to smugglers in Spain.

When Good News Is Bad For Politics

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"HOW sweet it is!" drawled V. Earl Dickinson, a state legislator from Mineral, Va. This November, unlike two years ago, and two years before that, Mr. Dickinson faces no opposition. In fact, in his 26 years in office, he has never seen voters so "really happy."
"I keep on going to the funerals, going to the weddings and showing up at all the different places," the 73-year-old Democrat said. "But the pressure is not there, so I can sit back." 
 Poodle skirts aren't back yet, but to hear it from incumbents, the happy, even carefree, circumstances of the Eisenhower era are: Profits are up. Unemployment is down. And, notwithstanding the stock market's gyrations, the news seems only to get better. Just last week, the Government reported that the economy grew at a much faster clip during the spring than anticipated.
But good times are not always good for American politics. Good times make for complacent incumbents. And they lead challengers, in their desperate hunt for issues, to engage in excesses that detract from legitimate criticisms of their opponents.
Make no mistake, it is hard to campaign amid prosperity. Ruth W. Messinger, who is expected to win the Democratic mayoral nomination in New York next week and then to challenge Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in November, knows that as well as anyone. Ms. Messinger last week raised the critical issue of decrepit and overcrowded public schools. But, straining for attention, she overreached in her first television commercial; it featured a staged scene of a class being taught in a crowded bathroom. Her efforts fell even flatter with the subsequent disclosure that for the first time in seven years, the city's schools had more new classroom spaces than new students.
The biggest beneficiaries of a thriving economy (besides the wealthy investors who helped bankroll the campaigns last year) are President Clinton and, by extension, Vice President Al Gore, who hopes to run in 2000 on the theme of prolonging the prosperity. The Republicans who control Congress are also well positioned if the economy holds. The longer voters are satisfied, the less incentive they have to upset the status quo.
What would Mr. Clinton's campaign theme have been in 1992 had he not seized on the gloom about the economy? Had the economy been in better shape, Mr. Clinton may have found himself in the predicament faced by Walter F. Mondale in his 1984 campaign against President Ronald Reagan -- that is, trying with no success to convince voters that they were living on the brink of "an economic Dunkirk."
In announcing last week that he would not run for Governor of Massachusetts next year, Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d demonstrated the difficulty of staking out issues when the economy is humming. Had he run, he said, a central tenet of his campaign would have been that "our economy is growing today, but we can't be so content with things as they are."
That hardly sounds like a rallying cry. But politicians are unaccustomed to straining for issues. For so long, they saw their role as diagnosing ills that face the nation -- from nuclear war to recession to welfare abuses -- and then fighting over remedies. Now, without galvanizing issues, people are becoming even more isolated from government, and elected officials face even less pressure to accomplish anything. Then, too, Americans are by nature nonideological, and they might have been exposed to an overload of ideology in the 1994 and 1996 campaigns.
Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, a Republican, said the public's interest in politics, including the Congressional fund-raising inquiry that resumes this week, is wearing thinner than ever. "Because of the economy, people are saying, 'I'm not afraid of losing my job,' " Mr. Thompson said. "So who wants to turn on their television and listen to a bunch of grown men argue over who was getting what money from the Chinese?"
The healthy economy made it easy for Congress and the President to agree to balance the budget, which now will make it all the harder for politicians to figure out what to talk about. For incumbents, it's not worrisome in the short run. "Politicians have all died and think they have gone to heaven," said Burdett A. Loomis, a political science professor at the University of Kansas. "Think of the allure of it: you can cut taxes. You can balance the budget. You don't have to cut Medicare."
But how do politicians present themselves now? The mood was ambivalent last weekend at a conference of Midwest Republicans in Indianapolis. Speaker Newt Gingrich drew cheers when he hailed the tax-cutting pact with Mr. Clinton. But hours later, former Vice President Dan Quayle was applauded by the same audience when he castigated the party for its role in the agreement.
While there are only a handful of elections in November, the traditional Labor Day kick-off seems particularly muted. In Virginia, the race for Governor is such a sleeper -- and both candidates seem to be mouthing such similar middle-of-the-road promises -- that a group of influential business executives has decided to sit out the race and focus on finding someone to run when the seat is open again in 2001.
The contest for Governor of New Jersey has focused on local issues like automobile insurance. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said she has been struck by the degree to which voters are concerned only about "things that impact their lives very directly."
 
Think Values
 Q. Whitfield Ayres, a Republican pollster in Atlanta, said many of his clients have the same refrain: "So what's next? What should Republicans do now?" Mr. Ayres is counseling them to artfully weave vague worries about moral values into more concrete issues like crime and education. The danger is that if social issues begin to replace the economic issues that have traditionally been the province of Republicans, that could undermine the party's efforts to appeal to independent-minded voters.
And elected officials who think they are so popular right now perhaps should not be overconfident. It could be that the Eisenhower-like boasts of "peace and prosperity" are ill-advised. If the economy falls flat, these same politicians could be punished at the polls for presiding over a downturn.
"I don't think people are going to swallow the 'Happy Days Are Here Again' argument forever," said Michael S. Lewis-Beck, a political scientist at the University of Iowa. "They have to send kids to college and to pay for mortgages."
But, at least for now, most politicians are not about to try to convince people that things are not as good as they may think. Just look at a poll conducted last month by CBS News: A whopping 73 percent of Americans rated the economy as in very good or fairly good shape.
