HEADLINE: Airline Woe: More Seats Than Fliers

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Nov. 30

 BODY:
As many as half the nation's airline seats could be on carriers operating under the protection of bankruptcy courts within a few months if high fuel costs, falling revenues and fare discounting persist, according to Robert L. Crandall, chairman and chief executive of American Airlines.
"The airline industry in the United States today is literally going broke," Mr. Crandall, who heads the nation's largest airline, told reporters Thursday night at a dinner meeting in Dallas. "We have too many seats chasing too few customers." 
 In an interview, Mr. Crandall said the nation appeared to be heading into a recession that could be as severe as the worst economic downturn since World War II, the 16-month slide in 1981-82.
Mr. Crandall declined to identify the weakest carriers, but industry analysts have said that Pan American World Airways and Trans World Airlines might be forced to seek court protection from creditors if the industry's daunting troubles extend through the winter. Eastern Airlines is already operating in a bankruptcy reorganization.
Mr. Crandall said he was repeating statements made by top executives of several of the nation's airlines to Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner at a private meeting earlier this month in Washington. The industry is expected to lose more than $1 billion in the fourth quarter, and if war erupted in the Persian Gulf, it would face higher losses, Mr. Crandall said.
 
 Competition Could Worsen
 Not only would jet fuel prices soar, but pilots and aircraft would be drawn into the military effort, he said, including 10 of American's wide-body, long-range planes.
If there is a new wave of failures and consolidations, many analysts say, the likely survivors would be American, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines. With competition eliminated, they could raise fares.
However, Mr. Crandall said that "competition could be even more intense" if only a few domestic carriers remained, because the bankrupt carriers might be reinvigorated by new investors, including foreign airlines, if Congress allowed it.
"I'm not at all sure that the long-run implications of multiple failures" in the airline industry "are good for American, or United, or Delta or any of the big survivors," he said, suggesting "oppressive regulation" might ensue. "I'm not sure what the political or economic reaction is going to be," he added.
For now, American has troubles that Mr. Crandall said could result in a fourth-quarter loss large enough to erase the profits of $175.5 million it recorded in the first nine months of the year. It paid $1.12 a gallon for jet fuel this week, compared with 59 cents last July. At that level, American's fuel costs would increase by $1.5 billion over 12 months.
The 2-for-1 fare discounting that swept the industry earlier this month "is imposing terrible losses on us," Mr. Crandall said.

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators In 4th Drop

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
The Government index intended to forecast the economy fell by 1.2 percent in October, the Commerce Department reported today. The drop extended a downturn that started this summer to the point where it now meets a rule-of-thumb test for signaling a recession.
The October decline, combined with a revision into negative territory for July, means that the index of leading indicators has now fallen for four straight months. Analysts often take three straight declines to mean the economy is turning down. 
 "It reinforces the view that the economy has entered at least a mild recession," said Darwin L. Beck, an economist for the First Boston Corporation.
 
 Little New Information
 Since practically all the components of the index have been previously published, today's report provided little new information and financial markets, accurately anticipating the outcome, showed no noticeable reaction early in the day, but rallied after President Bush offered to negotiate with Iraq.
Economists further cautioned that while the index rarely missed a recession, it sometimes predicted recessions that did not occur. One glaring example was the four-month drop between October 1987, when the stock market crashed, and January 1988.
On that occasion, the drop totaled 2.9 percent. The current decline, also four months, works out to 3.1 percent.
 
 Longest Peacetime Expansion
 Assuming that the current signal proves valid -- even the Federal Reserve's chief, Alan Greenspan, now describes the economy as in a "meaningful downturn" -- this would be the end of an expansion that began in late 1982, the longest peacetime expansion on record.
If there is no recession, the economy will tie its record 1961-69 expansion, which was spurred by spending for the Vietnam War, in October 1991.
A companion index of coincident indicators, which measure current economic activity, fell 1 percent in October after a drop of eight-tenths of 1 percent in September. The September decline was revised downward from an initial decline of four-tenths of 1 percent. This was the fourth straight decline in the coincident index, the first time this has happened since 1982.
 
 Lagging Indicators Ease
 Meanwhile, the index of lagging indicators, those that tend to move only after the economy has changed direction, eased three-tenths of 1 percent in October.
Eight of the 11 leading index components contributed to the decline, paced by a drop in the University of Michigan's survey of consumer expectations. The other negative forces, in order of impact, were a rise in the average weekly initial claims for state unemployment insurance, a shrinkage in the length of the average workweek, a decline in building permits, a lower M-2 money supply, a drop in stock prices as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a statistical decline in prices of materials particularly sensitive to changes in the business cycle and a speed-up in deliveries by corporate suppliers.
Three components rose, reflecting higher new orders for consumer goods and materials, higher contracts and orders for plant and equipment and a statistical rise in factories' unfilled oders for durable goods.
 
 'Statistical' Rise Shown
 Some components are calculated by the Commerce Department on a moving-average basis over lengthy periods so they sometimes show a "statistical" rise, say, even though the figures fall for the latest month.
An alternative predictor of the course of the economy, the ratio of the coincident index to the lagging index, fell to 1.115 during October from 1.220 in September, a second straight decline.
A private forecasting index maintained by Safian Investment Research of White Plains dropped 1.85 percent in October, its fifth straight decline and the biggest since October 1987. Fifteen of its 23 components fell, seven rose and one was unchanged.
The leading index of service sector activity compiled by the Columbia Business School's Center for International Business Cycle Research dropped to 155.5 in October from 156.9 in September, with its annualized growth rate turning negative at a rate of 1.3 percent.
 
 'Clear, Classical Signs'
 The United States Chamber of Commerce said that today's figures reflected "clear, classical signs" of a recession. The coincident indicators, falling by ever larger amounts, show that a recession has already begun, said William K. MacReynolds, the chamber's forecasting director. He noted that the leading indicators declining most in October involved the consumer, who accounts for two-thirds of the economy.
"This all shows that the overall economy is declining rapidly, following declines in the housing and construction industries and poor performance in the industrial sector," he said. "Predictions that the recession will be short-lived are based more on wishful thinking than sound economic analysis."

HEADLINE: Your Money;
Self-Directed Retirement Plans

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
In increasing numbers Americans are being given the opportunity to control their own destiny through self-directed retirement plans, not only I.R.A.'s and Keogh plans for the self-employed, but also employer-sponsored 401(k) plans that offer a number of investment options. Typically participants can change their investment mix in December, and the right choice now can make a considerable difference at retirement time.
"Many small companies no longer offer pension plans," said Charles H. Salisbury Jr., managing director of T. Rowe Price Associates, the Baltimore-based investment-management and mutual fund organization. "They do offer defined-contribution plans" in which the employee chooses how much is to be set aside in tax-deferred retirement accounts, he added. 
 Data from the Social Security Administration show that the percentage of privately employed workers covered by employer-financed pension plans seems to have peaked. The portion rose from about 25 percent in the early 1950's to 50 percent in 1979, but fell back to 46 percent in 1988.
To the employee this is a two-edged sword. It can mean that many are without the benefit of professional pension managers, although often the options include professionally managed mutual funds. The positive aspect is that it can also mean greater long-term rewards for those who are disciplined about putting money into the plans and taking time and effort in managing their accounts.
The most popular investment choice for employees' funds is a guaranteed investment contract issued by an insurance company or a similar contract issued by a bank. These contracts earn a guaranteed rate of interest, generally a bit higher than short-term money market instruments. Some 60 to 75 percent of employees' own money is in guaranteed investment contracts, retirement experts say.
Other popular investment choices include: short-term Treasury or money-market funds, employer stock, Government bonds or other fixed-income securities, balanced mutual funds and equity funds. In the majority of 401(k) plans employers match employee contributions to some extent, mostly in the company's stock.
Donald R. Levy, a lawyer and consultant on retirement and benefit plans for Maxwell Macmillan, cited a number of reasons that employees choose guaranteed investment contracts. "Basically, the employee wants to be sure not to lose his or her own capital," he said.
Nor is this employee conservatism wrong in Mr. Levy's opinion. "I would favor G.I.C.'s over bond funds because bonds can fluctuate in value." he said. "Employees should consider putting a goodpart in G.I.C.'s -- they're a good investment -- and for balance, consider equities and bonds." How much to put in each will vary.
The first consideration, Mr. Levy said, is what the employer is putting in. Other considerations include the investment mix of any other retirement accounts that the person and his or her spouse have and their age and risk tolerance.
Mr. Salisbury argues that younger employees in particular should "accept more volatility in the earlier years to build up more savings."
"A 28-year-old or a 30-year-old should not have most of their money in guaranteed investment contracts," he said, adding, "Buy stocks now when they are cheap." During eight postwar crises including the Korean War, President Kennedy's confrontation with U.S. Steel, President Nixon's resignation and the 1987 crash, he noted, stock prices tumbled, but in each case within six months to a year they recovered substantially, in many cases more than making up what they lost. And over the long term, equities have outperformed other investments.
As people get older, they can shift more money into fixed income, he said, recommending 10 percent in fixed income for every decade of age.
One way people can make their own determinations of how much to set aside and how to invest it is with a retirement planning kit that T. Rowe Price offers free to those who request it by calling 1-800-638-5660. It includes a workbook developed with Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm, with worksheets, and booklets on strategy and mutual funds.
Another source of advice is the Price Waterhouse Retirement Planning Adviser, recently published by Pocket Books at $5.50. George E. L. Barbee, executive director of personal financial services for Price Waterhouse, advises people to make the maximum contribution possible to 401(k) plans both this year and next -- that's $7,979 this year -- "especially if there's a match."

HEADLINE: Prices Paid to Farmers Down 0.7% in November

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Prices that farmers get for raw products declined by seven-tenths of 1 percent from October to November, leaving the overall index below its level a year earlier for the first time in 14 months, the Agriculture Department said today.
Lower prices were reported for hogs, milk, soybeans and corn, although higher prices for oranges, lettuce and strawberries helped soften the decline in other commodities.
"Wool was at the lowest price level since January of 1986," the department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its preliminary report. "Milk moved to the lowest level since July of 1989."
The November soybean price was the lowest in three years, the report said, and the farm price of wheat was the lowest since August 1987. Corn prices continued down, following a trend begun in July.
 
 Hog Prices Down Sharply
 Hog prices, which had moved higher in October, dropped off sharply in November.
But some increases were reported. Steer and heifer prices set another record, up 1 percent from the previous high in October. Peanut prices at the farm were the highest since January 1981
Most prices are mid-November averages that will be revised next month. For example, the latest report showed October prices declined by 1.4 percent from September instead of the drop of seven-tenths of 1 percent indicated a month ago.
No new figures were released to show how much farmers pay to meet expenses. Those are adjusted quarterly. The previous adjustment, announced in October, showed farm expenses jumped an average of 2.2 percent from July, with the index 5.6 percent above the October 1989 level. Officials attributed most of that quarterly increase, the sharpest since January 1982, to rising fuel prices.
 
 Larger Output Expected
 This week department economists forecast that 1991 consumer food prices will climb an average of 2 percent to 5 percent, compared with a 6 percent increase in 1990. Larger output of some major commodities is expected to help cool the price climb.
Based on the preliminary figures, the November price index for all crops was up 1.7 percent from October but averaged 3.9 percent less than a year earlier.
The November index for livestock and products was down 2.9 percent from October but still averaged six-tenths of 1 percent more than in November 1989.
Milk prices, reflecting stepped-up production, dropped 40 cents from October to November, to $12.80 for 100 pounds. The November price was down $2.80 from a year earlier.
The all-fruit price index in November was up 12 percent from October and was unchanged from the November 1989 average.
Commercial vegetables rose 13 percent from October and 32 percent from November 1989.

Dollar and Gold Are Down As Bush Eases War Fears

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The value of the dollar and the price of gold fell yesterday after President Bush offered to negotiate with Iraq, defusing some worries about the Middle East crisis. At a news conference, Mr. Bush invited the Foreign Minister of Iraq to come to Washington, and the President offered to send Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to Baghdad to discuss ways to end the four-month standoff.
The dollar, historically a safe haven for investors during international strife, surged after the United Nations Security Council voted late Thursday to allow the use of military force if Iraq does not withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 15. But Mr. Bush's comments yesterday eased some fears about the conflict, and the dollar sank, dealers said. 
 Gold, also seen as a safe investment in times of turmoil, retreated sharply. In New York, an ounce of gold fell $5.60 on the Commodity Exchange to close at $383.30, and the Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $382.00, down $5.00.
Earl I. Johnson, an assistant vice president with Harris Trust and Company in Chicago, said the dollar could not sustain its gains because of the weakening American economy and expectations that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates to stimulate business activity.
Lower interest rates would tend to depress the value of the dollar because the lower yields would make American investments less attractive to foreigners and decrease the demand for dollars to buy American securities.
The dollar was little changed against the British pound in New York, and closed up against the pound in London. The pound also faces interest-rate problems of its own as the new Government is expected to push Britain's rates lower.
The pound edged down to $1.9430 in New York, from $1.9435 late Thursday. In London, the pound was quoted at $1.9440 in London, compared with $1.9485 late Thursday.
The dollar fell to 132.50 Japanese yen in New York, from 133.25 on Thursday. In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 132.75 yen, from 130.15 yen Thursday, and in London, it fell to 133.05 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with the late Thursday prices, included: 1.5020 German marks, down from 1.5040; 1.2770 Swiss francs, down from 1.2805; 5.0580 French francs, down from 5.0775; 1,125.25 Italian lire, down from 1,129.50, and 1.16475 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16445.
In London trading, the bid for an ounce of gold was $382.25, down from $386.75 late Thursday. In Zurich, the bid was $385, down from $386.75 late Thursday. In Hong Kong, where trading ended before Mr. Bush's news conference, gold rose 18 cents and closed at $385.01.

Excerpts From President's News Conference on Crisis in Gulf

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference yesterday in Washington, as recorded by The New York Times:

 	 	 	 		OPENING STATEMENT	 	 	I have a statement -- an opening statement -- that is a little longer than normal and I'd ask your indulgence, and then I will be glad to respond to questions.
We're in the gulf because the world must not and cannot reward aggression. And we're there because our vital interests are at stake. And we're in the gulf because of the brutality of Saddam Hussein.
We're dealing with a dangerous dictator all too willing to use force, who has weapons of mass destruction and is seeking new ones and who desires to control one of the world's key resources -- all at a time in history when the rules of the post-cold-war world are being written.
 
 Objectives of U.S.
 Our objectives remain what they were since the outset. We seek Iraq's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait. We seek the restoration of Kuwait's legitimate Government. We seek the release of all hostages and the free functioning of all embassies. And we seek the stability and security of this critical region of the world.
We are not alone in these goals and objectives. The United Nations, invigorated with a new sense of purpose, is in full agreement. The United Nations Security Council has endorsed 12 resolutions to condemn Iraq's unprovoked invasion and occupation of Kuwait, implement tough economic sanctions to stop all trade in and out of Iraq and authorize the use of force to compel Saddam to comply.
Saddam Hussein has tried every way he knows how to make this a fight between Iraq and the United States, and clearly he has failed.
Forces of 26 other nations are standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our troops in the gulf. The fact is that it is not the United States against Iraq. It is Iraq against the world. And there's never been a clearer demonstration of a world united against appeasement and aggression.
Yesterday's United Nations Security Council resolution was historic. Once again the Security Council has enhanced the legitimate peacekeeping function of the United Nations. Until yesterday, Saddam may not have understood what he's up against in terms of world opinion. And I'm hopeful that now he will realize that he must leave Kuwait immediately.
I'm continually asked how effective are the U.N. sanctions -- those put into effect on Aug. 6. And I don't know the answer to that question. Clearly the sanctions are having some effect. But I can't tell you that the sanctions alone will get the job done. And thus I welcome yesterday's United Nations action.
The fledgling democracies in Eastern Europe are being severely damaged by the economic effects of Saddam's actions. The developing countries of Africa and in our hemisphere are being victimized by this dictator's rape of his neighbor Kuwait.
 
 Fragile Economies in Trouble
 Those who feel that there is no downside to waiting months and months must consider the devastating damage being done every day to the fragile economies of those countries that can afford it the least.
As chairman Alan Greenspan [of the Federal Reserve Board] testified just the other day, the increase in oil prices resulting directly from Saddam's invasion is hurting our country too. And our economy, as I said the other day, is at best in a serious slowdown, and if uncertainty remains in the energy markets, the slowdown will get worse.
I've spelled out once again our reasons for sending troops to the gulf. Let me tell you the things that concern me most:
First, I put the immorality of the invasion of Kuwait itself. No nation should rape, pillage and brutalize its neighbor. No nation should be able to wipe a member state of the United Nations and the Arab League off the face of the earth.
And I'm deeply concerned about all the hostages, innocent people held against their will in direct contravention of international law. And then there's this cynical and brutal policy of forcing people to beg for their release, parceling out human lives to families and traveling emissaries like so much chattel.
And I'm deeply concerned about our own Embassy in Kuwait. The flag is still flying there. A handful of beleaguered Americans remain inside the Embassy unable to come and go. This treatment of our Embassy violates every civilized principle of diplomacy. And it demeans our people. It demeans our country. And I am determined that this Embassy, as called for under Security Council Resolution 674, be fully replenished and our people free to come home. What kind of precedent will these actions set for the future if Saddam's violation of international law goes unchallenged?
I'm also deeply concerned about the future of Kuwait itself. The tales of rape and assassination, of cold-blooded murder and rampant looting, are almost beyond belief. The whole civilized world must unite and say this kind of treatmet of people must end and those who violated the Kuwaiti people must be brought to justice.
 
Potential Nuclear Threat
 I'm deeply concerned about Saddam's efforts to acquire nuclear weapons. Imagine his ability to blackmail his neighbors should he possess a nuclear device. We've seen him use chemical weapons on his own people. We've seen him take his own country -- one that should be wealthy and prosperous -- and turn it into a poor country, all because of insatiable appetite for military equipment and conquest.
I've been asked why I ordered more troops to the gulf. I remain hopeful that we can achieve a peaceful solution to this crisis, but if force is required, we and the other 26 countries who have troops in the area will have enough power to get the job done.
In our country, I know that there are fears about another Vietnam. Let me assure you: should military action be required, this will not be another Vietnam; this will not be a protracted, drawn-out war. The forces arrayed are different, the opposition is different, the resupply of Saddam's military would be very different, the countries united against him in the United Nations are different, the topography of Kuwait is different and the motivation of our all-volunteer force is superb.
I want peace. I want peace, not war. But if there must be war, we will not permit our troops to have their hands tied behind their backs, and I pledge to you there will not be any murky ending. If one American soldier has to go into battle, that soldier will have enough force behind him to win, and then get out as soon as possible, as soon as the U.N. objectives have been achieved.
I will never, ever agree to a halfway effort. Let me repeat: we have no argument with the people of Iraq. Indeed, we've only friendship for the people there. And further, I repeat that we have no desire to keep one single American soldier in the gulf a single day longer than is necessary to achieve the objectives set out above.
No one wants to see a peaceful solution to this crisis more than I do, and at the same time, no one is more determined than I am to see Saddam's aggression reversed.
 
 'Time Is Running Out'
 And lastly, people now caution patience. The United States and the entire world have been patient. I will continue to be patient. But yesterday's U.N. resolution, the 13th by the Security Council, properly says to Saddam Hussein: time is running out. You must leave Kuwait, and we've given you time to do just exactly that.
Many people have talked directly to Saddam Hussein, and to his Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz. All have been frustrated by Iraq's ironclad insistence that it will not leave Kuwait. However, to go the extra mile for peace, I will issue an invitation to Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz to come to Washington, at a mutually convenient time during the latter part of the week of Dec. 10, to meet with me. And I'll invite ambassadors of several of our coalition partners in the gulf to join me at that meeting.
In addition, I'm asking Secretary Jim Baker to go to Baghdad to see Saddam Hussein, and I will suggest to Iraq's President that he receive the Secretary of State at a mutually convenient time between Dec. 15 and Jan. 15 of next year. Within the mandate -- within the mandate of the United Nations resolutions -- I will be prepared, and so will Secretary Baker, to discuss all aspects of the gulf crisis.
However, to be very clear about these efforts to exhaust all means for achieving a political and diplomatic solution, I am not suggesting discussions that will result in anything less than Iraq's complete withdrawal from Kuwait, restoration of Kuwait's legitimate Government and freedom for all hostages.
Thank you very much, and I will be glad to respond to a few questions.

 	 	 		QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS	 	
 
A Deadline for War?
 Q. Mr. President, now that you have the clear-cut U.N. resolution on use of force, doesn't that force you into a position -- if these talks between the Secretary of State break down, doesn't this force you into the position of having to use force on Jan. 15 if Saddam Hussein hasn't left, and if not, won't we be seen as the one that blinked first?
A. No, the date was not a date at which point force had to be used.
Q. If I could just follow up with another question. Are you going to ask Congress for approval of this resolution? Would you like to see Congress pass the same kind of resolution as the U.N.?
A. I'd love to see Congress pass a resolution enthusiastically endorsing what the United Nations has done, yes. We're in consultation on that and I have no plans to call a special session. I'm not opposed to it, but we're involved in consultations right now. I've talked to several members of Congress, I've talked to leaders in the House, I've talked to several on the Republican side and Democratic side in the Senate. And I want to be sure that these consultations are complete.
Some feel a lame-duck session is not good, that the new members should have a right to have a say. Others feel that we ought to move right now. The Congress, as you know, in their adjournment resolution, had a provision in there that they could come back and take this up. They are a coequal branch of government, they can do that if they want to. But I -- we will continue our consultations. . . .
 
 Price of Victory
Q. Mr. President, you say you're confident that American troops will prevail against Saddam if called upon.
A. Oh, absolutely.
Q. At what price? I mean --
A. Well, I can't give you that. I can't give you that, any figures, of course. But I can say that the movement of this additional force safeguards the lives of every American and every one of our allies in the gulf.
Q. Mr. President, in recent days, senior members of the Administration have emphatically rejected the idea of any special emissaries or diplomatic envoys to or from Iraq to discuss this, on your part. What changed your mind, sir?
A. The United Nations resolution, I think, has a good chance of making Saddam Hussein understand what it is he's up against. I have not felt that he got the message. I hope this will do it. But I am convinced that these two direct meetings that I've discussed here will guarantee to all the people of the world -- certainly to the American people -- that Saddam Hussein not misunderstand, not misinterpret. . . .
Q. You indicate that this date is not actually a deadline for the use of force, merely a date after which force would be permissible. How do you avoid the impression, should that day come and go without military action, that the U.S.-led coalition has in fact blinked?
A. Well, we've got to look at events at the time. But I don't think there will ever be a perception that the United States is going to blink in this situation. That's why I had some of the words in this statement that I had. Yes?
 
 Quest for Mideast Stability
Q. Mr. President, you've just spoken about the weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons, and also that one of your goals is to try to reach stability in the region. Can you reach stability in the region with Saddam Hussein in power?
A. I think most countries, members of the United Nations, feel that there have to be some safeguards put into effect in terms of guaranteeing the security and stability of the gulf. And so I would think that the status quo ante will not be enough, and I think there will be -- there are sanctions in place now, and I think it would be very proper to discuss what those safeguards should be after there has been a total compliance with the United Nations resolutions. . . .
Q. Mr. President, I want to ask if your comments about the Kuwaiti Embassy -- whether it's fair to conclude, based on those, that you will neither close the Embassy nor permit those Americans to be starved out?
A. I will not say exactly what I will do or exactly what I won't do. There is a very interesting report that we got in this morning saying that some Iraqis showed up at the Kuwaiti Embassy -- our Embassy in Kuwait -- and had delivered fruit, vegetables and a case of Iraqi cigarettes to Embassy Kuwait. And apparently there's going to be another delivery tomorrow, including soda pop. And they asked what medical supplies were required. And it doesn't say that. And the Embassy will apparently provide a list tomorrow. And the electricity is still cut off. So this is kind of an interesting little development. But I -- somebody said to me: Well, hy, what about if there's some provocation? They asked me in the leadership meeting. I said consider me provoked when it comes to the United States Embassy. Consider me provoked when I see Americans without proper food and medical equipment.
Q. May I follow up? Do you take it from that communique that you received there that the Iraqis have the message and want to eliminate that as a potential tripwire?
A. I don't know. It's too early -- it's the best question, right on target, one that we were discussing inside. And I -- let's try to be optimistic and say this is -- this could be a positive sign. But it's so far short of compliance with international law that I can't be rejoicing. But it is a very interesting development. . . .
 
 Criticism in Congress
Q. You've been getting some pretty negative comments up on the Hill at these hearings that have been held this week. Now this morning you said this would not be a long, protracted, Vietnam-type war. However, General Odom, the former head of the N.S.A., testified just this morning at the Senate Armed Services that in fact you have to be there for decades. Now presumably he means even after military combat. We'd have to have people in place there as part of a peacekeeping force. Do you see our commitment there extend that far?
A. No I don't.
Q. May I ask something else? Al Gore, yesterday, takes issue with your comments and the comments of some of your aides, such as Brent Scowcroft, about Saddam being able to churn out a nuclear weapon in a matter of months. Gore, who's had some private briefings, apparently, from some of your people, indicates that your Administration statements are misleading.
A. I disagree with the Senator. And if he wants to gamble on the future about the construction of atomic weapons by Saddam Hussein, I don't. And I know what the intelligence says. Every bit of it. And I can't share it, obviously, because we don't comment on intelligence matters. But I am concerned. . . .
 
 Dependability of Allies
Q. Of those 26 nations that you list in the area, how many of those are equally committed to offensive action other than just defensive action?
A. I can't give you the answer to that, because I don't really know. But I'd expect that there is enthusiasm in all quarters of those countries for the U.N. action that was taken yesterday.
Q. With all respect, shouldn't you know how many would follow your troops into battle?
A. I know that what I said is true about the -- if we have to go into battle, and I'm satisfied I know enough about that. I went over in detail -- as you might well imagine a President should, because I have the responsibility as commander in chief -- what might happen if we have to use force. I repeat, I hope we'll never have to have one single shot fired in anger. Yes?
Q. Iraq has been constantly calling for dialogue. Aren't you concerned that those two missions, Tariq Aziz and James Baker, will lead Saddam Hussein to claim that the U.S. is showing signs of weakness? . . .
A. No, I'm not. I'm concerned some might say this is an ultimatum, in which -- all it is is an effort to make sure that he understands the commitment of the United States, that he understands that anything that is done must be done inside the confines of the United Nations resolutions that have been passed, that there will be no contingency, there can be no face-saving. This is not what this is about. This is to be sure that he understands how strongly the President of the United States feels about implementing to a T, without concession, the United Nations position.
And some have told me that he's not getting the message of how determined we are. And I can't think of any better way to do it, at this juncture, in the wake of the U.N. resolution, than this face-to-face meeting. I'm not sure he'll agree to it. . . .
Q. The Soviet Union did indeed vote on our side as far as the resolution, allowing force if it's necessary. Are we going to offer the Soviet Union any compromise on export credits? As you know, there's some concern that they think there's a de facto grain embargo going on because we won't offer export credits in their very needy time.
A. The matters are totally separate and unrelated, but I am concerned about this. And I've talked about, with Mr. Gorbachev, of a willingness to entertain proposals for food -- particularly if the reports prove to be accurate in terms of the severe winter and the hardship that this will inflict on the Soviet people.
 
 Conference on Mideast
Q. Mr. President, you -- Arab experts suggest that Saddam Hussein has hinted in his remarks that he would like to have some sort of deal, but he wouldn't necessarily hold to his demands. Now you're saying you're willing to meet with him. Are you willing to offer him anything in these meetings in return for a pullout, such as a conference on the Middle East?
A. No. Those two items are totally separate. We've made that very very clear. And what I have said is that this will be -- these discussions will be done within the U.N. mandate. . . .
Q. Mr. President, you mentioned the damage that higher oil prices are doing to the world economy. Should Saudi Arabia and other producers share more of their windfall?
A. I think they're doing a pretty good job in underwriting the costs to various countries and helping third-party countries that are -- that have been hurt by all of this. But I think everybody should go the extra mile to help others. . . .
Q. . . . Should Saudi Arabia have a military draft?
A. That's for the Saudi Arabians to decide. I don't think the United States needs one, incidentally. . . .
 
 Risking American Lives
Q. Mr. President, if you ultimately feel that you have to ask Americans to support the use of force, what that, of course, means is that you have to ask some parents to give up the lives of their children.
A. I know it.
Q. And what I was wondering was, we all know how important your children are to you. Do you feel that this issue is important enough to you that you could conceive of giving up one of their lives for it?
A. You know, Maureen, you've put your -- you put your finger on a very difficult question. People say to me: How many lives? How many lives can you expend? Each one's precious. And I don't want to reminisce, but I've been there. I know what it's like to have fallen comrades and see young kids die in battle. And it's only the President that should be asked to make the decision. Is it worth it? How many lives is it worth? Is it worth it to commit one life -- put one life in harm's way -- to achieve these objectives? And that's why I want to get a peaceful resolution to this question. You ought to read my mail. It is so heart-moving. Supportive and yet: "Please bring my kid home. Please bring my husband home." And it's a tough question. But a President has to make the right decision. And these are worldwide principles of moral importance. And I will do my level best to bring those kids home without one single shot fired in anger. And if a shot is fired in anger, I want to guarantee each person that their kid, whose life is in harm's way, will have the maximum support, will have the best chance to come home alive and will be backed up to the hilt. And that's why -- it's because of that question that weighs on my mind I added that language this morning about how this will not be a Vietnam. They can criticize me for moving force, and if we got one kid that's apt to be in harm's way, I want him backed up to the hilt by American firepower and others as well. And that's why I'm working as hard as I am, not only to hold this coalition together but to strengthen it. . . . And if force has to be used, the best way to safeguard lives is to see that you got the best and you're willing to use it. . . .

Hartford Bank In Revamping

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Nov. 30 (AP)

 BODY:
Society for Savings said today that it would sell about $1.6 billion worth of assets in a restructuring that will result in a $52 million loss for the year and the elimination of 140 jobs.
Society for Savings Bancorp Inc., the bank's parent company, said the bank needed to jettison about $130 million in non- performing commercial real estate loans and other assets to reduce expenses and remain competitive as New England's economy deteriorated.
The bank will also increase its reserve fund to $103.5 million, up from the $49.5 million as of Sept. 30.
Meanwhile, the parent company announced that Elliott Miller would retire as president and chief executive as of Jan. 1 after 12 years as president.
The projected 1990 loss includes a $58.6 million charge for severance payments and other restructuring expenses. The bank expects a fourth- quarter loss of $54.4 million.
The restructuring will take place in three stages in the next 13 months under a plan approved by the parent company's board of directors.

HEADLINE: Prices of Long-Term U.S. Issues Soar

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Plunging oil prices sent inflation-sensitive long-term Treasury bonds soaring yesterday. Shorter Treasury maturities, which are more responsive to moves by the Federal Reserve, posted much more modest gains. The drops in crude oil and byproduct prices came in response to hints of peace moves in the Persian Gulf crisis.
Largely as a result, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue maturing in August 2020, were offered late in the session at 103 28/32, up 1 2/32 on the day. This caused the yield to drop to 8.39 percent, from 8.48 percent the day before and 8.43 percent a week ago.
 
 10-Year Notes Also Climb
 The Treasury's 10-year long notes, which are compared with the "long bonds" of Japan and Germany, also soared. The 8.5 percent notes of November 2000 climbed 20/32, to 101 24/32, while the yield fell to 8.23 percent, from 8.27 percent a week ago. During the week, the yield on Japan's 10-year long bonds fell to 7.43 percent from 7.47 percent, but that on the comparable German maturity rose to 8.82 percent from 8.79 percent. 
 Meanwhile, the Treasury's new two-year notes, auctioned last Tuesday, rose by 4/32, to 99 24/32, to yield 7.51 percent, while the five-year notes sold on Wednesday increased by 9/32, at 99 26/32, for a yield of 7.91 percent.
Also helping the longer Treasury coupon issues was the fourth consecutive monthly decline in the Government's index of leading economic indicators, the latest evidence of a deteriorating economy. Also benefiting the fixed-income debt market, which thrives on both negative economic news and lessened inflationary pressures, was the further decline in prices of basic commodities.
The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 basic farm and industrial raw materials futures, with 1967 eaqual to 100, fell 1.46, to 223.26, its lowest level since Oct. 10, 1989, when it stood at 222.98.
Reports that President Bush had invited Iraq's Foreign Minister to come to Washington for talks and that the besieged American Embassy in Kuwait had received food from Iraqis sparked the plunges in oil and bond yields.
 
 Spur to Short Covering
 "The hints of peace moves caused oil prices to really start to fall around midday and this in turn prompted short covering, especially when prices broke through upward technical chart points," said Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Inc.
As yields on long-term Treasury bonds fell more than short-term rates, it flattened the yield curve further and added to the market's positive mood, Mr. Ricchiuto added. "The shorter Treasury issues, which are far more responsive to Fed moves, had been under pressure earlier in the week and did not participate in the rally," he said.
The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, surprised some dealers by indirectly adding $1 billion of reserves to the banking system before noon. The Fed's move came after it had effected a huge infusion of reserves on Thursday by arranging four-day repurchase agreements.
One explanation for the Fed's addition of reserves was that some dealers who participated in the four-day repos wanted their collateral back. Some dealers noted earlier in the week that the repo rates were not rewarding enough.
 
 Funds Rate Edges Up
 In any event, the Fed's addition of reserves did not prevent the key Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for temporary loans, from edging higher toward the close. After trading at 7.5 percent, which is perceived as the Fed's current target, for most of the day, the funds rate closed at 7 9/16 percent.
Meanwhile, the discount rate on Treasury bills, which are very sensitive to changes in the funds rate, declined. The 90-day bills dipped a basis point, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.03 percent; six-month bills fell two basis points, to 7.01 percent, and the one-year bills lost five basis points, at 6.84 percent.

American Troops in Desert Applaud the U.N. Vote

BYLINE: By JAMES LeMOYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: IN SAUDI ARABIA, Nov. 30

 BODY:
American servicemen here strongly applauded the United Nations vote authorizing the use of force against Iraq as a welcome, if sobering, definition of a mission that had begun to seem interminable.
"The sooner the better," declared Sgt. Maj. Roger Walker, the chief noncommissioned officer of the 52d Engineer Battalion now stationed far out in the desert. "I think it should be Jan. 1, not the 15th." 
 Pvt. Torica Johnson, 23 years old, also of the 52d Engineer Battalion, agreed, saying: "Let's do it now. Let's get it over with."
And Specialist 4 Timothy Fee, 21, a member of the 299th Engineer Battalion, alsodeep in the desert, commented: "Well, it's about time. It gives us something to work with."
 
Saudi Officials Hopeful
 Reflecting a new, openly public hard line, Saudi officials also welcomed the United Nations Security Council vote and said they hoped it would force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait or suffer defeat in a war that will come by March.
"The Iraqi leadership should now realize the determination of the world," said Adel al-Jubeir, a Saudi Government specialist on foreign affairs. "If war comes now, it will be a catastrophe that only Iraqi leaders will be responsible for."
Several American military men said the possibility of death raised by the United Nations vote authorizing war was less troubling than the prospect of endless waiting for a battle that does not materialize.
They said morale had suffered not because American troops do not want to fight, but because they fear they have been sent on an undefined mission that risks becoming prolonged and politically unpopular.
For such uniformed American men and women, the United Nations vote seems to set a deadline and offers a clear declaration that war will come sooner rather than later if Iraq does not withdraw from Kuwait.
"The vote is better than living with the unknown," said Air Force Tech. Sgt. Tim O'Quinn, 32, who spoke at an air base here. "That was the hardest part of the whole thing -- not knowing if something was going to happen."
 
'Being in Limbo' Worst
 Air Force Master Sgt. Tom Adams, also 32, added: "Yeah, that was the worst part -- being in limbo. This gives us time for us to get ready and for him to get out." He referring to the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein.
But Sergeant Adams said he does not think Mr. Hussein will withdraw from occupied Kuwait. He says he believes war is coming.
"He's hard-headed," he said. "I don't think he's going to back down."
Sergeant O'Quinn said he hoped the United Nations vote would speed the decision to go to war because he believes the longer Iraq has to prepare its defenses, the more casualties it will inflict on American forces.
"Waiting will give him a better chance to prepare," Sergeant O'Quinn said of Mr. Hussein. "More will die."
 
Concern About Congress
 Several servicemen and women expressed concern that Congress would now "politicize" military decision-making and unnecessarily delay a move to go to war.
"If the military is allowed to run this war, we'll win it," said a sergeant who asked not to be identified. "But we won't win if Congress tries to run it."
Army Pvt. Jerry Chambers, 20, from the 218th Field Artillery Battalion, said: "I say we should go ahead and do it now. We've given the man ample time to get out of Kuwait. If we wait now, he's going to think we're a bunch of pushovers."
Private Chambers, who deployed two months ago, said his wife gave birth to a boy, their first child, two and a half weeks ago. But he said he would still rather fight now than sit in the desert indefinitely.
 
Bush Critics Disputed
 Several servicemen said they did not agree with some members of Congress and critics of the Bush Administration's policy who have argued that American forces should remain deployed here, but not go to war for up to a year to allow the economic embargo against Iraq to take greater effect.
"They have no idea what it's like to sit in the desert," said an Army colonel who asked not to be identified. "I don't think the troops have any desire to be here that long."
Maj. Dave Monroe, 39, who is serving with the 212th Field Artillery Brigade, said of the United Nations vote, "It's just nice to have a date."
"Basically," he added, "everyone just sits around asking: When?"

HEADLINE: A Nickel More for Gasoline As U.S. Raises Its Fuel Tax

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
The cost of gasoline at the pump rises a nickel a gallon on Saturday as the recently enacted increase in the Federal motor fuel tax takes effect, and for motorists in some states the change is just a harbinger of increases to come.
Gasoline prices have sharply risen in recent months, to an average of $1.37 for a gallon of self-serve regular unleaded on Tuesday from $1.07 a gallon on Aug. 1, according to a survey by The Associated Press. And with the blessings of the Bush Administration and local transportation agencies, many states have recently raised their own gasoline taxes or will be actively considering such a move in the next year, state and Federal officials say. 
 Until now, the Federal Government has restricted gasoline tax revenue to paying for transportation programs, but it plans to use half of the income from this increase for general purposes. States typically use their taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel and gasohol to pay for highway construction and maintenance and mass transit.
 
Roadblocks to Increases
 The five-cent Federal increase in the excise tax, part of the deficit-cutting plan passed by Congress in October, is expected to add about $5 billion a year to the Treasury. It is to be collected at the pump and passed on fully and immediately by service stations. None of the other tax increases in the budget package take effect until Jan. 1.
The Administration has drafted legislation that would increase Federal highway spending from 1992 to 1996 but would require states to match the Federal grants with greater contributions of their own. Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner has repeatedly urged states to raise their fuel taxes for that purpose. The new Federal fuel tax level is 14.1 cents a gallon, and the average state tax is about 16 cents.
But at the moment, several factors make it hard for states to increase taxes. The economy is faltering, and fuel prices are unusually high because of the crisis in the Persian Gulf. Finally, many taxpayers are already smarting over the broad Federal tax increases enacted last month in an effort to slash the deficit.
"That is not going to make the climate any easier for states that want to raise their gas taxes," said Scott Mackey, a financial analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures.
"It is infinitely more difficult," said Franklin E. White, New York's state transportation commissioner. "I would never say never, but I would clearly say that it is much more difficult, and it complicates terribly the life of all the states."
 
Double Whammies
 This year New York altered its formula for taxing gasoline but left the basic 8-cent-a-gallon excise tax unchanged. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said early this year that he would like the tax increased, but the Legislature has resisted such proposals. Gasoline is also subject to New York state and local sales taxes and to a corporate gross receipts tax of 6.33 cents a gallon.
New Jersey has a relatively low 10.5 cent-a-gallon tax, and a draft of the state's energy plan that issued for public comment in October, discusses the possibility of increasing it. This could be difficult after an election that was widely interpreted as a rejection of high taxes.
But increases are definitely coming in some states.
Drivers in Massachusetts and Delaware will be among the first to pay a second round of tax increases hard on the heels of Saturday's increase. In Massachusetts, an increase of four cents effective on Jan. 1 will bring the state tax to 21 cents, following an increase from 11 to 17 cents that took effect in July. The tax in Delaware increases from 16 cents to 19 cents on Jan. 1.
 
Willing Californians
 In Massachusetts, a ballot initiative to roll back the gas tax and many other state taxes was resoundingly defeated in November.
Many officials believe that California's voter referendum in June approving an increase in the state's gas tax showed that voters would approve such increases if they believed that the money would be spent for important transportation programs. The measure doubles the state's gas tax to 18 cents over five years, beginning with an immediate increase of 5 cents.
In all, six states raised the tax per gallon for motor fuel in 1990, as against 19 states in 1989, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The six were Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Washington. The rate also rose this year in Connecticut, Kansas and Ohio because of laws already in place. In Washington state, the increase from 18 cents to 22 cents this year will be followed by another penny increase in April 1991.
But not all officials are confident of the voters' mood as they seek future increases.
 
Eye on the Gulf
 Missouri's state's transportation chief, Wayne Muri, says his state has the sixth-largest system of highways of all the states, one of the lowest state gas taxes at 11 cents a gallon, the nation's worst bridges, the fourth-highest rate of fuel consumption per driver and a citizenry overwhelmingly opposed to increased state gas taxes. The state also has a law requiring any such increase to be presented by the Legislature to the voters for direct approval. The most recent tax increase there, in 1987, was approved only after being defeated three times.
Yet Mr. Muir believes that the state ought to increase its tax to the levels of surrounding states, around 15 or 20 cents.
"A big factor, an almost an absolute factor, is what happens in Iraq and whether or not fuel comes down," he said. "There is no question fuel prices are artificially high. If that is resolved, and fuel prices come down, then we have a chance. If that doesn't happen then there is not a chance, and we are in great trouble."

BUSH OFFERS TO SEND BAKER ON A PEACE MISSION TO IRAQ, BUT VOWS RESOLVE IN A WAR;
SURPRISE OVERTURE

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he had invited Iraq's Foreign Minister to Washington and was ready to send Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to Baghdad in an attempt to find a peaceful solution to the Persian Gulf crisis. But he warned that if war came he would "never, ever agree to any halfway effort."
The President's unexpected overture to Baghdad, announced at a White House news conference, was welcomed by the Iraqi Ambassador to Paris, a close associate of President Saddam Hussein. There was no immediate response from Mr. Hussein. [Page 7.] 
 The President's action came only 24 hours after the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution authorizing member states to use force to oust Iraqi troops from Kuwait if they are not withdrawn by Jan. 15.
In a move that seemed to be driven by diplomatic as well as domestic political needs, Mr. Bush said he would be willing to send Mr. Baker to meet Mr. Hussein "at a mutually acceptable time" between Dec. 15 and Jan. 15. He invited Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, to meet him in Washington during the latter part of the week of Dec. 10, presumably for preliminary talks. [Excerpts from the news conference, page 6.]
 
'Positive Sign' From Iraqis
 Mr. Bush also disclosed that Iraqis unexpectedly appeared at the besieged American Embassy in Kuwait with fruit, vegetables and cigarettes -- a development he called "a positive sign." He also said he saw no need for a reinstitution of the draft, and indicated that he would not call Congress back into session soon because he was not sure it would be willing to pass a resolution endorsing his actions.
The President emphasized that Mr. Baker's journey "isn't a trip of concession" and pledged that the United States would not waver from the United Nations' repeated demands for Iraqi withdrawal, restoration of the Kuwaiti Government and release of all hostages. He said that "the best way to get that across is one-on-one, Baker looking him in the eye."
But he also said Mr. Baker would be willing "to discuss all aspects of the gulf crisis." Some students of the region suggested that the mere fact that Mr. Bush was ready to send such a high-level envoy -- not only the top American foreign-policy official but also the President's closest political associate -- might provide a key for breaking the deadlock in the region.
 
Possibility for Hussein
 Mr. Hussein, who has changed course suddenly in the past, might well seize upon the trip as the facing-saving symbol that he has sought, arguing that his invasion had accomplished a primary aim by forcing the United States to take account of his grievances.
In addition, the President's initiative went some way toward blunting Democratic calls on Capitol Hill for greater patience with economic sanctions, and toward meeting Soviet and French demands for further diplomatic efforts. European diplomats said, in fact, that they had been told that Soviet officials had insisted on something like the initiative announced today as a condition for their crucial backing in the Security Council on Thursday.
"Until now," said Judith Kipper, a Middle East scholar with the Brookings Institution, "the United States has argued that any face-saving was a reward, and hence impermissible, while the Soviets and most of the Europeans have argued that since we can't give anything on substance, we needed to give him a symbol. Now Bush has come around, and I think he'll have support approaching 100 percent if this fails and he decides he has to go to war."
 
Fear of Another Vietnam
 Finally, the Baker mission may help to convince a doubtful electorate that Mr. Bush is not rushing heedlessly into war. He tried, at his news conference, to assuage another fear that, according to opinion polls, grips many Americans: the deep-seated fear of another lengthy, costly, indecisive conflict like the one in Vietnam.
The President argued that the terrain, the enemy, the weapons and the geopolitical situation in the gulf all differed from those in Vietnam, and he added passionately: "This will not be another Vietnam. This will not be a protracted, drawn-out war."
Abdul Razzak al-Hashimi, the Iraqi ambassador to Paris, gave the first official reaction for his country to the President's surprise offers.
"This is a very important step," he said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation, "and we hope it is going to achieve what we are all striving for -- negotiations instead of beating the drums of war. I consider it very good news. We are not accepting negotiations with preconditions, but let's be optimistic and see what Mr. Baker has in mind."
 
Support Among Lawmakers
 On Capitol Hill, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, who have been two of Mr. Bush's leading Democratic critics, both said the President had done the right thing by "using yeterday's U.N. vote as an opportunity for diplomacy," as Mr. Gephardt put it. Other lawmakers of both parties agreed.
"But we should be clear about one thing," Mr. Kennedy said. "The President is going an additional mile, but going the true extra mile means giving sanctions adequate time to work. The Jan. 15 fuse for war is still lit, and the current peace initiative must not be allowed to divert the nation's attention from that fact."
Although, as Mr. Bush noted, Congress has the right to call itself back into session, much of the steam behind doing so seemed to evaporate.
Mr. Kennedy said a special session should be held next month unless Mr. Bush promised not to go to war until Congress had had time after reassembling in January to vote on the issue. But the Democratic leadership, which met with the President late this afternoon, continued to resist any special session.
 
Role of Congress Still Debated
 After a 90-minute meeting at the White House, the House Speaker, Thomas F. Foley, Democrat of Washington, said that calling Congress back to Washington "would not be timely," but Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, the Minority Leader, argued that Congress should act promptly.
"Apparently Congress wants to sit this one out," he said. "They don't want to do anything. In my view that's an error."
"We don't have a consensus in Congress," said Representative William Broomfield of Michigan, the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. "I think a narrowly drawn U.N.-type resolution would probably get through, but by a narrow margin. So what good would it do? It would send the wrong message to Saddam Hussein."
Others, like Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said they were concerned that Mr. Baker would find it hard to convince Mr. Hussein of American determination without a Congressional resolution.
 
President Sounded Confident
 With the United Nations resolution in hand, and with American troop strength in the region on the way to 400,000, Mr. Bush sounded confident and resolute as he met with reporters in the White House briefing room, despite a rising chorus of criticism of his actions during the last three weeks.
Former Government officials have been testifying at Senate hearings this week that the President should wait for sanctions to do their job before embarking on offensive action, and the polls show only a bare majority of the public favoring an early attack.
In a long opening statement, the President restated American goals and welcomed the Security Council resolution, for which Mr. Baker lobbied frantically on four continents. Until it was passed, Mr. Bush said, "Saddam may not have understood what he's up against in terms of world opinion, and I am hopeful that now he will realize that he must leave Kuwait immediately."
Confronting accusations that he is rushing into war when better alternatives remain open, Mr. Bush declared: "I want peace. I want peace, not war, but if there must be war, we will not permit our troops to have their hands tied behind their backs, and I pledge to you that there will not be any murky ending. If one American soldier has to go into battle, that soldier will have enough force behind him to win."
 
Wants to 'De-Isolate' Hussein
 By agreeing to receive Mr. Aziz in the Oval Office -- a visit sure to be exploited to the full for propaganda purposes by Baghdad -- Mr. Bush opens himself to the charge that he is retreating from his refusal to negotiate. But he said he felt it was necessary to do everything possible to make sure that Mr. Hussein understood reality -- "in a sense, to de-isolate him."
"I don't think there will ever be a perception that the United States is going to blink in this situation," the President said when asked whether the Jan. 15 deadline did not, in effect, force the United States to launch an attack once it had expired.
"I think yesterday's U.N. resolution was a step toward peace, not a step toward war," he said at another point, "because I believe that when Saddam Hussein finally gets the message and understands what he's up against in terms of world opinion and other thins, that he will do in Kuwait what he did in Iran," where he eventually withdrew his troops from enemy soil.
But Mr. Bush also commented, in apparent contradiction to that remark, "I'm not all that hopeful that we'll get big results out of all of this."

HEADLINE: Oil Price Drops $4.06 a Barrel; Stocks Move Up

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Continuing to lurch with each shift in the outlook for war, oil prices took a steep fall yesterday after President Bush called for an exchange of top diplomats with Iraq.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil for delivery in January closed at $28.85, down $4.06 a barrel, or 12.3 percent. 
 Many experts said that with the threat of war temporarily removed, the price would sink lower in coming weeks. But traders said prices seemed likely to gain strength approaching Jan. 15, the deadline set by the United Nations for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
 
Still 25% Above Aug. 2 Price
 "A lot of the war premium went out of the market today," said James R. Fielder, a trader at E.D.& F. Man International.
Still, the price of a barrel of oil stands 25 percent above its level on Aug. 2, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, and more than 70 percent higher than on July 2.
Stock traders were also quick to sense hopes for a peaceful solution in the Middle East, with the Dow Jones industrial average jumping 40.84 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,559.65. [Page 33.]
While the drop in the price of oil was substantial it was not a record; on Oct. 19, comparable contracts fell $5.41 a barrel.
"Most people were expecting the market to hold above $30," Mr. Fielder said. "When it sold through $30, everyody just jumped in."
Peter C. Beutel, a market analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group of Hoboken, N.J., said the United Nations deadline was more important. "It suddenly dawned on the market that while negotiations were unlikely to do anything, we have a window between now and Jan. 15 in which any military action is almost impossible," he said.
Thus, he added, for the first time since August, "the traders can follow the fundamentals without having to look over their shoulders at a war starting any second."
The "fundamentals," or balance of supply and demand, favor lower prices, experts agree. George F. Friesen of Deutsche Bank Group said an inventory surplus had been emerging since October. If the surplus continued to build for several months, he said, "it would be enough to send the price of oil into the teens," a level not seen since mid-July.
 
 Price of Oil Products Down
 The United Nations resolution also pushed down the price of oil products, but they had another reason to decline: the December contract expired yesterday. Thus, those that did not want physical delivery of the heating oil or gasoline -- meaning the vast majority of market participants holding such contracts -- had to sell.
Heating oil declined 7.65 cents, to 85.87 cents, and unleaded gasoline was down 5.79 cents, to 77.58 cents.
People who buy gasoline at the pump are unlikely to see much effect, however, because of a 5-cent-a-gallon increase in taxes this morning.
The crude and product contracts expire at different times, so the peculiar factors that move one generally do not affect the other. But this month was different. The reason was that traders who anticipated a declining price and thus wanted to sell something had only one outlet, crude oil for January delivery, said Ronald B. Caples Jr., a trader at Lehman Brothers.
 
 How Traders Sell
 Generally, traders can "sell" by purchasing contracts that obligate them to deliver oil or an oil product for any month they choose. Early in the day yesterday there was trading in the contracts for the "back months," or for months beyond the one just ahead, but those all fell by their allowable limits, 4 cents a gallon for products and $1.50 a barrel for crude. So in the afternoon, traders who still wanted to sell switched instead to the market for January crude oil, driving prices down further, he said. The amount that the "spot month" contract can move in a day is not regulated.
Mr. Caples described the resulting movement in the crude oil market as "panic selling."
"It was a very weird set of circumstances," he said, and predicted that on Monday some traders would start buying back crude, driving the price higher.
Estimates of inventories vary. But Robert W. Cassidy, the executive editor of Global Oil Stocks & Balances, a monthly publication of Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, said global stocks at the end of October were 82 days of supply, not counting strategic stocks. A year ago, he added, the comparable figure was 80 days.
 
 Unsold Oil in Tankers
 "Right now, there is a considerable amount of oil on the water, unsold," he said. "There is strong evidence of inventories building up at sea right now." The largest component of that inventory is Iranian oil waiting in tankers, he said.
In the meantime, global demand is down because of higher prices and an economic slowdown. Demand in this country was down by about 5 percent in September and October, compared with the same months last year. And Mr. Cassidy said, "In August and September, people got very worried, and there was a lot of pre-emptive buying for winter." Thus some of the demand that would normally come in December came in September instead.
In addition, production is roaring along. The Petroleum Finance Company, a consulting firm based in Washington, put production in November by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries at 22.8 million barrels a day, up from an average of 21.5 million barrels a day last year.

HEADLINE: Dow Gains 40.84, to 2,559.65, on Bush's Move

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
President Bush revived the stock market yesterday by calling for direct diplomatic negotiations with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
Wall Street's enthusiasm for the President's statement came after two days when stock prices slumped in anticipation of Thursday's vote by the United Nations Security Council to approve the use of force to drive the Iraqis from Kuwait. 
 Trading soared to 192.4 million shares -- the best in more than a month.
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 40.84 points, to 2,559.65, for a one-day rise of more than 1.6 percent. But after the two previous down days, the Dow's gain for the week stood at just 32.42 points.
Until the President spoke, stocks showed no tendency to move up or down. But as soon as he finished his announcement shortly after 11 A.M., crude oil prices plunged, bond prices spurted and stock prices jumped sharply.
From a high for the day of $32.80 a barrel almost as soon as trading began, oil prices headed lower -- even before Mr. Bush began speaking. But when the President ended his message, oil dropped rapidly, falling $4.06 a barrel by the end of the day, to $28.85.
In stocks, program traders were extremely busy, Birinyi Associates said. A five-minute buying wave began just four minutes after the President spoke and lifted the Dow by almost 15 points. By the close, heavy waves of buying lifted the Dow more than 42 points.
At 2:18, with prices advancing steadily, the New York Stock Exchange imposed its rule that governs trading when the Dow has moved 50 points up or down. To prevent prices from running away, the rule bars program traders from buying a stock when the Dow has risen 50 points and the stock's price has increased on the latest trade, or from selling when the Dow is off 50 points and the stock has moved down.
A solid 1,126 stocks rose and only 426 fell. Moreover, while 33 stocks slid to new lows, a respectable 20 rose to new highs.
"In a nutshell the Administration was perceived to be very hawkish until Friday's news conference," said William M. LeFevre, market strategist for the brokerage house of Advest Inc. "But when President Bush suggested face-to-face meetings between Secretary of State Baker and Hussein, it gave hope that a negotiated settlement will be possible."
In turn, he said, "That would lead to lower oil prices and, perhaps, to a shallower recession and the possibility of higher stock prices."
 
 Rapid Decline Cited
 Peter DaPuzo, co-director of worldwide equities for Lehman Brothers, noted that the price of oil started dropping rapidly after the Iraqis welcomed President Bush's diplomatic overture.
The President said that he was sending James A. Baker 3d to Iraq between Dec. 15 and Jan. 15 to persuade Mr. Hussein to leave Kuwait and that he had invited Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, to meet at the White House in mid-December.
The Iraqi Ambassador to France, Abdul Razzack al-Hashimi, called President Bush's announcement "a very important step toward peace."
"There's lot of cash out there that has to be put to work," Mr. DaPuzo said, "and institutions are buying stocks in companies with a clear picture that earnings won't be a disappointment."
Among them, he said, were so-called interest-sensitive stocks, like banks and financial companies, plus oil and oil-service stocks, growth stocks, high-tech stocks and biotechnology stocks.
General Motors, which said Thursday that it would cut production for the rest of the year and that it expected a fourth-quarter downturn, fell 1/2, to 36 1/2, with 2.3 million shares changing hands. At one point G.M. fell as low as 35 7/8.
Despite the sharp drop in oil prices, oil and oil-service stocks moved higher. Transportation stocks picked up sharply, with the Dow transportation average climbing more than 3 percent. The Dow industrial average, by comparison, rose slightly more than 1.6 percent.
Phillips Petroleum rose 1 1/8, to 27 3/8; Pennzoil 1 5/8, to 66 3/4; Sun 1 1/4, to 31 5/8; Consolidated Natural Gas 1 1/4, to 47 3/8, and Schlumberger 1, to 56 3/4.
AMR rose 3, to 47 1/4; Delta Air Lines 2 3/4, to 56 3/4; UAL 3 5/8, to 97 1/2, and CSX 1 3/8, to 29 3/4. Federal Express fell 1 1/4, to 29 7/8.
Time Warner fell 3 3/8, to 82 1/2, in heavy trading after The Wall Street Journal said the company was finding a search for minority partners harder than anticipated.

HEADLINE: 10-Day Sales: Chrysler Won't Tell

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 30

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation, whose financial results and share of the American automobile market have faltered in the last two years, announced today that it would no longer participate in the industry's widely followed reports of car and truck sales each 10 days.
Chrysler said it would stop publicly reporting its 10-day sales not only because of the cost and trouble of tabulating the numbers, but also because they exaggerate Japanese auto makers' gains in the American market. 
 The 10-day numbers report only the sales of American-built cars and light trucks, not sales of imported vehicles. As Japanese companies have built more and more factories in the United States, increasingly supplying domestically made vehicles to the American market, they have made imported vehicles a much less important part of their product line and they have been shipping fewer cars and trucks here from Japan.
 
 Gains Are Exaggerated
 This shift in the Japanese auto makers' pattern of supply means that the 10-day reports show larger percentage gains for the Japanese companies than they actually had.
The imported vehicles sold by foreign companies are included in the industry's monthly sales reports, and Chrysler will continue to supply its monthly figures. The General Motors Corporation said it was "reviewing" Chrysler's decision, but the Ford Motor Company said it did not plan to follow suit.
To illustrate how the 10-day reports magnify the Japanese advance in the American market, Bennett E. Bidwell, chairman of Chrysler's automotive division, cited in a recent speech the example of Honda's September sales. Honda reported that its American car sales were 89 percent higher in the first 10 days of September than in the period a year earlier, and 21 percent higher in the second 10 days. But those numbers were only for Hondas built in the United States. For the month, when imported Hondas were included, the company's American sales were up only 12 percent.
Similar comparisons for other months, including all Japanese auto makers, often do not show such big differences in the 10-day and full-month figures, but a gap is apparent.
It is unclear how much an impact Chrysler's withholding of sales figures for the first and second 10-day periods of each month will have. Economists and automotive analysts watch the figures closely for hints of the industry's performance and consumer buying. Still, the analysts will probably estimate Chrysler's sales, even if the company does not publicly report 10-day numbers.
"The 10-day report is a sensitive economic indicator of what is happening," said David Healy, automotive analyst for Barclays de Zoete Wedd, who added that he planned to complain to Chrysler. "But I think Chrysler has a legitimate gripe in that it appears to be holding its own in the market better on a monthly basis."
Edward J. Sullivan, vice president of automotive economics for the WEFA Group, a consulting firm, said, "Clearly they are losing market share to the Japanese transplants and want to do a little damage control."
 
 A.M.C.'s Failed Experiment
 Nevertheless, Chrysler's move could backfire. In 1980, during some of its most troubled times, the American Motors Corporation also tried to do away with 10-day sales statistics, but decided to revive the report in 1983 after analysts made estimates of the company's 10-day sales, often inaccurately.
Because the automotive business demands daily decisions regarding production, advertising, rebates and other competitive actions, it is unlikely Chrysler will stop internal recording and distribution of retail sales reports either daily or weekly, a spokesman acknowledged. But there will be fewer reports and less paperwork, he said.
In recent years, the Toyota Motor Corporation and the Honda Motor Company, in particular, have been able to report large percentage sales gains of American-built vehicles every 10 days. And Chrysler executives have frequently complained that news reporters and analysts hurt the image of the company's products by exaggerating the sales gains of Japanese auto makers by focusing on the 10-day figures.
Joel Pitcoff, a sales analyst for Ford, said he thought newspapers and news services should put pressure on Japanese car companies to report sales of imported vehicles every 10 days, just as they report sales of domestically made vehicles. He said sales of Japanese cars benefited from "the bandwagon effect," with reports of sharp sales increases encouraging more customers to choose Japanese products.
The 10-day report compiling dealers' sales was invented in the 1920's by Alfred P. Sloan Jr., the longtime chairman of General Motors, and his colleagues as a response to a lack of information about sales and inventory that had nearly caused G.M. to collapse. Other auto makers followed G.M. and the 10-day number grew into a reporting convention.
But many analysts play down the significance of individual 10-day numbers, saying that dealers do not always report retail sales on a timely basis and that other factors, including the weather and company-sponsored incentive programs, tend to distort individual periods. Economists have developed seasonally adjusted correction factors to account for external factors, but economists debate the accuracy of the correction factors.

HEADLINE: Administration Backs Revamping Of Banking and Securities System

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
The Bush Administration threw its weight behind a broad reorganization of the commercial banking and securities industries today. It would permit banks and securities firms to merge and would remove barriers to interstate banking.
In a speech before the Securities Industry Association in Boca Raton, Fla., Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady sought to reassure critics of the approach, saying the Administration package would include strong "firewalls" between banking and non-banking arms of a company to guard against overextension of the sort that led to bank collapses in the Great Depression.
 
Substantial Restrictions
 Since then, banks have operated under substantial restrictions imposed by the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which limits their ability to underwrite and trade securities. In addition, the McFadden Act of 1927 limits their ability to open branches across state lines. 
 Mr. Brady, who came to Washington from Wall Street, said the Administration was responding to the declining profits in both the banking and securities industries, as well as their difficulties in competing with foreign firms. He said the constraints of the McFadden and Glass-Steagall laws had led the industry to choose "among the more risky and often less attractive kinds of lending -- such as commercial real estate and loans to highly leveraged companies."
Efforts to remove the barriers to interstate banking and to mergers of banks and securities firms have failed in recent years largely because of the securities industry's powerful lobbying efforts. But the risky condition of the bank insurance fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation makes change probable now. The fund, which insures bank accounts up to $100,000, is at its lowest level in its 56-year history and, some experts say, could become insolvent if a strong recession occurs or if a few large institutions collapse.
"The Administration feels strongly that issues of deposit insurance reform -- that is, the extent and charter of the safety net -- are so closely intertwined with the question of reform of the industry's structure that it makes no sense to treat them separately," Mr. Brady said.
Within the last year, the securities industry has also reversed course and said it would not oppose the mergers of banking and securities companies, if the two entities were run completely separately.
"From what we heard today, we strongly endorse it," said Robert Downey, the chairman of the Securities Industry Association and a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Lawmakers have said they will begin drafting legislation soon after Congress returns in January.
Administration officials want to recapitalize the bank insurance fund. One option under discussion would require all banks to buy equity in the fund, at a cost of 50 cents to $1 for every $100 in deposits.
 
 Insurance Premiums
 The Treasury Department is also considering basing premiums paid by banks on the level and nature of their capital. All banks holding Federally insured deposits now pay 12 cents for every $100 in deposits; in January the premiums will increase to 19.5 cents.
The Administration is also considering limiting coverage, so that insurance would no longer fully protect institutions that hold money in banks in so-called pass-through accounts and brokered deposits. At present, institutions like pension funds and insurance companies can benefit from insurance by dividing their funds into different $100,000 deposits.
Mr. Brady called the current banking regulatory scheme "outmoded, burdensome and inefficient," adding that its flaws "are an unseen contributor to our financial institutions' current difficulties."
 
Chipping Away at Barriers
 The Federal Reserve Board has already begun chipping away at the barriers to banks' underwriting securities in the Glass-Steagall Act, but the Federal Reserve's power to overturn the regulations is limited. In September, the Fed decided to interpret a regulation to permit J. P. Morgan & Company to underwrite and trade securities, but the law still heavily restricts its volume of new business.
Many states have agreements with one another allowing banks to cross state borders.
Treasury officials have said a primary aim of permitting banks to enter new fields of business is to encourage the flow of capital. This would help resolve the banking industry's current difficulties in two ways. Increased capital would provide a greater cushion against losses, and it would also discourage speculative investments and loans by the banks since more of their owners' money would be at risk. Such speculation, permitted by the deregulation of the savings and loan industry in the early 1980's, has led to the largest taxpayer bailout in American history.
"We've got to carry out this restructuring in a way that limits, rather than expands, the taxpayers' exposure," Mr. Brady said. "In the era of the S.& L. cleanup, that is the first hurdle that any reform proposal will have to clear.
"The securities industry has always conducted its business -- in good times and bad -- without the benefit of a Government safety net or subsidy. This is right and should not change."
Securities firms, as well as banks, would benefit from the changes, he said.
"It goes without saying that when the Glass-Steagall barrier is lifted, banks and securities firms should find themselves on a level playing field, favoring neither side," he said.

HEADLINE: Gingrich Assails Bush's Budget Chief

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Launching another rocket in the fight for the soul of the Republican Party, Representative Newt Gingrich today called Richard G. Darman a "technocrat" in the mold of Michael S. Dukakis, and said the budget director should resign if he was not willing to overhaul the nation's economic and social policies.
"Ideological battles matter," said Mr. Gingrich, of Georgia, the House Republican whip and a leader of the conservative wing of the party. "If they didn't matter, we'd have President Dukakis." 
 Mr. Darman, a pragmatist and the most influential figure on economic and domestc issues in the first two years of the Bush Administration, has become the scourge of conservatives. They accuse him of persuading President Bush to abandon his stance against new taxes and of then joining hands with Democrats this fall to pass a budget with not only unnecessary higher taxes, but also insufficient spending cuts in domestic programs.
The dispute became most severe about two weeks ago after Mr. Darman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, gave a light-hearted speech in which he mocked the approach taken by conservatives. He called it "little more than slogans" that did not address "the hard choices of detailed program design and resource allocation."
That set off a barrage from critics on the right, and in a luncheon speech today, Mr. Gingrich took on Mr. Darman point by point.
The budget director declined to comment on Mr. Gingrich's speech.
In the short term, the outcome of the battle is among those factors that will determine the shape of the President's State of the Union Message and budget presentation early next year. In the long run it could determine whether Mr. Darman will continue to dominate the Administration's domestic policy; whether Mr. Gingrich, who was re-elected by fewer than 1,000 votes, will remain a prominent voice in Republican councils, and whether the party will slide further to the right or more toward the center as the 1992 Presidential election approaches.
After his speech Mr. Gingrich told reporters that he and Mr. Darman had talked amicably by telephone on Thursday and would meet next week to see if they could resolve their differences.
"Everything is in suspension for two or three weeks," he said, "to see if we can work together to reform the system."
If not, the Congressman added, he will resume his attacks on Administration policy. His opposition to the original budget agreement struck by Mr. Bush and some Congressional leaders was largely responsible for its defeat on the House floor last month. The budget that was finally approved was considerably more attractive from the Democratic perspective and less favorable from the Republican point of view.
Speaking to the American Legislative Exchange Council, an organization of conservative state legislators, Mr. Gingrich asserted that there were two schools of thought in Republican politics. He placed Mr. Darman in what he called the "managerialism" school, consisting of those who accept the existing system of government and want to make it work better.
He himself, Mr. Gingrich said, belongs to the other school and wants to "invent a new paradigm or a new model."
"We are on the wrong track," he said, and the times demand "a new domestic order."
Mr. Gingrich said the existing system discourages values like working, saving, investing and learning and is dominated by an entrenched bureaucracy and an obsolete Civil Service. Rules and regulations, he maintained, "encourage dumbness and discourage common sense."
"I'm not as smart as the director of the budget -- I didn't go to the Kennedy School," Mr. Gingrich continued. Instead of coining new words, as Mr. Darman did in his speech two weeks ago, Mr. Gingrich said he would stick to "simple words, like 'dumb.' "
 
In Praise of Adolescence
 The Congressman was especially critical of Mr. Darman's contention that American politicians have a "chronic attraction to the new," a sort of "perpetual national adolescence."
With his high-pitched voice rising even higher, Mr. Gingrich asked: "Is it adolescent to believe that maybe the South Bronx could work? Is it adolescent to believe that someday every American will have adequate health care at a reasonable cost? Is it adolescent to believe that someday Saddam Hussein might leave the Middle East without a war?"
Mr. Darman, "because he's a technocrat," did not grasp "the great romantic vision of being American," Mr. Gingrich said.
He argued generally that the country needed lower taxes and other incentives to give people more control over their own lives and to make the economy work better. But, except for supporting enterprise zones, a plan that gives tax breaks to businesses that provide jobs in poor neighborhoods, he offered no concrete policy prescriptions and did not suggest how his vision would be financed.
As for the budget director's view that conservatives were unwilling to make "the hard choices," Mr. Gingrich retorted, "What we need is not hard choices, it's hard thinking."

HEADLINE: 2 STATES PLANNING L.I. SOUND CLEANUP

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
The Federal Government and the states of New York and Connecticut agreed yesterday to begin cleaning up Long Island Sound by curbing discharges of pollutants that have made parts of it a dead sea in recent summers.
Under the plan, New York and Connecticut agreed to upgrade 19 coastal sewage treatment plants in New York and 24 in Connecticut to remove the pollutants before they reach the water. But because the cost could ultimately exceed $6 billion, questions have been raised about where the money would come from when both Albany and Hartford as well as Washington are struggling to make ends meet. 
 "We don't know where the money is going to come from," said Albert F. Appleton, New York City's Commissioner of Environmental Protection.
New York State and New York City would bear most of the cleanup costs because its plants are larger. But all the participants recognized that the region's economic doldrums have made huge investments unlikely, at least in the next few years. They are therefore exploring a host of ways to finance the project, including Federal and state grants and loans, and new taxes and fees.
The goal is to prevent what environmental officials call the Sound's severest pollution problem -- oxygen depletion -- from getting worse. Oxygen levels are lowered, and marine life is threatened, when nutrients like nitrogen are discharged into the water from several sources, including sewage treatment plants.
Low levels of oxygen can occur naturally. But officials say what is happening in the Sound can be attributed to the level of nutrients like nitrogen making their way from sewage treatment plants and agricultural and street runoff. Nutrients feed the growth of algae, which, when they die, sink to the bottom, where they decompose in a process that uses oxygen.
Improving sewage treatment to remove nitrogen would thus check the flow of nutrients. But if the states cannot find the money to improve the plants, construction projects would be affected because sewer hookups would have to be restricted to meet the no-increase commitment.
"They won't be able to do that if it increases the nitrogen level," Julie Belaga, the administrator of Region One of the Environmental Protection Agency, said of unrestricted sewer hookups. The agreement to limit nutrient pollution came in a meeting at the Region One headquarters in Boston.
 
A Serious Threat
 Also present were Constantine Sidamon-Eristoff, the agency's regional administrator for New York; Leslie Carothers, Commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Environmental Protection, and Robert L. Bendick Jr., a deputy commissioner for New York State's Department of Environmental Conservation.
Federal officials and the states of New York and Connecticut are in the fifth year of a six-year study of Long Island Sound pollution. They are expected to complete a management plan next November to address problems like oxygen depletion, toxic substances and floating garbage.
But oxygen depletion is viewed as such a serious threat that officials sought to begin dealing with it now.
Over all, officials expect the cleanup of Long Island Sound to go on for at least 20 years.
In recent summers, from July to September, severe oxygen depletion has been meaured in sections of the Sound from the Throgs Neck Bridge east to Port Jefferson, L.I., and Bridgeport, Conn. Almost all aquatic organisms require oxygen, and in its absence, habitat becomes unusable.
 
Upgrading Existing Plants
 About 50 percent of the man-made sources of nitrogen originate with sewage treatment plants, the study has found. Officials are evaluating ways to limit discharges from sources like farm runoff, but these are far more difficult to identify and control than the sewage treatment plants.
As a result, the major approach in coming years will involve upgrading existing sewage treatment plants. And new sewage plants must employ the best treatment technology, according to the agreement.
New York City officials say that following this approach is unfair and will cost billions of dollars that it does not have. Mr. Appleton, the Environmental Protection Commissioner, said that nitrogen levels discharged from its sewage treatment plants have not increased in 40 years, reflecting a declining population.
On the other hand, Connecticut and Long Island have grown substantially, leading to substantial increases in nutrient discharges like lawn fertilizers.
"New York City is not the chief culprit in the problems of Long Island Sound," Mr. Appleton wrote this week in an essay in Newsday. Even if the city were to make the huge investment proposed and spend a decade building nitrogen-removal plants, he said, within 10 years the continued growth of pollution from sources other than treatment plants in Long Island and Connecticut would largely eliminate any gains.

HEADLINE: Walesa Foe Touching Sensitive Polish Nerves

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW, Nov. 30 --

 BODY:
Stanislaw Tyminski, the wealthy emigre businessman who has turned Poland's presidential race upside down, has drawn on a personal philosophy in his campaigning that mixes Amazonian mysticism with economic theorizing from seemingly contradictory schools of thought.
Mr. Tyminski, a member of the far-right Libertarian Party of Canada, a tiny fringe group, favors sharp reductions in the role of Government. Nonetheless, as he has appealed to Polish workers fearful of losing jobs and position, he has called for the maintenance of Poland's subsidized social programs. 
 In this overwhelmingly Catholic country, he has stressed his Catholic faith but his associates say his spiritual awakening took place after he suffered business losses in Peru and journeyed through the jungle with local Indian tribes. He has written mystically of his own rise to "a fourth dimension" of existence through the practice of "self observation."
On the campaign trail and in his book, "Sacred Dogs," which he published here as he entered the Presidential race, Mr. Tyminski extols the virtues of rugged entrepeneurship, tax cuts and small-business success.
 
Emigrant Status Garners Respect
 His message, coupled with his self-declared status as a millionaire, seems to have touched many sensitive nerves in this country where successful emigrants are viewed with great respect. "Tyminski plays with myths, with frustrations, with our Polish complexes," said Czeslaw Bielecki, a writer and architect who was a clandestine activist in the Solidarity movement.
As he describes his view of Poland's economic future in both his book and his speeches, Mr. Tyminski plays on Polish memories and fears of conquest and dismemberment, claiming that the country once again stands defenseless against an onslaught by Western capitalists. The message he tries to convey is that only a man who has succeeded overseas can outsmart them and avert a future in which Poles become, as Mr. Tyminski puts it, "white slaves" providing cheap labor for the West.
Along the way he stresses that Poland's poverty is the fault of the tax system, the Communists or the current economic reform program, not any shortcoming among Poles.
"Look at the Poles who emigrate to the United States or Canada," he said in a recent interview. "They have neither savings nor disposable income. They work so hard, day and night, three or four jobs some of them. They rise very quickly, average three years, to the level of some security for themselves and their families."
 
Walesa Ahead in Poll
 The first public opinion poll published since Mr. Tyminski reached the presidential runoff put his rival, Lech Walesa, into the lead with 58 percent to 30 percent for Mr. Tyminski. Mr. Walesa finished first in last Sunday's ballot with 40 percent while Mr. Tyminski garnered 23 percent.
Today, Poland's bishops released a letter that hinted at support for Mr. Walesa, the Solidarity chairman. It did not mention him by name but called on voters to turn out for the Dec. 9 ballot because "we realize that it is a great effort that the nation united by the idea of Solidarity has been making to throw off the burden of the totalitarian system."
In his book, Mr. Tyminski describes his own spiritual beliefs. It is a subject he alludes to only elliptically in his campaign appearances.
According to Mr. Tyminski, human beings can normally comprehend only three states of being: the body, the intellect and the emotions. But he writes that through a process of "self observation" he has reached the fourth, or "spirit," dimension.
 
'Man of the Fourth Dimension'
 He argues that this has permitted him to recognize a crucially important third force in physics which is neither action nor reaction. He writes: "A good leader can only be a man who will act on the higher level with full understanding of the laws of nature. It must be a man of the fourth dimension."
Addressing this country's historic fears of its neighbors, Mr. Tyminski writes on page 220 of his book that Poland should develop a force of "intelligent rockets of middle range that have a nuclear warhead of one megaton." Mr. Tyminski, who does not welcome extensive interviews, has repeatedly denied at news conferences ever making such a proposal, and has challenged reporters to cite the place and time of his alleged remarks.
Mr. Tyminski repeatedly praises the idea of expanding trade with the Soviet Union. He noted at a recent news conference that he had visited Moscow in September to sign a contract between his Canadian computer concern, Transduction, and a Soviet company involved with industrial automation. Poland, he said, should accelerate its exports of pigs and other food items to the Soviet Union, which he insists has dollars, crude oil and natural gas available for payment.
 
Wants Tax System Changed
 On the stump, Mr. Tyminski calls for scrapping the current tax system, which has been set up to choke off soaring inflation. Under the economic reform plan, state enterprises must now pay punitive taxes if they raise their wages above certain ceilings.
At the same time, some of Mr. Tyminski's thinking resembles the unpopular policies that brought down the Government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki. For example, in his book he wrote that enterprises unable to support themselves "should be allowed to die a natural death."
In his campaign, however, he has seldom mentioned this idea.

HEADLINE: On Front Lines of the News Circulation War

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Hozel Williams spent the night on the B train and woke up just in time to get off at the right stop. He walked down 72d Street to the juice-and-hot-dog emporium he calls "Gray Papa's." In the darkness before dawn, the Gray's Papaya sign was blazing and the Daily News delivery truck was waiting at the curb. Another day, another bundle of freshly printed copies of the strikebound tabloid.
Mr. Williams, 29 years old, is a foot soldier in the ragtag army of homeless people and the unemployed who have been hawking The Daily News around the city, adding an odd and poignant touch to a bitter labor battle. By the time the sun had climbed over Central Park, he had staked out his territory on 72d Street, between Tip Top Shoes and the Roy Rogers fast-food restaurant on the Upper West Side. His paperweights were in place -- two croissants from the Eclair bakery up the street, protecting his stack of copies against the chilly breeze. 
 "Whatever you sell, you keep," he said. "Fifteen to 20 dollars a day. Big money." Ad hoc salesmen like Mr. Williams have become a crucial force in the battle for The News, especially now that the paper has won permission for hawkers to sell it in subway and commuter railroad stations. The News's chief spokesman, John T. Sloan, said that 1,109 hawkers have joined management's fight to keep the paper on the streets -- everyone from Sikhs in turbans to homeless people in parkas like Mr. Williams. Mr. Sloan said The News expects to have 1,700 sellers by the end of the month.
Despite the hawkers and their decibel-raising read-all-about-it sales pitches, The News is still hard to find in many neighborhoods. Mr. Sloan said that the hawker work force had been selling up to 150,000 copies aday and that he expected that to increase to 200,000 by Dec. 31 because of the ruling on transit-line sales.
But he acknowledged that The News was selling only about half as many copies as before the strike -- 508,000 copies a day, compared to 1.1 million on weekdays before the strike, which began Oct. 25.
In the weeks since The News's corporate strategists enlisted the hawkers, they have played out a street-corner drama like something out of "Les Miserables." At first, some of the hawkers said, they seemed to be in a different world from that of the middle-class people in suits and ties who were rushing by -- and who were their best prospects. But now, they said, they have customers who come back every morning.
"I'm selling more papers now than when I started," said a hawker at 53d Street and Third Avenue who gave his name as Joey. "People trust me; I'm now the equivalent of a newsstand."
At first, he said, he was selling 75 of the 100 papers he picked up every day. Now, he said, he is taking 200, selling 175 and pocketing $40.
From their street-corner outposts, the hawkers know only too well that the strike has been violent. Delivery trucks have been firebombed and battered by bricks and several strikers have been arrested on weapons charges. But more than 20 hawkers questioned at random in different neighborhoods this week said they had had relatively few problems with attacks.
"People call me a scab and union buster," Joey said, "but as long as they don't physically bother me, I don't care."
Some said a bigger worry was rival hawkers trying to steal their papers. Terence Lewis, an unemployed underwater salvage worker who was hawking The News at 72d Street and Broadway, was making change for a customer yesterday when a man in a dirty Army jacket and a ski cap grabbed a bundle from Mr. Lewis's stack.
With nickels and dimes jingling in his Daily News apron, Mr. Lewis chased the man into the IRT subway station. He made the tight squeeze through through the turnstile -- no time to buy a token -- and clambered down the stairs to the platform. But Mr. Lewis returned to his above-ground purlieu empty handed.
 
'Slow, but It's Going'
 "He had a knife," said Mr. Lewis, who described himself as a former champion boxer accustomed to fending for himself, "so I just had to leave him be."
Mr. Lewis suffered no out-of-pocket loss: he got the bundles he was selling free from the same delivery truck as Mr. Williams. Some hawkers said they they pay for their bundles. More than one said it depends on the day: They said they have been told that weekday papers are free but the Sunday paper is not, so they do not show up on Sundays to claim bundles.
And on other days, some ad hoc vendors said, the papers do not sell themselves.
"It's slow but it's going," said Mike Hill, a handyman and sometime painter who said he had been selling 200 copies a day on the street near Grand Central Terminal.
 
400 Papers in Two Hours
 But others insisted they were making money -- good money. Gus Tsakanikus begins his day by picking up bundles at the News building on East 42d Street and banking on early-morning sales to lighten his load. Then he heads to the Holland Tunnel, where, he said, he sells 400 papers in two hours. "Some people give me a quarter; some people give me more," he said. "But I always make about $150 a day for about five hours' work."
Mr. Lewis -- a six-bundle-a-day man on Broadway who said he had been unemployed for more than three months -- said he sympathized with the strikers. But he voiced anger at the homeless hawkers. He said the unions and The News should negotiate a speedy end to the strike because the homeless "degrade this paper by selling at all different prices, and then its value will be nothing and the strikers' jobs and the benefits they want won't exist anymore."
A few steps away on 72d Street, Mr. Williams settled in for a morning of steady sales. He said he had worked as a cook at a fast-food restaurant in the Bronx and as a dishwasher at a restaurant in Greenwich Village. "That was a good job," he said as he sold a paper to a man with a German shepherd. "Six bucks an hour."
He said he saw his work as a job, not a career. "I'm not doing this the rest of my life," he said. "This is just something for right now."
Like anyone who has been doing a thing long enough to settle into a routine, he has good days and bad days. Thursday was a bad day.
"I overslept," he said, "so I missed my papers. That's what I get for sleeping on the A train. I woke up at Lefferts Boulevard in Queens."

HEADLINE: Bolshoi is Born; East Texas is Midwife

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COLLEGE STATION, Tex., Nov. 30

 BODY:
Here in the Brazos River country of East Texas, about 100 miles north of Houston, ballet is rarer than cowboys in sneakers. The university here, Texas A & M, is famed for its farmers, engineers and scientists but not for its fine arts.
This was bonfire week, a time marked by beer drinking and the singing of football fight songs with lyrics like, "Hullabaloo, Caneck! Caneck!" but this year Tchaikovsky's sweet melodies also rang out here. 
 Aggieland, as the campus is known to those who love it, has just served as the birthplace for a ballet company.
Surrounded by adolescent revelry, a new troupe of Soviet dancers led by Yuri Grigorovich, the artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet, began an artistic and commercial experiment here. It was an experiment for both the dancers and for this college town, and there seems to have been a strange meshing of otherwise alien cultures.
On Thursday night thousands of students, alumni and mere fans watched the burning of a pyre 55 feet high to insure victory this weekend against their despised rival, the University of Texas at Austin. The police proclaimed it a relatively sedate evening since only about 20 people were arrested for public drunkenness and only 70 minors were cited for possession of alcohol.
 
'An Ideal Place'
 The Soviet visitors watched from afar, but they had their own bonfire party. Mr. Grigorovich, a master of Russian ballet for more than 30 years, donned a cowboy hat, struck rugged poses and hoisted margaritas to salute the debut of his latest and perhaps most ambitious creation, the Bolshoi Ballet Grigorovich Company.
"This was our birth for public performances and touring," Mr. Grigorovich said through an interpreter, "and this was an ideal place for it because ballet is about youth and our company is about youth and this is a young people's place and because everyone, everyone received us so warmly."
The 60 dancers he brought to Texas A & M from troupes and academies across the Soviet Union cheered him and his hat. Then they tried to eat fajitas with forks until laughing Aggies showed them how to use fingers.
Aside from the ages of the dancers, which range from 18 to 25, the most distinctive feature of Mr. Grigorovich's new company is that it claims to be the only major classical ballet troupe in the Soviet Union that operates without state subsidies or controls. It will dance at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow and make use of Bolshoi dancers, replicas of its sets and its choreography. But as an independent company destined primarily for touring it will draw its income only from the box office.
Mr. Grigorovich remains artistic director for the main Bolshoi company, a post he has held since 1964. He said he intended to feature one or two established figures from the Bolshoi regularly, like Nadezhda Pavlova, who is traveling with the new company, but otherwise the new company will be made up of young artists, some with no professional experience.
 
Doing What They Want
 Most of all, Mr. Grigorovich said, the troupe he formed over the summer is a bid to break away from the Soviet cultural bureaucracy and to exploit the new economic freedoms.
"We will put on real Bolshoi performances," he said, "but we will be free to do what we want. We can keep dancers or sack them if they do not suit the company because they are under contract and we pay them with our money. If we can sell ourselves, good; if not, too bad."
If nothing else, Texas A & M provided the Grigorovich company with the commercial support it desperately needed to get off the ground. Hundreds of people camped out overnight by the box office before tickets went on sale, and all but one of nine performances at the 2,500-seat Rudder Auditorium have sold out.
The company has performed "The Nutcracker" and a mixed bill called "The Best of the Bolshoi" here. After its final performance Saturday, the troupe is scheduled to go to Miami to put on the mixed bill at the Jackie Gleason Performing Arts Center from Tuesday to Friday. In New York from Dec. 19 to Dec. 30 it will perform "The Nutcracker" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
This version of Tchaikovsky's Christmas ballet has not been performed in the United States since the Bolshoi Ballet closed the old Metropolitan Opera House on a night in 1966.
Some of the Soviet dancers are already waxing nostalgic about Texas audiences. Natalya Bashkatova, an 18-year-old who has toured extensively with the Bolshoi Academy, said: "Nowhere else do people give this kind of reception. They applaud all the time, in the middle of the dance, at the end, they clap for everything you do. It is strange, but now I like it very much."
 
Troupes Visit Regularly
 As an all-male military school until the mid-1960's, Texas A & M developed as a place where rural boys went to get a technical education. Aggie jokes told all over Texas, except in Aggieland, are of the sort that mock the number of Aggies needed to screw in a light bulb.
Regardless of its reputation, deserved or not, Texas A & M manages to support regular visits by performing arts groups of national and international stature."
Mr. Grigorovich said he chose this site for his company's debut over 27 other places he visited in the United States because of Rudder Auditorium. It has a stage big enough to handle the company's sets, and it has an extra-springy dance floor that was built to the specifications of Rudolf Nureyev, who performed here in 1988.
 
Exceptional Experience
 For both the dance company and the community, however, this visit was an exceptional experience. The previous record for the longest run by a performing arts group here was three shows by a touring company of "Cats," and virtually all other visiting performers do just one show. Meanwhile, the Soviet troupe did more than simply perform. Under the slogan "Bolshoi and Bonfire," which was printed on thousands of T-shirts, they were absorbed into Aggie lore.
Arriving more than a week before the curtain went up for the first show, the company spent an extended rehearsal period developing its repertory. The company had only done three trial performances in Moscow.
Many of the dancers had never been out of the Soviet Union, and their visit may give them a thoroughly distorted view of America, if they think it is all like Aggieland. A series of official functions, including a ranch barbecue, a black-tie reception and an on-field appearance before a football game, made them all big people on campus. As a result, they have been taken to innumerable parties; restaurants have served them free and students have chauffeured them to their favorite destinations, nearby shopping malls.
Mr. Grigorovich says a kind of bonding took place. "This school is so closely connected to sport," he said, "and ballet is very physical like sport. With these young dancers, they've seen that our art is the art of the body. So maybe this is the beginning of something new here."

HEADLINE: Coping;
With Tipping in Lean Times

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
In these less-than-flush times, what can you do if you can't afford a seasonal tip to the people who make your life run smoothly -- the mail carrier, the hairdresser, the household helper, the child-care worker, the doorman, the garage attendant?
 "I think that everyone understands what's going on in the economy," said Fred G. Sampson, a former board member of the National Restaurant Association. His advice is to give what you can. "Don't ignore the holidays," he said. "It may not have been a good year for them, either." 
 "Letter carriers appreciate any sort of expression that shows you think they gave a year of good service," said Drew Von Bergen, a spokesman for the National Association of Letter Carriers, which has 235,000 active members.
If you live in an apartment building, the staff will expect recognition, even if it is only a fraction of what you gave in the past.
 And what if you simply haven't got any tipping money? "Write a personal note of thanks," said Charles Rappaport, the president of the Federation of New York Cooperatives. "Or if you feel you can give something, even it's only a very small amount, explain in the note why you can't match last year's gift."
 Another solution is to organize a program of apartment-house-wide giving. Marvin Gold, president of a Brooklyn management company, said several buildings that his company manages are thinking of "a combined gift."
A number of co-op residents, he said, felt that it would be insulting to stuff an envelope with two or three dollar bills -- all they could afford -- and had decided to give nothing.
 Group gifts were a welcome alternative. "All you need is someone -- or a few volunteers -- to go around collecting from each apartment," Mr. Gold said.
He went on to say that in the buildings where this was tried, the "combined" amount given each employee was far more than the employee would have received if the residents had given individually.
Similarly, Ellen Galinksy, co-president of the Families and Work Institute in New York, a national group that conducts research on work life and family life, suggests that if you cannot afford something for each of your children's day-care or after-school teachers and their assistants, a combined bonus from all the parents, with a note of greeting signed by all of them, will save face.
 "People in the early-child field are so hopelessly underpaid that they really do need the money," Ms. Galinsky said.
 Buying a cheap gift -- a bottle of cologne, a packet of soaps -- rather than giving a small amount of cash may not be as thoughtful as it seems,especially for workers in the lowest-paid occupations.
"Cash still goes down better than almost anything else among our workers," said Henry Levy, vice president of the Metropolitan Route Dealers Association, an umbrella group for independent newspaper delivery services in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. "What can you do with 100 pens?"
But small, individual gifts of cash, he said, can add up: If 100 households give $5 each, the deliverer has an extra $500 to pay some bills.
For a maitre d'hotel, a waiter or a hairdresser who is routinely tipped the year round, a homemade or handmade gift is a possibility.
Sal Fodera, a board member of the National Cosmetology Association in St. Louis, said, "It's important to our people to feel appreciated, even if all you can manage is a box of chocolates, a bottle of wine or a cake baked at home for the salon's Christmas party."
 "A handmade gift is especially meaningful," said Kathy Robertson, president of the International Nanny Association in Austin, Tex.

Doorman, building superintendent ..... $20 to $30
Handyman, porter, elevator operator ..... $10 to $20
Maid ..... One week's salary
Care giver ..... A week's salary or a gift equal in price
Paper deliverer ..... One month's service charge
Other deliverers ..... $10 to $30
Hairdresser, barber, manicurist ..... At least 20 percent of the cost of one visit

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE

BYLINE: By Martin Filler; Martin Filler, who frequently writes on architecture, is a contributing editor of Conde Nast Traveler, HG and Vanity Fair magazines.

 BODY:
LOOKING AT ARCHITECTURE. By G. E. Kidder Smith. 168 pp. (Abrams, $35.) It is difficult to imagine a more engaging introduction to the art of building than this collection of black-and-white photographs by the indefatigable G. E. Kidder Smith, who for more than 50 years has been recording architecture around the world for books that are now standard reference works. Trained as an architect, Mr. Smith has a sure grasp of what a building is essentially about, and he conveys the three-dimensional presence of a structure with remarkable power in his two-dimensional medium.
The photographer's selection of his own best pictures, sympathetically set off by Bob McKee's elegant book design, includes 80 landmarks renowned (the Parthenon, Taj Mahal and Eiffel Tower) as well as unfamiliar (the abbey of Pomposa in Italy, the country church of Havero church in central Sweden and the village of Baniane, Algeria). His striking images and pithy accompanying texts are personal, generous and illuminating. This is a man in love with architecture, and he transmits the pleasures of his life-long affair so joyously that few readers are likely to come away untouched by the broad expanse of his vision.
THE WORLD OF CHARTRES. By Jean Favier. 191 pp. (Abrams, $60.) No book can hope to capture the physical immediacy of the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Chartres, but this is a noble reminder of one of the consummate glories of Western architecture. Mostly built between 1194 and its dedication in 1260, to the designs of nine master masons, the present edifice replaced an earlier church destroyed by fire and believed to have been erected on the site of a pagan temple. Few who visit this overwhelming monument doubt that it is a sacred place, even though it possesses an insistently irrational quality at odds with the common perception of Gothic architecture as lucid and uplifting.
Chartres appeals to impulses embedded so deep in human memory that the spell this building casts quite defies explication through an inventory of its component parts. The narrative meanings of the biblical themes depicted in the cathedral's sublime stone sculpture and incomparable stained glass windows are more readily comprehended than the mysterious interactions of light and space within this stupendous, disturbing structure. For the immovable art of architecture, a book performs well if it makes one want to go to a building for a firsthand look, and at that this volume succeeds beautifully.
THE VILLA: Form and Ideology of Country Houses. By James S. Ackerman. 304 pp. (Bollingen Series XXXV, No. 34. Princeton University, $45.) Among the several histories of the country house published in 1990, this is easily the best. James S. Ackerman, the Arthur Kingsley Porter Professor of Fine Arts at Harvard University, is the acknowledged expert on Andrea Palladio, the late Renaissance architect and theorist whose classical villas in the Veneto region of Italy remained the international country house ideal for centuries, especially in the United States. Mr. Ackerman rightly places Palladio as the pivotal figure in his thoughtful, thought-provoking study of the villa from ancient Rome to the early 20th-century houses of Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier.
This is not an exhaustive chronological survey, but a series of focused chapters -- they were the A. W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts given at the National Gallery of Art in 1985 -- on the villa and its patrons at important junctures, among them the Medici in Tuscany, the Earl of Burlington and his circle in Georgian England, and Thomas Jefferson at Monticello. In each of them the author strikes a judicious balance between formal analysis and social interpretation.
Mr. Ackerman is quick to point out that the villa is not synonymous with the country house, the former term being reserved for buildings conceived for the pure enjoyment of the countryside, not primary residences weighted down with practical requirements. But that definition, correct though it may be, gets somewhat stretched by the time we reach Jefferson's exceedingly functional farmhouse, to say nothing of Wright's suburban Coonley house in Riverside, Ill.
Perhaps the certainty with which the Renaissance scholar can assess an Arcadian past accounts for the gloomy way Mr. Ackerman views the present. Though he stops far short of contemporary villas because "no historian can see his own time clearly," he laments that "the traditional ideology that imputed spiritual and moral values to country life has finally been lost." That may be so, but for millions of city dwellers around the world, their villas, however modest -- from log cabins on the lakes of Minnesota to wooden dachas in the Lenin Hills of Moscow -- remain the safety valves that make modern urban life tolerable during the working week, between rural escapes.
LIFE IN THE GEORGIAN CITY. By Dan Cruickshank and Neil Burton. 288 pp. (Viking, $35.) Few epochs in the history of design have been more wrongly romanticized than the 18th century. But this account of what daily life was actually like for Londoners during that imagined golden age will make interesting reading for people worried about the declining quality of life in big cities now. These were the good old days, the authors recall for us, when streets were unsafe and dirty and traffic was impossibly congested; when the air was polluted, real-estate developers were greedy, and contractors were apt to cut corners.
Mr. Cruickshank and Mr. Burton are particularly good at detailing the middle- and upper-class social conventions that both shaped and responded to the rapid expansion of the capital city during Britain's ascent as the world's leading economic and colonial power. They also provide information on everything from bricklaying techniques and paint colors to water closets and garbage removal, making intelligent use of period illustrations as a source of documentation often overlooked by historians who favor verbal records. If not up to the sheer brilliance of Sir John Summerson's 1945 classic "Georgian London," this book helps explode the myth of 18th-century perfection, while offering convincing reasons why the general level of urban design was so much better then than it is today.
THE UNROMANTIC CASTLE: And Other Essays. By John Summerson. 288 pp. (Thames and Hudson, $35.) At the age of 86, Sir John Summerson is the greatest living architectural historian, and the publication of any new book of his is always a welcome event. This compendium of articles and lectures takes its title from Riber Castle, a mid-Victorian pile in Derbyshire that housed the author's old school and first aroused his awareness of the difference between good and bad architecture. His latest anthology is another virtuoso demonstration of the gifts that make him such a delight to read: a graceful style, an unflagging curiosity, an accomplished but never pedantic command of facts and an ability to put forth ideas with the assured ease of an enthusiast eager to share his thoughts with like-minded friends.
But Sir John's Apollonian temperament has not led him to the admiration of classical architecture alone, though of course he excels at that. In addition to his definitive essay on the 18th-century English country house, this book also contains several pathbreaking studies on Victorian architecture, including the once-despised semidetached suburban villas of London. He is also attracted to some of the more offbeat practitioners of classicism, including the bizarre neoclassical maverick Sir John Soane (of whose eccentric house-museum in London Sir John Summerson was curator for almost 40 years) and the early 20th-century mannerist Sir Edwin Lutyens, whose unexecuted scheme for the Roman Catholic cathedral of Liverpool, the author persuasively argues, would have been among the most awe-inspiring churches in Christendom.
Sir John, who is more than an antiquarian, concludes with an eloquent case for the history of modern architecture: "The main thing is to get that history right and to get it clear." Those are tenets this scrupulous, peerless scholar has always personified.
CLAUDE-NICOLAS LEDOUX: Architecture and Social Reform at the End of the Ancien Regime. By Anthony Vidler. 447 pp. (MIT, $50.) The French Enlightenment architect Claude-Nicolas Ledoux has become a patron saint of the post-modernists, who see in his pared-down but intensified version of classicism proof that ancient tradition can be recast in contemporary terms. Would that they possessed just a bit of his terrifying talent. Anthony Vidler, a professor of architecture at Princeton University, demonstrates with learned but lively authority that long before the Bastille fell, Ledoux's designs attained their visionary impact not just through daring manipulations of mass and detail, but because of the architect's uncanny knack for encapsulating timely theoretical issues in structural form.
Ledoux's incisively geometric customhouses surrounding Paris were architectural harbingers of the sweeping political changes about to occur, revolutionary sentinels in stone. His biggest chance to build -- the ideal city of Chaux, a royal saltworks erected on a radical plan near Besancon during the first decade of Louis XVI's reign -- was a metaphor for the orderly universe. Ironically, the new social system Ledoux helped presage condemned him as an accomplice of the monarchy, and thereafter most of his quirky variations on classical grandeur were fated to remain mere dreams of glory.
ELIEL SAARINEN: Projects 1896-1923. By Marika Hausen, Kirmo Mikkola, Anna-Lisa Amberg and Tytti Valto. 355 pp. (MIT, $125.) When he immigrated to the United States in 1923 after winning second prize in the Chicago Tribune Building competition, the Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen began the distinguished second half of his fertile career. He went on to design the richly ornamented Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and a number of fine but much simpler church buildings. Yet by the end of his life he was eclipsed by the greater fame of his son, Eero, one of the leading lights of American architecture in the 1950's.
The earlier portion of the elder Saarinen's output, on which his reputation ought rightfully to rest, is not as celebrated as it should be. This extensive catalogue of his designs up to the age of 50 covers his best-known works in Finland -- his own country house, Hvittrask, and the Helsinki Railway Station -- as well as scores of proposals for everything from furniture to civic planning. In all of them, the architect struggled to devise an authentic national style for his homeland, then a grand duchy under Russian rule, in resistance against Czar Nicholas II's Russification campaign of 1899. The prodigious vigor of what might be termed Saarinen's Viking Art Nouveau phase -- compact, boldly emblazoned structures fairly bursting with folkloric energy -- makes this book one of the unexpected treasures of the season.
A SYSTEM OF ARCHITECTURAL ORNAMENT. By Louis H. Sullivan. 159 pp. (Rizzoli, $200.) Louis Sullivan was the Walt Whitman of American architecture, a sprawling genius of startling originality and unrestrained vitality whose spirit embraced multitudes. But for all his poetic inclination, Sullivan pursued his art in the hardheaded world of Chicago big business at the end of the 19th century, when he established himself as the master builder of the skyscraper.
After 1900, Sullivan's career soured, and with only a sporadic series of small bank commissions in small Midwestern towns to sustain him through two decades, he barely subsisted on the brink of destitution. In 1922, two years before his death, the Art Institute of Chicago's Burnham Library of Architecture paid Sullivan to set down, in words and drawings, his philosophy of organic design. The architect's response to his task was profound. He brought forth a manuscript of breathtaking beauty and heartfelt emotion, an exaltation of the life force in architecture as much as in himself.
Never has there been a more inventive ornamentalist. Sullivan's lush tangles of botanical forms and abstract patterns, reproduced in facsimile in this imposing folio with their delicate details intact, are wonders of complexity and coherence. First published by the American Institute of Architects in 1924, they offer timeless lessons in the dialogue between the whole of a design and its constituent parts. Above all, these mandala-like motifs are a testament to creative survival. Amid all this dazzling draftsmanship is the simple diagram of a sprout under which Sullivan inscribed his credo of regeneration: "Remember the Seed-Germ."
THE LIVING HOUSE: An Anthropology of Architecture in South-East Asia. By Roxana Waterson. 263 pp. (Oxford University, $49.95.) Architectural traditionalists have made much in recent years of the need for a return to evocative signs and symbols in building. That imperative is deemed most urgent for houses, in which elements such as the pitched roof, central front door and prominent chimney are believed to confer the sense of psychic protection fundamental to domestic shelter. Nevertheless, the problem remains that architecture alone cannot make people feel at home in the universe. If social and religious institutions do not give those comforts, there is little that a house can do to compensate for a lack of larger spiritual connection.
That is one pertinent conclusion to be drawn from Roxana Waterson's engrossing study of traditional architecture among some 70 tribal ethnic groups in Southeast Asia. Ms. Waterson, an anthropologist at the National University of Singapore, elucidates the concept of semangat ("life force" in Malay and many Indonesian languages) as an integral part of animist beliefs that imbue buildings with a living presence acknowledged by makers and inhabitants alike and manifest in every step of the construction process.
From the selection of a site (during which the permission of the land must be sought) and the propitiation of the indigenous deities (Thai architecture incorporates a miniature spirit house to accommodate gods displaced by building) to the raising of the center post (the all-powerful navel of a house) and the roofing of a structure (often a communal effort accompanied by complex rituals), the author presents a memorable chronicle of some of the richest architectural cultures on earth. This is an instructive example of how "primitive" ways of building can help us understand why most of our architecture no longer performs numinous functions for us.

HEADLINE: TERROR IN THE ANDES: The Flight of the Ashaninkas

BYLINE: By Gustavo Gorriti; Gustavo Gorriti is a Peruvian journalist. Volume 1 of his three-part history of the Shining Path insurgency was published in Peru this summer.

 BODY:
As The Little Cessna 185 approached the last stronghold of the Ashaninka Indians, the harmony of the heavily forested mountains and spectacular cascades made it possible to forget for a moment the deadliness of the jungle below us. We flew close to a towering waterfall, and barely a minute later reached our landing place, a plateau on the summit of a mountain the native people call Tzibokiroato -- "the place of ants."
I had an idea of what a jungle landing strip should look like, but couldn't see this one until the young pilot pointed it out. It wasn't straight but curved along the rim of an abyss. It wasn't flat either, but full of mounds and depressions. I thought that whatever was going to take place there shouldn't be called a landing but more appropriately an accident. 
 This was in early September, in the central highlands of Peru. Five months earlier, several hundred Ashaninka Indians, part of the largest group of native people in the South American Amazonian jungle, had been pushed to the mountain redoubt after a succession of bloody attacks by the Shining Path, a Maoist insurgency that controls growing areas of Peru. In August, the Rev. Mariano Gagnon, a salty, chain-smoking 60-year-old Franciscan priest from New England who many years ago welded his destiny to the Ashaninkas, had left the mountain to seek help in Lima, 200 miles to the west. Now Father Mariano, as he is called, was returning to discuss with the natives the momentous decisions they had to make.
The Ashaninka refugees could try to stay at Tzibokiroato, which could be defended. But they would have to fight off the well-armed Shining Path guerrillas with bows and arrows and a few shotguns. They could surrender, but they would face virtual enslavement and forced indoctrination in the Shining Path's rigid Communist dogmas. Or they could disperse in small groups, as some other Ashaninkas had done, hoping that the guerrillas would no longer regard them as a threat. (The Shining Path had sent word that they would stop the killing if the American priest did not return, an unconvincing vow.) Finally, they could try to cross the Andes, to seek refuge in the land of another tribe. But it would be dangerous for even the fittest Ashaninkas to scale the steep mountains.
Just that morning, we learned that the native leaders had reported by radio that the guerrillas had surrounded them. When told that the priest was on his way, they said they would try to hold off the enemy until he arrived.
Later, flying over Tzibokiroato (pronounced tzhee-bo-kir-WAT-oh), we peered anxiously at the huts built on the mountain; those on the lower levels had been charred in a recent rebel attack. We were waiting for the Ashaninkas to come out and give a signal to land (or, I thought, to crash). The plane circled several times, as close as possible, but the place was desolate.
We headed back to Satipo, the provincial capital about 50 miles to the northwest. Father Mariano's rough face showed his dejection, and he became more depressed when we flew over what was left of his mission at Cutivireni, for years the communal hub for 5,000 Ashaninkas of the Ene River parish. In the clearing near where three rivers met, only blackened foundations were left of 80 houses -- the former homes of some 700 people -- and 11 other structures.
Like somebody visiting the graves of dear ones, Mariano pointed to the places where some buildings had been: the bilingual school and the smaller chapel, which had been torched by the Shining Path. The generator building and the landing strip, he said, were blown up later in an operation directed by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, which said it wanted to keep cocaine traffickers and guerrillas from capitalizing on what was left of the abandoned mission.
Back in Satipo, we tried to figure out what could have happened. In the morning, the native leaders hadn't given their location, no doubt because the Shining Path monitors radio traffic. Maybe they had evacuated Tzibokiroato. After a couple of melancholy hours, the voice of an Ashaninka leader named Nicolas came over the radio. He sounded nervous, and communication was brief. They were not on Tzibokiroato, but in a fallback place that Mariano knew about. Despite the news, the priest beamed. Tomorrow at 8 A.M. Nicolas would radio again.
The next morning, the native leader reported that the refugees were very worried, their food was scarce. He gave his position -- "to the left of the waterfall" -- and said they had prepared a spot where a helicopter could land. He said they had been chased by the guerrillas the day before, but had shaken loose of them. Tzibokiroato, he said, was now controlled by Sendero Luminoso -- Shining Path.

I have known Father Mariano since 1984, when he sought help after his mission was burned for the first time. In August of this year, more desperate than ever to aid the Ashaninkas, he contacted me and a few other journalists, asking us to see the people's plight for ourselves. He gave me his diary and other documents, and over many weeks I talked to dozens of witnesses. This is the story of the Ashaninkas' struggle, based on those sources.
The road that led Mariano Gagnon to the Peruvian jungle began early, in his poor, Catholic upbringing in New Hampshire. He was born Joseph Theodore Gagnon to a French-Canadian mother and a father of French and Iroquois descent. Restless and stubborn, Joseph dropped out of public high school and went to a Franciscan seminary in Callicoon, N.Y. There, he finished high school "with great difficulty," he says, and began studying for the priesthood.
He had already decided he wanted to do missionary work with a native people, the farther away and the more difficult the circumstances, the better. His decision was not unusual: the Franciscans have long reached out to indigenous ethnic groups, especially in the Amazon jungle.
He arrived in Peru in 1948. It was hard for an independent-minded, cussing gringo to adapt to the rigorous Franciscan discipline, but he somehow did it. He changed his name to Mariano -- a not uncommon name in his order -- and was ordained a priest in 1957. Soon, he set out for missions in the jungle.
In the late 1960's, eager for a parish limited to a native people, he began a closer relationship with the Ashaninkas -- Campas, as they are called in Peru -- and was eventually sent to a small new mission at Cutivireni, in the mountainous jungle of the Ene River Valley.
The Peru Ashaninkas (pronounced ah-SHAN-in-kahz), which means "people" in their language, number roughly 20,000 and are scattered over a wide territory in the central jungle highlands. About 5,000 of them were known to have lived in the Ene Valley in the early 1970's. They are nomadic hunters and slash-and-burn farmers, whose basic crop is manioc, an edible root and the mainstay of their diet. They also grow cacao, which provides them with the cash needed to buy machetes, knives, batteries and other essential items. Until the early 1950's, the native groups had been able to maintain most of their traditional area. But outside settlers began moving in, and their land began to shrink.
The missionaries and colonizers who came in contact with the Ashaninkas over the centuries described them as a simple people. "The Campas are childlike," the Rev. Dionisio Ortiz, author of about 10 books on Franciscan missions in Peru, told me. "It is very easy to control them."
Father Mariano bristles at the stereotype. "Yes, they are childlike," he says, "but in the biblical sense, free from pretension, ostentation or calculation. Obviously, these uncommon virtues in a modern society make them victim to many abuses."
Realizing that the colonization pressure was only going to increase, Mariano tried from the outset to persuade the Peruvian Government to create a reserve, closed to other settlers. The Cutivireni area not only had a concentration of Ashaninkas, but also magnificent steep forests and abundant cascades the priest believed should be made into a national park. Though his campaign failed, he helped to preserve Cutivireni as the only Ashaninka land free from colonization.
Unlike most Franciscans, Mariano did not try to make his flock change its traditional ways, even when, as in the case of female breast nudity or polygamy, it offended Catholic sensibilities. He also cooperated with Protestant organizations like the Summer Linguistics Institute, which taught Indians Spanish. Despite his devotion to the Ashaninkas, Mariano never learned their language, communicating instead in Spanish.
Though he could be blunt with outsiders, he was by all accounts gentle toward the Ashaninkas, acting like a mother hen. Photographs show the gray-haired priest -- invariably in shorts, T-shirt and tennis shoes -- tending to everyday chores.
He did make some concessions to the outside world: he tried to teach the people about the market economy and modern technology. "I tried to prepare them for what was coming," he says.
The Cutivireni mission had a bilingual school, farm machinery, workshops and a well-stocked infirmary. Despite the Indians' dislike of large groups, they formed a small town around the mission. They built a plaza, with a much-admired fountain in the form of a lion.
Meanwhile, outsiders continued to settle around the area, and by the 1970's, they had reached the opposite shore of the Ene River. Mariano discouraged contact with the settlers, and while he says he never refused them the sacraments, he chose not to include them in his parish. "The Ashaninkas would have thought that a betrayal on my part," he explains. The colonizers considered him arrogant, and hard feelings arose. "I was probably tactless," he now acknowledges.
In the late 1970's and early 80's, cocaine trafficking boomed in the Ene Valley, as it did all over Peru. The local economy changed rapidly, raising the premium on land-grabbing. The airstrip near the mission, built by the Indians under Mariano's supervision, became increasingly busy, and Colombians appeared. They were considerate toward the priest and offered him a regular "contribution," which he rejected. The Ashaninkas were asked to give up cacao for the more lucrative coca, but Mariano warned that he would leave the mission if they accepted. None of the 700 people in his mission took the Colombians up on their offer.
Coca-growing flourished nonetheless, and in 1983 Mariano decided to tell the authorities. He sent a note to the commander of the Peruvian security police base in nearby Mazamari, and had a conversation in Lima with a United States Drug Enforcement Administration agent. Soon afterward, two drug traffickers visited the mission. They told Mariano the contents of the letter he had sent to Mazamari, and playfully advised him to steer clear of their business.
Mariano decided it was good advice. He never knew who had tipped off the traffickers, but he thinks the leak came from the Lima office of the Peruvian Investigative Police, where the letter had been sent for "processing."
It was already clear to Mariano that his vision of an Ashaninka Arcadia, immune from the world, was not going to be. He realized that a tough struggle for cultural and territorial survival was ahead. But he did not foresee a greater threat to his physical survival and to that of the Ashaninkas.

IN MAY 1984, 20 ARMED MEN invaded the mission. Mariano was in Lima at the time, and Brother Pio Medina, an old Peruvian Franciscan, had been left in charge. The assailants looked for Mariano, and told Pio that they intended to kill the American priest.
Then they looted the mission and burned it to the ground.
Mariano heard the news two days later on his way home from Lima, and hurried to Satipo, the provincial capital, where he waited for his Franciscan superior, the Rev. Felix Saiz. The only pilot willing to take them to the mission was flying the plane used by the Colombian traffickers.
When the village Ashaninkas found out that he had landed, they came out of the forest and back to the mission. They saw him standing over the ashes of his lifework, crying. The attackers were never identified. Father Mariano maintains they were settlers and local traffickers who wanted to get rid of him and dislodge the Colombians.
Rebuilding began immediately, but the work was strenuous and the mission was not complete until May 1988. That year, the Shining Path, the shadowy guerrilla movement that had begun fighting "a people's war" eight years earlier, closed in on the Ene River Valley and Cutivireni. Until then, the mission and neighboring area had been on the periphery of the war. But the rebels were spreading north from Ayacucho and southeast from the high Andes, and the valley was in between.
At first, the Shining Path existed only in rumors and in signs of underground organizing and proselytizing, mainly among the settlers, but also among some Ashaninkas. The guerrillas often stay in an area for years before making their move, a strategy perfected by their elusive leader, Abimael Guzman, a former philosophy professor who spent years in Ayacucho organizing students and then Indian peasants.
In June 1989, four armed guerrillas visited Mariano. They didn't try to conceal their identities. They asked for food, tools and other help, which Mariano, knowing the risks of acting otherwise, promptly gave them. They came back several times and asked for more specific things, like sneakers and mimeograph stencils, which he provided. Then they also asked him to recruit young Ashaninkas for indoctrination. Mariano refused, saying he had no authority to do so.
A few months later, as the Shining Path presence became more evident, Mariano decided to take a long-overdue trip to the United States, thinking it might be his last opportunity to visit his homeland.
While he was away, a United States helicopter landed at the mission, carrying Drug Enforcement Administration agents and State Department contract personnel. They had been appearing at the Peruvian police base in Mazamari since the arrival of a dozen or so members of the United States Army Special Forces, who were training the Peruvian paramilitary police. In operations, the Americans and the Peruvians combed the coca-carpeted Ene Valley for clandestine airstrips and laboratories -- which were then blown up. The American presence at the mission, however brief, emboldened some Ashaninka leaders to stand up to the Shining Path. A few even taunted the guerrillas, telling them that if they dared to attack, Father Mariano would call the Americans in with their helicopters to wipe them out.
On Nov. 12, 1989, there were national mayoral elections, which the Shining Path tried to sabotage by attacking candidates and voting places. At the mission that day, Mario Zumaeta, the head of the bilingual school, and other Ashaninkas tore up a red hammer-and-sickle flag the guerrillas had raised and replaced it with the Peruvian flag.
For several days nothing happened. In the meantime, Lucas Adins, a 43-year-old Belgian volunteer who had worked in the Ashaninka region as a medic and agricultural adviser, arrived at the mission. The next Sunday, he was working in the infirmary when the Shining Path entered the mission. Adins directed his companions to sit still and wait. About 60 guerrillas, young men and women armed with submachine guns and assault rifles, detained Adins and the Ashaninka leaders. Unaware of the raid, Mario Zumaeta arrived during the night and was arrested. "Don't make any error or it will be too late," Adins remembers saying to himself. The guerrillas sacked the mission and forced him to drive a tractor to the river with the loot to be shipped to the other side.
The next morning, while Adins was driving the tractor with more stolen goods, the invaders burned the mission. In the afternoon, as he headed back from his last trip, he saw a group of guerrillas walking with three Ashaninka leaders: Mario Zumaeta, Roy Ponce, who was in charge of the mission in Mariano's absence, and Alberto, a schoolteacher. Adins was told to drive them to the river. He knew what was going to happen, and he thinks the prisoners did, too. He was shaking when they reached the river, and was told to put his hands over the wheel and look straight ahead. But he saw the three prisoners being led away, walking with a strangely eager gait, and soon heard seven or eight shots.
The guerrillas came back alone. "You could see by their faces which guys had done the killing," he told me later. He was ordered to drive back to the mission. When he arrived, he was alone amid the smoky ruins.
Adins remained alone for several days. Then, early on the morning of Dec. 2, two American helicopters landed at the mission site with three United States advisers and six Peruvian commandos. They took the starving, distraught Belgian to the Mazamari base, and from there he was taken to Lima. That afternoon, he was debriefed at the United States Embassy.
The Ashaninkas found the bodies of Roy, Alberto and another teacher, probably killed later, several yards apart. Mario Zumaeta's body was never found. But the natives soon heard a horrifying story about his death: Mario had been taken to the settlers' town across the river, where he was crucified, castrated and disemboweled. What remained of his body was stuffed with stones and thrown into the river.
The information came from some mission Ashaninkas who now sided openly with the Shining Path. They were a minority, recruited clandestinely, but now they had the power to enforce their views. Their leaders were a paramedic who had worked at the mission and Nicolas's sister, Claudia. In nearby Ashaninka settlements, several native leaders -- including an evangelical priest and a bilingual teacher -- declared themselves openly as followers of the Shining Path. Evidence of underground organizing became clear, as guerrilla settlements formed rapidly.
The killings continued, and the mission was now almost desolate. A week after the execution of the three leaders, a group of guerrillas returned, looking for other Ashaninkas. They found the village shaman and a few young men. When they asked the shaman about the natives' whereabouts, he retorted that he wouldn't talk with assassins. He was killed on the spot, as were two boys who tried to protect him.
A few days after those shootings, a small Shining Path patrol returned to the mission for the tractor. A larger Ashaninka group, armed with bows and arrows, ambushed them, and most of the guerrillas were killed.
A full-scale war had broken out. As the mission's 700 inhabitants escaped into the forest, they knew they were outnumbered, outgunned and outmaneuvered. If the rebels had come from far away, the natives would have had tactical advantages. But the Shining Path commanded a base among the Ene Valley Ashaninkas and used their captives as slave laborers or soldiers. Other native groups, sensing that the balance of power was tilting to the Shining Path, were careful not to antagonize the guerrillas and tried to reach accommodation. Only those Ashaninkas close to Mariano, now under the loose leadership of Nicolas and another native, Matias, the community's president, actively opposed the Shining Path.
Mariano learned of the killings when he returned from the United States in early December. From Satipo, he was flown by plane over the mission's rubble, and when he saw a small group of mission Ashaninkas, he dropped them a letter asking for news and whether it was safe for him to come back and be with them for Christmas.
He heard nothing. Later he would learn that the natives had sent him a letter with three messengers who tried to reach Satipo on foot. Shining Path guerrillas intercepted them and they were killed. On Dec. 26, Mariano flew over an area near the mission, and saw a group of natives. They made signals telling him not to land, that there was great danger. He dropped them salt and Christmas presents.
The violence grew worse. In February of this year, the guerrillas raided the Ashaninka camp and killed 15 people. Most victims were women and children, because the men were able to run faster. Ashaninkas are no cowards, but they have a different way of waging war. They rely on surprise attacks and ambushes, and the concept of territorial defense is alien to them. If attacked, they will run until they think they have outdistanced the attackers. Then they will counterambush.
In the days that followed, the Ashaninkas managed to ambush and kill about a dozen guerrillas, but they suffered even more casualties. Shattered, they dispersed into the forest in small groups.

MARIANO WAS TOLD by informers that if he returned to the jungle, the Shining Path would kill him in a way that would leave a lasting impression on the Ashaninka memory. He had been joined in Satipo by Michel Saenz, a French explorer who had lived among the Ashaninkas, spoke their language, wore the native robes and went barefoot. His emotional attachment to the Indians rivaled Mariano's.
The Americans began to help them, beginning a brief relationship that would soon unravel. Mariano befriended the head of the United States Special Forces group in Mazamari. At first, Mariano saw them as a godsend. Desperate to save the Ashaninkas, he did not foresee conflicts with the United States agenda of the war on drugs.
In mid-March, two American helicopters dropped him and Michel Saenz off at a settlement of Ashaninkas that the Frenchman knew well. The group's leader was clearly worried that the pair's presence put his group in danger of retribution by the Shining Path. A few days later, the helicopters picked them up. Flying back to the base in Mazamari, they passed over the mission airstrip, and Mariano was horrified to see that it had been bombed during the brief time he was in the jungle. He realized then that the same people who were ferrying him were responsible. (The Americans would later say that Mariano had once asked them to destroy the strip, as a way of hampering drug traffickers. He denies it.)
Now, there was no place for a plane to land in the Cutivireni area. "My God!" he wrote that day in his diary, "how much work and sweat went there! More than one year's toil, and now if the Americans don't help us, how are we going to get in?"
Two days later, the helicopters carried Mariano and Saenz to a place where the priest hoped some mission refugee families were. He was right. They found Nicolas and Matias, the community's leaders, and other familiar faces. Uncharacteristically, the Ashaninkas gave free rein to their anguish, crying while they embraced the priest.
As they recounted their tragedies, Mariano saw how thin and gaunt they were. He decided to stay with them, believing that as long as he remained, some people would care about their fate. Two days later, the Americans returned and picked up Saenz, who said he would go to Lima for help. He and Marino agreed it was vital to obtain some shotguns for the natives, who, armed mostly with bows and arrows, were easy prey for the Shining Path.
Every day, more families arrived, as they learned of Mariano's return, and by March 27, nearly 300 Ashaninkas were at the camp. The mood was dark. They knew that the Shining Path was aware of Mariano's presence and that an attack was imminent. Those who had escaped from the guerrillas were the most afraid. Their testimonies about the heavy-handed indoctrination and brutal discipline were chilling.
Alarmed by the extent of Shining Path strength in the valley, Mariano decided to return to Mazamari to seek help. He contacted the base with the two-way radio he had brought with him, and was told he would be picked up shortly.
In the meantime, he tried to improve morale and made plans for a fortified town. On March 29, Mariano, Matias and some other Ashaninkas hiked to a steep rocky hill that they thought would be an ideal place for building. When the inspection was over, Mariano, a slower walker, decided to return to camp first.
Soon after he arrived, there was a sudden commotion. Women and children wailed, and ran around in a panic. They told Mariano that Rigoberto, an Ashaninka who had become a feared guerrilla, and three other armed men were headed toward the site Mariano had just left and where Matias still was. Bellowing commands, the priest sent most of the men to rescue Matias, organized the rest in two ambush parties and sent the women and children to safer ground. He then positioned himself with a pistol and two hand grenades he had brought from Mazamari.
The encounter on the rocky hill was brief. Matias's group fell on the guerrillas, killing Rigoberto and another rebel. A third tumbled over a cliff, into the abyss. The fourth escaped. When the men came back, Mariano praised the fighters and chastised one who had hesitated to use his weapon. Now the priest was a military leader.
A heavy storm moved in that night, and the Indians thought they heard the spirits of the dead rebels wailing in the rain. After waiting all the next day for the American helicopter, Mariano was told by radio that it had crashed. It wasn't known when another helicopter could pick him up.
The Ashaninkas decided to flee. They thought the Shining Path was going to wipe them out at any moment and they were almost mad with fear. They wanted to escape to another mountain, much farther away. There was water there, and fields to cultivate manioc. And because it was difficult terrain even for an Ashaninka, the likelihood of a Shining Path attack was lessened. Mariano resisted the idea, then relented.
At least 230 people began a five-day trek through rainy, slippery jungle up to the mountain called Tzibokiroato. They ran out of food the second day, and, after eating worms -- "green and hairy," Mariano remembers them -- the priest suffered debilitating diarrhea. Throughout the hellish journey, the Ashaninkas kept an even disposition. "Without a doubt, they are the Lord's chosen," the priest wrote in his diary. When they finally reached the mountain in a storm, he saw that an advance party had almost finished a thatched hut for him. He was overwhelmed by this testimony of love and care.
Tzibokiroato could be defended. Most important, the Ashaninkas could carve a short landing strip on the plateau at the summit. For a few days, the priest and the refugees enjoyed the idea of a new beginning. Still, the fear of an all-out Shining Path attack remained. Mariano thought the natives needed to be trained in territorial defense.
He radioed his new position, and on April 10 a Peruvian Air Force helicopter came to get him. Michel Saenz and Luc Adins were waiting in Mazamari. Saenz had brought food and medicine, and some rudimentary shotguns would arrive later. All three felt it was necessary to help the natives adapt to the new place, and they waited for the American helicopters to take them back to Tzibokiroato.

THE TRIP WAS NOT to happen. Instead, Mariano received a letter from Father Felix Saiz, his Franciscan superior, ordering him to Lima immediately. Mariano stayed in Mazamari. Six days later, Father Felix's message was repeated: Mariano was to board an American supply plane that was returning to the capital. This time, he had no choice.
In Los Descalzos convent in Lima, Mariano had a long talk with Father Felix, a Spaniard of lively expression and intelligence. Their exchange, while not bitter, reflected a centuries-old debate in the Catholic church.
Was Mariano's presence helpful or harmful to the natives? Felix asked. Mariano argued that, all things considered, it was helpful. Wouldn't it be better if the natives were left alone to decide their own fate? the Franciscan leader said. That, Mariano snapped, would be tantamount to handing them over to the Shining Path.
Father Felix then said he had heard from the American Embassy that Mariano had lost his sense of proportion, that he was organizing guerrilla units. This wasn't the church's calling and would put all missions in Peru, and the church itself, in jeopardy, Felix said. The embassy had also implied that Mariano was responsible for the loss of the downed helicopter and had otherwise cost the United States Government a lot of money.
The Franciscans didn't oppose self-defense in principle. But practicing it, especially with a priest in charge, could only make things worse, Mariano's superior argued. Many priests and nuns at the jungle missions in Peru survived through the daily crafting of a volatile coexistence with the Shining Path. They had to give food to the commissars, and watch helplessly as people were led to their deaths. At one mission, the guerrillas killed an uncooperative nun. Some missions couldn't take it anymore, and were closed. At others, priests and nuns braved great danger every day. They would be hostages if Mariano led a war.
Mariano no doubt knew of another Franciscan concern: reports of human-rights abuses by the Peruvian military. It was feared that if a priest was in league with the armed forces in any way, the cooperation might blunt the church's efforts to press for reforms.
Left unsaid was the wider perspective, held by many Franciscans. They believed that the natives were lost, that they would probably disappear as a culture as so many other indigenous peoples have throughout history. And there wasn't much the church could do, except to trim sails or to retreat altogether -- as it had done before in other times of rebellion. It would wait for peace to return, then resume its ministry with those who were left.
Mariano accepted none of this, and took the lack of an explicit church prohibition as tacit permission to continue his struggle.
He needed a ride back to Mazamari. Despite his growing rift with the Americans, he called the United States Army attache, Col. Robert Froude, who had helped him transport supplies in the past. Colonel Froude told him no planes or helicopters were flying there for several days at least.
The next day, Mariano managed to hitch a ride to Mazamari on a bank's private plane. He arrived there a few minutes before the American helicopters did. And he was told that the supply plane had come that morning and had just left.
The next day, Mariano returned to the base in Mazamari, determined to fly to Tzibokiroato with the two Europeans, Luc Adins and Michel Saenz. But right before a helicopter was to take off, he was told that neither he nor Saenz would be allowed to board. Only Adins was allowed to take off.
The Belgian had begun supplying the Americans with intelligence after they rescued him from the burned mission in November 1989. For his part, he says that more than anything he wanted to get back to help the Ashaninkas. "In the meantime," Adins said of the Americans, "they used me."
Mariano's falling-out with the American Embassy was to some extent a result of his own impetuousness. But he was also the victim of the Americans' involvement in the drug war, and their desire for information about the threat the Shining Path posed to the United States advisers in Mazamari. When Mariano's goals appeared to conflict with the embassy's, the Americans stopped helping him and began to cooperate with people they thought were more reliable and useful.
Embassy officials said Adins was realistic and dependable, while Mariano wanted to drag American assets into a Peruvian internal war. "He wanted the Americans to provide weapons to the Ashaninkas," an embassy official said, "and that once he and Michel had organized them, that we use the U.S. helicopters in the event of a Sendero attack. That was their hope and their game plan."
In May, Mariano wrote a letter to the United States Ambassador, Anthony Quainton, challenging some accusations the embassy officials had been making, including the claim that he was responsible for the helicopter accident. Quainton answered in July, expressing his "highest regard and admiration" for Mariano and denying that the embassy held him responsible "for any costs to the United States Government." By that time, the Army Special Forces had finished its work, and the Americans -- and their helicopters -- were no longer in Mazamari.
Without a helicopter, getting to the natives' bastion in Tzibokiroato was difficult. But Michel Saenz, in an extraordinary feat, flew to the other side of the Andes, crossed the high peaks by foot and walked all the way to Tzibokiroato. As soon as he arrived, he and the Ashaninkas began carving an airstrip. It was finished in mid-July. Soon thereafter, a local pilot, Armando Velarde, flew Mariano to Tzibokiroato.

IN AUGUST, MARIANO left Tzibokiroato to go to Lima for more help and to draw attention to the Ashaninkas. I accompanied him on his return to the Ene Valley in early September.
On Sept. 10, two days after our unsuccessful flight over Tzibokiroato, which was now in the hands of the Shining Path, a Peruvian Air Force helicopter took us to the new Ashaninka refuge farther east. It was called Maiobenti, which in Ashaninka means "where it is impossible to pass."
The helicopter descended toward a rocky riverbed between two steep forests. We circled the hillsides a couple of times but saw no signs of life. Then I saw about 60 Ashaninkas standing amid the rocks and boulders. They had materialized out of the forest in no time.
We jumped out of the helicopter, and Mariano embraced some of the natives. With the helicopter engine still roaring, the priest, all fire and action now, conferred with a small group. They listened intently, and then one native and Mariano boarded the helicopter. They took off, leaving me behind.
I stayed with the Ashaninkas for about 20 minutes. Very young women nursed babies; they were feeding intensely, as if to quicken the pace of life. When the helicopter came to fetch me, neither Mariano nor the Indian were on board. As the pilot began the return trip, I asked him where they were. He pointed behind, to the fading Maiobenti mountains.
I reflected on what I had seen. When the people saw Mariano, their expressions seemed a mixture of joy and pain. They obviously loved him and expected help from him. But they also knew that the Shining Path would attack with a vengeance as soon as they learned of his presence. And the Ashaninkas had probably concluded by now that their priest's noble intentions were greater than his means.

MARIANO HOPED TO persuade the Ashaninkas to stand their ground. But they had no more fight left. They told him that about 400 guerrillas attacked them in Tzibokiroato in mid-August, soon after he left to go for help in Lima. The Shining Path, now an equal mixture of hardened Andean rebels and Ashaninka natives, had overpowered them after an all-night climb and burned most of the new huts. The rebels also sabotaged the landing strip, and would have annihilated the refugees if a small party of Ashaninkas had not ambushed their enemy's rear guard. About 20 guerrillas died, including Claudia -- Nicolas's sister -- and some other Ashaninka converts. The natives fled from Tzibokiroato, but it was not long before the Shining Path found them and attacked again. Some of the Ashaninkas were killed, and the rest broke up into small groups and fled into the forest.
The Shining Path now controlled most Ashaninka communities. From about 500 families, the rebels could mobilize at least 1,000 natives, and it didn't matter whether they were eager or reluctant fighters.
The refugees, by contrast, now totaled 213. They had 18 shotguns with scant ammunition and a few hand grenades, which Mariano had brought them. And they were starving because they hadn't been able to tend their manioc fields for almost a year. Hunting was poor, and they subsisted mainly on snails and worms.
They had decided to try to escape over the Andes, to the territory of the Machiguenga, 125 miles east beyond the mountains. They knew that only the fit had a chance to make it, so they decided they had to kill the babies and younger children, and to leave the infirm behind.
Mariano told them that he would try to arrange the exodus, if they promised not to resort to infanticide. They agreed, and he contacted the Peruvian Air Force by radio. He asked for an airlift, to carry the refugees over the Andes peaks to the Urubamba River Valley. The air force answered the next day that it couldn't help, and would return only to pick up Mariano.
But Armando Velarde, the young private pilot who had aided Mariano in the past, signaled that he was willing to help with his little Cessna. So, Mariano and the natives decided to march back up to Tzibokiroato, where a plane could land, and to try to hold it for four to five days until Velarde could fly them out. They hoped the guerrillas would need longer to mount an all-out attack.
They began the trek, fortified by a breakfast of invertebrates as well as some condensed milk, which Mariano brought with him. It was two days of endless climbing and precipitous descents. Heavy rain made the river crossings hazardous. For Mariano, it was a punishing ordeal. He suffered several painful falls and arrived at Tzibokiroato exhausted.
But the rising rivers proved a blessing, preventing the Shining Path from swiftly moving to attack them. In one day, the Ashaninkas had fixed the crude mountaintop airstrip, and Armando Velarde managed to land his Cessna on the afternoon of Sept. 15.
He took Mariano back to Satipo, where they arranged an airlift of the refugees with a priest of the Dominican order, which ran the Catholic missions in the Machiguenga region where the refugees would resettle. Velarde would fly in and out of Tzibokiroato, with logistical help from a single-engine plane from Wings of Hope, a philanthropic organization. He would have to make the flights over the 14,000-foot peaks without oxygen masks and navigational help. He also had to count on the weather to remain cloud-free, a remote possibility, since the Andes cordillera stays cloudless for only a week or so a year.
The evacuation began early on the 16th, and on the very first flight, disaster almost struck. Unknown to anyone, part of the Cessna's tail stabilizer broke as Velarde landed in Tzibokiroato. When taking off with the first group of Ashaninka women, the plane suddenly plunged into the abyss. Amid his passengers' screams, Velarde throttled the engine, pressed his knees tightly on the rudder control, and somehow maneuvered the plane out of the canyon. He headed to Mazamari, instead of over the Andes. "After two minutes, my legs were numb," Velarde said afterward. "After 10 to 15 minutes, the pain seemed unbearable." The flight took 35 minutes, and after an emergency landing, he rolled out onto the ground, racked by nausea and stomach cramps. But the plane was repaired, and he was ready to fly again.
The next day, he made 20 trips across the Andes, carrying five or six natives from Tzibokiroato each time. Winds were strong, increasing the danger. The next day, he made 22 flights, and on the third he finished the evacuation. Wings of Hope made two flights to Tzibokiroato, but mainly ferried fuel for Velarde's Cessna. The mountains, normally swathed in clouds, remained clear for three consecutive days. Some thought it was a miracle. "What do you think a priest is for?" Mariano asked, using an unprintable adjective.
Almost all the refugees -- 169 people -- had been evacuated. The few remaining chose not to go. They dispersed, saying they would make the trek another time. The Ashaninkas relocated to Machiguenga land were greeted warmly and given a largely unoccupied territory upriver. The prospect of settling down, of planting manioc and of forgetting the bloodshed, at least for a while, made them happy.
With broad smiles and sunny faces, they set off up the river on Sept. 22. They waved to Mariano, who, after 22 years, was finally leaving his mission and the Ashaninkas, probably forever. The people would now be under the care of the Dominican order, which wanted a clean break between them and their priest.
He waved goodbye, vision and remembrance mingled together. He saw Matias and Nicolas, and Capitan, who had lost his wife and three daughters to the war, and then remembered Mario Zumaeta and Roy Ponce and all the others. And as he bid farewell, he cried, and as he thanked God, he mourned.

VISITING A DECORATOR'S OFFICE CAN BE offputting. The environment is picture perfect. From the front door right down to the pencil holders, the look is flawless. It's no accident. As any decorator knows, the office is one place where the proverbial handwriting really is on the wall.
"Our office reflects what we're all about," says Keith Irvine, a partner at Irvine & Fleming, a Manhattan-based decorating company. "It's where we sell the whole game."
For a prospective client, a decorator's office is a barometer of the firm's taste and flair. "If someone doesn't like my office, then they're not going to like my work," says Bunny Williams, who began her own business on the parlor floor of a Manhattan brownstone two years ago after 22 years as a decorator at Parish-Hadley. This is why designers usually insist on having initial meetings at their office rather than at the site in need of decorating. "It's the best way to get to know each other before confronting the nuts and bolts of a job," says Vicente Wolf, another Manhattan decorator. "It's also important that clients see we don't just work out of a back room, but that we have a very professional setup. That's why I always give them a tour of the whole office right down to where the billing is done. Decorating is all about teamwork."
The three offices shown here are newly decorated and the work of seasoned decorators. Prospective clients can not only pick up the overall spirit, but also specific decorating ideas. A visit to Irvine & Fleming's offices, for example -- 4,000 square feet in a modern high-rise -- shows what clever architectural mill work can do to transform bland modern space. Classical columns and archways, moldings and baseboards fashioned from both wood and fiberglass and painted with elaborate glazes were all newly added by the decorators. The office is an example of how a homey atmosphere can be created from scratch.
"We've purposely designed a strong architectural background," Irvine says. "In this economy people have to first put their money into what lasts. So we recommend to clients that good architecture and correct proportions should come before the trimmings."
"Certainly a sense of luxury has to continue," Irvine adds, "but in more subtle dollops." All the signatures of Irvine & Fleming's relaxed English country-house look are in view: the upholstery is the plushest down, the curtains Regency in style. There are faded chintzes, tiny silhouettes, 18th-century Chinese wallpaper and an assortment of English antiques. There is also a marble floor in the entrance. "When people walk down the hall it sounds as though we're in a real house," says Tom Fleming, another partner.

THE FLOORS IN VICENTE WOLF'S Conference room are painted a dead white. "I know it's not practical," he says, "but they're scrubbed every day." Unlike Irvine and Fleming, who created a look that is antithetical to their original space, Wolf has taken an old sewing factory and left reminders of its industrial past: the old windows are intact, the radiators, beams and sprinkler system are exposed. All the walls are painted white. In the main room, a white leather tablecloth covers a round conference table. "My office is a canvas, a purposely neutral space that allows the jobs we're working on to come to life," Wolf says. It's also a reflection of the atmospheres Wolf creates, where antiques are sparingly placed in spare settings. "Obviously I tell people my jobs don't always look like this," he says. "The office is simply a stage set."

BUNNY WILLIAMS CONSIDERS HER OFFICE A place where she can teach as well as show off her style. "The things in these rooms show what can be done," she says. "It's a vehicle for ideas." The faux marbre fireplace mantel in her conference room, for example, illustrates what beautiful finishes can do to a plain mantel. Regency-style hanging shelves display tiles and marble samples. A telephone table is actually a good storage tip -- it has extra-deep drawers that hold the decorator's catalogues.
Williams's private office looks like a cozy drawing room. The walls are a teal blue mottled wallpaper -- "a cheaper solution than paint when you have old walls," she says. The curtains have a sheered valance made of inexpensive Korean silk. "Curtains don't have to be overdone and cost the earth," Williams says. A pair of chairs in the window are English Esthetic Movement, still an affordable antique. "I want people to see that I'm about quality and atmosphere," she says. "And whoever comes to my office should be as comfortable as if they were in my own living room."

 If this new company cannot yet deliver the traditional ensemble hauteur or the rich individual characterizations of classic D'Oyly Carte versions, it does offer musical bonuses. Sullivan's instrumentation, using cleaned-up manuscripts, is well detailed, and there are original versions of numbers -- like "Were You Not to Ko-Ko Plighted" in "The Mikado," which has a dropped verse restored. Current British operetta favorites are featured, including Marilyn Hill Smith, a very fine "Pirates" Mabel, and Bonaventura Bottone, as Nanki-Poo.-- Richard Traubner
 
Tobias Picker: Symphony No. 2 ('Aussohnung'); String Quartet No. 1 ('New Memories')
 Leona Mitchell, soprano; the Houston Symphony, Sergiu Comissiona, conductor. Mendelssohn String Quartet. Elektra/Nonesuch 9 79246-2; CD and cassette.
Tobias Picker studied with that grand duo of American rationalists -- Milton Babbitt and Charles Wuorinen -- and, like them, possesses an abiding faith in the European 12-tone tradition. But his recent music, influenced by American trends toward tonality and accessibility, has opened up immensely, and his Symphony No. 2 sounds like full-blown post-Romanticism. This is, however, no easy return to Romanticism. Instead, it partakes of a chromatic Expressionism, underpinned by tonal references that burst to the surface only in the Straussian setting of a Goethe poem. The String Quartet No. 1, inspired by Georgia O'Keeffe, is more abstract and dissonant, but no less poignant. -- K. Robert Schwarz
 
Crumb: Works for Piano, Vol. 1
Jeffrey Jacob, piano. Centaur CRC 2050; CD only.
 Mr. Crumb's trademark gestures -- the clusters, whispers, tics, clicks and other-worldly evocations -- are impressively on display in this first installment of a two-volume traversal of his piano music. Mr. Jacob plays (and hums and strums) well, and the three selections include the hypnotically tinted and allusive "Makrokosmos," Vol. 1, from 1972. The other works are terser and less gratifying: the Webern-tinged Five Pieces for Piano (1962) and the more convoluted "Gnomic Variations" (1982), written for Mr. Jacob. The album is marred by some careless tape editing. -- Andrew L. Pincus
 
'Music for Martha Graham' -- Copland: 'Appalachian Spring'; Barber: 'Cave of the Heart' ('Medea')
 Atlantic Sinfonietta conducted by Andrew Schenck. Koch International Classics 3-7019-2 H1; CD and cassette.
 Here are two familiar works in their original guises. "Appalachian Spring" (1944) and "Cave of the Heart" (1946) were written for Martha Graham's ballet company, and that meant economy of means -- 13 instruments in the former case, 14 in the latter. Later, Mr. Copland fleshed out his score for the popular orchestral suite, and Mr. Barber recast his work as "Medea's Meditation and Dance of Vengeance." In getting back to the originals, Andrew Schenck shows us a psychologically shadowed side of "Appalachian Spring" omitted from the suite and bares the raw fierceness of the "Medea" ballet. But more than that, Mr. Schenck and company turn in performances of danceable pulse and suppleness, all recorded in vibrant colors. -- Lawrence B. Johnson
 
POP/JAZZ
 
Happy Mondays: 'Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches'
Elektra 60986; CD and cassette.
 The Happy Mondays of Manchester are the most significant group to emerge from Britain's working-class "rave culture," which has invented its own delinquent version of the "enterprise culture." The rave culture works hard (drug dealing, bootlegging) and plays hard (getting high on Ecstasy and house music). Happy Mondays' music is a lumpy puree of 70's funk, boogie guitar and 1990 house production, over which the singer Shaun Ryder spews a queasy stream of consciousness: squalid tales of chemical and sexual excess, oblique observations of lumpen-prole life. When it works, as in the baleful, sultry shimmer of "Loose Fit," it's brilliant. But too often, "Pills 'n' Thrills" is a perplexing mishmash. If the Mondays' sound and scene is the new punk, it's because it's designed to confuse and repel outsiders.-- Simon Reynolds
 
 The Flaming Lips: 'In a Priest Driven Ambulance'
Restless 7 72359; cassette and CD.
 For many young rock bands, psychedelia is a gimmick. But for the Flaming Lips of Norman, Okla., it's a credo. The band's fifth release sounds like psychedelia's inbred eighth cousin, with blasts of metallic feedback, Moog-like whistling noises and three songs about Jesus. But the Lips don't just wallow in weirdness; their songs are cunningly constructed. "Five Stop Mother Superior Rain" builds from a moribund acoustic guitar into crisp verses framed by drips of slide guitar. From a psychedelic base the Lips have evolved into a genre unto themselves.-- Karen Schoemer
 
 Tom Ze: 'Massive Hits'
Luaka Bop/Warner Brothers 26396; CD and cassette.
 Spinning art music from the roots sound of samba was the bossa-nova dream, and Tom Ze chased it with more passion and precision than any of his co-conspirators in tropicalismo, the Brazilian avant-garde pop movement of the late 60's. But where bossa nova came out all sighs and whispers, Tom Ze's best work over the last two decades -- compiled here by that increasingly sharp-eyed ethnomusicologist David Byrne -- tosses buzz, howl and calculated eccentricity into its meticulous balance of the dissonant and lyrical. Guitars tickle and saw, horns wheeze and menace, old bossa standards are syncopated to the brink of collapse. And never have American audiences been treated to a more thrilling display of the vigorous intelligence that tends to lurk beneath Brazilian pop's pretty surfaces.-- Julian Dibbell
 
Edie Brickell and New Bohemians: 'Ghost of a Dog'
Geffen 9 24304; all three formats.
 "Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars," this Dallas sextet's 1988 debut album, was alternative Muzak, noncommittal folk-rock suited to activities no more strenuous than hanging posters. The singer and lyricist Edie Brickell may still be the prototypical dormitory rocker, with a pseudo-coffeehouse penchant for mistaking her own scribblings for poetry ("Ghost of a Dog," "Oak Cliff Bra"). But in half of the 14 tracks here, she strings together her observances of minutiae into full-fledged narratives: "Times Like This" and "Carmelito" have a disarming immediacy of place and time. "Ghost of a Dog" may not be deep, but at least New Bohemians have left some of their ditsiness behind.-- K. S.
 
Louis Armstrong: 'Vol. 5, Louis in New York'
Columbia 46148; all three formats.
 This fifth chronological collection of Armstrong's records in the 1920's and early 30's includes his first attempt to expand from blues and black-oriented vaudeville songs to pop. Two classic performances in this vein -- "I Can't Give You Anything but Love" and "Ain't Misbehavin' " -- reveal an unsuspected ability to sing pop lyrics with rich emotion. There are also two curiosities -- records made in 1929 but not discovered until last spring. They are orchestral versions of "After You've Gone," which had an Armstrong vocal when first released. The newly found versions were intended for South America, where there wasn't much market for records with English lyrics. Armstrong's vocal chorus is replaced by lackluster instrumental solos, one a wimpish alto that reflects his fondness for the sound of Lombardo saxophones.-- John S. Wilson

In the Keys, New Museums, Hotels, Dining
Visitors to the Florida Keys this fall and winter will find some new facilities and vacation opportunities. A new museum of natural history and an adjacent nature walk has opened at the 63.5-acre nature preserve at Crane Point Hammock in Marathon. A three-person submarine capable of diving to 120 feet is available for rent at Conch Republic Divers (305-852-1655) at mile marker 90 in Tavernier.
At Little Torch Key at mile marker 28.5, near Big Pine Key, Captain Buddy's Family Trips (800-749-3868) has added a new glass-bottom boat that offers snorkeling excursions to the area's reefs and tours of the out islands. Snorkeling equipment and underwater cameras are available for rent.
The Marina del Mar Resort in Key Largo has almost doubled its accommodations with the addition of 54 rooms and villas, each with kitchen, living room, separate bedroom and balcony. Key Largo also has a new restaurant and motel. The Snappers Restaurant (mile marker 94.5) offers rental equipment for water sports as well as indoor and outdoor dining. The new Conch On In (mile marker 89.5), with seven rooms and boat dock, is a manatee observation site in winter.
Key West's Curry Mansion, the turn-of-the-century residence of one of Florida's first millionaires, William Curry, has opened an additional 15 rooms furnished with Victorian-style pieces. The keeper's quarters at the Key West Lighthouse, the only American lighthouse in the middle of a city, was restored and opened last month as a lighthouse museum. More information on the Keys is available from the Visitors Bureau (800-352-5397).
 
A Week As a Movie Star
Did Hollywood stardom pass you by? For $7,500 a person, Hollywood Fantasy Corporation is offering the chance to try a week of life as a movie star. After being cast for one of about a dozen scripts, vacationers will spend a week in Palm Springs, Calif., rehearsing and receiving voice training and acting lessons, as well as fashion and beauty advice.
At week's end, vacationers will star in their own movie alongside the actors Elliott Gould and Maxwell Caulfield. Participants receive a videocassette of the final edited version of their production and of highlights from the week's rehearsals and parties.
The package, scheduled for Jan. 6 through Jan. 13, includes a private villa at the Palm Springs Marquis Hotel, a chauffeured limousine to and from the hotel, and admission to Palm Springs International Film Festival events. For an additional $2,000, participants may take a guest who can attend all the events except the rehearsals and taping.
Additional movie fantasy vacations are planned for Palm Beach, Fla., in March and San Antonio in April. Information: 800-545-8050.
 
2 Visas Dropped In East Europe
Bulgaria and Hungary have joined Czechoslovakia in eliminating visa requirements for American citizens. The policy changes, which took effect Oct. 3 in Bulgaria and Nov. 1 in Hungary, apply to Americans planning to stay up to 30 days in Bulgaria and up to 90 days in Hungary. Czechoslovakia exempted Americans from visa laws last May.
Yugoslavia, which temporarily lifted its visa requirements in July to promote tourism, will reinstate its visa laws on April 1, 1991. After then, visitors will need to obtain visas, which are free, at the border or by applying in advance to the nearest consulate.
Romania continues to issue visas, good for up to 30 days, to travelers at the border; Poland still requires visitors to apply for visas in advance, through a consulate. (Allow two weeks for processing and provide exact travel dates.) Both countries offer single- and multiple-entry visas.
Colombia no longer requires American visitors to obtain a visa or tourist card. To make multiple visits and stay for up to 90 days in a given year, Americans now need present only a valid passport and a ticket for entering and leaving the country.
 
Air Service To Palermo
Alitalia, the Italian airline, has started a new daily service from Kennedy International Airport in New York to Palermo, Sicily, via Milan's Malpensa Airport. Passengers change planes at Malpensa instead of having to transfer from Malpensa to Milan's Linate Airport, as they did previously. To celebrate the service, the airline offers -- through March 31 -- a $100 discount off advance-purchase round-trip fares. Before discount, economy fares paid 14 days in advance are $871 on weekends and $807 midweek. The flight departs Kennedy at 7:30 P.M. and is scheduled to arrive in Palermo next day at 1:40 P.M.
 
Chinese Garden For Montreal
A Chinese garden, said to be the largest of its kind outside Asia, is scheduled to open in Montreal next June. The plan for the five-acre garden within the Montreal Botanical Garden includes an elaborate composition of waterways, rock gardens, hills, plants and pavilions with carvings.
The design derives from a style known as Meng Hu Yuan, or Dream Lake Garden, which originated during the Ming dynasty (A.D. 1368-1644). Chinese administrators stationed far from their homes, built gardens. The style is also known as the Yangtze style, because many of the officials who built the gardens were from the cities along the Yangtze River west of Shanghai.
The $4 million project was conceived in 1987 as a symbol of friendship between Montreal and Shanghai. The garden's wood carvings and peony trees and 300 of the 2,300 tons of stone came from China. About 50 people from Shanghai are working at the site under the supervision of Lei Wei-Zhong, of Shanghai, a garden designer of the Yangtze school. Interiors of the pavilions were completed last month.
 
DELHI DISPLAYS KASHMIRI WORK
 NEW DELHI -- To give the artisans of the battered Kashmir Valley an outlet for their crafts now that the local tourist industry has collapsed because of separatist conflict, the state government of Jammu and Kashmir has built an outdoor crafts bazaar in the Indian capital.
Tucked into a piece of open ground between the state government emporiums on Baba Kharak Singh Marg, near Connaught Place in central Delhi, dozens of stalls will offer bargains from Kashmir throughout the winter. Called Kashmir Expo 90, the craft fair opened Nov. 5 and is expected to go on until the beginning of February.
More than 80,000 people in Jammu and Kashmir lived on traditional handicrafts -- weaving, furniture and woodcarving, carpet making and papier-mache work being among the best known.
So far the finest Kashmiri weaving and papier-mache work do not seem to be on display. But it is possible to find hand-embroidered woolen shawls for under $25 and plain lightweight wool shawls for as little as $5, along with namdha-work rugs of embroidered, compressed wool at from $12 or $15 up, depending on the size of the piece.
The permanent Jammu and Kashmir State Emporiums in Delhi will be well stocked this winter. One is near the outdoor Expo at 7A Baba Kharak Singh Marg and the other at 5 Prithviraj Road. Both are open Monday to Saturday 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. -- BARBARA CROSSETTE

Prague's Spring Into Capitalism

BYLINE: BY LAWRENCE E. JOSEPH; Lawrence E. Joseph, the author of "Gaia: The Growth of an Idea," is based in Brooklyn, N.Y.

 BODY:
WHEN THE MACHINES FROM America finally arrived, they were in crates stamped "DO NOT OPEN!" in big black letters. A dozen women, kerchiefs in their hair and mops and dustpans in their hands, wandered in to smoke cigarettes and steal a peek.
But Stanislav Kuthan was not about to let anyone play Pandora with his boxes. The deputy director of the Tesla Electronics factory in Raspenava, a hamlet two hours northeast of Prague, had worked too hard to risk any accidents now. 
 When Kuthan set out to modernize his company in 1988, he says, "we found out we had fallen 20 years behind the rest of the semiconductor industry." For two years, the slight, fair-haired engineer battled government bureaucrats and a Yugoslavian competitor, while playing hardball with American negotiators, to win a joint-venture agreement with a Vista, Calif.,-based company called Pacific Vista Systems.
Now the boxes from California were here, soon to be followed by a team of Pacific Vista technicians to set up a new production line. The transformed factory will increase Tesla's annual output of 150 million computer capacitors by a factor of 3,000 percent -- if Tesla's workers prove equal to the exacting demands of the new technology.
"We will compete openly on the world market by next year," says Kuthan. "We are confident of making a lot of profit -- unless, of course, our national economy collapses."
Kuthan's doomsday humor captures the national mood in Czechoslovakia a year after Vaclav Havel's "velvet revolution" swept the Communists from power. The country's transformation from a centralized command economy to a mixed, primarily free-market system is a period of giddy hopes and grave doubts.
Elsewhere, such careening emotions would indicate a national neurosis. But in the course of two trips to Czechoslovakia since Havel took power, I have come to realize that the rules applicable elsewhere are of limited relevance in the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic. In this land that inspired Franz Kafka's surrealism, a nation where today the president is a playwright and the American Ambassador a former movie tap dancer, a visitor often feels he has stumbled onto the set of an experimental film.
"We have an irrational, wasteful, nonfunctioning centrally planned economy," says Vaclav Klaus, the 41-year-old Finance Minister. "The transition to a free-market system must be radical, immediate and irrevocable."cw0
It is Klaus, graying but athletically lean at just under 6 feet tall, who has set his nation on that course. The economics point man for the Government of President Havel toils in a utilitarian office in the Finance Ministry, a 15-minute walk down the hill from Havel's stately suite in Hradcany, the Prague castle where the President and his aides hold court. Along with Havel, Klaus is implementing drastic new laws and policies designed to revive Czechoslovakia's atrophied economy by administering the tonics of competition, profit and private property.

LAUS, WHO MAJORED IN FOREIGN trade at the College of Economics in Prague, had little chance to shape policy under the Communists. In 1970 he was kicked out of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, where he was a researcher, after a hearing in which he was branded "the leading counterrevolutionary" among Government economists.
Now, as his compatriots look to him for answers, the Finance Minister has adopted some distinctly capitalist role models. He has read extensively the works of Milton Friedman, the shaman of the University of Chicago thinkers who provided theoretical underpinnings for President Reagan's economic revolution. Klaus also admires Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard professor who is a lead architect of Poland's growth-by-pain economic plan.
The most direct free-market influence, however, comes from another Harvard professor: Martin S. Feldstein, the former chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisors. Feldstein, who is now C.E.O. of the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass., has traveled to Prague, dispensing capitalist advice and encouragement. He also has been holding a series of pro bono tutorials for Czechoslovakian economists sent to Massachusetts by Klaus to study Homo oeconomicus at Feldstein's knee. Among other prescriptions, Feldstein is advising Havel's Government to endow a market-driven social-security plan in which worker retirement accounts would be created, with the money invested in mutual funds.
Klaus has turned to America's free-market true believers in reaction to an absence of alternatives closer to home. Certainly, as economic anarchy sweeps Eastern Europe, Czechoslovakia can no longer blame -- or rely on -- Soviet domination. Comecon, the Communist Common Market that controlled almost three-quarters of Czechoslovakia's international trade, has disintegrated.
Meanwhile, the United Nations embargo of Iraq has clamped shut Czechoslovakia's access to the more than $2 billion in gas and oil that Iraq was to pay for tanks and other armaments. And Czechoslovakia's major oil supplier, the Soviet Union, has cut its shipments by about 35 percent. (The Soviets blame production problems at home, but many Czechoslovakians suspect the flow will resume after Jan. 1, when Moscow will begin demanding hard currency, rather than bartered goods, for Soviet oil.)
"A terrible coincidence, this oil crisis," Klaus tells me, with a disarming grin. "Too bad it didn't happen two years ago. We could have blamed the Communists."

KLAUS HAS HIS CRITICS WITHIN Czechoslovakia, and Valtr Komarek may be the most outspoken. "The social prices of these reforms have simply not been adequately discussed," complains Komarek, who believes Klaus is trying to change too much, too fast.
Komarek is taking a break between votes at the national Parliament, housed in an austerely post-modern building at the top of Prague's Wenceslas Square -- thus situating Parliament, locals joke, "halfway between the theater and the museum." A bearded bear of a man, Komarek is unofficial leader of the legislature's left-wing minority -- a shaky coalition of economic gradualists and some former Communists who fear that Finance Minister Klaus is leading the fledgling democracy into intense stagflation, massive unemployment and social disruption. Already, workers around the country have staged a series of demonstrations and brief, symbolic strikes.
The head of the Academy of Sciences' Economic Forecasting Institute in Prague, Komarek was Deputy Finance Minister in Havel's administration before losing out in a power struggle with Klaus. "Too many political careers have been launched mouthing the slogans of radical economic reform," Komarek complains. "There's an aggression to their politics, and a strong spiritual primitivism that reminds me of Castro coming to power in Cuba."
His critics notwithstanding, Klaus is second only to Havel in national popularity. In October he beat Havel's hand-picked candidate to win election as chairman of the Civic Forum, the coalition of dissidents responsible for last year's democratic revolution and now the nation's dominant political party.
Yet even Havel -- who appointed Klaus and took pains to express solidarity with the Finance Minister after the Civic Forum vote -- advocates a more gradual approach, as was evident in a September press conference. On a brilliantly sunny afternoon, Havel faced reporters in the great hall of Hradcany. It was the perfect opportunity to embrace free-market ideology, for appearing with him was Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain -- the woman who, along with Ronald Reagan, had been reviled by the previous regime as one of the great devils of capitalism.
But when I asked the president whether the time had come to turn over the marketplace to the entrepreneurs, Havel hesitated for a long, awkward moment before responding: "Right now we are in a transitional stage, where individual businesses are acting as though they were private, but without legal standing. The law must be articulated before we proceed."
Klaus, buoyed by his own burgeoning power, is impatient with such gradualism. "Whatever the social costs," he tells me, "they will be worse if we remain with this impossible status quo. There is no other way."

LET THE BUREAUCRATS worry about the paperwork. We are in the business of making meat," says Miroslav Petricek, a 36-year-old butcher, speaking for himself and his partner, Karel Klovcek, 32. In the bustling town of Hejnice, a half-mile down the road from the Tesla Raspenava factory, stands their popular new private meat market. This past summer Petricek and Klovcek were granted the right to take over the abandoned Government butcher shop, renovate it and start their own business.
"We make our salamis, smoke pork and even mix our own tea sausage. It disappeared from shelves because the state sausage makers were too lazy to make it," says Petricek. As he speaks, he cleaves a tenderloin from its thick layer of fat. "We plan to build a new smokehouse, as soon as we take full legal possession of our shop."
In the current environment, possession counts for considerably less than nine-tenths of the law. Under a law widely known as "the restitution act," which took effect Nov. 1, mom and pop businesses like the Hejnice meat market could be returned to their original owners. The claimants will need to prove that they lost their shops when the Communists nationalized private property in 1955. Tens of thousands of small businesses could be subject to such claims, with the resulting legal battles extending into the next century.
By opening debate on restitution, Czechoslovakia's legislators are asking a fundamental question about the nation's history: Is Czechoslovakia regaining a former state of freedom, or is it starting over again? "The whole issue of restitution is extremely difficult, perhaps impossible," says Klaus. "I don't know if there's an answer. I might almost be inclined to regard Communism as a natural dis aster and not give anything back to anybody," he says, less out of conviction than exasperation with the coming legal quagmire.
Under a law commonly called "the small-scale privatization act," several hundred thousand commercial establishments are expected to escape probate and simply be auctioned to the highest bidder. The terms: payment in full after seven days. Honest vendors, however, fear they cannot compete with the vast, illicit wealth of those who control Czechoslovakia's shadow economy: corrupt bureaucrats, black marketers and disgruntled members of the disbanding secret police. Petricek and Klovcek worry that bidding could drive the price of their butcher shop far beyond their reach.
President Havel -- who might be one of the richest men in Eastern Europe had the Communists not confiscated his family's wealth -- is determined to protect his nation from former Government officials who illegally accumulated riches during the Communist era. To Havel, this widely despised "Communist mafia" is the last and most powerful vestige of Soviet control.
In a speech Aug. 21, the anniversary of the 1968 Soviet invasion, Havel denounced "the extremely dark Slusovice-type practices" that he said were symptomatic of the moral and ethical problems plaguing Czechoslovakian industry. The reference to the United Agricultural Cooperative of Slusovice was shocking: Slusovice, a confederation of 14 villages in the Moravia region of central Czechoslovakia, had long been touted as the nation's economic showpiece; it was as if George Bush had insinuated that Disney World is a front for organized crime.
Slusovice was founded by the Communists in 1949 near Zlin, the village where Tomas Bata, the Czech shoe baron, a generation earlier had founded one of Europe's great industrial complexes. After the 1968 Soviet invasion, the once-humble Slusovice agricultural collective would become a country within a country, with massive chemical and computer factories and its own commercial airline. Under its director, Frantisek Cuba, the cooperative conducted its own foreign trade, amassed huge hard-currency reserves and -- as it now appears -- laundered perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars for Communist cronies.
The day after Havel's "dark practices" speech, Cuba resigned. This month, a law designed to confiscate assets acquired illegally by the criminal underworld is scheduled to take effect.

IN CAMBRIDGE, MASS., 3,900 miles from Prague, Martin Feldstein discusses the fledgling democracy as if he were talking about a bright but stubborn pupil. "I can hardly believe that the Havel administration's highest priority is finding out who has accumulated capital illegally," Feldstein tells me. "Their biggest problem is that after 40 years under a command economy, a lot of their businesses just cannot compete."
Even if Feldstein is sometimes displeased with the way his counsel translates into policy, he believes he has successfully imparted the notion that the capitalist system is not necessarily fair. "Members of the current administration are prepared to accept the fact that there will be some income inequality," he says. "Some people will own Mercedes automobiles, while others will do less well."
In rejoining the world community, Czechoslovakia is eager to be seen not as an Eastern bloc country but, simply, as a European nation. Prague is west of Vienna, and the capital of a nation that, though fashioned from the spoils of World War I, has thousand-year Holy Roman roots. There is a powerful consensus among the 15.6 million Czechs, Moravians, Slovaks, Hungarians and Gypsies (or Rom, as the Romanian-descended wanderers choose to be called) that ever since Stalin's Red Army drove the Nazis from the eastern two-thirds of Czechoslovakia at the close of World War II, the nation has been dominated by an alien culture.
While Germany's robust partnership between government and industry might logically serve as the appropriate European model, Czechoslovakia is loathe to take inspiration from its historically belligerent neighbor. "We now look to the United States for entrepreneurial spirit, aggressiveness, hard work and the willingness to take risks," says the Minister of Economics, Vladimir Dlouhy, 37, a reconstructed Communist who has become one of Klaus's closest allies.
Like Zeno's famous paradox of motion -- that, by successively halving the distance between oneself and a destination, a person can travel forever and never arrive -- America's radically free market stands as a beacon toward which Czechoslovakia can strive, but may never reach. Even ardent capitalists like Finance Minister Klaus expect that at least a third of Czechoslovakia's economy will remain in the hands of the state.
Still, Czechoslovakia should have increasing opportunity to learn American-style business first hand: in October, the United States Senate passed legislation granting "most-favored-nation" trading status to the country. The move, reducing tariffs, should stimulate trade between the United States and Czechoslovakia, which currently exchange only about $135 million worth of goods each year. The American Ambassador to Prague, Shirley Temple Black, is a personal friend of President Havel's and had lobbied Washington aggressively for the most-favored-nation bill -- not merely to give a break to her host nation, but to pave the way for American exports.

THE CENTER OF Slovakian industry and heritage is Martin, home to the giant Zavody Tazkeho Strojarstva (Z.T.S.) industrial complex, where military tanks are made. Ask anyone in Martin, "Who is in charge of the Z.T.S. complex?" and they will tell you how to find the house of the popular factory director, Jan Segla, who lives six miles away.
The three-bedroom split-level is modest, by American standards. In Slovakia, however, such a private home is a showplace. The bearded man who appears at the outside second-floor landing is clad in jeans and a "Levi's 501 Original" T-shirt. He has the build of an N.F.L. lineman. But he is a friendly giant, and he graciously welcomes the American visitors who have turned up at his door unexpectedly on a Sunday afternoon.
By the time he has poured a second round of Bulgarian brandy, Jan Segla is ready to speak his mind. "Havel and Klaus tell us to get out of the military business, but no one in the Government seems very interested in our future," says Segla. He is voicing a widely held sentiment that the current administration, dominated by Prague sophisticates, disdains the heavy industry that drives Slovakia's regional economy.
Regionalism remains a sensitive issue here in the easternmost of the country's three ethno-geographic areas. Moravia tends to look west to Bohemia's Prague for its cultural and political cues. But nationalists in Slovakia, which as recently as World War II was a semiautonomous German satellite, have struggled to preserve their Slovak heritage.
The factories of Slovakia made Czechoslovakia the world's sixth-largest arms exporter by selling low-priced weaponry to the Warsaw Pact nations and to the Middle East. Many Slovaks deride the plan of Havel and Klaus -- who are Czech -- to withdraw from the global arms trade as a "Pollyanna policy" that will emasculate the region's industrial might. But President Havel has argued that weapons are not only bad morals but bad business; more than half the bills, now most notably from Iraq, never get paid.
Segla, a Slovak, was elected director of Z.T.S. last February by the 14,000 employees of the complex, which is surrounded by barbed wire and guardhouses. "Our Zetor tractors are already the fourth-largest brand in the world, and our tank factories can be retooled to produce bulldozers, earth movers, steamrollers and dump trucks. But we need 3.7 billion crowns [about $150 million] in federal loan guarantees to do it."
Segla keeps the brandy flowing as he describes agreements he has negotiated with two manufacturers of construction equipment -- Germany's Hanomag and Dallas-based Dresser Industries -- to modernize Z.T.S.'s facilities and market Zetor products abroad. But those deals depend in large part on obtaining domestic financial backing.
Supplicants for federal support sooner or later find themselves in Prague, at the State Economics Ministry. There, in order to meet with Minister Dlouhy in his third-floor office, one must hazard the building's perpetual-motion elevator, a continuous loop of one-person cabins.
"The fact is that Czechoslovakians, per capita, are the heaviest producers and consumers of steel products in the world," says Dlouhy, who believes the nation must move beyond its reliance on heavy industry and evolve into a postindustrial economy. As the man spearheading the Government's privatization program, Dlouhy -- also a Czech -- will wield considerable influence over which businesses will survive. "Over the next few years there will be a substantial number of bankruptcies. If some of them hit inefficient heavy industries, then I say, thank God."
Working with Klaus, Dlouhy has crafted the pending "large-scale privatization act," designed to convert major state-owned enterprises like Z.T.S. into shareholding corporations -- where the profit motive would replace Communism's production-quota system. Under the innovative privatization plan, vouchers will be issued to virtually all Czechoslovakian citizens who, for a nominal flat fee, will then have the right to redeem vouchers for shares in any company they choose. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are helping the Government plan a stock exchange.
Vouchers will garner only about one third of all corporate shares issued, because redemption will generate no new capital. With domestic capital scarce and politically problematic, foreign investment becomes the obvious source of funds.
Czechoslovakia is also seeing some of its richest expatriates return to invest in the homeland. Thomas Bata, the 75-year-old son of Tomas, immigrated to Canada 50 years ago and built Toronto-based Bata into the world's largest shoe business. Today, Thomas Bata is negotiating to reclaim part of Czechoslovakia's state-run shoe company in Zlin, or form a joint venture with the Government to modernize the facility.
Boris Korbel, who fled Czechoslovakia for the United States in 1968, has come home in hopes of buying Sparta Prague, the nation's top soccer team. Korbel's Upper Deck Company of Yorba Linda, Calif., is one of the largest American producers of sports trading cards, and he hopes to use the Prague team as a way to launch a line of European soccer cards.

EVEN THOUGH HE speaks virtually no English and has no relatives in the United States, Jaroslav Leshner calls himself "a Czech-American patriot" because of his fascination with denim and its iconographic power in American popular culture. Leshner, 32, is the type of home-grown entrepreneur on which Czechoslovakia's capitalist experiment ultimately depends.
The Prague-based fashion designer invented a new method for dyeing denim in the mid-1980's. To obtain a patent, however, he was forced to swear that his process had been developed in conjunction with Polytechna, the Government's technical monopoly. The director of the Socialist Youth Organization, offended at the hip-hugging Western decadence inherent in denim, maneuvered to get the patent classified as a national secret. Leshner was forbidden to travel abroad for fear of what he might divulge. In retaliation, he recruited a corps of Prague fashion models to tour his designs across Western Europe in order to generate hard currency.
Since the revolution, Leshner has recovered his patent and reassembled his loyal team of 10 sales and production workers -- each of whom will become a partner after the privatization laws are passed. He recently contracted with a factory in Bohemia to fulfill his first export order, worth approximately $1.2 million, for a distributor who represents some 500 French clothing stores. That, he vows, is merely a start.
"I have hired a lawyer and a business manager, and I am also taking management courses," says Leshner, who has moved back into his Prague boutique, Monako. "The languages are the hardest. My best contacts are in France. And, of course, everyone says I must learn some English." He bends down to reclaim his denim hat from the teeth of his Great Dane puppy. "For 14 years I studied Russian," he says. "But the only time I ever used it was to curse the Soviets."

BYLINE: BY TIM RACE; Tim Race is an editor of this magazine.

 BODY:
AT 10:30 ON A THURSDAY MORNING, Michael Berger and Polly Siegel are at work, tracking the price activity of nearly two dozen futures contracts. Seven personal computers feed information from around the world into the four, color video monitors lined up in front of the traders.
The screens are divided into multiple windows, each window offering a different view of the relentless flow of numbers by which the futures game is played. One shows Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index. Another gives the Dow Jones Industrials, down five points on this day. Over here are bond prices. Down there are precious metals; next to them, currencies; elsewhere such commodities as cocoa, coffee, sugar . . . 
 The kaleidoscope of raw data could seem bewildering -- unless like the 42-year-old Berger you've been betting the ebb and flow of commodities prices for the better part of two decades.
He types a keyboard command, and at the bottom of one monitor a gray band appears, displaying a rolling stream of stock symbols and prices from the New York Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, Siegel, 38, searches a screen for the talismanic clues that might tell her to buy a May coffee contract or unload September soybeans. A red bar at the bottom of her screen continually flashes a message: waiting for trades.
If the technology seems the minimum one would expect at any modern brokerage house, consider this: Michael Berger and Polly Siegel, husband and wife, are working at home. Much of the information on their screens comes from a satellite dish on the roof of their house, which sits in the rolling New Jersey countryside 50 miles southwest of New York City.
Suddenly, Siegel's monitor beeps. "Price check," she says. "Coffee." One of their trading programs has alerted them to a big price drop in the past five minutes for the commodity, which was already down 260 points (the equivalent of 2.6 cents) on the day. This is good news for Berger
and Siegel. They have three short positions in coffee, bets that the price will drop.
Siegel studies the data on the screen. "Are you interested in selling at the market price?" she asks, proposing they take a fourth short position. There is no excitement in her voice, no baccarat tension. She might just as easily be asking if he wants to subscribe to TV Guide.
"What signal is that on?" replies Berger, who has programmed a number of different buy-and-sell cues into the system -- signals that alert him to pricing patterns that might be of interest.
She identifies the signal that has just been activated by its shorthand name: "good close."
"Sure," he says. "Go ahead."
Siegel phones the broker: "Sell one September coffee at the market."
Berger types a command and a red bar appears -- the scoreboard for the $200,000 of their own money they have in play. "Right now," he says, "we're up $3,800 on the day."
They have been using their electronic trading post for more than a year. Each weekday morning, when much of the investment world is filing into the urban temples of high finance, Berger and Siegel simply walk upstairs to the second floor. There, in a room overlooking their indoor swimming pool, they log on to their personal computers and dive into the swift currents of the global financial data stream.
Berger and Siegel, emblematic of a small but growing number of financial professionals, are fulfilling the personal computer's long-vaunted promise of revolutionizing the way people live and work. In the past few years, a confluence of faster hardware, better software and the centrifugal forces spinning people and jobs away from Wall Street has made the PC an entrepreneurial enabler -- cutting adventurous investment professionals loose from institutional or corporate ties.
Frederic B. Shipley, editor of Computerized Investing, a newsletter published by the nonprofit American Association of Individual Investors, notes that the ranks of such investment go-it-aloners are probably thin. Still, he guesses that serious PC investors, like gold prospectors quietly working their claims, might be a larger group than he or anyone else realizes. "I suspect some of them have the feeling that they have something good going, and they don't want anyone to know about it."
Once a floor trader on the New York Commodities Exchange, Berger founded a discount commodities brokerage on Wall Street with his wife in 1978. In 1981, they sold the business and began trading for their own account from home, but without the high-tech equipment they now have.
Five years later, they dropped out of the commodities business to start a monthly public-affairs magazine that folded after 10 issues. When they resumed trading, in 1988, Berger says, "I found getting back into it very difficult. My risk tolerance had changed. People get more conservative as they age. So I decided that if I could develop a software system that would take the principles I've used over the years for trading and automate them, then the risk-tolerance factor would not hamper the results."
As of five minutes to noon, the couple, who typically take in between $3,000 and $8,000 a day, are up $8,600. "When I get some more aggressive trading strategies programmed in," says Berger, looking at the $75,000 worth of hardware and software arrayed before him, "this will be throwing off a considerable amount of money."
Siegel points to one of the ornaments in the room. Propped between a pair of brass bookends -- one a bull, the other a bear -- is a Cowardly Lion doll. "That's to give us the courage to do this," she explains. The doll wears a button that says, "Don't Postpone Joy."

 I N AN AGE WHEN MONEY increasingly is reduced to a stream of data, PC technology is letting individuals and small financial firms manipulate that data in complex ways.
"Without the personal computer, I wouldn't have a business," says 48-year-old Marc O'Brien, formerly a Lehman Brothers bond salesman and lecturer at the Harvard Business School. "When I started on my own in 1986, I started without a computer. It took me a month just to prepare the quarterly statements for five clients." Now, with two assistants and three networked I.B.M.-compatible PC's and a laser printer, O'Brien manages $15 million for the 80 investors he serves from an office in a Cambridge, Mass., six-story commercial building overlooking Harvard Square.
Specializing in no-load mutual funds, O'Brien uses a portfolio-management software package to perform detailed rate-of-return and asset-allocation analyses for his clients' accounts. Several times a day, he uses a modem to tap into such on-line data bases as the Warner Computer Systems Exchange Master service to keep tabs on the market and the 175 mutual funds he monitors. By retrieving prices and dividend data from the Warner service, and employing a $300 software package called Fund Master T.C. to mine that data for moving averages and other trends, O'Brien is able to apply his own criteria for comparing the relative performance of similar funds.
In mid-1989, O'Brien felt that common stocks were overvalued. "The reward-to-risk ratio seemed higher in foreign bonds," he says. But which foreign-bond fund would he pick? After analyzing the historical performance of the T. Rowe Price International Bond fund, the Scudder International Fund and several others, O'Brien shifted 20 percent of his clients' money into Scudder. In the last 12 months, the fund gave investors a total return of 19.97 percent -- 10 percentage points higher than the average for international income funds and more than 11.25 points better than the T. Rowe Price offering.
Like most professional PC users today, O'Brien employs computers based on the Intel 80286 microprocessor. Popularly known as the 286, this microprocessor is the thumbnail-sized, integrated-circuit chip that represents both brain and central nerv ous system for desktop computers.
The 286-based machines, either by I.B.M. or one of its imitators, are widely available for between $600 and $2,000. With such a computer, a user can insert a new pricing variable into a spreadsheet containing 2.1 million separate items of information and have the whole thing updated in 30 seconds.
These PC's, however, are rapidly giving way to faster (and more expensive) I.B.M.'s and I.B.M. clones based on 386 and even speedier 486 chips. Such machines, which generally sell in the $2,000-to-$20,000 range, have the processing capabilities once found only in mainframe computers costing millions of dollars. Berger and Siegel, who trade in real time and therefore demand high number-crunching ability, operate six 386 models in addition to their 286 machine; they pay two programmers $5,000 a month to keep this ensemble in tune and another $1,500 a month for on-line services.
Apple Computer's Macintosh personal computer, although widely praised for its ease of use, is rarely the first choice among investment professionals. "Real users are using I.B.M.'s or compatibles," says Shipley, of Computerized Investing. "There are 10 times the number of software programs available, relative to what's available for the Macintosh."
O'Brien has an estimated $15,000 invested in hardware and software and spends another $720 a year in on-line access charges and update packages for his software. "In the past, only a large institution could have afforded to do what I'm doing," he says.
If the big brokerage firms, with their legions of analysts and economists, do not yet feel threatened by the ascendant Little Guy, they are at least aware of his presence. "There's much more integration of information than there was 10 years ago. There's much more computerization," says Richard D. Malone, a partner at Edward D. Jones & Company, a brokerage house. Malone also serves as the chairman of the information systems committee for the Securities Industry Association, a group that represents most of the major houses. "The individual," he says, "can now access the same information that the brokerage houses can. If he's willing to pay for it."

A WEALTH OF INFORMATION is available instantaneously through on-line data bases. Plug into Mead Data Central's popular Lexis Financial Information Service, and you have electronic access to 10-K and 10-Q reports, plus abstracts of more than a dozen other types of Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Or dip into the Disclosure database, which makes you privy to abstracts of information that 11,000 companies have handed over to the S.E.C. in the past two years.
The cost, however, can be daunting. In the case of Lexis, rates run $39 an hour, plus $6 to $35 per individual search and a monthly service charge of $50. "You pay a lot of money for connect time," Shipley says, "and if you don't know what you want before you log on, you're going to go broke before you get rich." An alternative to using on-line data bases is the CD-ROM optical disk, which can store massive amounts of historical information but comes with its own steep price: $7,000 to $20,000 a year, depending on the data base and the options selected.
On the windswept steppe of south central Michigan, Margaret Moore, a portfolio manager, oversees a $5 million to $10 million portion of tiny Hillsdale College's trust funds. In addition, Moore manages $2 million for a handful of conservative private clients. She cannot afford extravagance, but she cannot afford to be without timely information, either. "I need to be on-line with a data base to do what I do," says Moore, 51, a former broker with a regional firm, First of Michigan.
Moore makes judicious use of the on-line Dow Jones News Retrieval Service, a broad compendium of news, stock quotes and other selected information from more than 20 separate financial data bases. According to Link Resources, a New York-based research firm that has studied the use of PC's among the work-at-home set, News Retrieval is the most popular financial-information service.
"I'm on and off it at least once a day," Moore says of News Retrieval. The prime-time connection fees can approach $3 a minute, meaning Moore must plumb News Retrieval efficiently to keep her monthly tab below $500.
To cite but one example: when she had an opportunity to buy 1997-series bonds from Southern California Edison, Moore took a quick tour through News Retrieval. She checked the company's bond rating, then looked to see "if there had been any news in the past year that might alert me to increased debt or any defaults by the company." Things looked bright for the electric company, so Moore purchased 25 of the discounted $1,000 bonds.
Moore has a full-time secretary and a part-time accountant to handle the extensive tax-reporting requirements for the college's trust funds. "Without my PC," she says, "I would need a lot more people."

KENT, CONN., 80 miles northeast of Manhattan, is the archetypal bed-and-breakfast New England village, replete with a steepled, white clapboard Congregational church. Scattered over the rolling, wooded Kent countryside are New Yorkers' weekend homes. It was here that, two years ago, James S. and Katherine N. Vick -- toting their M.B.A. degrees, two small children and a PC -- decided to take early retirement from the 80's and make a full-time residence of their weekend retreat. The plan: to chart and trade commodities.
Kate Vick, who is 38, had put in 10 years as a management consultant at Arthur Young & Company and a stint as chief financial officer at Aspex Inc., a small computer manufacturer in Manhattan's SoHo district. James, now 39, had 14 years of international finance experience in his portfolio, most recently as a vice president in the foreign-exchange department of Manufacturers Hanover Trust.
According to Kate, their son Charles, then 4, was "beginning to bounce off the walls" of their rented Greenwich Village apartment. Baby Sarah, then 1, was seeing more of the nanny than of her parents, whose long working hours kept them from enjoying much of what Manhattan has to offer its achievers. So the Vicks agreed to move to their "contemporary farmhouse" -- a modified saltbox they had built in 1985 on a secluded four-acre plot.
To subsidize their fledgling investment practice, Kate is drawing upon her New York business contacts to build a full-time consulting practice. James, meantime, spends each weekday in the office that was once their garage, creating algorithms that help him take positions in commodities futures. Although Kate acts as strategic planner for the trading operation, she leaves the market analysis to him. "One of the things I have realized is that to sit in this room in front of a computer screen will not make me happy," she says. "But it makes James very happy."
Compared with Polly Siegel and Michael Berger's command center, the Vicks' operation is minimalist. James, who claims he didn't even know how to turn on a PC before arriving at Manufacturers Hanover in 1986, calls himself a mathematician who happens to use a computer. He has one 286-based PC, with a modem he seldom uses, and a modestly equipped Zenith laptop computer. He gets his prices from the daily newspaper and by phoning his discount broker in Chicago. Mostly, James has his theories, which he first tested on a handful of commodities before venturing into deeper waters with $50,000 in margins and reserves.
"For some strange reason," he says drily, "an effective trading system doesn't just pop out at you from the computer. The approach that I've been taking is not to gear up with hardware or software or on-line systems before I really feel a need.
"When I was in banking, as a manager I became very aware of the overhead in this business. You can get all kinds of machines. You can get neat graphics and lots of computing power. But I became convinced while I was at the bank that all that fancy stuff didn't assure one of success in trading; if you build up your overhead, that means you've got to make significantly more money just to break even."

UNLIKE SIEGEL AND Berger, who are monitoring prices in five-minute intervals and may adjust their positions several times a day, James Vick follows only daily closes. His approach, therefore, can be more technologically lean, and he frequently holds a single contract for two or three weeks.
As do many commodity traders, James relies on technical analysis -- the study of a commodity's historic prices to discern subtle patterns that could recur in the future. It is a quantitative method that virtually disregards such real-world market influences as killer frosts in the Brazilian coffee plantations or Saddam Hussein's seizing Kuwaiti oil fields.
"The whole foundation of my trading systems is historical testing," he explains. "If you're just using monthly charts and drawing trendlines, you can do technical analysis with a pencil. And they've been doing it that way for 30 or 40 years. But computers can give you a greater degree of confidence. You can back-test data -- the more, the better."
When the Vicks first struck out on their own, James worked up six trading systems that he tested against two years' worth of historical daily market data. "The systems looked fantastic. We got them up and running. And over six months, we gradually lost money. We learned a few lessons, including: two years' worth of data is not enough."
And so, a little more than a year ago, he purchased a $2,000 software package called System Writer Plus from Miami-based Omega Research. With it, James has been able to devise five new systems and back-test his theories against market data going back 20 years.
In the few months he experimented with these new systems -- with positions in Treasury bills and bonds, Eurodollars, Swiss francs, British pounds and Japanese yen -- he made $1,000 a month on average. "It's small money for these positions, but it did help keep me abreast of the market," he says.
It was his wife, the strategist, who persuaded him to create a spreadsheet program to demonstrate how these positions and systems would have performed, had they been in effect for a randomly selected 10-year test period. The results, when tested against the 1977-1987 period: an annual 80 percent profit.
"What this shows," says Kate, explaining a printout, "is that 55 percent of the time you make money each day. Sixty percent of the time you make money each week. And 65 percent of the time you make money each month."
And 35 percent of the months are losers, she quickly adds. "We have to be prepared, financially and psychologically, to be down $40,000 at any given time in this portfolio."
Like just about everyone else in this relatively new game of PC investing, the Vicks are still feeling their way. If the master plan plays out, they will perfect their systems and eventually manage other people's money -- a business James says can net 20 percent of the client's trading profit. But, before then, he expects to spend many thousands more hours testing his ideas on the computer. "I don't consider five systems to be sufficient diversification," James says. "I would much rather have 10 systems, 15 systems."
And Kate is willing to stay the course. "I have a tendency, much more than James, to want to be in the fast lane," she says. "But the idea of sitting in the country and looking out my window and seeing grass and rabbits is bearable because I can also say, 'Yes, but we also have a contract in wheat, and there are exciting things going on in the market.' "

HEADLINE: COVER STORY;
The Travelers Rides Into The Storm

BYLINE: BY JILL ANDRESKY FRASER; Jill Andresky Fraser, the financial strategies editor at Inc., has been following the insurance industry for 10 years.

 BODY:
AS 1990 DRAWS TO ITS GLOOMY CLOSE, the landscape is littered with the fallen idols of American finance -- greedy corporate takeover artists and investment bankers and the spendthrifts of the savings and loans. Now a new candidate emerges from an unlikely quarter: the insurance industry with its $1.9 trillion in assets. Once synonymous with the utmost fiscal prudence, insurers, the experts in managing risk, are themselves at risk. Though the crisis has been building for a decade, it has gone almost unnoticed until the last few years.
1988. Following a consumer revolt over soaring prices and redlining, California's voters hurl Proposition 103 at automobile and property insurers, requiring them to roll back rates by 20 percent. The animus spreads. Within a year, more than 14,000 bills are brought before the nation's state legislatures to control an industry that is virtually without Federal regulation. 
 1989. An actuary's nightmare: Hurricane Hugo, the San Francisco earthquake and other acts of God cost insurers $7.6 billion, the worst year for natural-disaster claims in the United States. About 80 property-casualty and life insurance companies become insolvent.
1990. In June, The Travelers Corporation, the company that invented car insurance back in 1897, announces it will stop selling auto and homeowner policies in nine states. Other major insurers follow suit, thereby provoking further consumer ire.
Meanwhile, a Congressional subcommittee, having published its report detailing the rising number of insolvencies among property-casualty insurers, turns to life and health insurers. Many companies in this sector of the industry, which controls 72 percent of insurance assets, are mired in the most troubled areas of the financial markets. These giant investors have committed $278.9 billion to real-estate and mortgage holdings and $50.7 billion to junk bonds.

ON FRIDAY, OCT. 5, ALARM BELLS SOUNDED IN THE country's insurance capital, Hartford, Conn. Travelers reported it was adding $650 million to reserves against potential mortgage and real-estate losses and -- even more ominous -- that it was cutting its quarterly stock dividend by one third, the first dividend cut in the company's history. Insurance industry analysts, some of whom had been recommending the company's depressed stock as a buying opportunity, were outraged. Moody's Investor Service and Standard & Poor's immediately downgraded about $1 billion in Travelers' debt.
The following Monday morning, Columbus Day, Travelers called an early-morning meeting at Manhattan's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in an effort to rally 100 analysts and institutional investors to its side. Edward H. Budd, the 57-year-old chairman of Travelers and the epitome of the hitherto anonymous executives who have traditionally run the insurance monoliths, strode confidently to the dais set up in the Jade Room. On his lapel, the graying C.E.O. wore a pin in the form of a red umbrella, Travelers' corporate symbol. The former actuary admitted that Travelers was preparing for its first year-end loss ever. (Indeed, three weeks later, the company announced a $499.3 million net loss for the third quarter.) But Budd's tone was upbeat. The dividend cut was a conservative step, he asserted, and Travelers, far from being the worst case in an ailing industry, was merely the first to acknowledge the current economic slump and to set aside money for future growth.
When Budd opened the meeting to questions, however, he was stunned by the audience's hostility. Brushing aside his generalities about prudence, the analysts demanded specifics about Travelers' investment portfolio.
Budd, along with Allan D. Schuster, the chief of Travelers Realty Investment Company, reluctantly disclosed that as much as 20 percent, or $3.5 billion, of the company's $17.2 billion mortgage portfolio had been classified as underperforming, and $275 million worth of loans were 90 days delinquent. Pressed further, Budd, sounding edgy, revealed that investment losses had cost his company $2 per share in 1989, and another probable $2.60 per share by the end of 1990.
At 10:20 A.M., a shaken Ed Budd adjourned the meeting. In the next few hours, Travelers' stock dropped $2, racking up a decline of nearly one-third of its value in two trading days. The shares of other insurance companies tumbled as well.
Gloria L. Vogel, an industry analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company who attended Travelers' meeting, says, "Management has lost its credibility with Wall Street. We don't know what's coming next." John B. Neff, portfolio manager of the Windsor Fund, which holds 5.3 million Travelers shares, laments, "I've never before seen this level of concern over the quality of their assets."
In an interview a week after the meeting, Budd professed surprise at the severity of Wall Street's response. "Before we decided to cut the dividend and increase reserves," he said, "we went through a very careful process of assessing all our options." With its real estate holdings caught in a depressed market, accounting measures seemed the only solution. "Our external options," he said, "are very limited."

WITH ITS MASSIVE HOLDINGS OF corporate and Government securities and real estate, the insurance industry has been a traditional bedrock of the economy. For investors, company stocks have represented a safe, sound way to participate in the best of American commerce.
"There isn't anything that goes on in this country -- economic change, social change, you name it -- that doesn't come through these doors," says Ed Budd. "You can't turn on your car without insurance. You can't get a mortgage without insurance. You can't start a business without it."
The insurance industry, one of the least glamorous of essential services, sells peace of mind. Its advertising slogans are couched in understated generalities -- Allstate's "You're in good hands"; State Farm's "Like a good neighbor"; Travelers' "You're better off under the umbrella" -- that nonetheless imply a social contract. The insurance company would provide protection for those who needed it and were willing to pay a reasonable price. But the contract began to unravel during the 1980's when insurers raised rates and refused to cover numerous would-be customers.
Bill Schwartz, a retail salesman in Rockville, Md., and his wife, Stephanie, bought car coverage from Travelers. From 1987 to 1990, the insurance rates on their Hyundai grew from $530 a year to $1,744 a year -- a 229 percent increase. "They raised us 11 times in 4 years," says Stephanie Schwartz, "but Travelers never told us why." The rate increases apparently resulted from moving violations and claims the Schwartzes made, yet in 1990 the couple was able to buy coverage from Allstate for $1,730 a year for both of their cars.
In order to attract customers, insurers often set rates below the company's actual cost of providing insurance. "Industry executives always say they're going to be disciplined about profit levels," complains Paul Gregory, a New York-based industry consultant. "But when everyone is cutting prices all around them, they're like a bunch of junkies who just can't say no." And, when faced with the inevitable losses caused by price slashing, insurers strayed beyond their traditional conservative investment strategies.

TRAVELERS, FOUNDED IN 1864, WAS THE NATION'S first provider of accident insurance, selling a Hartford banker a 2-cent policy against disaster during his daily four-block walk home for lunch. The following year, Travelers began selling life insurance. The company, which prides itself on being "multiline," offers a variety of coverage. By spreading costs over a spectrum of products, Travelers and other multilines try to balance out cyclical risks and maximize profits.
Today, Travelers is a giant of the industry with its 35,000 employees, $56.6 billion in assets and annual revenues of $12.5 billion. The Travelers Insurance Company ranks eighth in life insurance assets and the Travelers Insurance Group ranks tenth in property-casualty premiums. But the industry is so crowded -- 2,400 life insurers and 3,850 property-casualty companies -- even a company the size of Travelers holds no more than a 2 percent market share in any of its biggest lines.
Through the years, Travelers has shared its umbrella with victims of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the sinking of the Titanic and the torpedoing of the Lusitania. Property-casualty insurance covers the risks inherent in driving a car or owning a house or running a business. While an insurer cannot know when or whether a particular customer will file a claim, the actuarial premise holds that, given a large enough pool of customers, premiums from the whole will cover damages to the few.
But this equation has been battered in recent years by unforeseen developments -- lawsuits over product liability, for example, and environmental disasters such as the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989. Claims arising from such catastrophes can be huge, even though insurers spread their risk among other companies. Travelers is the lead insurer for the Shell Oil Company's cleanup of polluted ground waters at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal near Denver, a claim that could cost from $1 billion to $4 billion. Travelers has fought the claim on the grounds that Shell knew it was polluting the water.
Likewise, the tendency of juries in the mid-1980's to expand the notion of liability in workers' compensation cases has led to an industrywide leap in claims, from $17.8 billion in 1984 to $34.1 billion in 1989. Claim costs and expenses for workers' compensation have exceeded premiums since 1970. At Travelers, this line of insurance ranks second only to automobile insurance in property-casualty premiums. In 1989, it paid out $1.4 billion in workers' compensation claims on premiums of $1.35 billion.
"Insurance is unlike any other business," says Paul Gregory, the consultant. "It has simply gotten more and more impossible to predict the actual cost of insurers' products at the time that they're being priced and sold."
In the 1970's, when interest rates began to soar, a practice called "cash flow underwriting" spread across the property-casualty industry. Insurers cut prices far below projected costs in order to win market share and then shifted some premium payments away from such traditional investments as utilities and into high-yield Treasury bills, certificates of deposit and other interest-rate-sensitive instruments.
"The discipline of demanding good prices and underwriting results was weakened, because whatever cash was brought in could be invested at 13 percent or 14 percent," says Richard J. Shima, Travelers' chief investment officer. "Companies were actually able to operate at marginally unprofitable levels." Since 1980, Travelers has paid an average of $1.11 in claims and costs for each dollar's worth of property-casualty policies sold.
Property-casualty insurance is notably cyclical, with periods of competition and falling premiums, followed by insolvencies, reduced competition and premium hikes. But with cash-flow underwriting, another option was available. When interest rates started dropping from the double-digit levels of the early 80's, insurers -- rather than raise prices and lose hard-won market share -- shopped around for higher-yield investments.
Myron M. Picoult, a specialist in insurance industry finances at Oppenheimer & Company, calculates that Travelers' junk-bond and noninvestment-grade bond holdings add up to 20.5 percent of its property-casualty statutory surplus, the quantity of liquid assets companies are required to maintain in order to cover potential claims. "It's your statutory capital that supports your risks," says Picoult. "If you're leveraged this high, you can't afford to have many of your investments go wrong before you'll get into trouble."

THE PROBLEMS OF THE insurance companies do not exactly parallel those of the savings and loans, but there are some worrisome similarities -- particularly as concerns life insurance.
Unlike property-casualty, life insurance involves known risk: any given policy will eventually pay out. Life expectancy tables determine when that is likely to happen. The companies were thus able to invest in long-term, gilt-edged bonds and mortgages. Like savings banks, life insurers made their profits on the spread between the interest they credited to the customer's account and the yield they realized from investing the customer's money.
But in the 80's, the life insurers' tranquil world was threatened by competition. Banks and brokerages offered new, high-yield financial products such as cash management accounts that sophisticated consumers found more attractive than standard life insurance. Insurance companies responded with a host of higher-yielding policies such as variable life, universal life and guaranteed investment contracts.
At the same time, the life insurance industry was feeling pressure in another part of its empire. Health insurance had been a profitable line for life insurers -- until payments were pushed into the stratosphere by the high cost of such scientific advances as organ transplants, the increased demands placed on medicine by the growing numbers of older Americans and the spread of AIDS.
With operating costs escalating in health insurance, and new financial products competing with life insurers for customer dollars, the insurance companies -- in a pattern reminiscent of the savings and loans -- went hunting for higher returns on their own investments.
"That meant leveraging themselves with all kinds of risks -- real estate, junk bonds, lower-grade municipals, private placements, foreign loans and more," says Picoult. While property-casualty insurers stayed fairly liquid to meet liabilities, life insurers were able to plunge into long-term investment risks. According to A. M. Best Company, an industry rating service, Travelers' largest life company had 41 percent of its assets, or $13.1 billion, committed to mortgages in 1989.
One analyst, who followed the company until recently, confides, "We used to joke that Travelers owned the whole state of Idaho," the result of having to foreclose on so many nonperforming farm loans. Even more costly was what Travelers' investment guru, Shima, describes as a "geographic concentration of risk in oil- and energy-related areas" in the Southwest. At the October analysts' meeting, Allan Schuster reported that the company had been averaging losses of 33 percent on $1 billion worth of foreclosed property sales since mid-1988.
In 1987 the biggest office building in Austin, Tex., 111 Congress Street, was completed -- just in time for the collapse of the city's commercial real estate market. Travelers had invested $65 million in the project. Three years later, 19 percent of 111 Congress still stands vacant. The rest of the building has been leased out at rates Coldwell Banker's Austin office estimates at 50 percent below projected rents.
And real estate is not the only risky investment on the life insurance side. According to Picoult, in 1989 Travelers' $12 billion bond portfolio had $909 million -- 54 percent of its statutory surplus -- invested in junk and noninvestment-grade bonds. Included were a handful of Time Warner bonds and more than $85 million worth of R.J.R. Nabisco bonds, bearing a 12 percent interest rate. Even before the fall of junk bonds, the Travelers Insurance Company portfolio was lagging. Its $32 billion worth of life and health insurance assets yielded only 8.6 percent last year, according to A. M. Best, which ranked it near the bottom of the 20 largest life and health insurers in terms of performance. Only Equitable was worse, earning 8.2 percent.
Since insurers, like banks, carry many of their investments on the books at cost, rather than at the more realistic market value, it is difficult to assess the value of portfolios. And there is no telling what other losses exist in Travelers' mortgages and real-estate loans, nearly 75 percent of which are invested in office and apartment buildings.
In a serious recession, such investments could prove devastating. IDS Life Insurance, part of American Express, has conducted a six-month study into the solvency of the nation's largest life insurers only to conclude, in the words of James A. Mitchell, the C.E.O., that "20 percent of them would be at serious risk of failing in the event of an economic downturn." The biggest risk, he emphasizes, comes from investment illiquidity. "In a downturn, it won't just be junk bonds that become worthless and unsellable -- it will be real estate, mortgages, investments in affiliated companies and more."

IN 1945, THE INSURANCE industry mobilized Congressional support to pass the McCarran-Ferguson Act, under which insurers are exempt from Federal oversight. Insurance regulation -- what little there is -- takes place at the state level. With no uniform national standards of real significance, the regulatory system is sporadic and largely ineffectual. In its study, IDS found capital and surplus requirements too low. New York is the only state that requires insurers to match the duration of their investments and their liabilities.
"There are obvious differences in the quality and regulations throughout the states," acknowledges Terence Lennon, chief examiner of life insurance for the State of New York. His department, with 800 employees, is generally considered the best of the state regulators. "There are states that literally have only a handful of people regulating the entire industry."
John D. Dingell, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, has been running hearings into the soundness of the property-and-casualty insurance industry -- in response to the 300 percent rise in the number of "problem" insurance companies over the past decade. In his report, entitled "Failed Promises," Dingell warns, "Because the ill effects of fraud and gross incompetence may be hidden for 10 years or more after a policy is written, the problems . . . could quickly escalate into a real threat to the solvency of the insurance industry if reforms are not implemented very soon."
One insurer that drew subcommittee attention was Transit Casualty, chartered in Missouri, but based in Los Angeles. In 1985, after a state audit turned up worrying financial news, Missouri's regulators ordered Transit to stop selling policies.
During the four years between Missouri's audits, the subcommittee concluded, "Transit filed false and misleading regulatory reports. . . . There is no evidence of any regulatory review that discovered the errors."
The Missouri courts ordered Transit liquidated in 1985 and its receiver predicted the collapse would cost the state guarantee funds $400 million. That was before regulators discovered how fraudulent the insurer's filings were and how disastrous its underwriting mistakes had been. Current projections now run as high as $4 billion.
Since there is no national oversight, there is no obligation that the United States Government bail out basket cases like Transit. That responsibility has fallen to the industry itself, in the form of a patchwork system of guarantee funds, which operate in most but not all states.
When an insurer becomes insolvent, the insurance companies doing business in the state are responsible for paying off claims. With no nationwide regulations or funding standards, many state funds appear woefully inadequate when their financial reserves are compared to potential liabilities. "We've got a solvency guarantee system that counts on healthy insurers bailing out insolvent companies," says John B. Chesson, a counsel to the House subcommittee. "We're afraid that the cost of future bailouts could get so high it could push even the healthy companies under." And, needless to say, the consumers in the state end up footing the bill, in the form of higher premiums.
Chesson says, "Just as with the savings-and-loan industry, the regulatory system only works for companies that want to comply. The system isn't geared to prevent problems, to detect problems and to punish wrongdoers."
Congress, therefore, has put heat on state insurance regulators. "We have clearly gotten the message that either the states will shape up or someone else is going to take over our regulatory responsibilities," says Earl R. Pomeroy, the North Dakota insurance commissioner and outgoing president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. He and other state regulators are seeking to establish uniform standards. First and foremost, they want the state agencies to perform C.P.A. audits of the insurers' annual filings (35 states do not) and on-site audits every three years.
Industry experts believe that, even with regular audits, more insurers will fail if consumers demand lower rates while the industry's investment portfolio worsens. Analyst Martin Weiss of West Palm Beach, Fla.-based Weiss Research recently concluded that only 91 out of the 2,000 life insurers monitored were adequately capitalized to withstand a severe recession.
Travelers was not among them. Neither were four of the nation's five other major providers of both life and health insurance: Aetna, Cigna, Kemper and Transamerica.

FROM A DISTANCE, Hartford, Conn., looks something like the Emerald City, a landscape of gleaming glass-and-steel buildings; up close, the decay of the urban center becomes apparent. Three giants of the insurance industry make their home here -- Aetna, the I.T.T. Hartford Group and Travelers.
The headquarters building of Travelers, one of 22 company sites in the city, is a landmark 1919 pink granite-and-marble edifice. There in July, three months before the huge Travelers charge against earnings, Ed Budd talked about his life and the insurance industry.
A salesman's son who was raised on the outskirts of Hartford, Budd grew up convinced he would never choose insurance as a career. "I would watch neighbors who worked for insurance companies," he said. "They drove black, four-door sedans and left home each morning at 7:53 and arrived home each evening at 4:47. I said to myself, 'It's probably frightfully dull.' "
After a stint in the Navy, Budd took a bachelor's degree in physics at Tufts University in 1955, and started at Travelers the same year -- as an actuary. "It has never been dull," he says, "not one single day." Within a dozen years he was a vice president and became C.E.O. in 1981.
On a desk in his mahogany-lined corner office he keeps a marble cube engraved with the Chinese characters that spell out the word "crisis" -- one character representing danger, the other opportunity. "I hold it a lot," Budd said, turning the cube in his hands.
"We can't absorb all the uncertainties on the insurance side," he said, "and also absorb uncertainties in our investments." He looked bleak when discussing the consumer revolt. "If we were to conclude that California's rate rollback had a long life, it would be a conclusion that this country is abandoning important economic principles. I have more faith than that."
Budd places most of the blame for the industry's problems on what he calls "a continuous expansion in the theory of entitlement." In industry lingo, "entitlement" refers to everything from who's entitled to buy insurance and for what price to who's entitled to receive insurance payouts and for how much. Most recent insurance battles have centered around entitlement issues: How much should insurance cost a day-care center or a car owner in an inner-city neighborhood? Who will provide life insurance for an AIDS patient?
"Expansions in entitlement run contrary to the notion of predictability," Budd grumbled, turning to his favorite actuarial theme. He feels that the public expects too much from insurers -- what he calls the "socialization of people's expectations for compensation."
Back in July, Budd characterized his company's earnings problems as "short-term." Then, on Oct. 31, the company announced its disastrous third quarter figures.
"The problems at Travelers may be much worse than any of us know," says Herbert E. Goodfriend, an industry analyst. "I'm afraid there may have to be more dividend cuts and more write-offs, maybe next year."
Martin Weiss, the Florida analyst, calculates that Travelers would only have 30 percent of the capital it needed to withstand a major economic downturn, because of mortgage defaults and the illiquidity of its investments. The company, however, does have a substantial cushion against hard times: an investment portfolio -- half of it invested in fixed income securities -- which pulls in $3.5 billion a year.

WHEN I WAS GROWING up, my father, an insurance salesman, taught me that insurance was a business of faith -- of one man's word to another," recalls Robert Hunter, a former industry executive who runs the National Insurance Consumer Organization, a consumer activist group based in Alexandria, Va. "Now insurance has become a kind of schlock operation."
To counteract hostility, Travelers has devoted $50 million to lobbying, advertising and public relations. Timothy R. Campbell, the vice president for government affairs, says, "If we can work together with consumers who are organized already to seek safer automobiles and safer highways, then we know that will result in lower insurance claim costs." It may also help lessen consumer suspicion.
Campbell's additional mandate: to defeat state activists eager to put the screws to the industry and to counter the watchdogs in Congress who are seeking to repeal the McCarran-Ferguson Act. This year, in what has become an annual event, the House Judiciary Committee approved a repeal measure, which failed to reach the floor before Congress adjourned. Further action is expected when Congress returns in January.
Beyond damage control, Travelers is eager to cut losses on its basic businesses. This year, in an attempt to "flatten" the organizational hierarchy, the company eliminated 14 business units.
Budd has announced that, if regulations and rollbacks on automobile rates hit any one state too hard, Travelers will pull out of auto insurance in that state. Instead it will cherry-pick among the most profitable states and markets. But that approach can backfire. In mid-August, New Jersey's regulators warned the Hartford Group that, if one of its subsidiaries pulled out of the state's car insurance market, the entire company would be barred from doing business in the state.
Outside its basic business, Travelers is counting on income from a subsidiary that includes Dillon, Read, an old-line investment bank it bought in 1986 when many insurance companies were trying to become financial supermarkets. The subsidiary was responsible for $55 million in profits last year.
Travelers looks for future profit in the growing field of managed health care, which offers corporate clients Health Maintenance Organizations and employee health education. Last year, Travelers provided managed care to approximately 8.8 million people, for revenues of $2.6 billion. The operation, however, showed profit margins of only 1 percent.
Meanwhile, as the economy disintegrates, Travelers is facing an increase in fraudulent claims on both health and property-casualty insurance. In response, the company is exploring the use of artificial intelligence to pick out suspicious health claims, such as a visit to a doctor on a Sunday, the Fourth of July or Christmas or a major discrepancy in the patient's and doctor's ZIP codes. For the first nine months of this year, Travelers achieved savings of $22.4 million from its investigations.
But Travelers' efforts to rein in costs and increase profitability in its basic business are not likely to make a dent in investment losses if the real-estate market continues to fall apart. Not only Travelers, but the entire insurance industry, will be at risk should the nationally-chartered banks be allowed to sell and underwrite insurance. Only a Federal Reserve ruling in September stopped Citicorp from selling life insurance through a subsidiary in Delaware.
In fact, the insurance industry has already lost one-third of its market share to so-called "captive" insurance companies. According to H. Felix Kloman, a vice president and principal at Stamford, Conn.-based Tillinghast, a risk-management consulting firm, roughly 80 percent of the Fortune 500 companies have set up captives to provide their own insurance coverage. So have groups of small businesses and nonprofit organizations.
"Companies are fed up with the highly erratic prices, erratic levels of product availability and claims service they saw during the 1980's," says Kloman. "Companies don't do things like cash-flow underwriting when they run their own insurance captives."
Robert Hunter believes that cash-flow underwriting and other practices will lead to an industrywide shakeout. "We have -- what -- 6,000 insurance companies in this country? Most are very inefficient and badly managed. What we need is a thousand or so that know how to operate in their business profitably."
Ed Budd, faced with critics who expect the worst, recognizes that the industry -- and his company -- must adapt in order to survive. "I think in the last six months we've changed as fast as I've seen in my 35 years," he says. "When I first came to the company, I helped Travelers switch to monthly premium payments, which had never been done before. People kept saying, 'We can't keep up with the pace of change.' One fellow even had a nervous breakdown."
He pauses to offer a rare smile. "Change," he says, "is always going to be with us."

HEADLINE: Postings: From Realtors' President;
The Silver Lining

 BODY:
Although much of the country is in a real estate recession, there are encouraging words from the heartland. "Business is still very brisk in a lot of areas," said Harley E. Rouda, a Columbus, Ohio, realtor who last month was elected president of the National Association of Realtors, the country's largest trade organization of real estate professionals.
Mr. Rouda said that those regions where home sales are slumping, including the New York area, New England and Southern California, are distinquished from others by the torrid pace at which their housing rose in price in the 1980's. Where prices rose more gradually, he said, markets have remained robust. Among the healthiest states, he said, are Oregon, Washington, Oklahoma, Ohio and North Carolina.
Nor is it likely, Mr. Rouda said, that the real estate brokerage business is in for a deep, long-term decline. He predicted that the National Association, with 800,000 members this year, probably would shrink moderately to about 780,000 members next year.
Mr. Rouda, president of HER, Realtors, the largest brokerage in central Ohio, was elected to head the National Association for a one-year term running to November, 1991. Among his responsibilities will be to pitch the industry's point of view to Congress. He said his two top priorities are lobbying for a decrease in capital gains taxes on real estate and for the reinstatement of passive loss provisions for investors in rental housing, which were eliminated with the tax reform of 1986.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Mixed-Income Housing;
In Strong Locations, Economic Diversity

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
IN Manhattan, the mixed-income building financed with tax-exempt bonds came into its own as a successful form of rental housing in the mid-80's. Market rents were high enough to provide an internal subsidy for 20 percent of the tenants. They could live in new luxury buildings in desirable locations for rents of about $400 or $500 a month because other tenants were willing to pay two or three times as much to live in the same building.
Now this so-called 80-20 housing is having a harder time getting into construction, although builders with sites are available. The main problem is that banks have drawn away from construction lending. Despite the fact that tax-exempt bonds are available for the permanent financing, a bank letter of credit must be obtained by builders to guarantee the bondholders against the risks in the construction process itself. Banks are paid a fee for undertaking the risk. 
 One building company that found a bank to guarantee the construction is The Related Companies, which has accordingly gone into construction with a mixed-income building on the northwest corner of Third Avenue and 96th Street. The bank is the Mitsubishi Bank Ltd.
This as-yet unnamed building, designed by the Manhattan firm of Costas Kondylis Architects, will have 520 apartments in 30 stories and a broadly curved brick and glass facade facing southeast. The market-level rents will be about $1,400 a month for a one-bedroom apartment on a midlevel floor and $1,700 for a two-bedroom. Rents for the assisted tenants will be about a third as much.
The project testifies once again to the remarkable ability of Manhattan locations to promote economic integration, since the span of tenant incomes in these 80-20 buildings is striking. At the same time, it suggests that the cultural and educational backgrounds of tenants, more than their incomes, are what draw people together comfortably as neighbors in multifamily housing.
On the income side, occupants of market-rate units in Upper East Side mixed-income buildings are turning out to have earnings ranging from $45,000 to $75,000, or up to 200 percent of median income for a family of four in the city. Nearly everyone works. Moreover in convertible one- or two-bedroom apartments (about 40 percent of the total), there are typically two workers. Household income per two-bedroom apartment ranges from $80,000 to $130,000.
Accordingly, market rents for two-bedrooms can range upward from $20,000 a year, or about $1,700 a month. Meanwhile, moderate-income retirees and lower wage earners are living in the same building. But like their higher-earning neighbors, they are usually drawn from white-collar occupactions -- graphic arts and performing arts, publishing, social work, teaching, office work.
"YOU need a top product and a top location to make it work," says David J. Wine, president of Related Management Corporation, the management arm of The Related Companies, of the mixed-income developments. Since 1987, the number of tenants drawn from the financial services industry has declined significantly, Mr. Wine said. "But the residents are coming from other industries," he said.
Related has done 85 residential projects in the Northeast and Florida, and it manages 15,000 apartments. It is one of the country's largest users of government-assisted housing programs. Its experience with mixed-income housing is strikingly different in other locations from what it has been in Manhattan. Usually there is little difference in income between market-rate and subsidized tenants.
Typically, the difference in rent between the market-rate and the subsidized tenant is only $50 to $75 a month, Mr. Wine says. In places like Missouri, Minnesota and Florida, new rental housing is affordable to tenants earning 70 to 100 percent of median income. Even in Boston, a high-cost city, unassisted rentals are affordable to people with income of 115 percent of median.
But in New York City the market rents are almost three times more than the assisted rents. The basic reason is that there are so many working people per household. The degree of economic integration is at its zenith.
Not all buildings have been free of fiscal problems, however, despite successful rent-ups. Rents have gone up, but not at the pace predicted five years ago. At that time, some builders were mainly worried about the prospect of rising interest rates during the construction process. To the Milstein Organization, builder of the large mixed-income Normandie Court development on East 96th Street, which also used tax-exempt state bonds, it seemed prudent to get a commitment for a 10 percent fixed-rate loan. The underwriting was based on projected gains in rents of about 5 percent a year through lease renewals and turnover rents.
BUT rent increases have lagged, averaging well below permissible levels of rent stabilization guidelines, and the project is delinquent on mortgage payments. The Milstein Organization is accordingly trying to negotiate an adjustment in mortgage terms with the state's Housing Finance Agency.
The Related Companies and some other builders were luckier. They chose variable-rate mortgages that gave an effective debt cost of about 6 percent. It was a winning gamble. Had market interest rates risen, these developments, too, would have been hurt by lagging market rents.
New York City issued $250 million in bonds for mixed-income housing in 1985 and about $150 million has been used so far. The rest is committed to projects, but "credit enhancement" from major banks is needed to get them started. "Our hope is that some or all of the rest will be used in the next year," said Charles Brass, director of development for the Housing Finance Agency, the finance arm of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which has worked with developers to find the necessary financing.
It is not used in Manhattan projects only. In the Bronx, $11 million in tax-exempt financing has been plugged into the $33 million gut rehabilitation of 10 city-owned buildings on or near Sheridan Avenue from 167th Street to 170th Street, east of the Grand Concourse. Sparrow Construction Corporation, the developer, was selected for the work in January 1989. Occupancy will start in two weeks.
In this development, the city provides $18.5 million in financing at 1 percent interest, which permits the 80 percent market-rate rents to be truly affordable to the market. Tenants pay $435 to $510 for a one-bedroom, $519 to $614 for a two-bedroom and $607 to $683 for a three-bedroom.
"In the borough the program works better for rehabilitation than for new construction," said Barry Zelikson, development director for Sparrow.
In Manhattan these mixed-income developments are also helped by the automatic availability of the city's Section 421a tax abatement. For developments that are 100 percent market rate, the benefits are unavailable in the area from 14th to 96th Street unless the developer pays for certificates to generate off-site low-income housing.
The new project by Related qualifies even without these payments since its site on the north side of 96th Street is outside the excluded zone, but other sites for mixed-income buildings are within it. Developers of fully market-rate buildings in Manhattan say they have paid about $18,000 a unit to buy the certificates. By enabling them to accept lower rents or calculate reduced taxes for condominium buyers, the abatement lowers development risk, enhancing the builder's ability to get a loan.
The automatic availability of the 421a benefit is a key reason that the Brodsky Organization, for example, is considering seeking tax-exempt financing for its site on West End Avenue between 61st and 64th Street, a parking lot that formerly was the site of a New York Times printing plant. Before it went out of existence, the Board of Estimate approved a plan for 950 apartments there. Tax-exempt financing would mean that 20 percent of the apartments would rents for about $400 or $500 a month, said Daniel Brodsky, a partner in the company. But like other builders, Brodsky must find a big bank to take the construction risk.
As for Related, it too has another potential mixed-income site, on the east side of Amsterdam Avenue between 89th and 90th Streets. The company expects to build an 18-story 267-unit rental, in partnership with Kreisler Borg Florman Inc., the construction company. Cooper & Partners and Shuman Lichtenstein & Claman are the architects.
The building will complete the development of the West Side urban renewal area, where several vacant Columbus Avenue parcels were done successfully in the 80's as mixed-income rentals. The timing of construction depends on the availability of the letter of credit to guarantee bondholders during the construction period.

Random House Elects to Stay in Its Midtown Tower

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
SHOULD Random House ever discard the snug little cottage that has been its colophon since 1927, it could confidently choose as its new trademark a 40-story International style skyscraper.
For at least 29 years, the world's largest English-language trade book publisher will lease all 450,000 square feet in the office tower at 50th Street and Third Avenue where it has long been a tenant. 
 The Random House deal -- one of the largest this year in New York -- is noteworthy in several ways. The decision by the corporate giant to stay at 201 East 50th Street underscores how the falling real-estate market has restored mid-Manhattan's competitiveness against less traditional commercial areas, although downtown locales continue to draw tenants in the publishing industry.
Random House did not go into Zeckendorf Towers, on Union Square East, between 14th and 15th Streets, where some 350,000 square feet have been vacated by Integrated Resources, the financial services concern that filed for bankruptcy earlier this year.
Nor did it go into one of two projects that would add new towers to former department stores: B. Altman on Fifth Avenue, between 34th and 35th Streets, and Siegel-Cooper on the Avenue of the Americas, between 18th and 19th Streets. Nor did it go to the popular destination of Park Avenue South.
"With the Midtown market deteriorated, the need for an alternative market like Park Avenue South becomes less important," said David W. Levinson, senior managing director of the Edward S. Gordon Company, who brokered the Random House deal, with Carol Nelson and Mary Ann Tighe.
"When Midtown rents were $35 to $40 a square foot, with limited concessions, in the mid-80's, Park Avenue South was very attractive," he said. "As the market deteriorated, the gap between Midtown and Midtown South narrowed. Given the choice of being on 50th Street and being on 18th Street, our client preferred 50th Street."
Douglas Durst, vice president of the Durst Organization, which built and owns the Random House building, said the publisher's decision "demonstrates the underlying strength of the Midtown office market."
"We did not place any conscious limitations on our choices within Manhattan," said Alberto Vitale, the chairman, president and chief executive officer of Random House. "The main thing is to try to remain in Manhattan. Which part does not determine your contacts and relationships with the rest of the publishing community.
"You want to look at all of your options. The fact that we've been able to come up with an optimal -- or, let us say, competitive -- arrangement on this site presents the added advantage that we are saving ourselves the trauma of a move. People get used to the place where they work. Whether it's comfortable or not isn't the deciding factor -- they get used to it."
In its early history, Random House jumped from 73 West 45th Street to 20 East 57th Street to the Villard Houses, at Madison Avenue and 51st Street. Then, in 1969, it moved to the 50th Street skyscraper.
Random House and its imprints -- Alfred A. Knopf, Pantheon Books, Crown Publishing Group, Villard Books, Times Books, Schocken Books, Ballantine-Del Rey-Fawcett-Ivy, Vintage Books, Modern Library and Fodor's Travel Guides -- now occupy 20 floors, about 250,000 square feet.
Random House also has some 80,000 square feet in 225 Park Avenue South, at 18th Street, which it gained in 1988 with the acquisition of Crown and which it will sublet. After its consolidation at 50th Street, Random House will occupy about 350,000 square feet. It will also have 10 subtenants, some of whose leases run into the 21st century.
ONE key part of the Random House deal is the extent to which it allows the company to remain whole. "Many businesses move certain kinds of their activities out of the city, leaving only the editorial operations behind," said Alexander MacGregor 3d, executive vice president for administration. "We probably will do less of that than other publishers have been forced to do."
"While there's a premium that has to be paid for keeping a company unified in Manhattan," said Ms. Tighe of the Gordon company, "I think what you're seeing with the Random House deal is that major publishing companies are realizing that it's well spent. To keep vitality, there has to be interaction between the editorial and business sides."
What prompted the search by Random House was the impending expiration of its lease in 1994. "We wanted, as soon as was practical, to come up with a resolution of this problem so we wouldn't be faced with last-minute decisions that can cause dislocations for so many people," Mr. Vitale said.
He would say nothing about the rent under the new lease other than to call it "favorable." In a memorandum to Random House employees, Mr. Vitale also said that as a result of the new arrangement, "we will be able to fix all of the problems that have confronted us in the past (air-conditioning, elevators, ventilation, etc.)."
While Random House stayed in mid-Manhattan, Penguin USA has moved as far downtown as 375 Hudson Street, between Houston and King Streets, which is also headquarters of Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising. Included in this move were Viking Penguin, which had been at 40 West 23d Street, and NAL Dutton. NAL, the New American Library, had been at 1633 Broadway, between 50th and 51st Streets. E. P. Dutton had been at Two Park Avenue, between 32d and 33d Streets.
"The first goal was finding a suitable location within the economic constraints that were set by Penguin," said Michael R. Laginestra, vice president of Cushman & Wakefield, who brokered the deal. "Then we had to find a floor size and a building image that met the financial criteria. Then we had to match that up with a landlord who would be willing to do the kind of funding necessary for work and willing to make a contribution toward lease takeovers."
Mr. Laginestra said Peter Mayer, executive chairman of Penguin USA, was quite specific in his criteria. "He wanted people on two floors or less," the broker said. "He believes in that synergism created by constant contact with one another. And when you're looking for 60,000-square-foot floors, you have a limited supply."
SOME relatively new arrivals on Park Avenue South include Houghton Mifflin and Rizzoli International Publications. Rizzoli moved last year from the old Scribner Building, at Fifth Avenue and 48th Street, to 300 Park Avenue South, at 22d Street. Last week, it completed an expansion within that building from one to three floors, where it has been joined by its holding company, RCS Rizzoli Corporation New York.
"We moved down here because we believed it was going to develop as a Publishing Row," said Gianfranco Monacelli, the president, publisher and chief executive officer of Rizzoli International. "In fact, it has. Not that we have many contacts with our competitors, but it gives comfort that they are around."
Houghton Mifflin moved last year to 215 Park Avenue South, at 18th Street, from Vanderbilt Avenue and 45th Street. "There was some trepidation about leaving midtown," said Ms. Tighe, who was involved in the deal, "but they've found that it works very well. The pacing of the neighborhood seems to suit the industry."
"The buildings are very individualistic," she said, "not cookie-cutters. The companies liked the high ceilings and big windows. There's a sense of light, air, trees and gardens that people became used to. Housing in the immediate area is more in an acceptable price range than the Upper East Side or even Upper West Side. It's a natural environment for publishing."

HEADLINE: The Demise of 3 Hotel Proposals

BYLINE: By JOSH KURTZ

 BODY:
FIVE years ago, with an eye on the two new office complexes under construction in Somers, developers approached the neighboring towns of North Salem and Lewisboro with proposals to build three large, luxury hotels near Interstate 684.
Worried that the International Business Machines and Pepsico projects in Somers would spawn a building boom in their own rural areas, North Salem and Lewisboro changed their zoning laws in the years that followed. Hotel construction is now prohibited in Lewisboro and permitted in only a sliver of North Salem.
By all appearances, the three hotel proposals -- to build a Sheraton Country Inn in the Lewisboro hamlet of Goldens Bridge, a Crowne Plaza Hotel in the North Salem hamlet of Croton Falls, and a Ramada Inn in Croton Falls -- are dead.
One of the would-be Croton Falls developers, Gene Boshes, has just decided to sell his long-term lease on the property. Alvin Lukashok, who owns the other Croton Falls property, is suing North Salem for rezoning his property to prohibit hotel construction. And the Goldens Bridge developer, Peter Brock, has decided he would rather switch than fight and is considering town houses for his property.
 
Looking Over the Prospects
 All three developers have expressed varying degrees of irritation with the towns. But prospects for any sort of commercial development in Westchester in the next few years are so dim, said S. J. Schulman, president of the Westchester County Association business group, that "there's sort of a Rip Van Winkle feeling about development in the county."
Mr. Schulman said hotels might have been needed in the northern part of the county if more office development had taken place along I-684, as predicted in the mid-1980's.
The economic slowdown in the region -- and the fact that I.B.M. and Pepsico said they did not need hotels near their Somers plants -- has not stopped Mr. Lukashok from fighting North Salem in court, or Mr. Boshes and his partners from insisting that a hotel could be viable.
 
Benefits to Area Seen
 Alan Scheffler, a Mount Kisco lawyer who represents Mr. Lukashok, said the Manhattan-based developer was confident that with I.B.M. and Pepsico in Somers and the Trans World Airlines corporate headquarters in Mount Kisco -- all "within yelling distance" of Mr. Lukashok's 160-acre property in Croton Falls -- a hotel would benefit the area.
It is not just the corporations Mr. Lukashok is trying to serve, the lawyer said: the proposed 134-room Ramada Inn would have conference rooms, ballrooms and restaurants that would also serve North Salem and neighboring communities.
Nevertheless, Pepsico, which has 1,000 people at its beverage division in Somers, said employees from out of town who visit Somers on business are generally put up in one of several company-owned apartments throughout the county.
Jim Ruderman, an I.B.M. spokesman, said that because out-of-towners typically tour several company offices in the area in addition to the building in Somers, they could stay at hotels elsewhere in the county.
"In the worst case, people would have to drive 10 or 15 miles," he said.
 
County Called Overbuilt
 Wherever visitors in the county go nowadays, they are likely to find rooms available. Ernst Rechtermann, president of the Westchester County Hotel Association, said the present 62 percent occupancy rate for the county's 4,170 hotel rooms was relatively low.
"I think the entire county is completely overbuilt," he said. "I don't see any potential for any new construction of hotels."
After the North Salem Town Board established new zoning laws in 1987 that prevented hotel construction everywhere except for a small commercial district near the junction of Route 22 and Hardscrabble Road, Mr. Lukashok sued North Salem and town officials in an effort to overturn the zoning laws. He is also seeking $14.7 million in damages. The case is expected to be heard next spring in State Supreme Court in White Plains.
Mr. Lukashok first presented his proposal to the North Salem Planning Board in late 1984 and has spent "hundreds of thousands of dollars" on environmental studies, drilling costs and consultants' fees, Mr. Scheffler said.
"We wouldn't have spent all that time and all that money if we hadn't been encouraged by the town in the first place," he said.
Lois Lippmann, chairwoman of the North Salem Planning Board and the Town Supervisor when the town changed its zoning laws, said she could not comment on the lawsuit. But she said that after years of negotiations, she was surprised when Mr. Boshes, the other would-be hotel developer, stopped in her office on Election Day to tell her that he was trying to sell his long-term lease on the 12.8-acre property near the Mona Trattoria restaurant off Route 22.
 
Length of Process Deplored
 "Essentially, we're just tired," Mr. Boshes said. "It has taken so long to go through the approval process that the market has finally caught up with us."
When North Salem changed its zoning law, it cut in half the density of hotels allowed on that property, ruling out Mr. Boshes's proposed 240-room Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza. He later changed the proposal to a hotel of about 130 suites, but with no ballrooms, meeting rooms or swimming pool.
Edward Kelly, who owns the property, said another developer was sure to make some sort of proposal eventually because "the site can accommodate a number of uses."
Down the road in Lewisboro, developers of a proposed 300-room Sheraton Country Inn faced the same problem when the town changed its zoning laws in 1988. But after considering a lawsuit of their own, they withdrew their proposal and are now trying to work with the town to see what residents want at the 32-acre site, which is next to the Goldens Bridge Shopping Center.
Peter Brock, a New Rochelle developer who owns 23 of those acres, said that he was angry that he had "lost time, effort and money" after preparing the hotel proposal, but that he had decided "it's always more fruitful if you can work things out and not fight."
Mr. Brock has joined a citizens' group known as the Concept Committee, which was set up by town officials to meet periodically and discuss what sort of development should be encouraged there.
"I think it was a wise choice," he said. "I think it's a bad rap that you can't work with these towns."
The developer is considering building town houses near the shopping center. The reaction of town officials to such a project has so far been favorable.

HEADLINE: State Owed Millions in Uncollected Sales Tax

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
AS state officials search for ways to close an anticipated $600 million budget gap, tax experts say that hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes owed to the state by residents will probably never be paid and are virtually impossible to collect.
The millions owed are a result of a 1967 United States Supreme Court decision that exempts out-of-state businesses like mail-order companies from charging another state's sales tax on taxable purchases. And though residents are required by New Jersey law to pay the taxes on out-of-state purchases, officials say that only a small percentage actually report the taxes, as required, on their New Jersey tax returns. 
 Though the decision may provide residents with a convenient, albeit unlawful, respite from recently increased sales taxes, some legislators say it should be legislatively rectified since lost revenue is eventually paid by all taxpayers, including those who do all their shopping in New Jersey.
 But with the persistent antitax sentiment sweeping the nation, tax experts say, any support for a new law or an aggressive collection effort would be a politically unpopular undertaking. In addition, they say, the decision hurts businesses in the state by giving out-of-state companies an unfair advantage. The nonresident businesses, they say, can offer otherwise taxable goods at what amounts to a 7 percent discount.
Some legislators, however, say that while the state may have an interest in increasing revenue, a tax collected on mail-order purchases might have a negative impact on consumers, particularly the elderly and disabled.
At the same time, representatives of the mail-order industry say that estimates of lost taxes are greatly exaggerated and that many smaller and mid-sized direct-mail companies would have to raise prices if they were required to collect sales taxes.
The issue arises as state officials estimate that sales tax revenue will be $450 million less than anticipated, roughly three-quarters of the $600 million shortfall expected in the current fiscal year.
"It's hard to get a fix on the numbers," said Richard Kaluzny, chief of the Office of Tax Analysis in the State Division of Taxation. "But I think the estimate a couple of years ago was that we were losing $100 million a year in tax revenue."
Mr. Kaluzny was referring to a study conducted by the United States Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations that estimated New Jersey's 1988 sales tax loss from out-of-state sales to be $107 million.
Robert D. Ebel, director of finance research for the commission, said the estimated sales tax loss for the state would have increased to approximately $113 million by the end of this year. The loss, Mr. Ebel said, is at least partly the result of increasing mail-order sales.
"You have a choice of buying through a catalogue or you can drive down to the shopping mall," Mr. Ebel said. And though consumers may have various reasons for choosing one alternative over the other, he said, one factor that might be considered is that the out-of-state mail-order companies typically do not collect the New Jersey sales tax.
"Right off the top you can save 7 percent on a television or a computer system," Mr. Ebel said. "And that's not small dollars."
And while the amount of lost taxes is difficult to estimate, most officials agree that any additional revenue would be welcomed.
 "Certainly our revenue picture would be brighter if these companies would collect our sales tax," said Amy Collings, a spokeswoman for the State Department of the Treasury. "But that requires Federal action."
<> <> Ms. Collings said that as a result, state officials can only continue their present efforts to enter into voluntary agreements with other states and to lobby for Federal legislation.
New Jersey is not the only state losing tax revenue on out-of-state sales. The advisory commission's study estimated that in 1988 the 45 states with sales tax statutes were losing almost $2.5 billion. And while New Jersey, like most states, has a "sales and use tax," which requires residents to pay a use tax on items purchased outside the state, relatively few taxpayers actually report or pay the tax.
According to the State Division of Taxation, 3,584 taxpayers paid a total of $273,420 in sales taxes on out-of- state purchases in 1987.
In the 1967 Supreme Court decision, made in the case of National Bellas Hess v. Illinois Department of Revenue, the Court ruled that a state could require sales tax collection at the time of the sale only if the company making the sale had a physical presence in or "nexus" with that state.
<> <> Dr. Marilyn Marks Rubin, associate professor of public administration and economics at John Jay College in New York, said: "What constitutes nexus? That's the whole issue here. If I call Macy's in New York and buy snorkel gear and have them send it to New Jersey, Macy's has to charge me tax." The reason, she said, is that Macy's has stores in New Jersey.
"But," she said, "if L. L. Bean puts a catalogue in my mailbox, does that mean that L. L. Bean is doing business in New Jersey?" L. L. Bean's only store is in Maine.
The answer to that question is not clear cut, Dr. Rubin said, although the concept of what constitutes nexus, which traditionally required that a business have a physical presence in a state, has changed over the years.
Indeed, some experts say that modern marketing techniques, including the use of telemarketing, credit cards and computers, have created a new standard for determining nexus.
"The mail-order companies are present electronically and they are present economically," said Alan H. Friedman, general counsel to the Multistate Tax Commission, a Washington-based interstate agency. "Physical presence is no longer the benchmark; it should be economic presence as well."
 
Not a New Tax
 Another area of confusion, Mr. Friedman said, involves the common perception that a tax on out-of-state sales would be a new one.
"The taxes on those sales are already owed," he said. "There's no legal or factual doubt about it." But state tax officials, he said, are often hesitant to take aggressive measures to collect those taxes.
Mr. Friedman said that proposed Federal legislation, however, would clarify the nexus issue and allow states to require mail-order companies with more than $12.4 million in national sales or $500,000 in state sales to collect a state's sales tax.
That legislation, however, died in committee after meeting with strong opposition from the Direct Marketing Association, a New York-based group that represents more than 3,500 companies tied with the direct-mail industry.
The association dismisses essentially all the issues raised by those in favor of allowing states to compel sales tax collection by out-of-state businesses.
Robert J. Levering, vice president for governmental affairs for the association, said, for example, that New Jersey's revenue losses were far less than the estimates projected by the Advisory Commission study.
"Our bottom-line estimate of the potential revenue gain for New Jersey is $12 million," Mr. Levering said. The commission, he said, inappropriately took into consideration goods, like clothing, that were tax exempt. In addition, he said, the commission did not account for out-of-state companies that were already voluntarily collecting and remitting states' sales taxes.
 
Collection Problems Cited
 Mr. Levering also said that collecting tax at the point of sale was not as easy as proponents might believe. The idea that the seller can simply add the state sales tax to the customer's credit-card bill, he said, does not hold true for many of smaller and mid-sized direct-mail companies.
"They may be selling cheese and fruit and fruitcakes," he said, "but they might have 50 percent check-payers, and that screws everything up."
Customers who pay by check, he said, would have to figure the tax on their purchases and include that amount in their payments.
"Imagine making a semi-impulse purchase like that?" Mr. Levering said. "Those people would just put the catalogue aside and wait for a better time."
As far as some of New Jersey's Federal legislators are concerned, that would be good news for businesses in the state.
 
'A Hard Time Competing'
 "Businesses in our state have a hard time competing with the mail-order companies," said Representative William J. Hughes, Democrat of Ocean City. "Their fixed expenses are much more than the mail-order houses that don't have a presence in the state."
 Representative Hughes, who is a member of the House Judiciary Committee, was a co-sponsor of the bill that would have required out-of-state companies to collect states' sales taxes.
"It is argued that the consumers benefit from direct mail because they're able to purchase lower priced goods," he said. "But in the final analysis, when you include the drain on the public treasury and the damage to local businesses, we lose the benefits we think we gained."
Representative Hughes said he expected the bill to be reintroduced in the next session of Congress.
Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of Montclair, however, said he opposed the legislation. The convenience of mail-order sales was cited as a valuable option for consumers.
"Not only does it make shopping easier, cheaper and less time-consuming," Mr. Lautenberg said, "but it is also particularly important to people who are confined to their homes by age or disability or illness."
Though states may have a strong interest in increasing their revenue, he said, the sales tax issue must be viewed in light of such consumer concerns.
 
Agreements With States
 But rather than wait for Federal legislation to clarify the issue, New Jersey tax officials have entered into agreements with several states to provide for sharing of sales tax information that results from state tax audits.
 New Jersey, for instance, was the first state to enter into an agreement for sales and use tax reporting with the State of New York in 1986.
Under the terms of the agreement, New York tax auditors report to New Jersey tax officials all untaxed New York sales made to New Jersey residents. New Jersey provides the same information to New York. In addition, more than 6,000 merchants in both states are registered in the program and report out-of-state sales to the other state.
Lee Evans, an auditor with New Jersey's Division of Taxation, said that since the agreement was signed, New Jersey tax officials have collected about $39 million in taxes on sales that were reported to the division.
"You can't go after every sweater or record album," he said. "But when somebody's buying a big-ticket item like furniture or jewelry or art, it makes sense to go after it."
As for collecting outstanding taxes on unreported sales in other states, however, officials have found only frustration.
"We've been beating our brains in for years trying to get this money," said Robert Thompson, assistant director of audit activity in the Division of Taxation. "We've just been underwhelmed with our success."

HEADLINE: Children on Life-Support Systems Increasing

BYLINE: By MARY L. RAFFALLI

 BODY:
YUWANNA remembers the moments after her son, David, was born. He is her third child. She has two daughters.
"I said, 'Wow! I have a son,' " she recalled. "But looking at his face, he looked different. I knew something was wrong. At that moment, my expectations, my whole world collapsed. I went into a little cocoon and I wanted him to go back into my uterus and never come out. 
 "All the happiness of birth died, and my expectations for him died also."
David has severe cardiac and respiratory anomalies in addition to Down syndrome. When he was 3 months old, he had open heart-surgery to repair a ventricular septal defect, a hole in the wall of his heart.
He has a tracheostomy tube inserted through his throat to support his breathing.
At his home in Nassau County he is attached to a cardiac monitor that sounds an alarm if his heart rate is too fast or too slow.
David is one of a growing number of Long Island children on life support systems, and as the caseload increases the legal, social, medical and ethical issues surrounding the problem are intensifying. Hospitals and families are dealing not only with the academic issues but also with the realities of maintaining many critically ill children.
According to the State Health Department, the number of children younger than 1 year treated in Long Island hospitals for conditions that require life support increased 48 percent from 1987 to last year. The state's rate increased 22 percent.
Experts said the difference did not stem from different birthrates or documented differences in children's health. Physicians in New York City and on the Island said medical centers on the Island attributed the difference to improved pediatric and neonatal critical care.
Increasingly parents are taking their critically ill children to medical centers on the Island rather than the city, doctors said.
Some legal and medical experts attribute the increase in children using life-support procedures to doctors' growing unwillingness to withhold or withdraw treatment because they fear legal and social problems.
"If you err toward overtreatment, you're safe," said Peter Williams, a lawyer in the department of community affairs and preventive medicine at the SUNY Stony Brook Medical Center. "Physicians today have an obsession with malpractice or with being the test case. If they treat a kid as if he's the 1 case in 100,000 cases that is going to be a miracle, 99,900 cases will be treated inappropriately."
Through new diagnostic and therapeutic technology, medical centers are managing critically ill children more aggressively, and many severely ill infants are surviving with conditions that can be supported with advanced technologies.
"Amid technology, physicians find that they can do something, but not everything, for the child," the Rev. Robert Smith, a Roman Catholic chaplain at the Stony Brook Medical Center, said. "What should he do if he can assist the lungs with a machine, but he can't change the whole condition of the child?"
Father Smith is on the Governor's panel on life and the law. Removing or withholding life support can contravene the role and perception of doctors' curing illnesses and saving lives.
The director of bioethics and social policy at Schneider Children's Hospital, Dr. Robert Cassidy, said:
"If I go in there and pull that tube out, and the child gasps and gasps and dies, I could only have a sense of connectiveness between what I've done and what happens to the child. If I go in there and hook the tube up, then I'm just doing what doctors are supposed to do."
Dr. Andrew Steele, a neonatologist at Schneider, a unit of the Long Island Jewish Medical Center, said, "What has evolved in our society is an idea that you should not die in a hospital unless somebody pounds on your chest and tries to breathe for you."
 Physicians said their roles were being divided among lawyers, ethicists and judges. "People with a political agenda, economic agenda, philosopical agenda or simply inexperience are out there waiting to second-guess the physicians," said Dr. Cassidy.
 "Physicians are in an atmosphere of suspicion and hostility, which is unfortunate," Father Smith said. "But no physician will tell you that it is good medicine to make a decision based on the possibility that he might be sued."
One court case concerning infants, that of Baby Jane Doe, began in Stony Brook in 1983 and ended up in State Supreme Court. The court ruled that the parents could choose to withhold certain surgical procedures.
There have been no court cases on infants' treatment. "No court cases," Dr. Cassidy said. "No Federal vigilantes' coming over the hill, pounding on the doors of the neonatal unit."
The chairman of the bioethics committee at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, Dr. Alan Fleischman, said: "The problem is doctors are moderately paranoid and are reading facts incorrectly and reading the law inappropriately. There have been no cases to support the paranoia."
In July, the Supreme Court of the United States rendered a decision on the case of Nancy Cruzan, who is permanently unconscious. Although her family would like to withdraw her life support, the High Court ruled that proof was needed to show that the patient would want the support removed.
 
Limits in Cruzan Decision

Many physicians extrapolate from decisions on adults' cases to approach pediatric situations.
The executive director of the governor's panel, Tracy Miller, said the Cruzan decision and the panel's reports did "not offer any new laws or guidelines for newborns, only for competent adults."
"Nancy Cruzan has virtually nothing to do with New York State or with infants," Dr. Fleischman said. "It may be more prudent to treat from the potential-lawsuit perspective, but it may frequently be unethical as well."
 State law sets out rules on do-not-resuscitate, or D.N.R., orders for newborns and children, but they apply just to very specific circumstances.
"Most states have adopted legislation that allows parents and health-care workers to decide when treatment is inappropriate," Mr. Williams said. "D.N.R. covers cardiopulmonary resuscitation, not the 9,000 other situations that can come up."
 
'Miracles With These Kids'

Molly was born 13 weeks prematurely and remained in the intensive-care unit of Winthrop Hospital in Mineola for four and a half months. She had repeated seizures, was attached to a ventilator and a feeding tube.
Molly and her mother, Maggie, flew to Memphis, to a doctor who "had done miracles with these kids, too bad not mine," the mother said.
Molly is 3. She is microcephalic, with a brain significantly smaller than normal, and is wheelchair-bound. Intravenous tubes deliver nutrients and medications directly to her bloodstream. She lives at home with her mother, her twin brother and her younger sister.
"I've had a number of chances to let Molly slip away, but it would over my dead body," Maggie said. "Her life is as valuable to me as my two other children."
Doctors usually confer with parents over the child's treatment. There is controversy over what is considered "futile" treatment, not just between parents and doctors, but also among doctors.
Doctors agree that futile care should not be provided, but the question of what may be unnecessary for newborns is still difficult to determine.
The brain is very "flexible" in children younger than 2. Until at least that age, neurologists cannot be certain that an infant who may appear to be permanently unconscious will remain unconscious.
 "When the brain is so very young and immature and sustains insult," said the chief of pediatric neurology at Schneider, Dr. Lydia Eviatar, "the response initially may seem to be total devastation with no recovery. And yet we have seen children who qualify for the diagnosis of vegetative state, and six months, a year, sometimes two years later, they start showing signs of awareness."
Twenty years ago decisions to withhold or withdraw treatment were made between the physician and the family.
"Now we have too much treatment for too many," Dr. Cassidy said. "But maybe we need that to avoid too little treatment for too many."
 
Communication With Parents

An accident at birth deprived Angela of oxygen. By the time the doctors revived her, they did not know the severity of the damage. Angela was in a nonrehabilitative nonresponsive state.
Her father, Robert, said: "The ironic part is that there is a communication between the parents and the child. Yet everyone is so quick to question the ethics of it."
Eventually, a child who is technology dependent does not necessarily need to be in a hospital. Typically, parents have two basic options. One is to take the child home with them. In those cases, the parents learn how to work with the child and often obtain home nursing care.
"We took him home, because that's where we feel our son belongs," Yuwanna said about David. "But before he came home, it was very hard to decide, especially with other children. Now there are people in the house every single day. You can never just leave the house a mess or stay in bed. You always have the feeling that somebody is looking over your shoulder."
Maggie, who took her daughter home, said: "There is tremendous prejudice against these kids. I hate it when I go to temple and I see people avert their eyes or get upset that Molly is there. I've lost all my friends. But I wouldn't do anything differently. Molly is very happy when she's not in the hospital. She's beautiful."
 
One Center in Albany

The second choice is to place the child in a chronic-care center that does not provide hospital-style intense management. Parents on Long Island may not be able to find a chronic-care center.
When Angela was ready to leave the hospital, Robert looked for a long-term center. The only one in the state for a nonrehabilitative infant like Angela was in Albany, but it had a three-and-a-half-to-five-year waiting list.
Finally, Robert placed Angela in a center in New Britain, Conn. He and his wife, Angie, traveled five hours each week to visit their daughter. Angela died two months ago.
"Families need more facilities, especially downstate," said Phyllis Eckert, a senior social worker and supervisor in maternal and child health at North Shore University Hospital, who worked with Angela's family. "We are seeing more and more technology-dependent children, and there must be many more facilities made available to them."
 
'Lives Are Changed Forever'

 "What society has to realize is that these children are not being killed or dying, because they haven't provided places for them to go," Dr. Fleischman said. "They're taking up i.c.u. beds, acute-care beds, which is not what they need and which costs society more money anyway."
"I don't know anyone in the support group who would not want their child to live," Maggie said. "Robert and Angie haven't been freed since Angela died. They're still in pain. Their lives are changed forever.
 "When you're doing things out of love, you're very blind. I would almost love to still be able to go all the way to Connecticut just to visit her."

Program Eases Student Transition To College Life

DATELINE: FAIRFIELD, Conn.

 BODY:
To ease the transition from high school to college, Fairfield University has established a Freshman Experience Program. Unlike many such efforts at other colleges, its administrator says, the program tries to ease students through nonacademic problems in their college life.
"The program is directed toward the social development of the student," said Gwen Vendley, the program's director. "During the second semester it challenges the student to look beyond himself to the community" through outreach projects. 
 The program, which is voluntary, consists of weekly workshops to help freshmen adjust tolife at the Jesuit college. Drug abuse, stress, relationships and time management are among the topics covered. The core groups formed at the workshops act as support groups and provide a forum for the freshmen's concerns.
"Students typically feel lost and overwhelmed when they go to college," Mrs. Vendley said. "They imagine that everyone else is better prepared than they are and they feel isolated."
 
 'A Safety Net'
 Each group is led by two volunteers -- a student and either a faculty member or an administrator.
With 50 to 75 percent of the freshman class participating, there are now about 12 students in each of 38 groups, Mrs. Vendley said.
"The beauty of the program is that it doesn't try to be dominating or tell the students what to do, but it is a safety net and support group," said James D. Fitzpatrick, assistant dean of university activities and one of the volunteer leaders, or facilitators.
"I think it's really good to get to know the people in your group and to have a facilitator who pays attention to you and is concerned about you," said Patricia Sullivan, a freshman from Whitestone, Queens, who is majoring in psychology.
 
'It Was a Waste of Time'
 "We have a great time," said Kevin Talz, a junior from Chicago, a psychology and economics major and a freshman facilitator. "I love preparing for the class."
But not all groups have been as successful. "It was a waste of time," said Brooke Duschock, a freshman from South River, N.J., majoring in biology. "Our resident adviser on the floor will have meetings if we need to know something, and we can ask her questions when we have a problem."
David Lynch, a freshman from Burlington, Conn., majoring in chemistry, said the workshops did not help him, since "if you have a problem you can talk to friends or counselors."
"We don't need a group to tell us what to talk about," said Steven Gonzalez, a freshman biology major from East Northport, L.I.
"I'm not sure that it's needed to the extent that they are trying to push it with meetings once a week," said Jacqueline Carelli of Brookfield, Conn., a sophomore majoring in psychology and a freshman facilitator.
 
Housing Was Restructured
 Mrs. Vendley said she hoped that in the future the program would be designed so that the student facilitators and the freshmen would receive college credits.
The new program has also caused the university to restructure its housing plan, establishing freshman floors and adding a dining hall for freshmen.
The university's recent purchase of three buildings from the Sisters of Notre Dame on the campus provided the building for the freshman dining hall. An old chapel was renovated into the dining hall and the other buildings became offices and residences.
The administration originally proposed freshmen-only residence halls when the new program started, but many students protested. They asserted that one of Fairfield's attractions was the mixture of students. The administration compromised with freshmen wings and halls.
Mrs. Vendley said she planned to expand the number of facilitators to incorporate freshmen faculty advisers into the program and to include an additional student facilitator. She also hopes to make the meetings mandatory for all freshmen.

Tutoring Program Is Intended to Cut Housing Costs

DATELINE: AMHERST, Mass.

 BODY:
Students at the Uni versity of Massachusetts at Amherst can ease their financial burdens while easing fellow students' academic burdens through a new tutoring program starting next spring.
The program, created by the office of academic support and housing services, is aimed at helping students offset the $400 fee increase set for next semester while providing tutoring to students, said Ann G. Quinley, dean of academic support services. 
 Tutors will be chosen from juniors and seniors majoring in English, mathematics, accounting, economics and computer science. Applicants must maintain 3.0 grade point averages.
Each student will be paid $450 for working five and half hours a week for 12 weeks. The student can spend the money toward the $907 semester charge for a double room in a residence hall, but that is not required.
 
 60 Applications Received
 Ms. Quinley said her office had received about 60 applications as of Friday. About 50 students living on campus and 50 living off campus will be selected. Students living off campus will have to return to the dormitories to participate.
Some juniors and seniors move off campus between first and second semesters each year, leaving residence hall vacancies that the administration hopes the program will fill, said Joseph Zannini, director of housing services.
"It is not necessarily economically advantageous to students to move back to the dormitories," Mr. Zannini said. "Through the tutorial program, the administration can pay for some of the students' bills, provide a service and bring more juniors and seniors back into the dorms."
Ms. Quinley added: "We're relying on the increased occupancy in the dormitories to pay for the program."
Students will be notified of whether they have been selected by Dec. 17 so they can inform their landlords, Ms. Quinley said.
Tutorials will take place in residence halls and multicultural centers. Freshmen and sophomores will be matched with tutors the second week of the spring semester, which starts Jan. 31.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Consumers Aren't Buying The Bad News

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
As measured by the University of Michigan, consumer confidence actually rose in November. Not, to be sure, by nearly as much as it dropped the previous month, but nonetheless it was an increase. And the stock market was up nicely for the month, even before peace hopes on Friday propelled the Dow to a weekly gain of 32.42, to 2,559.65.
For the month, the Dow was up 4.8 percent, and smaller stocks did much better. The Nasdaq composite rose 8.8 percent. The mutual fund companies find it hard to believe just how much money is pouring into their stock funds. 
 The public's apparent optimism, or at least lack of pessimism, may reflect the fact that life looks a lot less grim on many Main Streets than it does on Wall Street. The word from Christmas shoppers in parts of the Midwest is that the malls are jammed.
A partial explanation for the good cheer is that the unemployment rate has not yet zoomed upward, and most Americans don't know people who are losing jobs. A Conference Board survey finds that the majority of Americans still tell pollsters that jobs are available, not scarce.
Another reason for consumers to be happy, while businesses are not, is that much of the economic pain so far has been borne by corporate America, as pressures have piled up to keep them from passing on cost increases. The Commerce Department says that inventory profits -- mostly for the oil companies -- sent overall corporate profits zooming in the third quarter. But economic profits, after adjusting for inventory gains, showed a sharp 9.6 percent decline.
Tom Doerflinger, who watches profits for Paine Webber, argues that the factors depressing earnings are not likely to reverse themselves. "The main point is that the bad news on earnings is still ahead of us, and expectations are too high," he said. "The worst is yet to come."
If this recession turns out to be mild and short, that forecast could be wrong. Over the short run, a Middle East war, or lack of one, could have a profound impact on that prospect, and it is reasonable that Wall Street hangs on every rumor of talks or attacks.
But over a longer term, the trade talks now nearing conclusion in Brussels may be a lot more important. Free trade can produce a more prosperous world, but it has few friends when economies are slowing around the globe, and the best bet is that the talks will fail.
If so, rounds of trade retaliation, like Europe's decision last week to slap a tariff on sales of Monsanto's Nutrasweet, may become the order of the day. Those are battles in which individual companies and interests win -- the European competitor of Monsanto, for example -- but the world economy loses.
Messrs. Smoot and Hawley made it into the economic hall of shame with their bill to raise tariffs in the Depression. If trade wars get going again, the results could be the same, and the current optimism will be long forgotten.

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
Taking the Measure of Recession '90

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
TO many Wall Street sages, the most dangerous phrase in the language is: "It's different this time." The economic landscape is littered with corporate corpses whose last words were, "Sure, junk bonds haven't had a good name, but it's different this time." Or, "A debt-heavy balance sheet used to be dangerous, but it's less risky now."
Of course, some things really do change -- and change so profoundly, with such intriguing implications for the market, that Wall Street ignores the alteration at its own risk. One such change has been occurring over the past four years, according to a forthcoming study by Mickey Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities in New York, an affiliate of the Chicago Research and Trading Group. And this change, a sharp shift in how and where America makes its money, suggests to Mr. Levy that Wall Street needs to re-examine some of its assumptions about what the coming recession will look like, and which stocks will perform best while it lasts. 
 The markets have been preoccupied with the overall state of the economy for months, and last week that concern developed into obsessionary overdrive. President Bush, still loath to say the R-word, conceded a "serious slowdown" has occurred. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, spoke out loud of "a meaningful downturn." And the Commerce Department reported that its index of leading economic indicators fell in October for the fourth month in a row, signaling to many that the recession is here.
Like most private economists, Mr. Levy expects a recession. But he does not think it will bear much resemblance to other recent downturns. Typically, the postwar downturns have been "V-shaped recessions," Mr. Levy said, with the Fed slamming on the brakes to tame an overheated economy and then hitting the gas pedal just as abruptly after the recession develops. "Thus, the entrance into and exit from recent recessions were quite dramatic," Mr. Levy said. "But this time is distinctively different."
Ah, the fateful phrase. But Mr. Levy is not deterred: "Look, it is simply common experience. We may all look back from some point in the future and say, 'Gee, 1990 -- the gross national product was growing, but it still felt like a recession. The Fed tightened gradually, and we have had this gradual slowdown.' " Indeed, the gradual onset of this recession distinguishes it from every other postwar downturn except for 1969, according to Mr. Levy. "And 1969 is not really comparable because you had the Vietnam War build-up, with defense spending as a much higher percent of G.N.P. than today, despite the situation in the Middle East."
Similarly, barring any aggressive stimulation from the Fed, the rebound from this recession is likely to be more anemic than in the past, and to come only after some protracted period of "flatness," Mr. Levy said.
What does this matter of timing mean to Wall Street? Well, the abrupt nature of past recessions helped dictate which industries felt the most pain, in Mr. Levy's view. Any sudden plunge into recession will typically leave manufacturers with unsold products in the warehouse. They cope with this inventory backlog by quickly scaling back production, producing layoffs and reduced business for their suppliers and distributors. That is one reason why service firms, unburdened by unsold inventory, have tended to outperform manufacturers during past recessions.
But this time around, manufacturers have not accumulated the inventories that haunted them in the past -- perhaps because of changed production practices that emphasize lower inventories, or perhaps just because the gradual slowdown gave companies the chance to adjust more gracefully.
At the same time, the weaker dollar has produced a dramatic but little-appreciated boom in exports, which have grown from less than 11 percent of G.N.P. in 1986 to nearly 15 percent this year. Further, there has been a sharp rise in the share of G.N.P. made up of spending on durable goods, which economists define as products with a life of at least three years and which shoppers define as big-ticket items -- cars, say, or sectional sofas. Both developments benefit manufacturers more than their service-sector brethren.
Since each percentage-point share of the G.N.P. is worth about $41.5 billion, these shifts represent the movement of a gigantic amount of money from one corner of the economy to another, and from one set of corporations to another. Consequently, Mr. Levy argues, the nation's manufacturing sector simply may not experience the levels of recessionary pain this time around that it has felt in the past.
 The other side of this encouraging coin, unfortunately, may be that those who work in the traditionally "recession-proof" regions of the nation's economy -- its banks and financial service companies, its real estate firms and its department stores -- are likely to suffer in this recession as never before in postwar history.
Here, too, the changing mix of the nation's economic production is significant. As exports have grown in economic importance, spending on nondurable goods -- the stuff that department store sales are made of -- has shrunk as a share of G.N.P., as has spending on residential property.
The service-sector equivalent of a warehouse full of unsold goods is an office full of idle people, Mr. Levy points out. "Thus, somewhat analogous to the liquidation of excessive inventories in the manufacturing industries in prior recessions," he explained, "this economic correction will involve the liquidation of excesses of human capital in these major service-producing industries."
The silver lining in all this, Mr. Levy adds, is that "a slow and gradual recession is much healthier over the long run." It permits the core rate of inflation to come down, and puts the subsequent recovery on a stronger footing. But if Mr. Levy's analysis is right, the path to that recovery winds through some unfamiliar terrain, and some people will not survive the trip.

HEADLINE: It's Glam! It's Fab! It's a Rave!

BYLINE: By WOODY HOCHSWENDER

 BODY:
Gene and Robert Pressman are like brothers from different planets.
Gene, long haired and laid back, preferring jeans and blazer to a suit, went to film school and worked as a go-fer in Hollywood before bringing women's fashion to the family business, Barneys New York. Robert, at 36, is three years' Gene's junior; he is close cropped and buttoned down, has an M.B.A. and runs the financial side of the company. In an era of retail retrenchment, it may be just this mix -- innovative fashion merchandiser and sober financier -- coupled with rich Japanese backers that will make Barneys fly as other retailers flounder. While in malls and on Main Street fashion industry executives are struggling just to survive, the Pressmans have been thinking: the world. 
 With help from Japan's sixth-largest retailing operation, the Isetan Company, Barneys has embarked on a remarkable expansion program, opening a chain of satellite stores in shopping malls from Long Island to California, Texas to Tokyo. On Nov. 16, it announced plans to open a 230,000-square-foot store on Madison Avenue at 61st Street, the largest new specialty store in Manhattan in decades and the first uptown foray for Barneys.
Retail analysts consider the expansion every bit as daring as the decision by Gene and Robert's father, Fred Pressman, in the 1960's, considered questionable at the time, to move Barneys from a men's-wear discounter to a high-end fashion store. The idea now is to take Barneys' peculiar mix of traditional and avant-garde clothes to suburban malls coast to coast -- well beyond the drumbeat of their well-honed advertising campaigns, to boldly go where Jean Paul Gaultier and Hickey-Freeman have never gone together before. Eventually, the Pressmans envision a national apparel chain of at least 25 stores, maybe 100. There are now 10.
 
Staking Out the Territory
 It is certainly a major change in direction for Barneys, which had remained in a single location at Seventh Avenue and 17th Street for 65 years. Superficially, the timing, with apparel sales sluggish and signs of recession everywhere, could not have been worse. Conceivably, a severe economic downturn could cause the Pressmans to cut back plans. But the Pressmans say they are not worried. "There is a market-share thing here," said Robert recently. "If you are expanding and others are retracting, when times get better you've got that share." Or as Gene, who handles marketing and merchandising, put it: "We got a lot going on here, and it's, like, worldwide."
Whether they can extend their success to such far-flung cities as Seattle and Tokyo may depend on their ability to adapt in each market, and, more important, to manage the various balls they are juggling. "The question I have to ask is: Do they know how to manage this new concept?" said Kurt Barnard, a retail analyst and publisher of the Retail Marketing Report. "They're creating something new, but can we assume they can master that business?"
Certainly, Barneys' moves reflect the robust opportunism of this generation of Pressmans, who developed a women's fashion image for Barneys even as others in the industry scoffed. But it is also reflects the conservative, deleveraging mood of the 90's. While many of America's most prestigious stores sag under huge debt, Barneys is financing its expansion largely with cash -- its own and Isetan's.
Most of all, the expansion points to the importance of having a partner that shares a commitment to long-term retailing goals -- and has very deep pockets.
"Isetan is a fourth-generation family-run business," said Robert Pressman, executive vice president of Barneys and grandson of the founder, Barney Pressman. "It's not like going to a venture capitalist. Isetan doesn't expect to get back money overnight."
The start-up investment by Barneys and Isetan is about $250 million, with Isetan putting up more than half -- how much more Barneys executives would not say.
As a privately held company, Barneys has formerly declined to disclose sales figures. But executives provided figures showing that Barneys has nearly doubled sales since 1986, when its women's store opened.
 
Pursuing Volume
 A Barneys men's clothing store opened in the Wall Street area in 1988 -- with no involvement from Isetan -- has not met expectations. Barneys executives said layoffs in the financial services industry had affected sales, but they expect that eventually it will be profitable. Total sales for all stores in 1989 were $130 million, according to Barneys figures, with sales of $160 million projected for this year. By comparison, Isetan estimates sales from its own operations will be $4 billion this year.
With sales of the new Madison Avenue store projected to exceed $150 million in the year it opens, 1992 -- plus additional volume from scheduled satellite store openings both here and in Japan -- Barneys' yearly volume could easily more than double again, to about $400 million.
However, a long and deep recession will certainly affect sales at a premium retailer like Barneys, no matter how much capital they have. "The burden of risk may be with the Japanese, but that does not guarantee success," Mr. Barnard said. "Barneys is trying to become a destination store of preference among the elite. But when people are spending more conservatively, they tend to revert to established store loyalties."
Clearly, Barneys New York has come a long way from the 1940's -- from the radio days of "Calling all men" (short men, tall men, stout men!), when it sold bargain men's clothing. For years, it remained a cautious, family-run company staying close to its humble retailing roots: In 1923, as family lore has it, Barney Pressman pawned his wife's engagment ring (her idea, the story goes) to raise $500 to cover rent and to stock men's suits.
But with its entry into the women's fashion business and its hard-won expertise at promoting itself and its products, Barneys has become a fashion mecca. While traditional retailers deck their holiday windows with toy trains and quaint movable figurines of Christmases past, Barneys displays life-size figures of Mikhail Gorbachev, Lawrence Taylor, Ivana Trump and Madonna in ironically glamorous contexts.
 
Strange Beauties
 Its Tammy Bakker window this season, for example, shows the fallen evangelist's wife standing before a Christmas tree made out of a giant mascara brush. Another window portrays Karl Lagerfeld, the designer who updated Chanel, in a totally quilted room, including a quilted fireplace with quilted flames -- a visual allusion to the signature Chanel quilted handbags. On the wall is a quotation: "I don't like standard beauty. There is no beauty without strangeness."
Those sophisticated images are aimed at maturing baby boomers, those who have grown up hip and rebellious but now have the money to buy Chanel (or at least appreciate witty visual allusion to Chanel's signature quilted handbags). With competitors in disarray, the Pressmans are on the prowl. "In a weak retail environment, that's the time to take a shot," said Robert Pressman.
At Madison Avenue and 61st Street, Barneys will be in position to take advantage of weakness at nearby Bloomingdale's, whose parent company, Federated/Allied Stores, entered into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year. It can also challenge other stores like Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue for the tourist trade. It is at the gateway to a golden strip of Madison Avenue designer boutiques, leading up to the Ralph Lauren store at 72d Street.
The 11-floor store, purchased outright for more than $100 million, cash, abuts the Pierre Hotel and the swank Metropolitan Club. This prime spot was achieved through a real estate co-venture of Barneys and Isetan in which each retains a 50 percent share in the building. But therein lies a tale.
How did a relatively small company -- compared to the large specialty store chains like Saks and Neiman Marcus -- come up with the kind of cash for a global expansion?
 
Just Family
 "In 1986, we hired Goldman, Sachs as an adviser and sat down as a family to try and figure out how to grow and still sleep at night," Robert Pressman said. (With almost 1,500 employees, Barneys is nevertheless a family business. Fred remains president of Barneys New York, although Robert and Gene are leading the expansion. Fred's wife, Phyllis, is vice president and general merchandise manager. Their daughter, Nancy Pressman-Dressler, is general merchandise manager of the main store's Co/Op section. Bonnie Pressman, Gene's wife, is general merchandise manager for women's accessories, cosmetics and shoes. Holly Pressman, Robert's wife, is director of corporate gifts and investments.)
On the advice of Goldman, Barneys entered into joint ventures with Isetan, which was eager to import the hip display and merchandising skills that Barneys is known for.
In Japan, there are few such mid-sized specialty stores -- on a scale somewhere between a boutique and a department store -- but there is a strong consumer appetite for sophisticated, fashionable "special" store products. And Barneys is nothing if not special, from the majolica china in its Chelsea Passage department to the clothes by Romeo Gigli, Yohji Yamamoto and Issey Miyake, which sometimes seem to require a set of instructions on how to put them on.
The deal was structured so that Isetan and Barneys each has an equity stake in ventures set up on the other's turf. Isetan became a minority partner in Barneys America, the company established to open the smaller satellite stores (7,000 to 30,000 square feet) in the United States. So far, the verdict remains out on the stores, which are in Chestnut Hill, Mass.; Short Hills, N.J.; Manhasset, L.I.; Westport, Conn.; Costa Mesa, Calif.; Seattle and Dallas.
"We took the viewpoint that we would do the opposite of what everybody else has done," Robert Pressman said. "We don't make interest payments, and we're not dependent on banks. We do not have to run fall sales in August."
Even though Isetan holds only a minority interest in the satellite stores, it is kicking in a majority of the cash for building them.
Barneys became a minority partner in Barneys Japan, set up with Isetan to open the Asian stores, including a 30,000-square-foot Barneys that opened in Tokyo Nov. 3, and two more slated for Japan.
Through Barneys Inc., formed in 1923, Barneys and Isetan will open larger American stores, along the lines of the Seventh Avenue flagship. These will include the Madison Avenue store and a 110,000-square-foot Beverly Hills store, expected to open on Wilshire Boulevard in 1993. Barneys Inc. will own and run both, leasing the property from the joint venture set up with Isetan. Contrary to some industry reports, Isetan holds no equity interest in Barneys Inc., Barneys executives said.
On the face of it, it would appear that Barneys and Isetan would each have invested about $50 million in the $100 million Madison Avenue deal. But Barneys could have put up less, Robert Pressman said, without elaborating. Isetan executives declined to be interviewed. Payments to the real estate partnership will be tied to sales performance. Robert Pressman said future rent payments by Barneys Inc. might not be split equally by the partners. In other words, he said, Isetan could receive more -- as Isetan may have invested more. "It's incredibly complicated," he said.
Barneys executives expect new-store profits to finance the expansion. "In the good old days, retailers made enough money internally to pay for expansion," Robert Pressman said. Now, that's not so.
 
 
CASHING IN ON THE GREAT REAL ESTATE BLUES
 In leasing its new properties, especially for the smaller satellite stores, Barneys says that it has benefited from a softness in the real estate market nationwide -- a softness accelerated by the wave of retail bankruptcies in the last three years.
"People who own real estate, particularly new shopping centers, are more flexible," said Gene Pressman, co-president of Barneys America, established to open the satellite stores. "Things have definitely changed in the last 18 months. There aren't a lot of takers out there."
Mall owners in two of the satellite store locations -- Costa Mesa, Calif., and Manhasset, L.I. -- would not provide details, but said they gave Barneys favorable terms. Typically, such leases are long term and geared to sales volume.
In Manhasset, Barneys opened a year ago in the Americana shopping center, about 20 miles from its Manhattan flagship store. It is directly across Northern Bouleward from the red-brick shell of Bonwit Teller. A block away stands ivy-covered, empty B. Altman. Both fell victim to the bankruptcy proceedings at their parent company, the Hooker Corporation. Still, Barneys is far from alone. In the same block are Polo/Ralph Lauren, Sonia Rykiel, Anne Klein, Giorgio Armani, Liz Claiborne and Hermes -- high focus, high fashion.
Barneys' smallish satellites "make sense," said Frank Castagna, founder and owner of the Americana center. "To take big stores and try to ship them all over the country doesn't work. We found that out after the Campeau bankruptcy, when Bloomingdale's released its numbers: The New York store was great but the rest of the country was not outstanding. It's very hard to adapt a big unit to different lifestyles."
With that in mind, Barneys has confined its plans for larger stores -- more than 30,000 square feet -- to major cities including Chicago, Los Angeles and New York. The Chicago store is scheduled to open on fashionable Oak Street late next year.
The newest Barneys satellite is in Dallas -- a 30,000-square-foot store that opened on Aug. 26, within days of the closing of Bloomingdale's troubled Dallas unit. Barneys also plans a satellite store in Tower City, a development in downtown Cleveland, next spring.
"The offers from mall owners are endless," said Gene Pressman. "But we don't want to be all over the place. Our product is not as commercial as the Limited or the Gap."
 
RETHINKING THE MIX
WITH seven satellite stores open, some brand new, the verdict is still out on the Barneys expansion. But Barneys has already begun to tinker with the merchandising mix.
When the first six stores opened in the last two years, they were stocked primarily with women's clothing, in a mix loosely based on the hip, moderately priced styles sold in the Co/Op department, a youth-oriented section of the 17th Street store. About 20 percent of the women's clothing was designer level -- Jean Paul Gaultier, Comme des Garcons, Sybilla and the classic Hermes.
In a radical departure from the flagship store's traditional emphasis, men's wear was scarce. And it was confined to sportswear -- no suits.
But this is being rethought.
"After we opened," said Gene Pressman, "we found the men's business was doing way above the $600-a-foot average." Barneys average, $600-per-square-foot annual sales volume, is about double the typical mall store performance. So men's suits and dress shirts are in -- at all the satellites.
In the remerchandizing, European men's suits by Giorgio Armani, Ermenegildo Zegna and Hugo Boss are sold with Barneys-label suits and clothing by leading women's designers. In Manhasset, L.I., where women wear Azzedine Alaia to the supermarket, the strategy seems to make special sense.
"They're on target in terms of revenue and profits," said Mark Green, Barneys' adviser at Goldman, Sachs, who receives aggregate sales figures from the satellite stores. "I don't know if every store is meeting its projections or not, but they're doing well."

Israel's Latest Push to Attract Investors

BYLINE: By Joel Kurtzman

 BODY:
Israel has undertaken an investment initiative designed to lure high-tech American and European companies to invest in its economy. The program was developed by Moshe Nissim, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry and Trade. Mr. Nissim discussed the initiatives and the state of Israel's economy with Joel Kurtzman of The New York Times. 
 Q. The intifada continues in Israel while the Middle East is generally tense after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Is this the right time to try to lure new foreign investment?
Mr. Nissim: Why not? Let me tell you about the intifada. It hurt our economy in 1988 only. Since then, we haven't seen any special damage to our economy. The purchases of our products from people coming in from the territories is down somewhat. But as far as the security issue goes, the damage to Israel is only psychological.
In the region, yes, we have problems with all of our neighbors except Egypt. But these security problems have not damaged the image of the Israel as a country of high-level industry. Motorola, Intel, National Semiconductor, they have all established enterprises in Israel and succeeded.
Q. But doesn't tension from the gulf crisis spill over into Israel?
Mr. Nissim: I think only in tourism. Everyone knows that this crisis will find its end. I don't know how or how long it will take, but it will not take years -- and I don't want to interfere in it. But we will see the end of this crisis.
Tourism was down before, around the time of the U.S. raid on Libya. That was when President Reagan recommended that Americans not come to the Middle East. It was also down during the first year of the intifada. But in 1989, we had more tourists than in 1988 or 1987 or even 1986. It was booming in the first part of this year as well. Only now is it down because of the gulf crisis.
But in reality, our security problems don't create any more risks than there are in other countries around the world. They will not damage the prospects for investing in Israel.
Q. You recently outlined a new series of incentives for investing in Israel. Why?
Mr. Nissim: I submitted to the Government a new plan hoping to accelerate the growth of our economy. The goal is to create a lot of new jobs. You know why? Because within the next three years we'll absorb a million Jews from the Soviet Union. Our population will increase by 25 percent, more or less. That is something quite unusual.
Q. Does the plan focus on selling state-owned companies?
Mr. Nissim: Privatization is only one component. There are a lot of separate components. We are trying to create the conditions for growth. We are trying to encourage investments -- local and foreign. We have to double and triple investment. We have to increase our business-sector output by 12 percent a year. We have to double exports within four years. If not, we will not have new jobs for the immigrants. This is our main task. We want to accomplish it by encouraging investments. How? The Government will participate with the investor to offset the risk. The investor has to put in one-third of the investment and the Government will give a state guarantee for two-thirds. The investor has to go to the bank to get a loan, of which two-thirds will be guaranteed. In different parts of the country the incentives vary. In the north and south we give guarantees and 10 years of exemption from income tax and company tax.
Q. Israel is famous for its slow and cumbersome bureaucracy. How are you going to deal with that?
Mr. Nissim: Everyone talks about the bureaucracy. This is what we've done. The company has to make an application to the Israel Investment Center in our ministry. We will make a decision within 12 working days, not more. We will examine the record of the investor and the business plan, all within 12 days. We'll give the decision without bureaucracy. If it takes longer than 12 days, then the answer is an automatic "yes." We want to cut -- no, crush -- the bureaucracy.
Q. A lot of countries are competing for a limited amount of foreign investment. Why should a company invest in Israel?
Mr. Nissim: We offer grants and we have state guarantees. We offer an exemption from taxes. We offer a free-trade area and a very high level of facilities -- banks, communications, infrastructure. But there is something else. Highly skilled manpower as a proportion of the total work force. In the 1990's, 33.5 percent of our work force will be highly skilled versus 16 percent in the U.S. Twenty-two percent of the new immigrants from the Soviet Union are engineers; engineers will make up 6 percent of our work force in the 1990's versus 1.6 for the U.S. It is a higher percentage than in Denmark, Germany, Ireland and Japan.
Q. There has been opposition to foreign investment within Israel, hasn't there? Privatizing the national airline, El Al, has been a subject of controversy.
Mr. Nissim: El Al is not a company that is easy to privatize because it has some legal problems. The company is under receivership. It's a very good company, but because of strikes 10 or 12 years ago, it was put under the receiver. It will be privatized, but not tomorrow.
Q. There has also been controversy over the foreign purchase of the state-owned Israel Chemical Industry.
Mr. Nissim: Correct. But I am in favor to privatizing it. We have some things to do there too. My idea is to sell shares on the stock exchanges in New York and in Tel Aviv. In the first stage, we'll sell 12.5 percent in New York and 12.5 in Tel Aviv.
We want to deregulate our economy. You can see it in our plan. We deregulated control of foreign currency. I opened the market in a lot of areas. Our plan is to gradually open all of our industries and all sectors of our economy -- textiles, food chemicals and electronics -- everything will be open.

HEADLINE: Railroads Meet Steep Grades in Trying to Haul Trash

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
SEVERAL years ago, some railroad executives and consultants began referring to the garbage mountains accumulating in the nation's cities as "urban ore."
The railroads envisioned a tantalizing new opportunity in hauling the wastes hundreds or even thousands of miles to incinerators, recycling plants and remote high-tech disposal sites dubbed megafills. They foresaw a $1 billion market by the turn of the century, because thousands of older landfills in populous regions were nearing capacity or facing closure due to environmental problems. In addition, they expected revenues and even higher profit margins from hauling lesser amounts of hazardous waste, including contaminated soil. 
 So far, though, the new business is inching ahead at most railroads with all the speed of an iron-ore train huffing up a steep grade.
"It's developed more slowly than anyone anticipated," said Roderick Willey, a consultant with Waste Placement Professionals Inc. in Dayton, Ohio. Indeed, most analysts say there is little chance that such business will have a measurable impact on earnings in the next few years.
The delay has not caused railroad executives to give up on the market, or even to stop making ambitious plans. Two railroads, for example, are involved in separate plans to haul hundreds of millions of tons of waste out of the Los Angeles area over the next century. Others are pursuing ventures to haul hazardous waste in Oklahoma and municipal wastes in Washington State.
Yet, for now, even the biggest waste hauler, Conrail, has only a modest operation: its tonnages are small and the business is scarcely more mature than operations at other railroads that are hauling wastes sporadically and searching for dependable markets.
Nationwide, railroads are unlikely to capture more than 15 percent of the garbage-hauling market -- about 30 million tons -- before the latter part of the decade, according to Dean Wise, a transportation expert at the consulting firm of Temple, Barker & Sloane in Lexington, Mass.
One problem is that railroads have needed time to figure out the best types of equipment to handle different types of waste. Some railroad executives say they are still getting to know the marketplace, having had few previous contacts with waste-collection companies, municipal sanitation departments and other customers they need to wean from truckers.
Moreover, truckers have been able to carry all kinds of consumer goods -- even food -- in one direction and wastes on their return trip, a cost-cutting strategy known as backhauling that has allowed them to offer unbeatable prices to waste generators in many urban areas. Railroads have not had the right blend of equipment and customers to offer similar deals. Congress passed legislation early this year calling for restrictions on backhauling by trucks transporting food and agricultural products, but regulations implementing the limits are not expected until next year at the earliest.
BUT the biggest problem has been the lack of disposal sites approved by state and Federal regulators that are easily accessible to rail lines.
"The lack of environmentally sound destinations has really held us back," said Steve Watson, assistant vice president in charge of hazardous and solid waste at the CSX Corporation, which has its railroad operations based in Baltimore.
That problem will probably not be cured quickly, given the opposition in most areas to any new development that smacks of waste handling or disposal. Railroad executives say there are already cases in which local groups have blocked railroads from building "transfer stations" where wastes can be loaded on to trains. In other cases, protesters have pressured regulators or disposal-site owners to reduce or even block importation of out-of-state garbage.
The Supreme Court has ruled that outright bans on such imports are illegal. But strict licensing requirements and a variety of fee structures have proven to be equally imposing hurdles in many cases.
"This is a challenge like nothing I've ever seen before," said Barry Vann, director of environmental logistics and marketing for the Burlington Northern Railroad Company, based in Fort Worth. "Economics don't determine whether you will make any money. It's all relationships with states and local communities."
Just last month, a ballot initiative in South Dakota forced developers to suspend construction of a megafill that would have received wastes hauled from out of state on a Burlington Northern line.
Despite such obstacles, long-distance rail transportation of wastes is growing and should accelerate as the decade progresses.
"We have reached the stage where we carry something every day," said Ellison Wefel, manager of the solid-waste business group at Conrail, which was formed in 1976 to take over the freight operations of the bankrupt Penn Central and five smaller Northeast railroads. "The grand numbers some people envisioned are still somewhere down the road, but we are optimistic we'll get there."
Conrail serves the Northeast and portions of the Midwest, where waste-disposal problems are especially pressing and the cost of local disposal can reach $150 a ton or more, more than 10 times that of some areas in the West.
Last year, Conrail was paid about $4 million to ship municipal wastes and incinerator ash and $5.7 million to ship contaminated soils and hazardous waste. The waste material was taken to disposal sites in Conrail's region or to other railroads that carried it as far as Florida or states west of the Mississippi.
Conrail expects its solid-waste revenues to reach $40 million to $50 million by 1994. It anticipates that hazardous-waste revenues will grow 10 to 15 percent annually, to as much as $11.5 million, over the same period. Such sums pale beside the company's total revenues -- $3.4 billion last year -- but the company sees long-range potential for further growth.
"IT'S all new business, so it's very important to Conrail," said Wayne Michel, the company's director of asset management. Smaller regional railroads, notably the Long Island Rail Road, feed substantial amounts of the waste into the Conrail system for shipment.
Conrail has moved further into the waste business through its stake in the Concord Resources Group, a year-old Pittsburgh-based joint venture with the OHM Corporation, an environmental concern best known for cleanups of hazardous waste. Concord is seeking a permit to build a hazardous-waste disposal site next to Conrail tracks in western Pennsylvania and hopes to open a string of solid-waste disposal sites in rural sections of the 17 states Conrail serves. Conrail has invested $5 million in Concord and lent it $100 million.
The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company has more focused -- but no less ambitious -- plans for its joint venture with Waste Management Inc., the nation's largest solid-waste disposal company. The two companies have pledged to invest $85 million in a proposal to ship up to 200 million tons of waste from the Los Angeles area over the next century to a megafill on the railroad's property 225 miles to the east in the Mojave Desert. Dubbed Rail-Cycle, the project includes recycling programs and up to six processing centers in the Los Angeles region.
"We hope to handle about half the Los Angeles basin's solid waste, but it would be worth our while if we get half that," said Delbert M. Miller, the railroad's spokesman for the project. At its projected disposal cost of $41.50 a ton in 1989 dollars, the project could bring in as much as $8.3 billion.
A JOINT venture involving the Southern Pacific Railroad, Western Waste Industries and the Mine Reclamation Corporation to transport similar amounts of garbage from the Los Angeles region to abandoned iron ore mines south of the Rail-Cycle site fell apart earlier this year. (Western Waste is a Los Angeles-based waste-disposal company; Mine Reclamation is a privately held startup venture based in Norwalk, Calif.)
Mine Reclamation hopes to go ahead with the project and Southern Pacific remains the logical choice to haul the waste because its tracks run by the mines, according to Gary Korvall, a Mine Reclamation spokesman. With the Los Angeles region generating up to 80,000 tons of solid waste a day, Mr. Korvall said, there is ample room for both projects.
Waste Management, meanwhile, is working with another railroad, the Union Pacific, on a more modest program that is scheduled to start hauling waste from Seattle to Waste Management's disposal site in eastern Washington next year.
Since 1988, the Union Pacific, which is based in Omaha, and Uspci Inc. (formerly United States Pollution Control Inc.), a leading hazardous-waste disposal company based in Topeka, Kan., have both been owned by the Union Pacific Corporation of Allentown, Pa. Internal committees have been asked to explore potential synergies.
But Uspci has operated independently since it was acquired and continues to work with other railroads carrying a growing share of the wastes that reach its disposal sites, said Ken Jackson, vice president for business development. For instance, the company is working on a joint venture with Burlington Northern to build a transfer station in Avard, Okla., where hazardous wastes brought by rail from distant places could be unloaded for a short truck trip to Uspci's site in Fairview.
With the megafill project in South Dakota on hold, Mr. Vann at Burlington Northern is more eager than ever to push ahead at Avard. "People see a large, growing market," he said, "but no one ever thought it would be easy to cash in on."
 
 
JUST WHOSE BACKYARD IS IT?
 Burlington Northern got an expensive lesson in how strong the "not in my backyard" factor can be during last month's elections.
A group of developers operating under the name South Dakota Disposal Systems Inc. had persuaded the community of Edgemont, S.D., and the South Dakota Board of Minerals and Environment to license development of a 1,200-acre megafill that would take solid wastes from around the state and, by means of the Burlington Northern line that ran by the site, vast amounts of out-of-state waste from sources as far away as New York. Megafills are designed to minimize leakage and other problems associated with older landfills.
But an environmental group based 90 miles away in Rapid City placed an initiative on the ballot requiring that all megafills be approved by the State Legislature.
The megafill's backers and the railroad spent more than $1.5 million opposing the measure, compared with about $25,000 by the environmental group, but lost, getting only 47 percent of the vote. South Dakota Disposal Systems was forced to suspend construction. Opponents have pledged to force a statewide referendum on the issue if the legislature approves the megafill this winter.
"I'm skeptical about the prospects for this business unless we can win some battles like the one in South Dakota," said Barry Vann, Burlington Northern's director of environmental logistics and marketing. He said it was especially discouraging because Edgemont voters once again endorsed the plans in the election only to be outvoted by the rest of the state.
To combat the "Nimby" factor, railroads have begun to argue that long-distance garbage shipments not only make economic sense but also are environmentally preferable. They claim that it is riskier to dump wastes at sea or bury them in states in which populations are denser, water tables higher and rainfall more plentiful.
Kim Marie Kiepke, the Rapid City environmentalist who led the initiative fight, said such claims may be true but are beside the point if the nation needs to work far harder to avoid burying wastes anywhere.
"In return for today's solution, we are getting tomorrow's problem," she said. "We are arguing that to the extent we and the other Northern Plains states provide easy dumping sites, we are undermining recycling efforts everywhere."

HEADLINE: So Many Taxes, So Few Services

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I was depressed to read the article by Stuart Meyers, "A Company Gives Up on New York" (Forum, Nov. 4). But I was even more depressed to read the ad hominem attacks written in response. The question is not whether Mr. Meyers should have purchased insurance. The question is why insurance rates are so high given the amount spent on the criminal justice system. And given the increases in water charges in the last decade, why can't the city provide pipes that don't rupture? Not one writer responded to the real problem: Why can't this city provide services commensurate with the amount spent on services? Unless it does, people will continue to vote with their feet to the detriment of the city, the state and this country.

HEADLINE: NEW YORK WEIGHS MORE TENNIS SPACE

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
New York City officials say they will consider leasing additional land in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park to the United States Tennis Association so it can build a bigger and better complex there for the United States Open.
That position heartens those who fear that the tournament might be moved out of the city if the association -- whose current lease on its 17-acre park site expires in 1994 -- cannot have a larger and more efficient National Tennis Center. 
 But it distresses some civic leaders in Queens and parks advocates, who oppose what they term the city's propensity to give up pieces of the three-mile-long park -- the city's largest after Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx and one of its most heavily used -- for commercial ventures or other non-park uses. They are already upset by a city plan to build a seven-acre 40-million-gallon underground sewage tank in the park just several hundred yards from the center.
 
'The Answer Is Yes'
 Mayor David N. Dinkins, an avid tennis player who attended some matches at the Open this year, has expressed concern that the tournament's departure would cost the city's economy more than $100 million a year in what those attending the annual two-week late-summer event spend for hotels, restaurants and other services.
"The question is do we want the United States Tennis Association to say in New York, and the answer is yes," Betsy Gotbaum, the city's Parks and Recreation Commissioner, said recently. "If the condition of their staying is they want some more land, the answer is yes."
Mrs. Gotbaum said in an interview that expansion of the tennis center could take place on land outside the park, just north of the center, but also that it could take place on parkland.
She and other administration officials said talks with the association had just begun and any agreements were a "long way" off. The tennis group has not even indicated yet how much additional space it might need or what the size or design of an expanded center might be, they said.
But Mrs. Gotbaum said that aside from wanting more seats, the associaton wanted to do away with the tight spaces between stands that made it difficult for the crowds to move around.
 
Critics Vow Court Fight
 The current center is at the northern end of the park, just south of the subway yards and Long Island Rail Road tracks, which separate it from Shea Stadium. The center comprises the 20,000-seat Louis Armstrong Stadium; a 6,000-seat adjunct and 25 additional courts, some indoors and some outdoors, which members of the public pay to use when the Open is not taking place.
Mrs. Gotbaum acknowledged potential opposition to allotting more of the park to the Tennis Association, and that the association would have to "mitigate" the loss of parkland. The association might have to buy nearby land that could be added to the park, or to provide community recreational operations within an expanded center.
Critics of granting additional parkland to the Tennis Center vowed to fight any such move in court.
Patricia Dolan, the first vice president of the United Civic Council of Queens, made up of 35 civic groups in the borough, said, "We are absolutely appalled at what the Parks Department is considering doing." She said parkland was a "public trust and not to be looked upon as something to trade."
Benjamin M. Haber, a lawyer and president of the Civic Association of Kew Gardens Hills, an area east of the park, pointed to the role of Sid Davidoff, a politically connected lawyer and lobbyist who represented the race promoters and who is now negotiating on behalf of the Tennis Association. Mr. Davidoff is a tennis partner of Mayor Dinkins and raised a large amount of money for his mayoral campaign.
But a spokeswoman for Mr. Dinkins, Catie Marshall, said Mr. Davidoff's ties with the Mayor "have nothing to do with anything."
"The U.S. Tennis Association brings in enormous revenues to the city," she said, "and for that reason alone we would deal seriously with them, whoever is negotiating."
Mr. Davidoff said he had been retained because "I know the park pretty well; I know Queens, and I know tennis."
He said the Tennis Association's board preferred to keep the Open in New York and that "they want to stay in Flushing Meadows" because of its convenience to major highways, the subway and the Long Island Rail Road. But the association "has indicated it needs an expanded and better facility," he said.

HEADLINE: NO MOVES ON RICE BY JAPAN ARE SEEN

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Japanese negotiators departed Friday for a crucial round of trade talks in Brussels next week amid signs that they were no more prepared than in the past to ease the nation's ban on rice imports.
While not eager to admit it openly, officials acknowledge that the stalemate between the United States and the European Community over American demands to reduce protection of farm products had eased the pressure on Japan to make concessions. 
 They also said they did not expect the deadlock to be broken in Brussels.
"The E.C. will not make major concessions during the Brussels meeting," said a Japanese official. "Such a deep gulf cannot be bridged in five days."
Japan and the United States have had a series of trade disputes in recent years -- over supercomputers, telecommunications equipment, wood products and other matters -- that have been addressed in talks between the countries. Washington relegated the rice issue to the multilateral talks, being conducted by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world body that oversees trade.
 
Pressure on Rice Import Ban
 For years, Japan has been under pressure to ease its ban on rice imports, which it argues is necessary for food security. Instead, Japan proposes reducing some farm subsidies in return for a promise that its own rice market remain completely protected.
The United States has rejected the Japanese position, and Vice President Dan Quayle carried a sharp message to Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu when he attended the enthronement of Emperor Akihito three weeks ago.
Japan is also under pressure to ease barriers on other fronts. Japan has tariffs on dairy products, starches, tomato products and certain types of vegetables, all products over which Tokyo has been slow to make concessions.
The Japanese strategy appears to be to wait until the American dispute with the European Community has been resolved, and then to decide itself whether to make concessions on rice.
 
How Tokyo Is Perceived
 How much of a concession is made is likely to depend on whether Tokyo is perceived as a stumbling block to successful completion of the talks.
Officials here acknowledge that Japan is deeply divided and hampered by weak leadership under Mr. Kaifu, who has a small political base and is viewed by Japanese as less powerful than others behind the scenes.
Rice farmers are a powerful constituency of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, not simply because 90 percent are part-time farmers employed in other professions, but because rice-growing is a key to the health of fertilizers, chemicals and other agriculture-related industries.
Moreover, the Ministry of Agriculture continues to issue warnings about the possible disastrous consequences of easing the rice import ban. It argues that such a step would throw entire communities into a recession.
 
Another View in Japan
 On the other hand, officials at other powerful ministries, including Finance, Foreign Affairs, and International Trade and Industry, say they recognize that Japan cannot afford to be seen as the stumbling block at the GATT talks.
Japanese officials reason that should GATT fail, there would simply be pressure from the United States on rice.
A broader concern among Japanese officials is that the talks' failure might lead to greater barriers to Japanese exports in Europe and elsewhere. Japan also shares the United States position that GATT is needed to eliminate protection in the developing world of telecommunication, insurance, banking and other services.

HEADLINE: Officials in Cuba Seem to Be on the Defensive

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAVANA, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Senior Government and Communist Party officials in Havana often begin discussions with foreigners these days on a wry, almost plaintive note, before reverting to their customarily combative defense of their Revolution.
"So, have you too come to say that we are doomed?" one official after another asked of a recent visitor, recounting the increasingly pessimistic assessments made by academics, diplomats and journalists from both friendly and antagonistic countries, of the country's ability to resolve itsgrave economic and social problems while, almost alone in the world, it clings to Communism. 
 "People look at us and say, 'the water is up to your neck,' " said Julio A. Garcia Oliveras, a Central Committee member, of Cuba's sudden loss of most of its traditional economic partners since the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe.
Even as they issue such defiant proclamations, the country's leadership shows increasing signs of anxious searching, as it seeks to both retain popular support and reorganize its economy in a world where international underpinnings for both arequickly dissolving.
As Communist-style rule has lost much appeal in the world, Cuban officials, while clinging to the label, have increasingly sought to emphasize two other central tenets of their ideology: a high-pitched nationalism that celebrates the authenticity of the country's revolution and faithfulfulness to the person of President Fidel Castro.
Revolution and national independence are "insolubly linked," Mr. Castro has said in recent speeches, which have dwelt lengthily on Cuba's identity.
The Cuban leadership, meanwhile, has ceaselessly wielded the threat of a United States invasion to drum up support, loudly amplifying the supposed menace with the United States interventions in Grenada and Panama.
Officials commonly predict that if American soldiers do not fight in the Persian Gulf, a thirst for blood will push President Bush to attack Cuba.
Internally, as it prepares for a crucial fourth congress of the Communist Party to be held sometime early next year, Cuban leadership is seeking to project a more benign image.
In a wide-ranging interview, Cuba's first vice president, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, a gray-bearded 77-year old, who diplomats say has long been entrusted with Mr. Castro's most sensitive missions, spoke of the "mistake" of Stalinism, confessing that the leadership had committed many errors, including what he called intolerance. The Cuban Communist Party, he said, wasbeing streamlined to ease communication between the leadership and the people.
 
If Lenin Had Lived Longer
 "Our first conclusion is that a revolution, to keep moving forward, must be authentic, not imposed" Mr. Rodriguez said, explaining the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. "In the Soviet Union, with all of its problems, Socialism is holding up better. I think if Lenin had lived a few more years, we would have a different situation."
"One of the fundamental characteristics of our revolution is the direct link between the leadership, headed by Fidel, and the people," he added. "You really need to go out into the streets with him to see it, to give yourself an idea of the degree of identification between the people and Fidel,"Told that many Cubans had expressed weariness with Mr. Castro's leadership during street conversations with a visitor, Mr. Rodriguez said: "We have the support of 80 or 90 percent of the population. The others are either strongly against us or are equivocal."
Cuban human rights advocates dispute this figure, saying popular support for the Government is closer to 20 percent or less, and falling in the face of growing economic hardship.
"Up until the end with Ceausescu, you could see vast halls of people applauding on cue," said Gustavo Arcos Bergnes, one of Cuba's leading human rights advocates, of the Romanian dictator who was overthrown last year. "These say all sorts of things, but they don't even believe them themselves anymore.

HEADLINE: Can Japanese Import Save an Oyster Industry?

 BODY:
New Jersey environmental officials, hoping to buoy a sinking oyster industry, are considering introducing a new species -- the Japanese oyster -- into the Delaware Bay.
The idea has been proposed by scientists from the state and the Rutgers University Shellfish Research Laboratory in Bivalve, N.J. But it has been strongly opposed by environmentalists and neighboring states, who warn that the species from the Far East could irrevocably alter the bay's ecosystem, as well as those of estuaries all along the Atlantic seaboard. 
 The scientists, however, say the Japanese oyster, or Crassostrea gigas,could prove resistant to two parasites that have mysteriously decimated the native Eastern oyster and the industries it has nurtured in New Jersey since the colonial era.
One parasite, called MSX, has ravaged the Eastern oyster from the Carolinas to New England since it was discovered in 1957. Another, called Dermo, was once confined to the Gulf of Mexico but has recently spread as far north as the Delaware Bay. Neither is a threat to people.
"At some point people will realize they will have to look for alternatives," said Dr. Standish K. Allen, a Rutgers researcher who wants to test whetherthe Japanese oyster can adapt to the Atlantic seaboard. "Almost anything is better than nothing."
But some environmentalists say that introducing the Japanese oyster is short-sighted and that efforts should rather be spent protecting the diminishing populations of Eastern oysters.
"What happens if they introduce them and in five years they succumb to these same diseases and have crowded out native oysters, and we have no oysters left?" said Peter Defur, who studies oysters for the Environmental Defense Fund in Richmond.
In New Jersey, oyster boats landed 7.2 million pounds of oyster meat in1950, but in 1980 they hauled in only 756,546 pounds. For three years, from 1987 to 1989, New Jersey closed the beds altogether.
If introduced, the Japanese oyster would transform the industry. Instead of planting and then harvesting oysters from the sea bottom, oystermen would grow the Japanese oysters on trays.
Robert L. Morgan, owner of the Port Norris Oyster Company, said he is "very much opposed to that." But he acknowledged that the industry is desperate for a solution.
The hearty Japanese oyster, which is abundant along the Far Eastern Pacific Rim, has been introduced in other regions, including the Pacific Northwest. While it has revived some oyster industries, it has also disrupted native populations.
This year, Dr. Allen sought thestate's permission to put several thousand Japanese oysters at seven sites on Delaware Bay to test the species' adaptability to baywaters.
But the test was put off when neighboring states, including Delaware, objected, saying it did not do enough to prevent the oysters from escaping.
 
Unanswered Questions
 "There are all kinds of questions, both ecological and economic, that have not been answered," including whether the Japanese oyster will co-exist with or wipe out the Eastern oyster, said Jack G. Travelstead of the Virginia Marine Resources Commission. In May, the commission refused to approve a similar plan by the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences at the College of William and Mary.
The Atlantic States Marine FisheriesCommission, an advisory body, refused to endorse New Jersey's experiment and on Nov. 14 recommended that tests on the Japanese oyster be restricted to the laboratory until more is known about its impact on the environment.
"The Catch-22 is that you can't release gigas until you know its ecological impacts, but you can't know its ecological impacts without releasing it into the environment, at least on a scientific basis," Dr. Allen said.
Despite the commission's resolution, which is not legally binding, New Jersey officials said they are still considering Dr. Allen's proposal.
"We're still going to do it eventually," said Bruce A. Halgren, director of the Marine Fisheries Administration. "It's part of our mandate to pursue avenues of potential restoration of the oyster industry."

HEADLINE: Speedometers to Be Used to Raise Subway Speeds

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
A subway rider can go from Bowling Green to Bloomingdale's in about 16 minutes, or nearly half the time the 4.8-mile trip would take in a taxi fighting midday traffic in Manhattan, the New York City Transit Authority boasts in a recent radio commercial.
Riding the subway trains around town should get even faster, transit officials say, under a plan to speed them up by installing speedometers in them, beginning in the spring. By knowing precisely how fast they are going, train operators, or motormen, will be less wary of exceeding subway speed limits, the officials say. 
 "We are not trying to get our drivers to operate unsafely or to drive like bats out of hell," said Termaine Garden, a Transit Authority spokesman, "but we are trying to get them to go closer to the maximum safe speed."
Motormen now rely on instinct and experience to judge how fast they should go, and that usually means they veer toward caution, particularly if they are wary of poor track conditions, transit officials say. A recent survey by the management consultant firm of McKinsey & Company found that 80 percent of subway trains travel at speeds below the safety limit of 50 miles an hour. While the exact speed of the trains varies throughout the route depending on the turns, condition, and grading of the track, most trains travel an average of 40 to 45 miles an hour.
 
'Extremely Cautious'
 For the last 20 years, motormen have been required to go slower because of the poor condition of subway cars and tracks. "The old track and cars posed operating dangers, so we had to be extremely cautious," said Andrew Bata, the Authority's director of rapid transit service planning.
But since the Transit Authority began its $12 billion capital program in 1982, he said, 493 miles of subway track have been replaced, 1,175 new subway cars have been purchased and 4,181 old cars have been overhauled, making it safe to speed up again.
"It's like driving a car," Mr. Bata said. "When you see a road full of dips and potholes, you go slower until the road is repaved."
But some motormen doubt whether speedometers would make any difference in how fast they go, and some are concerned that higher speeds would only add to the stress of their jobs and reduce their control over the trains.
 
Trains Will Be Staggered
 "Speedometers would be great as long as they don't use them to make us go faster and faster," said Louis Aponte, 32, who has been a motorman for four years. "These trains do not stop on a dime, and the motormen who have less experience will probably have difficulty controlling the trains if they are asked to go faster."
Increasing the speed of the trains, even by a small percentage, would mean passengers would arrive at their destinations sooner, if only by a few minutes, transit officials say. But higher speeds would not mean that trains would arrive at a given station more frequently. Rather, trains will be staggered at greater distances from one another, meaning fewer trains and motormen will be needed to meet current timetables. That will save millions of dollars in maintenance and operating costs, the Transit Authority says.
Transit officials estimate that reducing the average time it takes a subway train to complete its run by 5 percent could save the Authority about $15 million a year. Such a reduction in travel time would allow the Authority to eliminate a total of 300 subway cars from the system. Each subway car costs about $50,000 a year to maintain.
Hit hard by a weak regional economy, declining mass-transit subsidies from New York State and shrinking ridership, the transit agency is scrambling to find ways to cut costs to offset a swelling deficit that is estimated at $272 million for fiscal 1991. A report by McKinsey & Company said that the Transit Authority could save about $80 million a year by installing the speedometers, increasing the number of express trains and those that skip every other station, revising speed limits, reducing the time the trains remain in stations, increasing maintenance productivity, and running shorter trains during off-peak hours.
 
'More Work for the Same Pay'
 The agency is considering all those measures. Though running the trains faster will require more electricity, the Transit Authority says the extra cost will be minimal and offset by the other savings.
But most motormen interviewed recently said that the new speedometers would make their jobs more difficult.
Norman Smith, a 30-year-old motorman who operates a No. 2 train on the IRT line, said: "What they are doing is increasing the pressure on us and asking us to do more work for the same pay. It's not easy being locked in that small cab for hour after hour and now they want to drive us even harder."
Harry Slade, 46, who has been a motorman with the Authority for 22 years, said, "We've been doing fine without the speedometers all these years so why do we need them now." And Mr. Slade said, "you always seem to go at just about the right speed -- it comes naturally."
 
'Very Good Judges of Speed'
 Mr. Slade said that instead of spending time and money installing speedometers, the Transit Authority should concentrate on repairing and maintaining the track signals that tell motormen how to proceed.
Louis Brusati, a Transit Authority yard master, who supervises and trains motormen, said that most of the agency's 3,036 motormen were "very good judges of speed" and that installing speedometers on trains would "probably not make a big difference in run times."
But Mr. Brusati said that the speedometers would make the subway system safer because motormen would rely on them when they encounter difficult turns and track grading where they are required to slow down.
To further increase subway efficiency, the Transit Authority is revising the posted safety speed limits in certain parts of the system. For example, since the early 1900's the Authority has required trains to travel at no more than 35 miles an hour when going through an underwater tunnel. "This rule was made so long ago that we don't even know how they came up with 35 as the magic number," Mr. Bata said. "But if we can increase the speed, we eliminate a lot of the delays and congestion we experience on many of our lines where there is only one underwater tube."

HEADLINE: Japanese See Opportunities In U.S. Sludge

 BODY:
A Japanese conglomerate has made an unusual offer to Monticello, N.Y: give us your sludge and used tires, and we will dispose of them at no cost.
World Envirotech, an American subsidiary of the Kubota Corporation of Japan is hoping that officials from American cities will beat a path to Monticello's sludge in search of technology that the company says can turn even the most toxic sludge and tires into a harmless lava-like material. 
 The disposal of sewage sludge -- the waste product left after sewage treatment -- is becoming a critical question for municipalities around the country, and in particular in the New York area, where a Federal law that takes effect in 1991 will bar the dumping of sludge in the ocean.
And as environmental choices are becoming more difficult and costly here, industry analysts say, Japanese businesses are taking an increasingly aggressive approach to marketing waste treatment technologies in America. The ribbon-cutting of the $5 million plant in the shell of an old incinerator in the Sullivan County village in September, for which waste-treatment experts flew in from around the world, is an example, they say.
"It's a marketing thing for them," said Bob Reimers, a professor of environmental sciences at Tulane University, who is sponsoring a conference on sludge management this winter. "They want to see what the operation costs are like in America. We do the same thing in Japan."
 
Burn, Bury or Purify
 Local governments now have three basic choices for disposing of sludge, which is composed mostly of water with some organic materials and some poisonous heavy metals.
They can burn it, and hope to deal with the more modest problem of how to dispose of the ashes, which are often toxic; they can dump it directly into a landfill, and deal with the problem of finding enough land to fill, or they can purify it and try to find farmers who will want to use it as fertilizer.
Composting -- using sludge as a fertilizer -- is the technique environmentalists prefer. Monticello, like many municipalities, has stored its sewage sludge in a landfill.
The Kubota method, which involves exposing the sludge to very high temperatures, is most similar to incineration. But instead of burning the sludge to produce ashes, it melts it, producing a gritty substance that resembles shards of crushed black glass. The used tires are burned to raise the temperature of the flames in the furnace to about 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit.
 
Six Plants in Japan
 The shards can be used as a substitute for fine aggregate, a material used in road construction, officials say. But the economics of the process -- finding a market for the shards -- poses as big a question as the technology does.
World Envirotech plans to give Monticello the aggregate produced by the plant in its first six or seven years, which the village will use to line pipes, said David A. Greenhut, the vice president of World Envirotech.
The sludge-melting technique that Kubota licensed to World Envirotech was first introduced in Japan in 1975. There are now six Kubota plants in operation in Japan, making the company one of the country's largest waste management companies.
Japan has a head start in many environmental technologies because the island is so densely populated that it was forced long ago to find alternatives to dumping sludge, said Barry Mannis, an environmental services analyst at Morgan Stanley. Those Japanese businesses are expected to find more customers as the costs of dumping in landfills rises around the United States.
The Monticello plant has received all the necessary permits to operate, but construction delays have pushed back an opening date to early next year.
 
'Let's Wait and See'
 The state officials who approved the plant said they thought the technology held great potential, but wanted to wait until they had seen it in operation before calling it the sludge solution.
The Monticello plant will treat 25 tons of sludge a day and give off no smoke or odor, officials say. Even so, that capacity dwarfs the village's sludge treatment needs. The company hopes that one revenue source for the plant would other communities' bringing sludge to Monticello for treatment.
Even though Kobuta officials promise to avoid the pollution risks of incineration, dumping or burying sludge, environmentalists said in interviews that they disapproved of the approach.
Sludge is most useful as a fertilizer, said Sarah Clark, a staff scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, and any other use for sludge squanders that potential.
Monticello's Mayor, John Diuguid, who is also a lawyer, said the agreement with World Envirotech would allow the town to buy the plant after 10 years at a 10 to 20 percent discount. Also, he said he thought having a state-of-the-art sludge treatment plant would attract developers to Sullivan County.

HEADLINE: Philadelphia Journal;
Amid Sea of Bad News, An Accent on the Good

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 1

 BODY:
With the city now in its fourth month of fiscal and political paralysis and the prospects of insolvency very real, the Convention and Visitors Bureau has begun a campaign to promote civic pride.
But the bright side of things has tough competition. For example, the Christmas tree in front of City Hall did not light up the first time that Mayor W. Wilson Goode dramatically threw the switch this week. And T. Milton Street, assistant budget director of the Traffic Court, publicly refused to pay $2,600 he owed in parking violations and then had a shouting match with a Traffic Court judge and took over her bench and chair for five hours one day last week. 
 In addition, municipal services are slowly deteriorating, with the city running out of no-parking signs and with contractors walking off jobs, leaving block-long streets unpaved.
Although those are the types of occurrences that make Philadelphia Philadelphia these days, the visitors bureau has its sights on more positive events. For instance, two luxury hotels, including a Ritz-Carlton, and scores of accompanying shops, including a jewel box from Tiffany & Company, opened their finely finished doors for business two weeks ago.
These new buildings and shops are some of the stars of a videotape, "Visions of the 90's," being produced by the bureau for distribution to major employers and civic organizations in the Philadelphia region.
"We're doing a Philadelphia Pride campaign, not a glitz piece, but an educational piece, based on bricks and mortar," said Thomas O. Muldoon, the bureau's president.
The show will not sidestep the city's fiscal problems, but will put them in perspective, he said, adding, "We want to create more faith in the city's future, because if there is a question in people's mind about the city's economic viability, it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy."
All of the projects now opening their doors were conceived in the warmer economic climate of the mid- to late-1980's, but business executives say there is still very good money to be made here. "Philadelphia ranks in the top 10 cities in the United States as far as strong demographics for our type of customer," said Brian E. Ohl, a senior vice president at Tiffany's. "Look at all the great things happening in Philadelphia. Look at the new mall. Look at all the new office buildings. Look at all the new stores."
Julien J. Studley, a national real estate consultant who has taken a look at the city, agrees.
"The secret story of Philadelphia is that it has a certain degree of prosperity greater than any other city in the Northeast," said Mr. Studley, president of Julien J. Studley Inc., a New York-based company with offices in Philadelphia and 14 other cities. "It's got a very diversified economy, and it's attractive because nearly everything costs less there."
The brick-and-mortar star of "Visions of the 90's" is Liberty Place, a pair of 61-story office buildings that add an Art Deco flourish to the skyline. Developed by Rouse & Associates and designed by Helmut Jahn, the $700-million project was the first to be allowed to rise above the statue of William Penn atop City Hall. Liberty Place includes an office tower, the 290-room Ritz-Carlton and 80 shops and restaurants off a street-level, glass-enclosed rotunda.
Some co-stars of the videotape are the $26-million Omni Hotel, a 155-room luxury hotel that also opened this month on Independence Mall, a dozen new shops at the renovated Bellevue Hotel and a new terminal at Philadelphia International Airport that is scheduled to open early next year. A convention center, now a six-square-block hole in the ground, is scheduled for completion in 1993, and an associated hotel, a 1,200-room Marriott, is scheduled to open in 1994.
These and other healthy new projects, when packaged into a 15- or 20-minute videotape, could well shore up people's confidence in the city's economy. But whether it will resusitate civic pride remains to be seen.
"It's not that my pride in the city isn't re-invigorated by these new shops and buildings," said Ruth Anne Gage, echoing the comments of several Philadelphians interviewed the other day as they shopped and strolled around the new shops and buildings.
"But these things are happening in spite of what's happening in city government," said Ms. Gage, a 29-year-old retailing executive. "One-hundred and fifty years ago, the city leaders were corrupt and the city was full of patronage. I don't think that has changed very much."

HEADLINE: Bush to Press Trade on South American Trip

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
President Bush leaves on a weeklong tour of South America on Sunday intended to further his efforts to create a hemispheric free-trade zone and demonstrate interest in a continent long forsaken by United States Presidents.
Administration officials said they did not expect any major agreements to come out of Mr. Bush's trip to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Venezuela. But they said that along with economic matters a broad range of items would be discussed, including protection of the Amazon jungle, nuclear nonproliferation and the continuing instability in Central America. 
 A senior State Department official said that, in a time when oil-fueled inflation, debts and economic austerity programs threaten to weaken the authority of democratically elected Governments, especially in Chile, Argentina and Brazil, "we want to give these guys a shot in the arm."
 
'You Can't Walk Away From It'
 A second senior official noted that Mr. Bush was the first American President "to look south of Panama" since Richard M. Nixon, and that he would work hard to rekindle relations withArgentina, Brazil and Chile that cooled during years of military rule. "He has the vision that Latin America is too important to let it be poisoned. You can't walk away from it."
Aside from parades and other pageantry designed to spotlight Mr. Bush's excellent rapport with several Latin leaders, the focus of the trip will be on promoting Mr. Bush's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative.
The initiative envisions an eventual free-trade zone from the North Pole to Tierra del Fuego. It calls for negotiations to reduce $7 billion of the region's $12 billion debt to the United States Government, and includes $300 millionin fresh aid to be provided by the United States and other international donors to encourage Latin financial and economic reforms. The program also permits countries, particularly Amazonian nations like Brazil, to make debt interest payments to a fund for environmental-protection projects.
 
Ties Into Brady Plan
 The Enterprise for the Americas Initiative fits neatly with the Brady Plan, an Administration proposal that developing debtor countries sell state-owned industries and cut spending while commercial banks forgive some debts and lower interest payments on others. So far, Costa Rica and Mexico have reached agreements with their creditors under the Brady Plan, and Uruguay and Venezuela expect to complete arrangements soon. Mr. Bush is expected to encourage Presidents Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil and Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina to press on with their economic reform programs of privatization and cutting deficits so they may work out arrangements under the Brady Plan with their creditors as well.
Latin American leaders pledged in telephone interviews to give Mr. Bush a warn welcome.
"He understands and respects us," said President Luis Alberto Lacalle of Uruguay. "He knows where we are on the map, and we like that."
President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela said, "There is no doubt that the Enterprise for the Americas is the most advanced proposal the United States has ever proposed for Latin America. It's a revolutionary, historical reaching out."Such comments underscore the fact that Mr. Bush is the beneficiary of a new Latin American intellectual trend away from anti-United States political ideology and populist economic thinking that fueled growing debts with Government subsidies and bureaucracy in the 1970's and 80's.
Sol M. Linowitz, a former United States representative to the Organization of American States and negotiator of the Panama Canal treaties, predicted that Mr. Bush would receive plenty of abrazos, or embraces, during this trip.
"But behind the abrazos," he said, "there are real concerns. The hard truth is that the practice of democracy in many of these countries is floundering."

HEADLINE: As Alertness Outlives Vigor, New Kinds of Care for the Old

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
The morning Peggy Scotch was to leave her daughter's house and move into the two-room suite where she plans to spend the rest of her life, she fumbled the battery from her hearing aid, dropped it on the floor and began to weep.
For the past week, Mrs. Scotch, who is 85, widowed and arthritic, had been determinedly upbeat about her move, declaring herself delighted with the decor and service at the New Jersey retirement complex she had chosen. 
 But the broken hearing aid was the last straw, crystalizing fears she had been trying to suppress. "I was far away from the people who fix my earphone," she said. "I thought I should have my head examined for making this move. I was scared in a way I've never been scared. It was such an unknown quantity, and I didn't know anyone there."
Such moves, and such fears, have become more common as older Americans, unable to manage housekeeping on their own, but not ready for a nursing home, turn increasingly to complexes offering a new way of life to the old and infirm, with private rooms or suites, three restaurant-style meals a day, activities, maid service and access to nursing care for those whose health declines.
 
The Sadder Stage
 While many of these continuing-care communities promote their elegant lobbies and good food, to people like Mrs. Scotch they represent a second, sadder stage of retirement after failing health prevents them from enjoying the active retirement life they chose when they first stopped working.
Mrs. Scotch and her husband, Maurice, who together practiced law in Union Township, N.J., retired 20 years ago to the poolside warmth of Florida. But when her husband died two years ago, Mrs. Scotch's children began pleading with her to move back north. This fall, after a broken leg left her dependent on a walker, Mrs. Scotch gave in to their wishes and decided to move to The Atrium in Allendale.
Also living there is Rose Edelman, who led a lively retirement in Puerto Rico until her husband, Hyman, suffered a stroke and needed nursing care. Mr. Edelman lives in the nursing home part of the complex, while Mrs. Edelman lives in a suite at the other end of the building.
"I haven't come to terms with living like this yet," said Mrs. Edelman, who has Parkinson's disease. "I hope I do. I'm more reconciled than I was, but I still do wake up in the middle of the night wondering what I'm doing here. Yet I can't think of a nicer place to end up. It's right for me now, because I have nowhere else to go, and I can be close to my husband here."
 
 Levels of Care Depend on Health
 The Allendale complex, like most others, offers three levels of care. They are "independent living," where Mrs. Scotch and Mrs. Edelman live, which costs about $2,000 a month for a studio; "assisted living," for those who need help dressing or getting out of bed, which costs $2,400, and the nursing home, for those who become incontinent or demented or, like Mr. Edelman, need rehabilitation from a health crisis, which costs $3,000.
Continuing-care complexes attract the more elderly people; nationwide, the average age of new residents is 79. Most residents are women, most are widowed, and most have never before made a move without their spouses. And like Mrs. Scotch and Mrs. Edelman, most have adult children who worried about their parents' living arrangements, and helped select the new residence.
"After Dad died, it was really hard for us not to be close enough to be of any real help to Mom," said Mrs. Scotch's daughter, Barbara Schreiber, who wearied of traveling to Florida every few months. "So we mentioned, for the 48th time, or was it the 73d, that maybe she should think about moving back north."
Mrs. Schreiber and her brother, who lives in Vermont, left the decision to their mother. But in some cases, admissions directors at the complexes say, children become so upset about their parent's isolation or reclusiveness that they almost bully the parent into moving.
"The hardest transitions tend to be people who believe that families should always live together, that their children have dumped them here and they don't really belong," said Barbara McVeigh, who handles admissions at The Atrium. "Even in the best of circumstances, it usually takes a couple weeks before people begin to feel comfortable. Most of them eventually come to feel that this is the right place for them."
But even those who are happiest to move may have mixed feelings about living so closely with strangers, relinquishing responsibility, however onerous, for running a household and coming to terms with an old age in which they feel diminished by dependency.
"Sometimes I wonder what I'm doing here, surrounded by so many people who are old and sick, but then I remember that I'm not so young and I'm not so well, and I know of no viable alternative," said Mrs. Scotch. "I couldn't market and cook and clean by myself. The only possibility would be having a full-time housekeeper on top of me all day long in an apartment, and that would be very lonely and sad. I don't want to be a burden on my children."
Experts say continuing-care complexes will never attract the majority of older people. In a study by the American Association of Retired Persons, 86 percent of people 55 and over said they wanted to to stay in their own homes in old age. And even most people 85 and over -- a particularly fast-growing segment of the population -- still do live in their own homes, often getting intensive home care to cope with their frailty and health problems.
 
Coming Back North, This Time to Stay
 Mrs. Scotch came north in October to visit her daughter in New City, N.Y., and find a retirement home nearby. There were not many alternatives, since some institutions exclude people with walkers and others have long waiting lists. Mrs. Scotch's daughter and son-in-law had already visited The Atrium, and when Mrs. Scotch saw it, she decided immediately that it was what she wanted.
"It has a beauty parlor, and a bank branch and it is all in very good taste," she said."I decided on the spur of a spur of a moment. I didn't look at the nursing home part, and that was not part of my decision, but I guess in the back of my mind I thought it was a good thing to have there under the same roof."
Still, Mrs. Scotch awoke at 4 A.M. the day she was to move in, and calmed herself by doing crossword puzzles. Her daughter and son-in-law drove her to The Atrium at 10:30. All three were heartened when another resident, carrying a crossword puzzle book, greeted Mrs. Scotch, telling her she was going to love the place.
But the best surprise came a day later, when Mrs. Scotch walked into the dining room and saw Syd Zuckerman, a woman with whom she had been friendly in Florida 15 years earlier, when both still had their husbands. It was a great joy to both, especially since neither had found a soulmate at their assigned dining tables. After a few days, hey were able to arrange to sit together at meals.
"We could talk all day just catching up," said Mrs. Scotch, a tiny woman with the white curls and warm smiles of a storybook grandmother and a thoroughly modern intelligence.
Social contact at meals is a big draw of continuing-care complexes, especially for those with limited mobility. And even complexes where residents have their own kitchens usually require that some meals each day be taken in the communal dining room.
But unwanted social contact can be trying, forcing interaction with those who are slightly senile, overly talkative, querulous or simply incompatible. A tablemate who hums, curses or complains -- or repeatedly appears at the door uninvited -- can become almost unbearable.
"It's like an army barrack or college dormitory, where the constant interaction with people whom you did not select can be like a pressure sore," said Rose Dobrof, executive director of Hunter College's Brookdale Center on Aging. "Because of the constant proximity, some people are afraid to make close friendships, for fear that it won't work out, and they'll be stuck."
That worry has made Mrs. Scotch cautious: "I would love to find another kindred spirit, but I don't want to be impetuous," she said. "I don't want to start a friendship, make a mistake, and not be able to get out gracefully. So I'm trying to make haste slowly."
 
New Friendships In a New World
 Mrs. Scotch said she was looking forward to going on the daily outings but could not do so until her leg healed. But she does go to the word-game session. She singled out a candidate for friendship when there was talk of starting a book group, and she noticed that one of the women from the word games seemed interested.
Among the widows, there is surprisingly little conversation about husbands, a great deal about long-dead parents and even more about children: "Something happens, and all the children have all of a sudden become saints," said Mrs. Edelman, dryly. "I guess that's old age."
Each retirement community is a self-contained world, with some residents who build new friendships, some who rarely leave their rooms, and others who alienate everyone by constant boasting about their past. Most residents leave the premises only for rare visits to a relative's home or group outings to a shopping mall or museum.
Such outings can be a real relief for older people who were almost shut-ins on their own. Mrs. Scotch, for example, never drove, and her husband, who had heart disease, stopped driving two years before his death. Sometimes, she said, friends hesitated to invite her out because of the difficulty of the travel arrangements.
For many older residents, there is great relief in having a call bell in the bathroom, a nurse on the premises, a hot meal in the dining room and a maid. But there is also a bittersweet loss of control over basic daily chores.
"I was a good cook, and I still look at recipes, and then I think, what am I doing, I'm not going to be cooking any more," said Mrs. Scotch.
 
Praying the Money Doesn't Die First
 Rarely discussed, but often present, is a fear of outliving one's money, a fear that is likely to intensify as the industry switches increasingly to pay-as-you-go complexes like The Atrium, and away from nonprofit communities charging a large entry fee to cushion future costs. While all the complexes screen applicants' health and finances, it is unclear what will happen when their projections are wrong and residents live longer, and need more care, than their resources can cover.
At the family-owned Allendale complex, Ms. McVeigh said, the owners have absorbed the costs rather than turning a resident out, in the few cases where the question arose. But directors of most nonprofit complexes express skepticism that in difficult economic times, complexes run by large corporations for profit will make the same decision.
Even for the most affluent elderly, it is hard to adjust to a future less full than the past.
"I used to go walking at night in the first snow, and the stars would come out, and I would say to my husband that it's just like diamonds; I never thought I'd be left a widow," Mrs. Scotch said. "Sometimes you feel as if you're not whole, because you are so dependent on other people. But I'm not in a hovel, I'm not beholden to anybody, and I think I've made the right choice moving here."

HEADLINE: Unemployment Insurance Aiding Fewer

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
The unemployment insurance system, the main Government program meant to ease the pain of recession, is much less effective than it used to be, largely because the Federal Government and the states have let it wither rather than raise taxes to sustain it.
As a consequence, barely one-third of the jobless are now receiving unemployment checks. Experts say that proportion will not rise much even if the country enters a severe and prolonged recession, a prospect many economists and politicians believe is not beyond possibility. 
At the depth of the recession in 1975, more than three-quarters of the people out of work received unemployment benefits from the Government. In the last recession, in 1982, about half got benefits.
"When this recession hits," said Representative Thomas J. Downey, "unemployment insurance is not going to be the effective tool it could and should be. A lot of innocent people are going to be hurt because of our inaction." Mr. Downey, a Democrat from Long Island, is acting chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee's Human Resources Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over unemployment compensation.
Sentiment against higher taxes is so strong in Washington and across the country that chances are slim the system will be made more generous. Many states may actually tighten eligibility requirements or lower payments next year if the demand for benefits rises.
That could make economic conditions worse, many economists believe. Providing billions of dollars in additional unemployment payments is one way the Government can put money in people's pockets during bad times, slowing the decline in consumption and hastening a recovery.
 
A Cushion for the Jobless
 The unemployment compensation system was established in 1935 by the same law that created the Social Security system. The theory behind unemployment insurance was the same then as now: to provide a temporary cushion for people out of work and to act countercyclically against the economy by making more money available for consumption when unemployment rates were high.
From the beginning, Social Security was administered nationally and paid for by a Federal tax. The unemployment system, by contrast, was delegated to the states, which, within broad Federal guidelines, were given the right to set their own eligibility and benefit standards and to set the level of the tax they imposed on businesses to raise the money.
As the law stands now, all states must require employers to impose a tax of at least eight-tenths of 1 percent on each employee's first $7,000 of pay. But beyond that, the states are free to go in different directions.
Most states base the tax rate on each business's record of laying off workers. Employers that lay off a large percentage of workers and, thus, have many claiming benefits pay a higher tax, and those whose employees make few claims pay the minimum. In three states, Kentucky, Tennessee and Michigan, the rate can be as high as 4.6 percent for employers with the worst records of layoffs. In New York, no employer pays more than 1 percent.
In 36 states, but not New York, the wage base on which the tax is paid is higher than $7,000. The average nationally is about $8,500. But a few go much higher, up to $21,300 in Alaska.
 
Worker Benefits Vary
 How much and how long workers are paid also vary considerably. Most states tie benefits to the amount of wages last earned and the length of time worked for the last employer. Longtime employees can generally get 26 weeks of benefits. In 1989, the average weekly payment was $152; the maximum was $408, in Massachusetts.
But the size of the benefits is not what concerns the critics. As a rule, benefit levels have kept up with inflation over the years, averaging about 35 percent of what workers were earning at their last jobs. What the critics find worrisome is that with each passing year, fewer workers are eligible for any benefits.
That has occurred for two main reasons, said Wayne Vroman, an economist at the Urban Institute, a private research center in Washington. Mr. Vroman, who is working on a study for the Labor Department, has done more analyses of this subject recently than any other economist.
First, he said, most states have tightened eligibility requirements in recent years, requiring workers, for example, to work longer and earn more before they qualify and generally denying benefits altogether to those who were not laid off but quit their jobs voluntarily.
The states did this mostly to avoid raising the taxes they charge employers. Businesses argue, and many politicians agree, that a lower unemployment insurance tax improves the business climate of a state and makes it more attractive to companies that might wish to come there.
 
Changes in Work Force
 The second main reason for the decline in eligibility is that the nature of the work force has changed markedly in the last two decades. Fewer people are in manufacturing jobs, and many more are in services. Service industry employees tend to earn less and change jobs more frequently. Many, especially women, have taken time off from steady work or are part-timers who have not worked enough hours or earned enough pay to qualify under the more stringent rules.
In addition, service workers are less likely to be unionized, and that has made employers bolder in challenging claims in an effort to keep their layoff record cleaner.
"It is almost unheard of for General Motors or Ford to file a challenge, but the fast-food chains do it all the time," said Walter S. Corson, an economist at Mathematica Policy Research, who has also studied the system's shortcomings for the Labor Department.
During recessions, the proportion of the unemployed entitled to benefits tends to be higher than it is during good times. But Mr. Vroman has found in his studies that even if the unemployment rate, 5.7 percent last month, rose as high as 9 percent, indicating a serious recession indeed, only 36 percent to 38 percent of those out of work would be eligible for unemployment checks.
 
Situation May Worsen
 The budget rules that Congress approved last month could worsen the situation. In past recessions, laws were enacted that extended the duration of unemployment benefits from 26 weeks to 52 weeks, with the Federal Government picking up most of the additional cost. The new budget rules require any increase in benefits to be accompanied by a spending cut or a rise in taxes that balances out the cost of the benefits. Those are steps President Bush and Congress are not likely to take.
Michael J. Boskin, chairman of Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview that the Administration had no plans to extend unemployment payments, although he said he could not completely rule it out if a deep recession developed.
In each of the last two years, when the unemployment rate was low, Representative Downey proposed legislation that would raise the minimum wage base to $10,000 nationally from $7,000. He argued that when the economy was healthy, states should beef up their benefit funds, which in many cases are in shaky financial condition. But he faced solid opposition from Republicans and Southern Democrats and never had the votes to get his bill out of the Ways and Means Committee.
Opponents contended that higher taxes hurt business and that better benefits merely encouraged people to remain unemployed.
Mr. Downey said he intended to offer his bill again next year, but he said he had no confidence it would be enacted.
"It's a classic economic march of folly," Mr. Downey said. "We knew what was wrong going into this recession, but now we're going to be completely unprepared."

HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA PANEL BACKS PAY RAISES

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Dec. 1

 BODY:
A citizens' commission rejected protests on Friday and unanimously approved a 40 percent increase in the governor's salary, to $120,000 annually, as well as a rise in state lawmakers' base pay to $52,500.
The panel, the California Citizen's Compensation Commission, was created in an initiative approved by the voters on June 5. The initiative, a political ethics measure, also banned the acceptence of speaking fees.
The commission's decision is final and is not subject to approval by the Legislature or the Governor, but the panel is required to conduct regular reviews of lawmakers' pay.
The new salaries take effect Monday. The commission had tentatively approved the proposal earlier this year.
Besides the governor, those scheduled to receive pay increases are the lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, treasurer, controller and the 120 members of the Assembly and Senate.
 
Protests From Public
 Friday's ratification of the measure was accompanied by boos, hisses and shrieks of protest from taxpayers who jammed the chamber and urged the commission to cut or eliminate elected officials' raises.
More than 200 people attended the meeting, most of them criticizing the new salaries. The critics contended that a worsening economy and state budget problems, including a potential $4.3 billion shortage over two years, required pay cuts, not increases.
There was some support for the pay scale, from lobbyists, a former legislative fiscal adviser and the citizens' group Common Cause, among others, who said elected officials' pay should be commensurate with their responsilities.
 
Governor's Pension Increased
 The measure provides a $21,000 raise -- from $50,000 a year to $71,000 -- in the pension of Gov. George Deukmejian, who is retiring after two terms and will leave office by Jan. 7. The legislative leaders of both houses, including the Assembly Speaker, Willie Brown, and Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti, will get raises to $63,000 a year from $40,816.
Claude Brinegar, a vice president of the Union Oil Company who is the commission's chairman, said the salary levels were decided regardless of the "popularity or unpopularity of the current incumbents." The goal of the commission, he said, was to "set salaries to attract a good range of candidates."
But opponents described the Legislature -- and the commission -- as corrupt and angrily denounced the revised salary schedule.
"How can you give elected officials a $3,000-a-month raise and $1,000 raise for legislators" while asking welfare recipients "to do without a $17 a month cost-of-living adjustment?" asked Harvey Rosenfield, the head of Voter Revolt.
The commission's decision culminated a three-month survey of salary levels of comparable jobs in other states and pay in private industry.

Bush's Overture to Iraq Is Welcomed by Both Egypt and the P.L.O.

BYLINE: By By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Dec. 1

 BODY:
From divergent perspectives within the Arab world, both Egypt and the Palestine Liberation Organization today welcomed the Bush Administration's overture toward Iraq, casting it as a chance to obtain peace.
President Bush's offer of talks with Iraq in Baghdad and Washington sent tremors through the region's diplomacy as the Arab world contemplated an outcome of the crisis short of a war that Arab leaders say publicly they do not want. 
 The foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia, anti-Iraqis who were supposed to meet here today to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis, postponed the encounter until Monday. And Libya, which earlier this week said it had lost interest in the crisis, sent an envoy to Syria to discuss the issue.
The Saudi Press Agency said that President Bush telephoned King Fahd and the exiled Kuwaiti leader, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, on Friday night and that President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt also called the Saudi ruler. Western diplomats here said the American invitation to Iraq was not discussed in detail when President Bush visited Saudi Arabia and Egypt last month.
 
'A Last Chance'
 Egypt, America's leading Arab ally, has sent forces to join the United States-led military buildup in Saudi Arabia, as has Syria, offering the force an Arab profile supposed to legitimize it in regional politics.
President Bush's invitation "represents a last chance to resolve the crisis through peaceful means, as Egyptian diplomacy has sought to do since the start," Deputy Foreign Minister Butros Ghali said in Cairo.
At the Tunis headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the welcome was shaded with concerns that the Palestinian issue be placed on the agenda of United States-Iraqi contacts, as Baghdad insists it should.
"The U.S. President's decision is a step in the right direction," said Yasir Abed Rabbo, a P.L.O. spokesman. "We hope the agenda will include all regional issues, including rapid holding of an international peace conference and international protection for our people under occupation."
"This could be a turning point in the history of the region and could also be the step which precedes war," he said. "That depends on how the U.S. side responds to a comprehensive solution for all regional crises."
While Egypt has led Arab support of American diplomacy in the region, the Palestine Liberation Organization has tilted openly toward Iraq, seeing President Saddam Hussein as its newest champion.
In Taif, Saudi Arabia, where Kuwait maintains a government-in-exile, a Kuwaiti spokesman said Sheik Jaber held "identical" views with President Bush on the crisis.
But Western and Arab diplomats here said the exiled Kuwaitis could come to view the contact between Washington and Baghdad with some trepidation because their position as the only players without control of their own country was inherently vulnerable.
Both the United States and its Arab allies insist on Iraq's unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait and the restoration of what they call its "legitimate" government.
 
Saudis Cancel Egyptian Debt
 Saudi Arabia sought to cement the anti-Iraq alliance further today with a formal announcement that it had canceled Egypt's debt, estimated by Western economists at $4 billion.
The United States has canceled an Egyptian military debt of $7 billion and other gulf nations have forgiven debts of about $3 billion in return for Egypt's commitment of 15,000 soldiers to the multinational force.

HEADLINE: Help for Salvadorans, With a Catch

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 1

 BODY:
For those daring enough to grasp it, the United States is offering a hand of welcome, though an ambiguous one, to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants from El Salvador.
The broad immigration law signed Thursday by President Bush offers among its provisions an 18-month "safe haven" to Salvadorans who have illegally entered the United States. But to qualify for safety, they must make their presence known to the Government, and at the end of the 18 months they return to their former status, illegal alien.
Those who register by July will win the right to live and work in the United States, with all the benefits of legal residents. But after 18 months, with their names and addresses in the hands of the authorities, they become subject to possible deportation.
The safe-haven provision represents a victory for immigrants' rights advocates, who have sought protection for El Salvadorans fleeing the military and political strife in their country, said Guillermo Rodenzo, executive director of El Rescate, a private legal and social services group in Los Angeles. But he said, "It is not clear whether the implementation of the legislation will have a negative or positive impact on the Salvadoran community."
 
Confronting a Quandary
 The law presents groups like his with a quandary. "We'd like to say: 'This is great. Do register and don't worry,' " Mr. Rodenzo said. "But we just can't do that because we don't think it is that wonderful."
But Frank Sherry, an immigration advocate in Washington, said, "The fear that people live with on a daily basis is so overwhelming and debilitating that the opportunity to live free and work safely for 18 months or more is a benefit that may be worth the risk."
Duke Austin, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Washington, noted that the safe-haven provision was intended only to meet what was seen as an immediate need, a humanitarian gesture to provide a respite for people fleeing war.
"There has never been anything said about granting them permanent residence," he said.
Indeed, the provision includes language making it difficult for a person who accepts safe-haven status to apply to stay permanently.
A paradox at the heart of the provision is that the United States is offering a haven for refugees fleeing a Government and a military that Washington supports and helps to finance.
The safe-haven provision is one of several innovations in the immigration law, which also raises quotas for highly skilled immigrants, enlarges the number of Europeans and Africans to be admitted, and ends certain barriers, including those blocking Communists, homosexuals and people with AIDS.
 
Rule Could Be Extended
 The attorney general is empowered to extend the safe haven longer than 18 months, or allow it to lapse. If the time is extended, it is unclear whether immigrants who had chosen to remain underground could then apply.
One of the El Salvadoran immigrants who now faces the decision is Andres Candido, a 51-year-old farmer who said he fled El Salvador two years ago to escape retribution for anti-government activities.
He has turned for counsel to Madeline Janis, executive director of the Central American Refugee Center in Los Angeles. At seminars for El Salvadoran immigrants, her group is urging them to think before registering.
"The military killed some of my brothers because they were with me in a cooperative," Mr. Candido said. "My family and I spent eight years in hiding, moving from place to place, and we were running out of places to hide."
In America, he said, he has found political freedom but economic hardship. Apart from six months' work as a security guard, Mr. Candido has been unemployed and needs relatives' help to support his wife and two daughters.
 
After 18 Months, What?
 "We all want work permits," he said of his fellow immigrants, "but we would like to know what the Government is going to do after 18 months. If they are going to deport us, then maybe it is better for us to remain as we are and not turn ourselves in."
But he added, "I think there are people who will apply out of desperation."
Ms. Janis said 400,000 to 500,000 El Salvadoran immigrants live in Los Angeles, most of them without legal status. They represent perhaps half of all Salvadorans in the United States.
The Salvadorans are only part of a huge wave of Mexican and Central American immigrants who have entered the country illegally in recent years, but they have been singled out for safe haven because of the fighting in their country.
"There are people who are fleeing the general conditions and are in danger of the general violence, and there are people who are a little more active in politics and perhaps labor issues," said Nils Frenzen, a lawyer with a private legal assistance group, Public Counsel, adding, "Everyone in El Salvador is in some degree of danger."
Nevertheless, the United States rejects all but about 2 percent of El Salvadoran applications for political asylum, say immigrant-rights advocates.
 
An Underground Society
 The result is a large underground society here of people who share low-cost housing and work illegally at low-paying jobs, with little prospect of achieving legal residence.
"I think many will participate simply because it will allow them for 18 months and perhaps longer to leave their house every day without having to look both ways for the immigration agent," said Mr. Sherry, executive director of the National Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Forum, a coalition of groups in Washington.
"It will allow them to stand up to their boss who has been refusing to pay overtime or making them work in poor conditions, to stand up to the landlord who used to threaten to turn them in while gouging them with the rent, to go to their child's school and talk to the teachers without the fear of being reported," he said.
Dr. Rodenzo at El Rescate, a physician who fled the war in El Salvador in 1980, said that for people who live with hardship, immediate needs can outweight longterm risks.
"Life has been very hard for them and people think, 'What do I do right now in order to survive?' " he said. "The consequences of 18 months are very far away."

HEADLINE: Stirrings of Hope in Redeeming Chesapeake Bay

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANNAPOLIS, Md., Nov. 28

 BODY:
After a decade-long struggle against pollution and overfishing in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, environmentalists and government officials say they are seeing the first signs of progress. But they warn that unless new steps are taken, including far-reaching controls on development and the pollution it produces, the fight could be lost.
The progress is scattered -- a clear stream here, a new bed of clams there, a sewage pipe through which nothing now flows. Like canaries in a mineshaft, "the fish and the shellfish and the bottom grasses are sending out a few good signals," said Ann P. Swanson, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, a multistate panel that monitors the effort to save the 200-mile-long estuary.
"But we're still a long way from winning the battle," she went on, "and we could still lose it if we don't do even more, especially in controlling and guiding future growth."
 
Action in Maryland
 Once one of the world's richest sources of seafood, and still a playground for the mid-Atlantic region, Chesapeake Bay is deeply scarred by decades of pollution. Though environmental laws have blocked many sources of pollution, experts say unchecked growth could undo much of that progress. The populations in many metropolitan regions in the bay have increased by as much as 50 percent over the last quarter century.
One crucial state, Maryland, is pressing to control growth. It has established a 1,000-foot zone along its bay shore in which development, particularly housing subdivisions, is severely restricted. And this week, a state study commission recommended that the Legislature pass laws restricting growth around the bay mainly to areas already built up.
The commission said too many farms and forests had been bulldozed to create sprawling subdivisions, with the uncovered raw soil often eroding into nearby streams that lead to the bay. The commission said such erosion had produced much of the silt that is choking parts of the bay, and added that runoff from new roads and the newly fertilized lawns of subdivisions had further polluted the bay.
The commission's proposal to stop suburban sprawl set off a debate among planners, developers and Marylanders who still cling to the American dream of a home on a spacious lot. But commission members said land use was growing twice as fast as population. "Everyone is going to have to modify, to some extent, their style of living," said Walter A. Frey 3d, a business executive on the panel.
The progress up to now has been accomplished mainly through widespread construction of modern sewage plants and the regulation of waste flowing into the 150 rivers and streams that feed the bay. There has been a major reduction of fertilizer runoff from the farms in the bay watershed, especially those concentrated along the banks of the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania. And restrictions have been placed on seafood that can be taken from the bay, on the amount of wetlands that can be destroyed or disturbed and on the use of pesticides.
The move to control growth represents a new direction in the effort to save the bay. It could involve people who live miles away from the shores of the estuary whose immense drainage basin stretches from Cooperstown, N.Y., to Lynchburg, Va.
"It's the next logical step, but it's also a tricky approach because you have to find some way to protect the economic interests of those in rural areas whose land can no longer be developed," said W. Tayloe Murphy Jr., a Virginia lawmaker who serves on the Chesapeake Bay Commission.
 
Life on the Bottom Again
 One of the most striking signs of progress in the fight to save the Chesapeake can be found on the bay's bottom. Some sections that pollution had denuded of almost all life are now lush with underwater grass, a critical part of the bay's life chain that provides food for some of the bays creatures and also helps cleanse and rejuvenate its waters.
Elsewhere, signs of progress include summer swimmers in the Potomac River, a major tributary that was dangerously toxic before the imposition of strict pollution controls, including the construction of some of the most modern sewage treatment plants anywhere.
On the bottom of Baltimore harbor, once considered dead because of all the industrial pollution that had been poured into it over the years, there are newfound beds of clams and the stirrings of mud worms.
All across the bay's watershed, the amount of phosphorus flowing into streams and the bay has been sharply reduced in the last decade, as much as 50 percent, by new sewage treatment methods, the elimination of phosphates from household detergents and the imposition of erosion controls. Phosphorus is one of the nutrients on which choking rafts of algae feed, keeping sunlight from reaching the bay's life-giving grasses and depleting life-supporting oxygen.
Striped bass, shad, ospreys, peregrine falcons and bald eagles are beginning to make a comeback, as is the Chesapeake oyster, once the bay's greatest seafood resource, along with the blue crab.
Among these varied creatures of land and sea, only the crab has been able, year in and year out, to hold its own against pollution, pesticides, disease, waterside condominiums, overfishing and serendipitous Mother Nature. But this year enough striped bass, called rockfish by many residents of the bay area, showed up to permit a fishing season, the first in the better part of a decade.
Environmentalists credit newly clean spawning areas and closed seasons for the resurgence of the fish. Still, after just a few days, the 1990 season had to be ended, so intense was the angling.
"That was a sign of just how fragile our progress is in cleaning up the Chesapeake," said William C. Baker, the president of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, a citizens' group that monitors the bay's quality and promotes its conservation.
"We're still a long way from the days when we could pull in millions of pounds of rock and shad," he said. "In fact, we may never get back to that or to the kind of bay that Captain John Smith found in the early 1600's when he said there were so many fish he could catch them with the frying pan. Our realistic hope is that we can return to a bay in which species aren't endangered and pollution and human pressure are managable."
The continued fragility of the bay is especially evident in the amount of bottom grasses. While new grasses are beginning to spring up in some places, three-fourths of the areas where grass was once plentiful remain bare.
 
Few Simple Answers
 While oysters appear to be making a comeback this year after several exceptionally barren years, the catch is drastically down from the past -- only a tenth of what it was at the turn of the century. That sharp reduction is attributed not just to pollution and over-harvesting but largely to naturally occurring, cyclical diseases.
"In figuring out what is happening in the bay and who and what is to blame, there are seldom many simple answers," Mr. Baker said. "For instance, while pollution causes serious oxygen depletion in the bay's waters, we also know that such depletion occurs naturally."
He also pointed out that just when pollution experts thought they had figured out how to handle the problem of phosphorous and nitrogen entering the bay from waste and fertilizer runoff they discovered that acid rain was also bringing nitrogen in the bay. That discovery helped lead to the new growth approach for saving the bay.
"In this fight," Mr. Baker said, "knowledge is often progress."

U.S. Rebuffs Iraq on Palestinian Talks

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Neither President Bush nor Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d responded publicly today to Iraq's acceptance of Mr. Bush's offer of talks on the gulf crisis.
But Administration officials rebuffed the Iraqi government's suggestion that any direct talks between Iraq and the United States on Kuwait should deal with the issue of a Palestinian homeland. 
 In its statement, Iraq welcomed the chance for the two countries to have "a serious and deep dialogue," but did not make its acceptance of Mr. Bush's offer conditional on discussion of the Palestinian issue. But the statement also said that "Palestine and the other occupied Arab territories will remain before our eyes and at the forefront of the issues that we will discuss in any dialogue."
In making his offer, Mr. Bush said that Mr. Baker would be willing "to discuss all aspects of the gulf crisis" on his visit to Baghdad.
"Palestine is not an issue on the table," Vice President Quayle said on Cable News Network today. "There is no linkage."
 
Hussein Linked the Issues
 Roman Popadiuk, a White House spokesman, seconded Mr. Quayle when he said, "Our position all along is that there is no linkage of the Gulf crisis to other issues, including the Middle East."
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has said many times that he will leave Kuwait only if the Israelis leave the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
While the President and his advisers have publicly refused to link the fates of Kuwait and Palestine, what appeared to be a carrot on linkage was inserted into a speech Mr. Bush gave at the United Nations on Oct. 1, when the President suggested that diplomatic opportunities would exist in the Middle East after Iraq made an unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait.
The President met today at Camp David with his top advisers, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff and their chairman, Gen. Colin Powell; the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft; Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and Mr. Baker. The group reviewed military options in the gulf even as they waited for an official response to the President's offer to send Mr. Baker to Baghdad to hold direct talks on Kuwait with Mr. Hussein.
 
Seen as a Last Resort
 The offer, which Mr. Bush first made during a White House address and news conference on Friday, was conveyed formally today by Joseph Wilson, deputy chief of mission in Baghdad, to Nizar Hamdoon, an Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister. It is seen as a last resort for a peaceful solution, since a resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council on Thursday gives Iraq until Jan. 15 to pull out of Kuwait or face possible military action.
Because the invitation was delivered late in the day in Baghdad, no formal response was expected until Sunday. But the 10-man Revolutionary Command Council chaired by President Hussein did issue a statement to the press, in response to Mr. Bush's press conference, saying that it would accept the offer from "the arrogant" Mr. Bush for an emergency meeting in Baghdad, as well as an invitation for the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, to meet with Mr. Bush in Washington.
Mr. Quayle said today that the point of the direct talks is not to negotiate, but to persuade Mr. Hussein that this is his last chance to comply with the United Nations resolution before force is used. Mr. Bush said on Friday that Mr. Baker was not making "a trip of concession" but that he would be willing "to discuss all aspects of the gulf crisis." Middle East experts say it is inevitable that trade-offs would be broached -- by the Iraqis if not by the United States.
In the C.N.N. interview, Vice President Quayle was asked why the President had changed from the patient approach of economic sanctions to the aggressive approach of a military deadline.
"Okay," Mr. Quayle replied. "Patience means, in essence, that we're not going to do anything for 18 months. Well, what about the hostages in Iraq? Are we prepared to let them stay there for another 18 months?"
At the beginning of his Administration, Mr. Bush promised that he would never personalize American hostages held in the Middle East, because it would likely increase their value as objects of ransom. But he and his top advisers have consistently tried to personalize the fate of the hostages in Iraq recently as a way of building up American support for possible military action.
 
Relieved Reactions
 The President's offer to "go the extra mile for peace," an effort to persuade a skeptical American public that he is not rushing into an unpopular war, has once more quelled the rising voices for a special session of Congress to debate the Administration's policy.
It triggered a wave of relieved reactions this weekend from Congress, allies and from the Arab world.
William Broomfield, a Republican lawmaker from Michigan who is the senior Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that the proposed diplomatic talks would offer "wiggle room" for Mr. Hussein to save face. "Anything the President can do to keep the focus of the crisis on diplomacy and not on war is all to the good," Mr. Broomfield said.
State Department officials said that they had received calls from the Ambassadors of Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other key Arab states saying they were pleased and relieved about Mr. Bush's approach.
 
Kissinger Dissents
 One of the few voices of dissent was Henry Kissinger, the former Secretary of State who said on ABC-TV's "Nightline" on Friday that the President's action filled him with "foreboding."
"I feel extremely lonely," Mr. Kissinger said. "I have not been this worried in decades."
Mr. Kissinger argued that "the arrival of an American Secretary of State in a country that is holding a thousand hostages, a country that has been compared to Nazi Germany and been threatened with war crimes trials" would create an atmosphere that would favor Mr. Hussein.
He suggested that the military option and the United States bargaining position would erode if Mr. Hussein was allowed to narrow the issue so that he would leave Kuwait and take only two disputed islands and some northern oil fields.

HEADLINE: A Weak Case for War in the Gulf

 BODY:
In bits and sound bites, interviews and briefings, the Bush Administration has finally explained why it abruptly shifted three weeks ago from Desert Shield to Desert Sword. Until then, the purpose of the troops in Saudi Arabia was defensive. Now officials are starting to make the case for changing to the possibility of offense. The case they present is unpersuasive.
The Security Council has now authorized force to evict Iraq from Kuwait, but many nations do not share Mr. Bush's enthusiasm for an early showdown. Few are willing to commit their own troops in force. 
 Far more important, growing numbers of Americans question the President's haste. At Senate hearings last week, some of the country's most knowledgeable strategic authorities challenged the Administration's policies.
Here are some of the most frequent Administration arguments, and some reasons why they seem inadequate.
The coalition won't survive much delay. Tensions between Arab states and Israel could erupt at any time, the argument goes, and conservative Arab states may be destabilized by the long-term garrisoning of U.S. troops.
These are legitimate concerns. But so far, the glue of self-interest has held fast, even during the crisis over Temple Mount. War, with its likely high toll of Arab civilian casualties, would test allied unity far more severely than patient pressure. And King Fahd made plain last week that he considered the foreign military forces supporting Saudi Arabia "a blessing from God."
Time is on Saddam Hussein's side. The U.S. deployment is set to peak early next year. From then on, morale and logistics problems will mount. After February, summer heat will start returning to the Saudi desert. Meanwhile, every day Iraqi forces are entrenching their positions, and dismantling Kuwait.
True enough. But the logistical and morale problems are self-inflicted, and would be eased by a return to the smaller scale of Desert Shield. Experts doubt that a war begun after Jan. 15 could be concluded before the onset of hotter weather. And a calendar-driven timetable could bias tactics toward massive air strikes, producing horrific civilian casualties but still requiring ground combat later.
What's more, the Administration argument ignores the sapping of Iraq's fighting strength through the cumulative impact of sanctions.
Iraq's abuse of hostages is intolerable. Saddam Hussein has manipulated the hostage and embassy issue, and President Bush's gut feelings are real. But Mr. Bush sensibly proclaimed at the start of the Kuwait crisis that concern for the hostages could not be allowed to overturn sound policy judgments. That's still the wisest position.
Iraq must be stopped from going nuclear. Four months ago, the Bush Administration insisted that Iraq's nuclear program posed no imminent danger. But in an ex poll facto judgment, after surveys showed Americans viewing a nuclear threat as the only plausible reason for war, the White House has been sounding nuclear alarms. Expert opinion still holds that Iraq is years away from a deliverable nuclear weapon. And diplomacy, not military pre-emption, remains the most effective response to potential nuclear threats.
High oil prices will wreck the world economy. The embargo against Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil will shave one or two percentage points off world growth rates in the short term. But as former Energy Secretary James Schlesinger noted at Senate hearings last week, most of this price has already been paid. The world oil market, Mr. Schlesinger reported, "has now been brought into balance . . . without Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude."
America, as President Bush noted Friday, has vital interests at stake in the gulf. Chief among these are preventing a single dictator from gaining decisive control over world oil supplies, and assuring that naked aggression reaps no rewards. Both of these interests are fully served by the original operation Desert Shield. Iraq has been deterred from moving against Saudi Arabia, and suffers economic punishment rather than reward for grabbing Kuwaiti oil fields.
With vital interests on the line, fighting may eventually become necessary. In that case, heavy costs will have to be borne, and Americans will bear them. But honest and informed citizens remain skeptical that that threshold has yet been crossed, or even approached.

HEADLINE: Bush Has Made the Right Moves, So Far

BYLINE: By Caspar W. Weinberger; Caspar W. Weinberger was Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Defense.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
I believe President Bush is doing what has to be done in the Persian Gulf and is doing it very well. That was clearly the majority view of the nation immediately after Saddam Hussein's conquest of Kuwait, but since then there has been disarray and confusion.
In sending James Baker to Baghdad and inviting Iraq's Foreign Minister to Washington, Mr. Bush has struck the right note. It is well that he warned Mr. Hussein not to misread our motives. The trips must not be viewed as involving standard negotiations in which both sides give a little to achieve an agreement. The only peace acceptable is a peace under which Mr. Hussein gives up what he has stolen, makes reparations for his theft and is left without the ability to steal again. 
 Before Mr. Bush's announcement, he had encountered increasing opposition and questions, claims that our goals are not clear, contentions that Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are not worthy of being defended, and cries for a negotiated peace. There have even been demonstrations by a few moth-eaten relics of the Vietnam peace movement, which despite their small size have been given undue prominence on TV news.
There are Americans who not only support our being in the gulf but want us to attack immediately. There are still others who think the embargo will not work but content themselves with saying that and with professing "profound pessimism" or some equally helpful analysis.
There really is and should be no confusion about why Mr. Bush sent the troops to the gulf. We are there to prevent a particularly brutal aggression that, if successful, would have badly crippled a large part of the world and left us subject to continual blackmail by one of the world's most miserable leaders. President Bush's Thanksgiving speech to our troops in Saudi Arabia made that crystal clear.
That we have not always acted with such dispatch and effectiveness every time some aggression has occurred is beside the point, and hardly an argument for not trying to establish the rule of law globally now.
To say we are in the gulf only because of oil is to trivialize the great role we are playing. Of course oil is important to our civilization -- just how important we'd easily know if Saddam Hussein had been allowed to carry out his plan to march through Saudi Arabia and take the United Arab Emirates, thereby securing control of at least 70 percent of the world's known oil reserves.
The troops know why they are in the gulf even if many opponents profess to be "unclear" and "puzzled." The troops appreciate that aggressors cannot be allowed to keep what they steal. By protecting the world from continual blackmail and relieving it of the incalculable cost of clawing Mr. Hussein out of Saudi Arabia and the emirates, we achieve complementary goals: preventing aggression from succeeding and from undermining the quality of life Americans and millions of others enjoy.
As for the specious argument that we should not oppose Iraqi aggression because Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are not as pure as some would like, let's remember when we heard a similar argument: "We should not support the Shah of Iran because his Government has done repressive things." But that overlooked the alternative: the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeni. So, are we going to let Mr. Hussein keep Kuwait because Kuwait is not everything its critic want?
What is this negotiated peace so many want? Some advocates tip their hands when they talk of Iraq's "historical claims" to Kuwait. But no one can contend that Kuwait invaded Iraq. If some country's claims on another justify a brutal invasion, freedom and the rule of law are dead. What kind of negotiated settlement can we reach with a mass murderer who suppressed Iraqi Kurds seeking some small measure of freedom? What would be the terms of such a compromise or negotiations?
Would we let him keep half of Kuwait? Or "to save Saddam's face," which seems to be the goal of some who talk compromise, would we let him retire gracefully from Kuwait, welcome his generosity, express gratitude for the return of hostages -- and watch him repeat the whole murderous scenario when he chooses?
None of this is to say that we should commit our forces to combat now. I believe the economic sanctions, enforced by a tight air and sea blockade and supported by some 21 other countries, including every major Arab country, is succeeding. It will bring Iraq to its knees if we and our allies have the patience to keep it tightly in place, and the willingness to wait until its full effect is felt.
Of course we must keep our own military strength, joined by more than 130,000 allied troops, in place and ready to be used if necessary. The objections to President Bush's recent strengthening of our force make little sense: If we are in the gulf because we have to be, every military consideration dictates that we should be there with overwhelming power.
I do object, however, to the policy of no rotation for our troops. It would help morale if they were rotated home after some months' service in the harsh desert. This could be done without any loss in strength, and without sending any signal to Saddam Hussein other than that we have the best interests of our troops in mind.
I hope this great opportunity to enforce the rule of law globally is not watered down, compromised and weakened. We must preserve the military option. But let us see if patience and strength will give us victory without committing troops to combat.

HEADLINE: The Region: Recession;
It Took Time, But New York Yields to Laws Of Gravity

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
PERHAPS inevitably, what started as a "BMW recession" is filtering down to those who also travel by bus and subway.
Since June, New York City has been shedding about 7,000 jobs a month -- construction jobs, clerical jobs, retailing jobs, manufacturing jobs, financial-industry jobs, white-collar jobs, blue-collar jobs, managerial jobs, selling jobs, assembly-line jobs. 
 With less than four weeks until Christmas, there seem to be more vacant stores in Manhattan than at any time in years. City Hall, which went on a hiring spree in the 1980's, is talking about layoffs. Law firms and advertising agencies are pinched. Suddenly, it's easy to get a cab.
"Economically," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, "we're in the soup."
All this now seems a natural consequence of the stock market's freefall three years ago, an event that essentially ended the 1980's a few years early. But while Wall Street, which had propelled the city's boom, began shrinking soon after the plunge, the rest of the city's economy was surprisingly unaffected, at least at first. And if there were fewer wealthy young traders, and fewer pricey restaurants for them to swagger into, well, that did not seem such a terrible price to pay for the excesses of the decade.
There was a "puritanical backlash," said Matthew P. Drennan, an economics professor at New York University, whose prediction that the city would lose 30,000 jobs by the end of 1988 is only now coming true. "A gloating about what happened to Leona Helmsley and Milken and Trump."
 
Falling Off a Cliff
 What happened to the city next? Mr. Ehrenhalt likened it to a cartoon character who runs right off a cliff and, oblivious to the lack of support, hangs in space, feet churning and face smiling. Then he looks down. Then he falls.
For a few years after the stock market's plunge, the city's economy hung there, with employment holding steady at around 3.6 million. Then it fell. And now it is falling faster.
By last year, the ripples had reached the real estate industry and were being felt in the boroughs outside of Manhattan and in the suburbs. State and local governments, struggling with drooping revenues, began raising taxes, pulling more money out of an already faltering economy.
Then, this year the national economy weakened. The effect on the city was akin to that of a large wave on an uncertain swimmer. The demand dropped for the goods New York produces for the rest of the country -- the services of advertising agencies, architects, engineers, accountants, lawyers, finance experts and consultants of various sorts. Consumers turned wary and retail sales in the city sagged. Dry cleaners and other neighborhood businesses suffered, too.
The savings and loan scandal, though caused by institutions in other regions, made New York lenders more cautious, inflicting more pain on small businesses, which often are underfinanced.
The construction industry, which flourished during the last decade even as factory jobs continued to disappear, tailed off, but only after a few too many skyscrapers were erected. Carpenters and other people in the trades who went from office building to office building, sometimes commuting in from the suburbs, were faced with choices like finishing basements or tending bar.
The rise in oil prices in a region that consumes energy without producing it further tightened discretionary income. And on top of all this, the city endured a wave of violence over the summer that was well chronicled across the country, making it harder for New York to attract visitors and businesses.
"This is the price you pay for being a world media capital," said Ronald K. Shelp, president of the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the New York City Partnership. "Black eyes take a while to go away."
In retrospect, it seems clear that some of what is being felt now can be attributed to structural changes that occurred even as the city prospered. With computers replacing clerks and cash machines replacing tellers, for example, banking employment peaked in 1982. Suburban malls and catalogue outlets were siphoning off city business even before some New York department stores began to struggle under the weight of corporate debt that was a legacy of the junk-bond and leveraged-buyout carnival of the 80's.
But downturns can have benefits, even in the short term. Apartment rents, long a barometer of a housing shortage that came to be regarded as permanent, are falling in much of New York for the first time since the 1930's. There is greater choice of office space now and it's cheaper, too, which might encourage companies to stay or expand. According to the brokerage firm of Cushman & Wakefield, vacancy rates in the heart of the financial district have hit 23 percent for primary office buildings and 30.3 percent for secondary buildings.
The city's retooled economy is now strong in what Mr. Ehrenhalt calls information and knowledge-based industries -- from law firms to sophisticated business consulting -- which are the ones with the best prospects for growth in the 1990's. The question is, will advances in telecommunications render face-to-face meetings obsolete, reducing the need to do business in New York, which is still more expensive than elsewhere in the country.
Last month, after state and city officials offered about $150 million in incentives, the directors of four of the commodity exchanges located in the city recommended that their new headquarters be built in Lower Manhattan rather than New Jersey. Several other financial institutions, though, including the Morgan Stanley Group, are considering moving not just back-office clerks but also executives out of the city.
In the late 60's and 70's, New York endured the loss of 600,000 jobs and the near bankruptcy of its municipal government and, astonishingly, emerged to enjoy its most prosperous decade since World War II. Economists point to that experience as evidence of the city's resilience, if not its luck. What happened in the 70's was a catastrophe, they say. This is a cycle.
Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, believes there could be a turn in New York's fortunes by the mid-1991. She can even envision one sooner, if Iraq withdraws from Kuwait, the price of oil drops, interest rates fall and the national economy, which pushed New York down, raises it back up.
"I don't think the sky is falling," said Professor Drennan. He, too, sees a turnaround, but not until 1992.

Another Dinkins Test: The Bond Market

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
SINCE even before David N. Dinkins was elected Mayor, the municipal bond market has, like a Greek chorus, shadowed him across the public arena, sometimes heckling him, sometimes cheering him on. And now that he is wrestling with the worst fiscal problems in a decade, his administration's efforts to calm the concerns of the institutions and individuals who invest in New York City's bonds have moved to center stage at City Hall.
Next week, after an intensive marketing campaign in which the city feted investors at a two-day conference, the city is offering nearly $1.2 billion in long-term bonds -- the first such sale since the city's fiscal picture darkened in October, as tax revenues fell and the Mayor warned of layoffs. 
 Underwriters say the city faces the immediate prospects of significantly higher interest costs -- the city expects next year's payments to reach $2.7 billion, up from $1.8 billion this year -- as well as the likelihood of higher costs in future sales.
The relationship between the city, the largest borrower in the municipal market, and the investors who buy its bonds has become closely intertwined over the last year, beginning in the closing weeks of the 1989 mayoral campaign.
"The market for city debt has become sensitive to the local economy and just plain change in the last year or so in a way that was not true before," said Mark Page, a deputy city budget director.
This relationship became starkly clear in October, after the administration sent some confusing signals about its mastery of city finances. In the course of a single week, Mr. Dinkins agreed to a 5.5 percent increase in teachers' pay, announced plans to hire thousands of police officers and warned of the possibility of 15,000 layoffs. Worried bondholders quickly dumped large blocks of bonds. Prices fell and the yields on bonds ---- yield is the overall return on investment received by the buyer ---- rose sharply.
And while most New Yorkers never buy a municipal bond, these changes in the market matter. The more the city spends on debt service the less it can spend on city services.
During the last years of the Koch administration, after the city shook off the lingering effects of the fiscal crisis, city bonds were in high demand and sold at lower interest rates than other similar bonds.
But in the closing weeks of last year's mayoral campaign, yields on a benchmark 25-year bond rose, from 7.45 percent in September to 7.9 percent in late October, and rose again in December, just before Mr. Dinkins was sworn in. Yields reached 8.35 percent last April, as Mr. Dinkins grappled with his budget -- and the state, which provides $5 billion in aid to the city, failed to pass its budget on time.
 Rates dropped in July, after the City Council approved Mr. Dinkins's first balanced budget. In October, they reached 8.6 percent, and have remained high since.
One way of measuring the changes in city bonds is to compare their yields with those of other bonds. Through most of September 1989, the Bond Buyer's weekly index of 20 representative municipal bonds showed that city bonds were trading with a yield of a quarter of a percentage point above the index. By mid-October, the difference rose to seven-tenths of a point and to eight-tenths by January. In November, the spread was more than 1.25.
Some investors said the decline in the city's bonds was due to fears about social change under a mayor committed to giving more political power to minorities. Others said any new mayor, particularly one elected on a liberal platform, would have to demonstrate fiscal responsibility.
According to many city officials, investors and traders, the city's financial picture had been quietly deteriorating long before Mr. Dinkins appeared on the scene. And at the same time, the city pressed ahead with plans to sell more and more bonds -- $57 billion over the next 10 years -- raising questions about the city's ability to find buyers. As long as Mayor Edward I. Koch and Controller Harrison J. Goldin were in office, the market took little notice. Investors were familiar with their style and confident in them.
Darcy Bradbury, the Deputy Comptroller for Finance, said she viewed the changes in the market as a straw poll on the city's financial management.
"It will take time for investors to get comfortable with the new administration," she said, "because the old administration was in for 12 years. That was a long time."
 
Investors' Alert
 She attributed the beginning of the decline in city bonds to a full-page editorial in Barron's that appeared a few weeks before the election and called attention to the city's ever-growing payroll, revenue shortfalls and increased long-term borrowing needs. It questioned whether Mr. Dinkins or his Republican opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani, was up to the job.
 Support for the notion that the city's problems predated Mr. Dinkins comes from James F. Lynch, a money manager and editor of the Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory in Santa Fe, N. M., who has been urging investors to sell their New York City bonds since 1987 and who now warns that "the crisis is coming."
 "The politicians played games when they had all of the money that was generated from the tremendous economic growth in the 1980's," Mr. Lynch said. "Everybody was fat, dumb and lazy in giving the store away. Dinkins can't walk away from it. He has been in city government all of his life."
 The Dinkins administration views its problem in the credit market as one of symbol as much as substance. In one of his first budget decisions as Mayor, Mr. Dinkins delayed the hiring of a new class of police recruits, signaling that he intended to act responsibly. He has warned that creating a "leaner, more efficient" government requires "tough choices."
But one city underwriter said the Mayor's confusing signals in October were so damanging because they undermined his past efforts to reassure investors.
When asked at a news conference last week why city bond yields had risen so much since he took office, Mr. Dinkins said that municipal finance was "an inexact science."
"It is very subjective," he said. "It is predicated to a large degree on what people feel."

Weicker Is King of An Uncharted Mountain

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
LOOKING for patterns in the careers of those few independent governors elected in this nation over the last century is like studying a pile of pick-up sticks. By their nature, people who have the ego and drive to surmount an entrenched two-party system are, well, independent and don't lend themselves to patterns.
James Bernard Longley, elected Governor of Maine in 1974, was an insurance man who apparently found politics and most politicians distasteful. By contrast, Walter J. Hickel, elected Governor of Alaska last month as an independent, is a career Republican who served as Governor in the 1960's before becoming Secretary of the Interior under President Nixon. He intends to rule as a Republican once again with the support of his party. The only independent before Mr. Longley, William Langer of North Dakota, served only two years before leaving office in 1938 for an unsuccessful independent run for the United States Senate. 
 Connecticut's experiment in nonparty government, which begins next month with the inauguration of Lowell P. Weicker Jr. as Governor, is like none of those others. Mr. Weicker, a 59-year-old former United States Senator who will be the first independent Governor here since 1858, thrived for 30 years as a Republican politician who routinely crossed party lines and openly antagonized leaders of his own party. Some people here still recall how even as a young lawmaker from Greenwich Mr. Weicker turned his back on fellow Republicans to work with a Democratic Governor as House liaison on transportation issues.
This year, however, he told voters that he had given up entirely on party politics and would run for Governor as an independent.
Running under the banner of A Connecticut Party, a name he plucked from thin air earlier this year to meet the legal requirement of getting on the ballot, Mr. Weicker beat his nearest rival, the Republican Party's nominee, Representative John G. Rowland, by 32,736 votes out of 1.1 million cast. He buried the Democratic Party's nominee, Representative Bruce A. Morrison, with a victory margin of nearly 224,000 votes.
Now Mr. Weicker faces the problem of turning his lone-wolf victory at the polls into a functioning state administration. Among the questions he faces: How will an independent get legislation through a Democratic-controlled General Assembly? Would he return to the Republican fold? Would he make a deal with the Democrats and try to use that party as his base to support legislation? With a sinking economy and a floundering state budget, would the legislative session spiral into chaos?
One month after the election, most of those questions are still echoing, but there have been signals. Within days of the election, Mr. Weicker turned in his membership card in the Republican Party, then immediately appointed two Republicans, Thomas J. D'Amore Jr. and Stanley A. Twardy Jr., a United States Attorney appointed by President Reagan, to be his closest advisers. He then named a Democrat who had also sought the governor's chair, William J. Cibes Jr., to be the state's next budget chief.
"It's opened up tremendous horizons," said Jonathan Pelto, the political director for the state Democratic Party, referring to the first wave of appointments, specifically that of Mr. Cibes, the former co-chairman of the Assembly's Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee. Mr. Pelto said that while many Democrats are leery about Mr. Weicker, he believes the possibility of genuine "coalitional government" has become tangible.
 
Personal Popularity

 
 Politicians and academics who have studied the dynamic of relations between chief executives and legislatures say that in the months and years to come, several other factors will affect Mr. Weicker's ability to rule. If he can sustain a high personal popularity, lawmakers may be cowed into cooperating lest voters later retaliate.
And the issue of popularity will probably to a great degree hinge on how and when Mr. Weicker presents his proposals to resolve the state's yawning budget gap and how he addresses the still-simmering resentments over his election.
Over the next 18 months, Connecticut is expected to face a shortfall in state revenue of about $2 billion in an annual budget of just over $7 billion, with most of the gap resulting from plummeting sales-tax collections and corporate-profits taxes. Mr. Weicker has warned that solutions will be neither popular nor painless, and many lawmakers have interpreted the appointment of Mr. Cibes -- a supporter for the idea of a state income tax -- as a sign that the long-avoided wage tax may be at hand. Connecticut is among 10 states that have no income tax.
 
Tactics on Taxes
 One tactical possibility mentioned by Democrats is that Mr. Weicker would present a straw budget this February deliberately loaded with unpopular or unworkable measures. Lawmakers could then work out their resentments and publicly denounce the plan, allowing a compromise to be worked out behind the scenes that would include an income tax. A bleaker interpretation has Assembly leaders left on their own to fashion a solution from the wreckage and face the wrath of an angry electorate.
An even more Byzantine scenario, according to Mr. Pelto, involves Mr. Weicker leading the Assembly on to solve this year's budget gap through the sale of short-term bonds, thus intentionally postponing the final budget reckoning until 1992, an election year for legislators but not for the Governor. Then, in the predicted surge of voter anger over taxes, Mr. Weicker's fledgling party could storm the Assembly, running Connecticut Party candidates against the weakened Democratic and Republican incumbents.
Mr. Weicker, who takes office on Jan. 9, isn't tipping his hand and declined to be interviewed for this article. But those who know the Governor-elect's history say the fear of such intrigue is exaggerated.
"My fear is that he won't like the job," said Leo V. Donohue, a 66-year-old auditor of public accounts, who is a veteran of more than 30 years at the capitol and remembers Mr. Weicker's early days. Mr. Donohue said there was no mistaking Mr. Weicker's self-possessed style as a legislator, but that this time around he won't be able to go it alone. "He's going to be dealing with a lot of people who also have egos," he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 9, 1990, Sunday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about Governor-elect Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut omitted the name of one independent elected to a governorship in this century. Julius L. Meier served as Governor of Oregon from 1931 to 1935.

HEADLINE: Office Parties: They're Still Given, But the Ostentation Level Is Down

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS

 BODY:
To party or not to party? That is the question many company executives are asking themselves this year. Whether to forgo the office Christmas party in light of budget cuts, layoffs and gloomy economic forecasts or to celebrate having survived a year of outrageous fortune.
"By this time last year, I had corporate party invitations for every night of the week in December," said Kurt P. Ross, president of K. P. Ross Inc., a public-relations concern for real-estate and investment clients. 
 By Friday he had received only one invitation.
Not every business is doing without. The Bureau of National Affairs, a nonprofit information service in Washington, reported that of 504 employers it surveyed, 61 percent would sponsor holiday parties this year, the same proportion as in 1989.
Seventy-four percent of the 217 New York City businesses surveyed by the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry said they planned to have Christmas parties; 68 percent of them said the company would pick up the tab.
And BDO Seidman, a leading accounting and consulting concern, said that 79 percent of 1,650 business owners it surveyed provide office parties and 69 percent distribute bonuses to celebrate the holidays.
 
A New Spirit of Frugality
 But where, in years past, the motto seemed to be the bigger and more lavish the better, 1990 seems to have ushered in a spirit of frugality and cost-consciousness.
"The big corporations and even the smaller ones are asking themselves, 'How can we let people go during the year, then throw $10,000 to $20,000 on a Christmas party," said Nicholas Baxter, a Manhattan caterer who says his holiday business is doing well. "Some won't have a party at all. Then there are those who say, 'Why should we suffer?' So they have a party, but do it cheaper."
Many businesses are having their parties in the office or at the home of a senior officer. In some cases employees are chipping in. In others sit-down dinners have given way to buffets, and instead of filet mignon and shrimp on silver platters, there will be cold cuts on stainless steel.
"We're not exactly at the point of paper plates yet," said John Dawson, owner of Tri-State Party Rentals in Mount Vernon, N.Y. "Clients still want the party to look nice."
Sharon Destefano, a spokeswoman for the law firm of Jacoby & Meyers, said, "We've decided to arrange six smaller, more intimate gatherings in local restaurants, as opposed to the big Saturday night extravagant shindig we use to host."
Some businesses are so wary of how people might react to their employees kicking up their heels when others are having to bite the bullet that they are keeping their party plans secret.
A spokesman at Prudential-Bache Securities said the company would have no comment about its holiday party plans. A corporate communications director at a Manhattan marketing concern said he could lose his job if information about the concern's lavish party appeared in the public prints.
Adam Weiss, vice president and director of banquets for Bridgewaters, a 23,000-square-foot banquet center at 11 Fulton Street, said: "We've had three clients who prefaced their bookings with us on the basis that we keep the information confidential. Our clients are very sensitive. They want to keep their employees happy, but they don't want to set off any negative impressions." Bridgewaters is booked from Dec. 3 through Dec. 21.
 
But for Some, Open Jollity
 But there are those who, having looked at the bottom line and seen black, want to see jolly old red for the holidays.
Ron Bruder, president of the Brookhill Group, a real-estate developer and an adviser to troubled properties, gave a small party last year for his staff and a few clients in his conference room. This year he has doubled it, sending invitations to almost 200 people -- including Mr. Ross -- and is holding the Dec. 11 affair at Colors, a restaurant on Park Avenue.
"I think it's important to do this to show that there are still successful people in the real-estate business, and the office party is an important symbol at Christmas," he said.
The Caroline Jones Advertising Agency is taking a similarly upbeat attitude. Ms. Jones said the agency, which is celebrating its third year, is thankful to be alive and well. To show the agency's appreciation of its staff, clients and friends, Ms. Jones has rented Rex, a restaurant on the Avenue of the Americas, and invited clients from Bankers Trust, the Ministry of Tourism for the Bahamas, Western Union and Prudential-Bache, along with friends like O. J. Simpson, for "dancing, prancing and vixening."
David Bricker, a psychologist with a Wall Street practice, said: "Nobody's called to ask my advice, but were they to, I would say it's a good idea to have a holiday office party, especially if they had one in the past.
"You might cut back and not do something too garish, like taking people to the '21' Club or hiring Frank Sinatra to sing. But just because you have layoffs doesn't mean you start selling the artworks on the wall."

HEADLINE: Poles Move Forward, Nervously

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Will Poles Scuttle Economic Plan?" (news article, Nov. 28), you quote me as saying that Poland's election results were "tragic." This remark, taken out of context, might be seriously misunderstood.
What was tragic about the results was that an unknown Polish emigre, Stanislaw Tyminski, could overtake Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki through a campaign of demagoguery and outright lies. Mr. Tyminski's hot rhetoric that Poles were becoming the "white slaves of Europe" and that the Mazowiecki government had committed "high treason" by selling state enterprises cheaply to foreigners (while the privatization program -- based mainly on Polish ownership -- had not yet begun), played well in Poland's impoverished rural regions.
But as you make clear, the prospect of Lech Walesa as president is anything but tragic. A Walesa presidency offers an excellent chance for continuation of the economic reforms, because Mr. Walesa will be a highly persuasive advocate for them. As Mr. Walesa has been saying for weeks, and as he reiterated boldly at a Nov. 27 press conference following the election results, he will continue the Leczek Balcerowicz plan of rapid economic reform. It is even likely that Mr. Balcerowicz himself would be asked to continue at the economic helm in a Walesa Government.
It has been evident for months in Poland that the highest costs of reforms have not been the actual results (because the costs have been balanced by major advances), but rather the profound anxieties that have been raised among the population about the future.
Poles are living in a time of rapid change, and they often have grave doubts about their ability to remain afloat in the new market economy that is arising in their country.
Thus fears of future unemployment or collapsing living standards are grossly exaggerated (as with the widespread estimate that the unemployment rate would reach 20 percent this year, when it is 5.5 percent, less than in the United States).
To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt, the main thing the Poles have to fear is fear itself. It is in confronting such fears that Lech Walesa will likely prove again to be a political genius. He mobilized Polish society to confront Communism against extraordinary odds. Mr. Walesa is now likely to do the same thing with regard to economic reform and the reintegration of Poland into the mainstream of Europe.

HEADLINE: Notable Books of the Year

 BODY:
This list has been selected from books reviewed since the Christmas issue of December 1989. It suggests only high points in the main fields of reader interest, and it does not include the titles chosen by the editors of The Book Review as the Best Books of 1990. Books are arranged alphabetically under subject headings. Quoted comments are from The Book Review. 

Autobiography and Biography
AGAINST THE GRAIN: An Autobiography. By Boris Yeltsin. (Summit, $19.95.) This provocative book gives voice to the Russian-style populism and antiparty insurgency of its author, the most visible leader of the opposition to Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
AMELIA EARHART: A Biography. By Doris L. Rich. (Smithsonian Institution, $19.95.) THE SOUND OF WINGS: The Life of Amelia Earhart. By Mary S. Lovell. (St. Martin's, $22.95.) Two biographies of the famous American pilot (and feminist) who vanished in the South Pacific in 1937. The authors agree on the important facts; Ms. Lovell is more skeptical about her flying skills than Ms. Rich, and thinks better of her husband and publicist, G. P. Putnam.
AMERICAN CASSANDRA: The Life of Dorothy Thompson. By Peter Kurth. (Little, Brown, $24.95.) A skillful exploration of the life and personality of the formidable foreign correspondent.
AS I SAW IT. By Dean Rusk as told to Richard Rusk. (Norton, $29.95.) A joint memoir, written with his son, presents the once inscrutable and remote former Secretary of State as eloquent, funny, moving, devilish and even earthy.
AS THOUSANDS CHEER: The Life of Irving Berlin. By Laurence Bergreen. (Viking, $24.95.) A vivid and impressive portrait of the phenomenon who was part songwriter and part industry, set against the panorama of 80 years of American show business.
BECOMING A POET: Elizabeth Bishop With Marianne Moore and Robert Lowell. By David Kalstone. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $22.50.) The fullest account so far of Bishop's life, David Kalstone's presentation approaches her creative activity through her close friendships with two other major poets.
BENEDICT ARNOLD: Patriot and Traitor. By Willard Sterne Randall. (Morrow, $27.95.) This industriously researched biography turns up much evidence that Arnold, though brave and talented, shouldn't have been trusted in the first place.
BORIS PASTERNAK: A Literary Biography. Volume One: 1890-1928. By Christopher Barnes. (Cambridge University, $69.50.) A painstakingly researched, elegantly produced book that renders the full texture of Pasternak's insecure, displaced existence.
THE BOY-MAN: The Life of Lord Baden-Powell. By Tim Jeal. (Morrow, $24.95.) A monumental (670 pages) biography of the founder of Scouting, doing full justice to the complexities of the man and the contradictions in the movement he fathered.
CAPTAIN SIR RICHARD FRANCIS BURTON: The Secret Agent Who Made the Pilgrimage to Mecca, Discovered the Kama Sutra, and Brought the Arabian Nights to the West. By Edward Rice. (Scribners, $35.) This life of the 19th-century explorer and sage is a first-class account of a strange and remarkable career.
THE COLONEL: The Life and Wars of Henry Stimson, 1867-1950. By Godfrey Hodgson. (Knopf, $24.95.) A lucid, penetrating biography of the statesman, a pragmatic idealist who served Presidents from Theodore Roosevelt to Harry S. Truman.
C. S. LEWIS: A Biography. By A. N. Wilson. (Norton, $22.50.) A skilled novelist and biographer (of Tolstoy) brilliantly and sympathetically demythologizes one of the most tendentiously written-about British authors of the 20th century.
DADDY, WE HARDLY KNEW YOU. By Germaine Greer. (Knopf, $19.95.) Ms. Greer's enormous digressions and rambles are as entertaining as the principal action in this account of her quest to learn the origins of her own father, a man who, she finds, never knew his birth name or parents and lied about what little he knew.
DANGEROUS CAPABILITIES: Paul Nitze and the Cold War. By David Callahan. (Edward Burlingame/HarperCollins, $24.95.) An industriously researched life of Mr. Nitze as the ultimate insider's insider, a systematic international pessimist who served under six Presidents, starting with Franklin D. Roosevelt.
DARKNESS VISIBLE: A Memoir of Madness. By William Styron. (Random House, $15.95.) A short, intensely described account of the depression that struck Mr. Styron in 1985 and of his agonized recovery from what he calls "a howling tempest in the brain."
DE GAULLE: The Rebel, 1890-1944. By Jean Lacouture. (Norton, $29.95.) The biographer of Ho Chi Minh and Andre Malraux wins again with the first volume of his splendid life of Charles de Gaulle, which takes destiny's favorite Frenchman from his birth to his triumphant entry into Paris in August 1944.
DIARY OF AN EROTIC LIFE. By Frank Wedekind. (Blackwell, $24.95.) This sharply observed, outspoken diary was meant by the playwright both as a sourcebook for plays and as autotherapy.
THE DIARY OF H. L. MENCKEN. Edited by Charles A. Fecher. (Knopf, $30.) The good Mencken -- a great writer, editor and friend -- and the bad Mencken -- anti-Semite, racist and crank -- revealed in a compulsively readable diary, kept from 1930 to 1948.
THE EARLY ARRIVAL OF DREAMS: A Year in China. By Rosemary Mahoney. (Fawcett Columbine, $18.95.) A memoir by a teacher that indicts the works of the Chinese establishment all the more effectively because of its tenderness and generosity.
ETCHINGS IN AN HOURGLASS. By Kate Simon. (HarperCollins, $19.95.) The third and last of Kate Simon's autobiographical books dips at anecdotal hazard into the places and events -- a lot of them sexual -- of a gallant, independent and hard-won life.
EVERY GOOD-BYE AIN'T GONE: Family Portraits and Personal Escapades. By Itabari Njeri. (Times Books/Random House, $17.95.) An impassioned, skillful, frankly subjective attempt to explore and expose the depth of a black American family heritage.
FREEDOM IN EXILE: The Autobiography of the Dalai Lama. (Cornelia & Michael Bessie/HarperCollins, $22.95.) Forthrightly political and spiritual, the 14th Dalai Lama's reflective account argues for nonviolence, environmentalism and a free Tibet.
GUILTY OF EVERYTHING: The Autobiography of Herbert Huncke. (Paragon House, $19.95.) The very survival of this prototypical beatnik and hipster to age 75 is amazing, and so is his record of horrific misadventures and unlikely acquaintances.
A HIGHER KIND OF LOYALTY: A Memoir by China's Foremost Journalist. By Liu Binyan. (Pantheon, $22.95.) Repeatedly Mr. Liu wrote the truth; repeatedly he was punished for it, but never gave up faith in the party until Tiananmen Square. Strange and sad.
HOLDING ON TO THE AIR: An Autobiography. By Suzanne Farrell with Toni Bentley. (Summit, $19.95.) The great ballerina's generous and unpretentious memoir shows us first a girl coping with conspicuous success, then a young woman bewildered by George Balanchine's affections, finally a triumphant maturity.
A HOLE IN THE WORLD: An American Boyhood. by Richard Rhodes. (Simon & Schuster, $19.95.) Mr. Rhodes's own passage through abuse and deprivation to redemption: a harrowing tale.
THE HOUSE OF BARRYMORE. By Margot Peters. (Knopf, $29.95.) An excellent history of the prominent American theatrical family, considerable warts and all. For better or worse, the Barrymores have found their chronicler.
HOW I BECAME HETTIE JONES. By Hettie Jones. (Dutton, $18.95.) The memoir of a young Jewish woman of the Beat Generation, who loved -- and lost -- the poet and black nationalist LeRoi Jones, is a valuable social document.
IN ALL HIS GLORY. The Life of William S. Paley: The Legendary Tycoon and His Brilliant Circle. By Sally Bedell Smith. (Simon & Schuster, $29.95.) Ms. Smith's thorough reporting displays both the greatness and the smallness of the generous, energetic but insecure and sometimes untrustworthy genius who created CBS.

LUCIUS D. CLAY: An American Life. By Jean Edward Smith. (Holt, $35.) A masterly biography of the brilliant political general who headed the American occupation of Germany after World War II, presided over the Berlin airlift and created West Germany.
MEANS OF ASCENT: The Years of Lyndon Johnson. By Robert A. Caro. (Knopf, $24.95.) The second volume of a projected four, Mr. Caro's account of Johnson's life from 1941 to 1948 -- especially the "stolen election" that put him in the Senate -- is the work of an indefatigable researcher and master narrator.
MEMOIRS. By Andrei Sakharov. (Knopf, $29.95.) Not so much a reflection on his life as an annotated record of it, this account tells how an essentially shy and securely privileged Soviet scholar became an unbreakable witness for intellectual freedom.
MIDSTREAM. By Le Anne Schreiber. (Viking, $18.95.) A dauntless and moving memoir by a former Times editor who became a freelance writer while her mother died cruelly of cancer.
RANDALL JARRELL: A Literary Life. By William H. Pritchard. (Michael di Capua/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25.) One of the most literary lives ever lived, Jarrell's was short on event but plentiful in wit, pathos and brilliance, as this careful biography shows.

SLIM: Memories of a Rich and Imperfect Life. By Slim Keith with Annette Tapert. (Simon & Schuster, $22.95.) A high-powered, experienced wife (of a film director, an impresario, a British banker) tells what fun charm, brains and beauty were to have.
STALIN'S APOLOGIST: Walter Duranty, The New York Times's Man in Moscow. By S. J. Taylor. (Oxford University, $24.95.) A beautifully researched life of the high-living, cynical journalist who helped cover up Stalin's atrocities in the 1930's.

GET SHORTY. By Elmore Leonard. (Delacorte, $18.95.) In Mr. Leonard's new punchy thriller, a crook from Miami changes his life -- or reveals it -- when he goes to Hollywood, where life isn't life unless it's the basis of a major motion picture.

THE HOLOCAUST: The Fate of European Jewry, 1932-1945. By Leni Yahil. (Oxford University, $35.) A work of synthesis rather than documentary scholarship, this popular survey aims to cover all aspects of the subject, including its political context.
THE JEWS IN AMERICA. Four Centuries of an Uneasy Encounter: A History. By Arthur Hertzberg. (Simon & Schuster, $22.95.) A broadly familiar story that rises to the superb in its account of the last 60 years or so, but is pessimistic about the future, foreseeing an end to Jewish history unless a spiritual revival supervenes.

Poetry
 ABOVE THE RIVER: The Complete Poems. By James Wright. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $27.95.) Lucidity, precision, poise, intelligence and the rigors of a craft that liberated imagination were the poetic values James Wright cherished, and his best poems, with their grace and intelligence, remain among the finest examples of midcentury American lyric.
ARARAT. By Louise Gluck. (Ecco, $17.95.) There is nothing relaxed about the white-knuckle language of these poems, which give a family history with objectivity, compassion and regret, and with wit more mordant than trenchant. No American poet writes better than Louise Gluck; perhaps none can lead us so deeply into our own natures.
THE AUGUST SLEEPWALKER. By Bei Dao. Translated by Bonnie S. McDougall. (New Directions, Cloth, $16.95; Paper, $8.95.) Bei Dao, the guiding voice of the stillborn "Democracy Movement" in China in the late 1970's, uses words as if he were fighting for his life with them. Living in a nightmare of cruelty and dreaming of normality, he has forged a language that speaks to all of us in astonishing, beautiful poems.
THE NIGHT PARADE. By Edward Hirsch. (Knopf, $18.95.) Emotional richness combined with a precision of language and metaphor make the best of these poems wonderful to read. Some seem to have forced themselves into being; silence was no longer possible.
SELECTED POEMS, 1966-1987. By Seamus Heaney. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $20.) Seamus Heaney's patch is Ireland, with its turmoil and mutilated native culture, and no poet has taken his role more seriously or defined his responsibility with greater care. The great heart and humanity of the man ring through the decades of his splendid poetry.
THE TONGUES WE SPEAK: New and Selected Poems. By Patricia Goedicke. (Milkweed, $9.95.) This volume spans 25 years of the work of a poet who is always aware of the political state of the world and of history. Her strengths are sincerity, memorable rhythms and great emotional power.
THE TRANSPARENT MAN. By Anthony Hecht. (Knopf, $18.95.) COLLECTED EARLIER POEMS. By Anthony Hecht. (Knopf, $22.95.) No poet can write more beautifully when he wants to, but Anthony Hecht is also our only poet who can horrify. He achieves most in the intensity of lyric, but always he speaks like a biblical patriarch, and his elegant speech is a brilliant counterirritant to the contemporary wastage of our language.
THE WANT BONE. By Robert Pinsky. (Ecco, $17.95.) Jazzlike improvisations and brooding civility mark these poems about the overlapping metaphysics of Christianity and Judaism, about history as invisible presence, about the shaping drives and powers we turn into the artifacts of culture. It is Mr. Pinsky's riskiest and most imaginative book.
 
Popular Culture

CLEOPATRA: Histories, Dreams and Distortions. By Lucy Hughes-Hallett. (HarperCollins, $27.50.)

JEAN HOWARD'S HOLLYWOOD: A Photo Memoir. With photographs by Jean Howard and text by James Watters. (Abrams, $39.95.) Herself one of Hollywood's most beautiful and privileged people, Jean Howard snapped her shutter with a social historian's eye, capturing the great at play in the 1940's and 50's.

THE SPIRIT OF FOLK ART: The Girard Collection at the Museum of International Folk Art. By Henry Glassie. Color photographs by Michael Monteaux. (Abrams, $60.) With 154 splendid color pages, this rather ambitious illustrated essay celebrates a collection (located in Santa Fe, N.M.) that richly deserves it.

THE DIVIDE. By Robert Charles Wilson. (Foundation/Doubleday, $19.95.) This literate thriller is a superbly crafted novel of character and a thoughtful exploration of what it might feel like to be a superman.
RAMA II. By Arthur C. Clarke and Gentry Lee. (Spectra/Bantam, $18.95.) The sequel to Mr. Clarke's famous novel "Rendezvous With Rama" -- about a vast alien spaceship that seems oblivious to humanity's best efforts to make an impression -- is just as gripping in this second encounter.
LENS OF THE WORLD. By R. A. MacAvoy. (Morrow, $18.95). Ms. MacAvoy has written a fantasy novel with all the conceptual rigor of good science fiction.

FLOW: The Psychology of Optimal Experience. By Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. (HarperCollins, $21.95.)

HEADLINE: Betting on the Planet

BYLINE: BY John Tierney; John Tierney is a reporter for The New York Times. He is writing a book on environmental crises.

 BODY:
In 1980 an ecologist and an economist chose a refreshingly unacademic way to resolve their differences. They bet $1,000. Specifically, the bet was over the future price of five metals, but at stake was much more -- a view of the planet's ultimate limits, a vision of humanity's destiny. It was a bet between the Cassandra and the Dr. Pangloss of our era.
They lead two intellectual schools -- sometimes called the Malthusians and the Cornucopians, sometimes simply the doomsters and the boomsters -- that use the latest in computer-generated graphs and foundation-generated funds to debate whether the world is getting better or going to the dogs. The argument has generally been as fruitless as it is old, since the two sides never seem to be looking at the same part of the world at the same time. Dr. Pangloss sees farm silos brimming with record harvests; Cassandra sees topsoil eroding and pesticide seeping into ground water. Dr. Pangloss sees people living longer; Cassandra sees rain forests being decimated. But in 1980 these opponents managed to agree on one way to chart and test the global future. They promised to abide by the results exactly 10 years later -- in October 1990 -- and to pay up out of their own pockets. 
 The bettors, who have never met in all the years they have been excoriating each other, are both 58-year-old professors who grew up in the Newark suburbs. The ecologist, Paul R. Ehrlich, has been one of the world's better-known scientists since publishing "The Population Bomb" in 1968. More than three million copies were sold, and he became perhaps the only author ever interviewed for an hour on "The Tonight Show." When he is not teaching at Stanford University or studying butterflies in the Rockies, Ehrlich can generally be found on a plane on his way to give a lecture, collect an award or appear in an occasional spot on the "Today" show. This summer he won a five-year MacArthur Foundation grant for $345,000, and in September he went to Stockholm to share half of the $240,000 Crafoord Prize, the ecologist's version of the Nobel. His many personal successes haven't changed his position in the debate over humanity's fate. He is the pessimist.
The economist, Julian L. Simon of the University of Maryland, often speaks of himself as an outcast, which isn't quite true. His books carry jacket blurbs from Nobel laureate economists, and his views have helped shape policy in Washington for the past decade. But Simon has certainly never enjoyed Ehrlich's academic success or popular appeal. On the first Earth Day in 1970, while Ehrlich was in the national news helping to launch the environmental movement, Simon sat in a college auditorium listening as a zoologist, to great applause, denounced him as a reactionary whose work "lacks scholarship or substance." Simon took revenge, first by throwing a drink in his critic's face at a faculty party and then by becoming the scourge of the environmental movement. When he unveiled his happy vision of beneficent technology and human progress in Science magazine in 1980, it attracted one of the largest batches of angry letters in the journal's history.
In some ways, Simon goes beyond Dr. Pangloss, the tutor in "Candide" who insists that "All is for the best in this best of possible worlds." Simon believes that today's world is merely the best so far. Tomorrow's will be better still, because it will have more people producing more bright ideas. He argues that population growth constitutes not a crisis but, in the long run, a boon that will ultimately mean a cleaner environment, a healthier humanity and more abundant supplies of food and raw materials for everyone. And this progress can go on indefinitely because -- "incredible as it may seem at first," he wrote in his 1980 article -- the planet's resources are actually not finite. Simon also found room in the article to criticize, among others, Ehrlich, Barry Commoner, Newsweek, the National Wildlife Federation and the secretary general of the United Nations. It was titled "Resources, Population, Environment: An Oversupply of False Bad News."
An irate Ehrlich wondered how the article had passed peer review at America's leading scientific journal. "Could the editors have found someone to review Simon's manuscript who had to take off his shoes to count to 20?" Ehrlich asked in a rebuttal written with his wife, Anne, also an ecologist at Stanford. They provided the simple arithmetic: the planet's resources had to be divided among a population that was then growing at the unprecedented rate of 75 million people a year. The Ehrlichs called Simon the leader of a "space-age cargo cult" of economists convinced that new resources would miraculously fall from the heavens. For years the Ehrlichs had been trying to explain the ecological concept of "carrying capacity" to these economists. They had been warning that population growth was outstripping the earth's supplies of food, fresh water and minerals. But they couldn't get the economists to listen.
"To explain to one of them the inevitability of no growth in the material sector, or . . . that
commodities must become expensive," the Ehrlichs wrote, "would be like attempting to explain odd-day-even-day gas distribution to a cranberry."
Ehrlich decided to put his money where his mouth was by responding to an open challenge issued by Simon to all Malthusians. Simon offered to let anyone pick any natural resource -- grain, oil, coal, timber, metals -- and any future date. If the resource really were to become scarcer as the world's population grew, then its price should rise. Simon wanted to bet that the price would instead decline by the appointed date. Ehrlich derisively announced that he would "accept Simon's astonishing offer before other greedy people jump in." He then formed a consortium with John Harte and John P. Holdren, colleagues at the University of California at Berkeley specializing in energy and resource questions.
In October 1980 the Ehrlich group bet $1,000 on five metals -- chrome, copper, nickel, tin and tungsten -- in quantities that each cost $200 in the current market. A futures contract was drawn up obligating Simon to sell Ehrlich, Harte and Holdren these same quantities of the metals 10 years later, but at 1980 prices. If the 1990 combined prices turned out to be higher than $1,000, Simon would pay them the difference in cash. If prices fell, they would pay him. The contract was signed, and Ehrlich and Simon went on attacking each other throughout the 1980's. During that decade the world's population grew by more than 800 million, the greatest increase in history, and the store of metals buried in the earth's crust did not get any larger.

Population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio. Subsistence increases only in an arithmetical ratio. -- Thomas Robert Malthus, 1798.

Population Outgrows Food, Scientists Warn the World -- Front-page headline in The New York Times, Sept. 15, 1948, over an article about the "dark outlook for the human race" due to "overpopulation and the dwindling of natural resources."

No Room in the Lifeboats -- Headline in The New York Times Magazine, April 16, 1978, over an article warning that "the cost of natural resources is going up" as increasing population ushers in the "Age of Scarcity."

The earth has limited resources, and if we don't recycle them we use them up. -- Meredith Baxter-Birney, who played the mother on the "Family Ties" television show, in a recent Greenpeace public-service message showing the family sorting garbage in the living room.

IT IS SUCH AN OBVIOUS proposition in a finite world: things run out. It must have occurred to Homo habilis while searching for rocks to make the first tools 2.5 million years ago. Aristotle and Plato shared the same concerns as the "Family Ties" cast. The American Indians put it nicely in a proverb that has been adopted as a slogan by today's environmentalists: "We do not inherit the earth from our parents. We borrow it from our children." The idea shapes our personal actions when we bundle newspapers to avoid running out of wood for paper and land for garbage dumps. It affects our national policies when we send soldiers into the Persian Gulf to prevent Saddam Hussein from getting a "stranglehold" on the dwindling supplies of oil. It is the fear Paul Ehrlich raised in 1974: "What will we do when the pumps run dry?"
The counterargument is not nearly as intuitively convincing. It has generally consisted of a simple question: Why haven't things run out yet? The ones asking this question now tend to be economists, which is a switch, since their predecessors were the ones who initiated the modern preoccupation with resource scarcity. Economics was first called "the dismal science" in the last century because of Malthus's predictions of mass starvation. He had many successors, the most eloquent of whom perhaps was a British economist named William Stanley Jevons.
In 1865 Jevons published "The Coal Question: An Inquiry Concerning the Progress of the Nation, and the Probable Exhaustion of Our Coal Mines." In most ways, it was quite similar to the books that appeared during the energy crisis of the 1970's. There were graphs showing parabolic curves of population and coal consumption shooting upwards, and charts showing estimates of woefully inadequate coal reserves. "The conclusion is inevitable," Jevons wrote, "that our present happy progressive condition is a thing of limited duration."
Unlike the prophets a century later, though, Jevons was not sure that the answer was mandatory conservation. At first glance, he wrote, there seemed to be a clear case for the Government's limiting industry's profligate energy use. "To disperse so lavishly the cream of our mineral wealth is to be spendthrifts of our capital -- to part with that which will never come back." He warned that this might lead to the sudden collapse of British civilization. Yet he noted that much of that civilization, such as "our rich literature and philosophy," might never have existed without "the lavish expenditure of our material energy" that "redeemed us from dullness and degradation a century ago." To reduce coal consumption might only bring back stagnation, he cautioned, and he ended his book with a sentence in italics: "We have to make the momentous choice between brief greatness and longer continued mediocrity."
There were many other sightings of the end of the lode. An energy crisis arose in the middle of the 19th century, when the dwindling supply of whales drove up the cost of lighting homes with oil lamps and tallow candles. In 1905 President Theodore Roosevelt warned of an American "timber famine," a concern that prompted a proposal to ban Christmas trees. In 1926 the Federal Oil Conservation Board announced that the United States had a seven-year supply of petroleum left.
Naturalists gradually replaced economists as the chief doomsayers. They dominated the conservation movement early this century, and in 1948 two of them -- Fairfield Osborn, the president of the New York Zoological Society, and an ornithologist named William Vogt -- started a national debate by publishing popular books: "Our Plundered Planet" and "Road to Survival" respectively. Both men warned of overpopulation, dwindling resources and future famines. Vogt's book lamented the loss of "such irreplaceable capital goods as soils and minerals." Vogt was especially worried about one of the metals that turned up decades later in the Ehrlich-Simon bet, warning that "we might go to war to ensure access to tin sources." The world's supply of agricultural land, he wrote, was "shrinking fast" and "every year producing less food." America's recent bumper crops were "accidents of favorable weather." Since the United States was already overpopulated, "a fall in living standards is unavoidable." And if humanity did not follow Vogt's "Road to Survival" -- conservation and population control -- there was the alternate route presented in the book's last sentence: "Like Gadarene swine, we shall rush down a war-torn slope to a barbarian existence in the blackened rubble."
Both books made an impression on the teen-age Paul Ehrlich. He was already a naturalist himself, thanks to a mentor at the American Museum of Natural History in New York who encouraged him to study butterflies and publish papers while he was still a high-school student in New Jersey. Ehrlich went on to study zoology at the University of Pennsylvania. He married Anne in 1954 while in graduate school at the University of Kansas, and they put their Malthusian principles into practice by limiting themselves to one child. Ehrlich had a vasectomy in 1963, shortly after getting tenure at Stanford.
In the mid-60's, Ehrlich started giving public lectures about the population problem. One caught the attention of David Brower, then executive director of the Sierra Club, who led him to Ballantine Books. Rushing to publish his message in time for the 1968 Presidential election, Ehrlich produced what may be the all-time ecological best seller, "The Population Bomb."
It was "The Tonight Show" that made him and his book famous. As Ehrlich remembers it, Joan Rivers went on first, telling jokes about her honeymoon night ("I said, 'Turn off the lights . . . turn off the lights . . . shut the car door.' "). Then there was a starlet whose one-word answers made things so awkward that Ehrlich was rushed on early to rescue Johnny Carson.
"I went on and did basically a monologue," Ehrlich recalls. "I'd talk until the commercial, and during the break I'd feed Johnny a question, and then I'd answer it until the next commercial. I got the highest compliment after the show, when I was walking behind Johnny and Ed McMahon up the stairs, and I heard Johnny say, 'Boy, Paul really saved the show.' "
"The Tonight Show" got more than 5,000 letters about Ehrlich's appearance, the first of many on the program. Ehrlich has been deluged ever since with requests for lectures, interviews and opinions. He is a rare hybrid: the academic who keeps his professional reputation intact while pleasing the masses. Scientists praise his papers on butterflies and textbooks on ecology; talk-show hosts tout his popular books and love his affably blunt style. He has never been one to mince words or hedge predictions.
"The Population Bomb" began: "The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970's the world will undergo famines -- hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death." Ehrlich wrote that "nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate" and that America's "vast agricultural surpluses are gone."
Six years later, in a book he wrote with his wife, "The End of Affluence," he raised the death toll. The book told of a "nutritional disaster that seems likely to overtake humanity in the 1970's (or, at the latest, the 1980's). Due to a combination of ignorance, greed and callousness, a situation has been created that could lead to a billion or more people starving to death." The book predicted that "before 1985 mankind will enter a genuine age of scarcity" in which "the accessible supplies of many key minerals will be nearing depletion." Shortages would be felt in America as well as the rest of the world. "One general prediction can be made with confidence: the cost of feeding yourself and your family will continue to increase. There may be minor fluctuations in food prices, but the overall trend will be up."
Ehrlich was right about one thing: the world's population did grow. It is now 5.3 billion, 1.8 billion larger than when he published "The Population Bomb." Yet somehow the average person is healthier, wealthier and better fed than in 1968. The predicted rise in the world death rate has yet to materialize -- infant mortality has declined and life expectancy has increased, most dramatically in the third world. There have been famines in countries afflicted by war, drought and disastrous agricultural policies, but the number of people affected by famines has been declining steadily during the past three decades. In fact, the number is much lower than it was during the same decades of the last century, even though the world's population is much larger. Experts argue about how much hunger remains in the world, but they generally agree that the average person in the third world is better nourished today than in 1968. Food production has increased faster than population since the publication of "The Population Bomb," just as it has since the books of Vogt, Osborn and Malthus.
Perhaps the best way to see what has happened to food prices -- and to get a glimpse of the Malthusian mind-set -- is to consider a graph from Lester R. Brown, another widely quoted doomster. Brown has long been the chief source for Ehrlich and other ecologists on trends in agriculture -- "the best person in the country on the subject" in Ehrlich's words. Brown is the president of the Worldwatch Institute in Washington, which makes news each year with what it calls the world's most widely used public-policy document, its "State of the World" report. This year's report includes a graph, below, of grain prices that is interesting for a couple of reasons:
 
[GRAPH: "World Wheat and Rice Prices, 1950-89]
 
Consider, first of all, how it compares with Brown's predictions of a decade ago. He was pessimistic then for the same reasons that Ehrlich, Vogt and Osborn had been: rising population, vanishing topsoil, the growing dependence on "non-sustainable" uses of irrigation, fertilizer, pesticides. "The period of global food security is over," Brown wrote in 1981. "As the demand for food continues to press against the supply, inevitably real food prices will rise. The question no longer seems to be whether they will rise but how much." But as the graph shows, grain prices promptly fell and reached historic lows during the 1980's, continuing a long-term decline that dates back to the days of Vogt and Osborn (and Malthus, too, if you extended the graph).
Now consider how Brown analyzes this data. In a chapter titled "The Illusion of Progress" in this year's report, he focuses not on the long-term trend but on the blips in the graph in 1988 and 1989 -- when prices rose because of factors like drought and a United States Government program that took farmland out of production. Looking ahead to the 1990's, Brown writes, "The first concrete economic indication of broad-based environmental deterioration now seems likely to be rising grain prices."
We are barely into the 1990's, but so far Brown's poor track record is intact. Grain prices have plummeted since he published his prediction at the start of the year. The blips in the late 1980's caused farmers to do what they always do when prices rise: plant more crops. The price of wheat has fallen by more than 40 percent in the past year, and if you plotted it on that graph, it would be at yet another all-time low. Once again Malthus's day of reckoning will have to be rescheduled.

JULIAN SIMON REMEMBERS his first glimpse of Paul Ehrlich as being one of the more frustrating moments of his life. It was during the Earth Day furor two decades ago. Simon was sitting at home in Urbana, Ill., Ehrlich was on "The Tonight Show" and Johnny Carson was enthralled.
"Carson, the most unimpressable of people, had this look of stupefied admiration," Simon recalls. "He'd throw out a question about population growth and Ehrlich would start out by saying, 'Well, it's really very simple, Johnny.' Now the one thing I knew in those days about population was that nothing about it is simple. But what could I do? Go talk to five people? Here was a guy reaching a vast audience, leading this juggernaut of environmentalist hysteria, and I felt utterly helpless."
At this point, Simon was still in the early stages of Cornucopianism. He had started out as a Malthusian. After studying psychology at Harvard University and receiving a doctorate in business economics from the University of Chicago, he joined the faculty at the University of Illinois in 1963. He was an expert in mail-order marketing -- his book on the topic sold 200,000 copies, more than any he has written since -- and was looking for something else to do when he heard the grim predictions about overpopulation. In the late 1960's he began publishing papers on using marketing tools and economic incentives to persuade women to have fewer babies. But then he came across work by economists showing that countries with rapid population growth were not suffering more than other countries. In fact, many were doing better. He also came across a book, "Scarcity and Growth," published in 1963 with the help of Resources for the Future, a conservation group dominated by economists.
The book was a revelation to him: it provided the empirical foundations of Cornucopianism. The authors, Harold J. Barnett and Chandler Morse, tracked the price of natural resources back to 1870 and found that the price of virtually everything had fallen. The average worker today could buy more coal with an hour's pay than he could when "The Coal Question" was published in the last century, just as he could buy more metals and more food. Things were actually getting less scarce as population grew.
The evidence inspired the boomster view of history, which was then refined by Simon and others, like Charles Maurice and Charles W. Smithson. These economists, then at Texas A & M University, looked back at 10,000 years of resource crises and saw a pattern: things did sometimes become scarce, but people responded with innovations. They found new supplies or practiced conservation. They managed to recycle without the benefit of government policies or moral exhortations from Greenpeace. Stone Age tribes in areas short of flint learned to resharpen their tools instead of discarding them as tribes did in flint-rich areas.
Often the temporary scarcity led to a much better substitute. The Greeks' great transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age 3,000 years ago, according to Maurice and Smithson, was inspired by a disruption of trade due to wars in the eastern Mediterranean. The disruption produced a shortage of the tin needed to make bronze, and the Greeks responded to the bronze crisis by starting to use iron. Similarly, timber shortages in 16th-century Britain ushered in the age of coal; the scarcity of whale oil around 1850 led to the first oil well in 1859. Temporary shortages do occur, but Cornucopians argue that as long as government doesn't interfere -- by mandating conservation or setting the sort of price controls that produced America's gas lines of the 1970's -- people will find alternatives that turn out to be better.
"Natural resources are not finite. Yes, you read correctly," Simon wrote in his 1981 manifesto, "The Ultimate Resource." The title referred to human ingenuity, which Simon believed could go on indefinitely expanding the planet's carrying capacity. This idea marked the crucial difference between Simon and Ehrlich, and between economists and ecologists: the view of the world not as an closed ecosystem but as an flexible marketplace. The concept of carrying capacity might make sense in discussing Ehrlich's butterflies or Vogt's "Gadarene swine," but Simon rejected animal analogies. He liked to quote the 19th-century economist Henry George: "Both the jayhawk and the man eat chickens, but the more jayhawks, the fewer chickens, while the more men, the more chickens."
Of course, men can also produce more pollution than jayhawks, and Simon conceded that the marketplace did need some regulation. But he insisted that environmental crises were being exaggerated. He and another leading boomster, Herman Kahn, edited a book in 1984, "The Resourceful Earth," rebutting the gloomy forecasts of the Government's "Global 2000 Report" prepared under President Carter. Their book was replete with graphs showing that, by most measures, America's air and water had been getting cleaner for decades, thanks partly to greater affluence (richer societies can afford to pay for pollution controls like sewage treatment) and partly to the progress of technology (the pollution from cars today in New York City is nothing compared to the soot from coal-burning furnaces and the solid waste from horses at the turn of the century). Simon asserted that innovations would take care of new forms of pollution, and he set about disputing the various alarming estimates of tropical deforestation, species extinction, eroding topsoil, paved-over farmland and declining fisheries.
"As soon as one predicted disaster doesn't occur, the doomsayers skip to another," Simon complains. "There's nothing wrong with worrying about new problems -- we need problems so we can come up with solutions that leave us better off than if they'd never come up in the first place. But why don't the doomsayers see that, in the aggregate, things are getting better? Why do they always think we're at a turning point -- or at the end of the road? They deny our creative powers for solutions. It's only because we used those powers so well in the past that we can afford to worry about things like losing species and wetlands. Until we got so rich and healthy and productive at agriculture, a wetland was a swamp with malarial mosquitoes that you had to drain so you could have cropland to feed your family."
Simon's fiercest battle has been against Paul Ehrlich's idea that the world has too many people. The two have never debated directly -- Ehrlich has always refused, saying that Simon is a "fringe character" -- but they have lambasted each other in scholarly journal articles with titles like "An Economist in Wonderland" and "Paul Ehrlich Saying It Is So Doesn't Make It So." Simon acknowledges that rising population causes short-term problems, because it means more children to feed and raise. But he maintains that there are long-term benefits when those children become productive, resourceful adults. He has supported making abortion and family-planning services available to women to give them more freedom, but he has vehemently opposed programs that tell people how many children to have. He attacked Ehrlich for suggesting that governments should consider using coercion to limit family size and for endorsing the startling idea that the United States should consider cutting off food aid to countries that refuse to control population growth.
Among academics, Simon seems to be gaining in the debate. Many scientists are still uncomfortable with his sweeping optimism about the future -- there is no guarantee, after all, that past trends will continue -- and most population experts are not sure that the current rate of population growth in the third world is going to bring the long-term benefits predicted by Simon. But the consensus has been shifting against Ehrlich's idea of population growth as the great evil. Simon's work helped prompt the National Academy of Sciences to prepare a 1986 report, which noted that there was no clear evidence that population growth makes countries poorer. It concluded that slower population growth would probably benefit third world countries, but argued that other factors, like a country's economic structure and political institutions, were much more important to social well-being. The report opposed the notion of using government coercion to control family size. It noted that most experts expected the world food situation to continue improving, and it concluded that, for the foreseeable future, "the scarcity of exhaustible resources is at most a minor constraint on economic growth."
But Simon is still far behind when it comes to winning over the general public. This past Earth Day he did not fare much better than he did in 1970. Ehrlich was still the one all over national television. In the weeks leading up to Earth Day in April, Ehrlich did spots for the "Today" show and appeared on other programs promoting his new book, "The Population Explosion," which declares that "the population bomb has detonated." At the big Earth Day rally in Washington, Ehrlich was one of the many Malthusians warning that this was humanity's last chance to save the planet. It was a scene to make Cornucopians wonder if the ancient Greeks who described Cassandra's curse -- fated to be always right but never heeded -- had gotten it precisely backward. The crowd of more than 200,000 applauded heartily after Ehrlich told them that population growth could produce a world in which their grandchildren would endure food riots in the streets of America.
Ehrlich did not mention Simon by name, although he did refer to him at another event that Earth Day weekend, a symposium of ecologists inside the domed auditorium of the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. The symposium was devoted to the question of natural resources -- "Population and Scarcity: The Forgotten Dimensions" -- and Ehrlich talked about humanity squandering irreplaceable capital. He praised a colleague who had advocated the idea of governments' stopping economic growth by setting quotas on the amount of resources that could be used each year. Ehrlich criticized the shortsightedness of economists, and he got a laugh when he alluded to Simon's book: "The ultimate resource -- the one thing we'll never run out of is imbeciles."
That same day Simon spoke only a block away in a small, low-ceilinged conference room at another Earth Day symposium. It was sponsored by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a group that explores free-market solutions to environmental problems. In an intense, quiet voice, Simon declared that the Malthusians "must either turn a blind eye to the scientifc evidence or be blatantly dishonest intellectually." He spoke of population growth representing "a victory over death," because it was due to the doubling of life expectancy since the Industrial Revolution. "This is an incredible gain. Human history has never shown any achievement to hold a candle to that. You'd expect lovers of human life to be jumping with joy at this incredible success. Instead, across the street we've got them lamenting that there are so many people alive."
He seemed a little disappointed that there were only 16 people in the audience to celebrate his message. "Well, there may be more of them over there," Simon said, gesturing toward the place where Ehrlich was speaking, "but we're happier."

The bet was settled this fall without ceremony. Ehrlich did not even bother to write a letter. He simply mailed Simon a sheet of calculations about metal prices -- along with a check for $576.07. Simon wrote back a thank-you note, adding that he would be willing to raise the wager to as much as $20,000, pinned to any other resources and to any other year in the future.
Each of the five metals chosen by Ehrlich's group, when adjusted for inflation since 1980, had declined in price. The drop was so sharp, in fact, that Simon would have come out slightly ahead overall even without the inflation adjustment called for in the bet. Prices fell for the same Cornucopian reasons they had fallen in previous decades -- entrepreneurship and continuing technological improvements. Prospectors found new lodes, such as the nickel mines around the world that ended a Canadian company's near monopoly of the market. Thanks to computers, new machines and new chemical processes, there were more efficient ways to extract and refine the ores for chrome and the other metals.
For many uses, the metals were replaced by cheaper materials, notably plastics, which became less expensive as the price of oil declined (even during this year's crisis in the Persian Gulf, the real cost of oil remained lower than in 1980). Telephone calls went through satellites and fiber-optic lines instead of copper wires. Ceramics replaced tungsten in cutting tools. Cans were made of aluminum instead of tin, and Vogt's fears about America going to war over tin remained unrealized. The most newsworthy event in the 1980's concerning that metal was the collapse of the international tin cartel, which gave up trying to set prices in 1985 when the market became inundated with excess supplies.
Is there a lesson here for the future?
"Absolutely not," said Ehrlich in an interview. Nevertheless, he has no plans to take up Simon's new offer: "The bet doesn't mean anything. Julian Simon is like the guy who jumps off the Empire State Building and says how great things are going so far as he passes the 10th floor. I still think the price of those metals will go up eventually, but that's a minor point. The resource that worries me the most is the declining capacity of our planet to buffer itself against human impacts. Look at the new problems that have come up: the ozone hole, acid rain, global warming. It's true that we've kept up food production -- I underestimated how badly we'd keep on depleting our topsoil and ground water -- but I have no doubt that sometime in the next century food will be scarce enough that prices are really going to be high even in the United States. If we get climate change and let the ecological systems keep running downhill, we could have a gigantic population crash."
Simon was not surprised to hear about Ehrlich's reaction. "Paul Ehrlich has never been able to learn from past experience," he said, then launched into the Cornucopian line on the greenhouse crisis -- how, even in the unlikely event that doomsayers are right about global warming, humanity will find some way to avert climate change or adapt, and everyone will emerge the better for it. But Simon did not get far into his argument before another cheery thought occurred to him. He stopped and smiled.
"So Ehrlich is talking about a population crash," he said. "That sounds like an even better way to make money. I'll give him heavy odds on that one."

HEADLINE: TELEVISION;
Now, a Look at the Life Style of Robin Leach

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
You are Robin Leach. That Robin Leach. You are the star of "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous" and "Runaway With the Rich and Famous." You are launching "Preview: First Look at the New," a $30 million, five-day-a-week television extravaganza. You've traveled 400,000 miles this year to exotic locales. And yes: You are the on-screen voice of Spuds MacKenzie.
Yet dark clouds have shadowed your paradise. You are savaged by critics. You are parodied. By children, even. You are continually amazed at the remarkable number of misconceptions that keep cropping up about your life, your person and your art. What do you do? You pause between continent-spanning flights. You grant an interview. You speak frankly. And you set to rest once and forever 13 myths about the ever-growing Legend of Leach: 
 1. Robin Leach Is Rich and Famous: "Actually, I'm infamous," said the 49-year-old Mr. Leach, sipping decaf coffee from a not very rich or famous Styrofoam cup. He was seated not on the Orient Express but on a conference chair in one of his two offices in midtown Manhattan. "And I'm not rich. Everyone thinks I make what Oprah does or Cosby, but I don't, because we're in syndication. I made my first million by the time I was 31 and promptly lost it when I got divorced." How close is he now to his 10th million? "Nowhere near," he said in the famous harsh, manic voice.
He added, with more modulation: "I don't want to be rich -- in the definition we have of rich." He meant that the cutoff point for inclusion on "Lifestyles" is $50 million. "I just want to be comfortable."
2. Robin Leach Has Hot-and-Cold Running Servants: "I have no servants," he said. "I do have a cleaning lady, like everyone else." He sighed. "I have no limo. In cities, I usually hail a taxi like everyone else. My car at home is a Ford Mustang. I have a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan, which is really a glorified closet for changing clothes." He owns a three-bedroom house in Connecticut -- "no fence, no guard, no barking dog" -- and a two-bedroom house in Los Angeles.
3. Robin Leach Is Robin Leach: "I've become Robin Leach the cartoon character in front of the camera," he said. The cartoon character is a 5-foot-11-inch, lower-middle-class Englishman with protruding ears and sufficient girth who breathlessly intones his lines in glass-cutting vowels on international television. "I am the most unlikely star in the world," Mr. Leach said happily.
"But the cartoon character, that's not who Robin Leach is," he added. "Robin Leach is a guy who, when he has the time, goes quietly to his house in Connecticut and sits looking into the fire with a good glass of red wine in his hand." Mr. Leach said his steady date these days is the actress Judith Ledford; he has three grown children from his first marriage.
"And when I wake up in the morning," he continued, "I wink at myself because I like me -- I know who I am. And when it's time to send the cartoon character off, I just send him on his way."
4. Robin Leach Is on Every Single Television Station Every Hour of Every Day: "It just seems that way," he said. Especially in New York and Los Angeles, where weekends are Robin Leach television festivals. Leach-lovers can view three of his shows and three repeats on three different networks in Los Angeles, and three shows and one repeat on three different channels in New York, where, as in many other cities, Mr. Leach's shows are broadcast seven days a week.
Truly, a gradual process of worldwide Leachification is occurring: in addition to the 168 stations in America that carry his programs, his shows are now broadcast in 22 overseas markets. "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous," Mr. Leach's weekly hourlong show celebrating millionaires, celebrities and industrialists, is in its eighth year and has been renewed for next season; according to A.C. Nielsen, it has 4.4 million viewers. (In the New York City area, "Lifestyles" is on WABC-TV on Sunday nights at 8.) "Runaway With the Rich and Famous," which takes celebrities and their video cameras on jaunts to exotic foreign climes and/or locales, is in its fifth season, has 3.5 million viewers a week and has also been renewed for next year. (In New York, "Runaway" is on WABC-TV on Sunday mornings at 9:30.) Mr. Leach is executive producer, and on-air talent, for both shows; he is managing editor and on-camera reporter for "Preview: First Look at the New," the latest Leach project. The half-hour, five-day-a-week "strip," as it's called in the biz, began in September and has 2.1 million viewers. (In New York, "Preview" is on WNBC-TV weekdays at 9 A.M.)
 The impression of Leachian ubiquity is further enhanced by all those commercials. Mr. Leach has been the voice of Spuds MacKenzie -- the piratical Bud Light party pooch -- and he has hawked the California Lottery and Honda automobiles. If you remember, Robin Leach is the man who said, "I'll take the red one."
What makes Robin run? Is it the desire for fame? Is it greed? "It's enthusiasm," he said. "I thrive on it. And I really do have a lot of fun."
5. Robin Leach Is Daunted by Fears of a Recession: "I think the 90's will be a much more interesting era for us," he said. "It won't hurt 'Lifestyles' -- there's more fascination with a Gatsby in a depression, when no one's rich, than in a time when everyone's rich."
A recession "certainly isn't a bad time for television, when people have less income to spend on entertainment. It means that more people will be staying at home."
In a depression is it possible that Mr. Leach will run out of millionaires for "Lifestyles"? "Even now, two new people become millionaires every day," he said. "In our first eight years, we've been able to do stories on only 2,000 millionaires. We've hardly scratched the surface."
And if he's wrong? "Well, then we have two choices. We can do 'Lifestyles of the Formerly Rich and Famous,' " he said, "or we can do 'Lifestyles of the Poor and Unknown.' "
6. Robin Leach's New Show Is a Knock-Off of "Entertainment Tonight": "Cynics say that 'Preview' is 'Entertainment Tomorrow,' but they are two different shows," said Mr. Leach, who developed the new show with his longtime partner, Al Masini. Mr. Masini is the producer who came up with the concept for "Entertainment Tonight," and he also came up with Robin Leach: Mr. Leach was the only performer on the pilot of "Entertainment Tonight" to make it to the debut, and he stayed with the show for three years.
"Preview" is "the first look at everything that is new," said Mr. Leach. The show is a gee-whiz preview of movies, TV, recordings, fashion, medical breakthroughs, hotels, restaurants and life styles that often has the feel of a video press release.
7. Robin Leach Will Interview Just Any Millionaire: "We were offered the Duvaliers and the Marcoses," he said. "We turned them down cold. We felt their wealth was based on exploiting people in horrible ways."
8. Robin Leach Is Interested Primarily in Gossip: "It's not a fascination with gossip but with people," he said. "All my life I've been doing people-motivated journalism. It comes from the curiosity I have about what makes other people tick."
9. Robin Leach Has a Cockney Accent: His accent isn't true Cockney but a hybrid with "a bit of Manchester," he said. Mr. Leach said he spent two years in that city after spending his first 16-and-a-half years in Harrow, 18 miles from London. "Mine is a strange accent that has a harsh tone on some consonants," he said. Sometimes it sounds almost Australian.
The cartoon-character Robin Leach talks in a voice "that Rich Little said is just south of Howard Cosell in terms of arrogance, and just north of the adenoids," said Mr. Leach. "Unlike the politician, who's usually brought babies to kiss, I can't tell you how many parents ask me to listen to their 7-year-olds' bad Robin Leach imitations."
10. Robin Leach Broadcasts Trash TV: "Compared to 'Geraldo,' we look like Masterpiece Theater," said Mr. Leach. "We do sizzle, but we don't do sensation. None of our shows is trash TV. We offer the best in infotainment. You'd never catch us doing a show about nuns who become transvestites, or vice versa. You'll never see me in a dress like Phil Donahue."
Couldn't the content of Mr. Leach's shows have more calories? "We are what we are," he said. "People criticize us for being empty TV without substance, but that's what TV is. TV is the click of life. You know, the remote box." He pretended to be a viewer holding a remote-control, changing channels. "You have to grab the viewer's attention or -- click!"
For years, critics have denigrated Mr. Leach's shows, deploring his breezy pseudo-reportorial style that seems to have been inspired not by news but by hotel, resort and entertainment tie-ins, and disparaging his glorification of conspicuous consumption. " 'Lifestyles' is seen to be about money, but that's not true," he responded. "The audience sees it as fun and entertaining. The audience also learns something -- that capitalism, though not perfect, is the best system. The Russians are learning that now. We say it's O.K. to better your life. We say that the American dream is still alive and well."
Isn't all this fascination with the wealthy somewhat twisted? "I think it's eminently healthy," he said. "The American capitalist system offers the chance at the best of what there is. And 'Lifestyles' keeps banging home the values of the good life. The idea is, work hard and you'll be rewarded."
11. Robin Leach Sees Himself Primarily as a Performer: "I am a businessman who, every once in awhile, stands in front of the camera and screeches his screech," Mr. Leach said. "We are very, very serious about what we do. TV is an art, but it's not brain surgery. It's a business.
"We aim for the mass market and put it in a package," he said, adding that the package was first wrapped in the world of the tabloids. "I believe in talking in 96-point," he said referring to the screaming headlines of Fleet Street, where he once worked. "I write short sentences. No sentence shall be more than 10 words long. No word shall have more than seven letters. I love cliches. I love alliteration. On television, you can wrap your tongue around cliches and aggressive verbs."
12. Robin Leach Can Keep Working 18-Hour Days Forever: "I suppose that, after 10 years of 'Lifestyles,' I'll have to limp into the sunset like Chester," he said. "Then I'll be 50, and look it. My hairline has been going backwards, and my waistline has been going forwards. The question is, at age 50, will audiences want to see this slightly balding, overweight Englishman, crumpled in a chair?"
13. Robin Leach Will One Day Be Absent From Television: " 'Lifestyles' and 'Runaway' have a very long shelf life," he said. "They'll run forever. They'll still be running when I'm dead."

 BODY:
ASK THE AVERAGE COUCH POTATO about cable television, and he may tell you about MTV or the Home Shopping Network or complain about soaring rates and companies that seldom answer the phone. Odds are, the name John C. Malone will never come up in the more than 50 million households to which, directly or indirectly, he provides cable TV.
 In fact, John Malone, C.E.O. of Tele-Communications Incorporated, is perhaps the most powerful man in the television business and, indisputably, one of the most feared. It is Malone, for example, who once threatened to yank the popular sports network ESPN from T.C.I.'s many cable systems if a new rate structure were not negotiated by midnight of the day in question. 
John Malone's opinion and attitude is surmised at, guessed at, speculated at in every sports-rights negotiation, in every conversation investment bankers might have about the formation of a new cable service," says a ranking network executive who is familiar with Malone's business practices. "Although John is a likable man, when you're negotiating with him, he will let you see his fangs. His power is real. And some of his rhetoric about the people he competes with, his rhetoric about the networks, certainly suggests that he considers himself intellectually superior to all of us. With some reason, I think, by the way."
 In his south-Denver office on a late-September morning, the 49-year-old Malone, the guiding spirit of the largest cable television company on the surface of the planet, looks hardly the consummate villain his numerous enemies describe. He is intense and handsome, clearly comfortable in his tweed trousers and green sweater-shirt -- and, surprisingly, trim. (The suits he wears, when protocol dictates, appear to have been tailored for an oil drum.) Nor does the T.C.I. headquarters, in a sleek new office tower across the street from a luxury hotel but otherwise surrounded by a sea of vacant lots, give hint to the awesome media empire Malone has assembled. As the result of a long series of shrewd, if often fiendishly complex, acquisitions, T.C.I. has a hand in piping a cable television signal to more than 11 million households in 48 states -- or roughly one-fifth of the American cable-viewing populace.
 Malone's company does much more than simply run a coaxial cable into those homes; it wields enormous influence over the programming that travels through that cable. T.C.I. holds equity stakes in 9 of the top 20 "basic" cable networks, the largest of which, the Cable News Network, reaches 55.3 million households.
 Malone's cable systems own the electric plumbing that delivers the television signals to his subscribers' homes. The programming networks, by contrast, create many of the shows that the signal carries. T.C.I.'s interest in both parts of the business, its vertical integration, gives Malone three bites of the apple. He receives the subscriber fees paid monthly to his cable systems, and his largest programming investments yield income from both advertising and the fees paid by other systems to carry the shows.
 T.C.I., in short, is an incredible money machine with an annual operating cash flow projected at $1.4 billion this year, more than any other company in the American television industry. And John Malone, the machine's chief engineer, makes no apologies for his success.
 "I think there's no question that I have the cable industry tattooed on one of my rear-end cheeks, and T.C.I. on the other," he says. "But I don't think I've been ruthless in anything. I don't think I've driven anybody out of business."
 If Malone sounds defensive, he has good reason. In an office down the hall, an aide monitors the nonprofit, public-affairs cable channel C-Span, which T.C.I. helped create. (Unique among television executives, Malone keeps no TV set in his office.) On this autumn day, C-Span is covering proceedings in the United States Senate -- activity of vital importance to T.C.I.'s future.
 The House had already passed, and the Senate was now considering, legislation that would effectively reregulate an industry that in the 1980's had won almost complete freedom from Government supervision and control. "What the cable industry can do and how it does it," says Malone, "is largely a function of what the Government permits it to do."
 As events subsequently transpired, the bill was stalled by Senator Timothy E. Wirth, the Colorado Democrat who has collected 19 percent of his campaign contributions over the last year and a half from cable executives and 33 percent of his PAC money from the cable industry itself -- including $10,000 received in April from Malone's T.C.I.
 But the reprieve, in all likelihood, will be only temporary. Most cable industry experts expect a new bill to emerge next year, one that might go even further in curtailing cable companies' power.
 If Malone feels that such legislative efforts are aimed directly at him, he has a certain amount of justification. "There's a joke going around Washington," says John Tinker, a New York-based Morgan Stanley & Company investment banker who specializes in cable television. "If you have a gun with two bullets, and you have Abu Nidal, Saddam Hussein and John Malone in a room, who would you shoot? The answer is John Malone -- twice, to make sure he's dead."
IN 1952, A FORMER OKLAHOMA cottonseed salesman and part-time rancher named Bob Magness sold his cattle, mortgaged his house and founded the company that would become Tele-Communications Inc.
 In that golden video era of "The George Gobel Show" and "Tom Corbett, Space Cadet," cable TV -- often called "community antenna television" -- was almost exclusively a means of carrying the broadcast networks to distant farms, homesteads and villages where the over-the-air signal was either weak or nonexistent.
 Stringing the lines himself from utility pole to utility pole, Magness completed cabling his first town, Memphis, Tex., in 1956. He proceeded to Montana and then, in 1965, moved his company, Community Television, to Denver. At that point he owned 17 cable systems with nearly 37,000 subscribers and a microwave-transmission business, which, like cable, primarily carried broadcast signals to distant locations.
 Magness renamed his operations Tele-Communications Inc. in 1968 and took it public in 1970. He did not entirely relinquish control, however. To this day, he and Malone, through their majority ownership of the company's Class B stock, account for 41 percent of the voting rights in T.C.I.
 From the earliest days, Magness operated according to two principles: "Keep It Simple" and "Pay Interest, Not Taxes." The latter credo, based on his belief that the most effective way to accumulate assets is to borrow copiously while reporting very little profit, would find a receptive ear in the man who would eventually succeed Magness. In 1973, with T.C.I. falling deeply into trouble, Magness hired that person, 32-year-old John Malone, as president.
FOR A MAN SO YOUNG, Malone had already enjoyed an impressive career. Born in 1941 in Milford, Conn., John Charles Custer Malone graduated from Yale in 1963, with a double major in electrical engineering and economics, then joined AT&T as an economic planner. Malone went on to take an M.S. in operations research from Johns Hopkins in 1964 and a Ph.D. from the same university in industrial engineering five years later.
 He became a management consultant at McKinsey & Company in 1968, and two years later moved to the General Instrument Corporation, soon rising to president of its Jerrold cable-equipment division. At Jerrold, a key supplier to cable-systems operators, Malone's star burned with sufficient brightness to attract the attention of Warner Communications' chairman, Steven J. Ross. In 1972, Ross asked him to head up Warner's fledgling cable operation.
 Malone turned him down. "Some of the senior management were very good friends of mine, but their continued involvement would probably have been inconsistent with my coming in, if you know what I mean," he says. Unwilling to dismiss friends and eager to remove his family from the hectic New York metropolitan scene, Malone accepted Magness' invitation to work for him in Denver.
 "The early years of me and T.C.I. were really a workout," says Malone. "T.C.I. was struggling. It was overextended. But I liked the entrepreneurship. I liked the people. I wanted a career."
 As recently as 1972, T.C.I.'s stock had traded at $37. But it had tanked, and, after the stock market turned downward in 1974, it could be purchased for less than a dollar. Wall Street was effectively cut off as a source of new funds. Meanwhile, turmoil in the cable industry had shut off the credit markets.
 At that point, T.C.I.'s money-losing microwave subsidiary was one of the nation's largest microwave common carriers. And the cable subsidiary became the second-largest cable company the next year. Malone, however, was running a company whose long-term debt reached $122 million in 1976, serviced by an operating cash flow of only $19 million. Meeting this challenge was the making of John Malone.
 Although his financial achievements would become the envy of the industry, the man who slowly turned T.C.I. into the most powerful force in the cable industry remained virtually unknown to the public -- with some significant exceptions. In the 1970's and early 80's, Malone and T.C.I. became all too familiar to the residents of a handful of small municipalities.
 Too often, T.C.I.'s signal was poor, and its repairmen frequently failed to keep their appointments. In handling such complaints the company established a reputation for treating customers with utter disdain. A partial bill of particulars:
 * In 1973, rate negotiations stalled with local regulators in Vail, Colo., the local T.C.I. system shut off all programming for a weekend and ran nothing but the names and home phone numbers of the mayor and city manager. The harried local government gave in.
 * In 1981, T.C.I. withheld fees and vowed to go completely dark in Jefferson City, Mo., if the city failed to renew its franchise, while a T.C.I. employee -- "who turned out to have a psychological problem," says Malone -- threatened harm to the city's media consultant. Again, a beleaguered local government renewed the franchise -- although in a subsequent lawsuit, T.C.I. was fined $10.8 million in actual damages and $25 million in punitive damages.
 * In 1983, the small city of Kearney, Neb., also dissatisfied with poor service and rising rates, tried to give Malone some competition in the form of a rival system built by the regional telephone company. T.C.I. slashed fees and added channels until the enemy was driven from the field.
 "That's the dark side, if you will, of T.C.I.," says Richard J. MacDonald, a media analyst with New York-based MacDonald Grippo Riely, discussing the strong-arm days. But, he quickly adds, such methods were not confined to T.C.I. at a time when munici pal governments were the primary regulators of cable television.
IT WAS PROGRAMMERS -- Time Inc.'s Home Box Office and a Georgia entrepreneur, Ted Turner -- that propelled the cable industry into the great leap forward that made much of Malone's true and lasting power possible. HBO began broadcasting via satellite in 1975. The following year, Turner took the signal of his Atlanta television station, WTBS, and similarly beamed it skyward. HBO's movies and Turner's "superstation" were now available to every cable operator in the land.
 Satellites spawned a new generation of cable networks, created by programmers who put together video offerings and lined up advertisers to help pay for them. A single program could be sold simultaneously to any cable operator with the necessary "earth station" to receive the signal.
 "Malone understood the nature of the business sooner, quicker and more profoundly than any of the others did," says MacDonald. "He realized that large size meant lower costs. The bigger he was, the better the deals he could cut with his suppliers, which in turn boosted his cash flow. Everyone else in the industry stood around worrying about what Wall Street would think about their earnings. But Malone quickly realized that the debt market was awash with cheap money, and he went after it."
 Malone seemed to have a divining rod for money. In 1978, he pledged to give HBO access to his 660,000 subscribers in exchange for free satellite earth stations. That same year, Malone persuaded a group of institutional investors -- including the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, along with Equitable Life -- to lend T.C.I. $70.5 million. The largest cable loan in history to that point, the deal was made possible by the company's improved operating cash flow, by then $31.5 million and growing. In the early 80's, Malone gave the proliferating programming networks access to his cable systems in exchange for advance royalties -- obtaining, in effect, tens of millions of dollars in interest-free loans.
 But if Malone was bold and inventive in raising his money, he was cautious when it came to investing it. "We took a conservative strategy," he says, "of building the company up in little bites rather than great big swallows."
 Many little bites. By mid-1989, after 16 years with T.C.I., Malone had done an incredible 482 deals, on average one every two weeks. By the latter part of the 80's, the bites had become great big swallows. At least three acquisition deals -- Heritage Communications, United Artists Communications and Storer Communications -- ran more than $1 billion each.
THROUGH THE Early 1980's cable companies faced a bewildering maze of jurisdictions -- municipal, state and Federal -- responsible for regulating systems and dictating the fees the operators could charge subscribers. To placate these regulators, cable companies often made extravagant and sometimes impossible promises: limitless public-access channels and, perhaps more tempting, channels devoted solely to coverage of the mayor and city council.
 The cities, in turn, saw an opportunity to generate nontax revenue. Though Federally limited to charging the cable companies 3 percent of gross receipts, many municipalities charged as much as 5 percent. At the same time, many local officials, eager to please the voters with inexpensive cable television, placed artificially low ceilings on monthly cable fees.
 Congress, determined to streamline the regulatory system, passed the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984. The law transferred primary oversight of cable rates from the cities to the Federal Communications Commission, where the Reagan-era commissioners interpreted their new powers in a way that effectively deregulated cable television.
 Among other measures, the agency eliminated rate regulation wherever a cable company operated in a competitive environment -- defined as the presence of at least three over-the-air broadcast signals in the cable operator's service area; most major markets, in other words.
 Even though they were no longer required to, virtually all cable systems continued to carry the major broadcast networks and important independent stations -- just as they had always done, at absolutely no cost to themselves. Meanwhile, the new-found ability to charge the subscribers any price the marketwould bear meant that a well-managed cable company now had ample funds to expand its system to carry the many new types of programs that had been created especially for the cable industry.
 By the end of the decade, most cable systems offered some three dozen channels to compete with the single channel each major broadcast network could provide. The fractionalized video marketplace seriously eroded the broadcasters' share of the audience.
 It was in this dramatically altered environment that John Malone consolidated his power.
IN 1987, MALONE led a consortium of cable holding companies, including Time Inc., that invested $568 million in Turner Broadcasting to save it from the disastrous consequences of Ted Turner's purchase of the MGM/UA film library. Suddenly, T.C.I. held 22 percent of Turner Broadcasting, including the all-news channel CNN, and Malone sat on Turner's board.
 Over the years, T.C.I. has also acquired other programmers, including 60 percent of the Prime Network group of regional sports channels; 50 percent of American Movie Classics; 49 percent of the Discovery Channel, and 20 percent of Black Entertainment Television.
 In Malone's view, there had been sound and even benign reasons for these investments. "We kept Turner in business," he says. "And without us, the little guys don't have a chance. The guys at the Discovery Channel ran around looking for someone who could help them. They ended up here."
 But Malone did not hesitate to throw his weight around. During rate negotiations, for example, Malone once threatened to use Turner Broadcasting to compete with ESPN for sports programming, and subsequently threatened to compete with Turner's CNN by forming a joint news venture with NBC. In both cases, he backed off after securing favorable terms.
 Lately, however, there are signs that the tables could turn. Consumers now demand that their cable systems carry such popular services as ESPN, MTV and the Turner networks. Whereas the programmers once paid the cable companies to transmit their services, the most popular ones now charge the cable operators -- and even indulge in blackmail of their own.
 Last New Year's Eve, Peter R. Barton, T.C.I.'s senior vice president for programming, stopped by his office to pick up some papers. On his desk was a telegram from ESPN. As of 12:01 A.M., New Year's Day, T.C.I. was to cease carrying ESPN everywhere in the country -- unless Malone's company agreed to a huge rate increase. T.C.I. had no choice. It paid, and passed the increase along to its subscribers.
 As the year wore on, the credit markets fell into a steep decline; the savings and loan crisis and the growing disarray in commercial banking had caught up to cable. During the 80's, fueled in no small part by Malone's shopping spree, the per-subscriber market price of a cable system had risen from $998 in 1983 to $2,328 in 1989.
 But with Federal bank examiners now looking with great disfavor on leveraged transactions, the money spigot was shut off. Malone had anticipated this situation by arranging for nearly a billion dollars' worth of credit, but he is no longer in a mood to deal.cw0
 "The Government is fishing for tuna and catching porpoises," he says. "Federal examiners are running around in a panic. You can't do an acquisition or a refinancing in the media industry today in the United States." Other types of deals were still possible, however, as Malone demonstrated in September, when he agreed to carry Fox Broadcasting -- the "fourth network" -- on all his systems. In essence, the deal makes T.C.I. the first formal network-broadcast affiliate in cable history.
 But by early November, Malone's attempt to buy 50 percent of Viacom International's pay-TV programming networks -- Showtime and The Movie Channel -- had been inexplicably stalled for months at the Federal Trade Commission. Malone was giving serious consideration to withdrawing his offer.
 He was also conspicuously absent as a bidder for the 20 percent share of ESPN that RJR Nabisco had placed on the block, and which the Hearst Corporation bought last month. "I can't understand why anybody would want to own 20 percent of a controlled company," Malone says of ESPN, the other 80 percent of which is owned by Capital Cities/ABC. "The other reason is that Tom Murphy [the chairman of Capital Cities/ABC] said we weren't an acceptable bidder."
CONGRESSMEN MAY have difficulty counting money, but they can count voters with astonishing accuracy. And while cable deregulation had been a boon for Malone and the industry, it had been decidedly less popular with the citizenry. "I'm hearing from the people," says Senator John C. Danforth, the Missouri Republican and ranking minority member of the Senate Commerce Committee.
 The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, has found that, since deregulation, the nation's 9,000 cable systems have raised rates for basic, bare-bones cable service an average of 43 percent. The average, though, masks the extremes, such as in Denver, where T.C.I. is a partner in the system. Between 1986 and 1989, the fee for basic service increased sevenfold in the Mile High City.
 "People think they're being gouged," says Danforth. "They think that service is deteriorating. They think the cable companies are monopolies." During the 1989-90 Congressional session, the impulse to reregulate cable became, for Malone and his industry colleagues, a dangerously nonpartisan issue. In June, the Senate Commerce Committee approved a bill that would have given the F.C.C. power to regulate basic cable rates and monitor prices for so-called premium services. In September, the full House passed its own, similar version of the legislation. In a transparent move, Malone and other cable operators responded by creating a new service tier, called "enhanced basic," that would place certain channels -- such as MTV and ESPN, traditionally part of the basic package -- beyond the reach of the House bill.
 Although adamantly opposed to the very idea of legislation, Malone portrays himself as a cable industry statesman. As a member of the executive committee for the politically powerful lobbying group, the National Cable Television Association, he says, "I've consistently voted with the N.C.T.A. majority in its attempts to accept a reasonable bill. But we have been skeptical from the beginning." Even so, "at the last minute, we encouraged Tim Wirth to try and negotiate a resolution."
 When the bill reached the Senate floor, Wirth criticized the legislation as going "far beyond" a simple redressing of consumer complaints. His opposition effectively stalled the bill. Subsequently, however, Wirth reached an eleventh-hour compromise with Senator Albert Gore Jr., the Tennessee Democrat whose constituents were particularly outraged over sudden rate hikes by their system operator, U.S. Cable.
 The sticking point between the two Senators had been a provision restricting the ability of cable companies to block the sale of programming to satellite broadcasters and microwave-transmission companies; Gore favored this provision, but it was intolerable to Wirth's constituent, John Malone. Wirth and Gore agreed that cable companies could retain exclusive rights to programming, so long as they did not "unreasonably" impede competition.
 In the end, opposition from the White House, which wanted no reregulation whatever, combined with the all-consuming budget crisis to prevent a cable bill from being passed -- this year.
 With the industry's legislative future in doubt, it is perhaps no coincidence that Malone recently, if belatedly, discovered the virtues of customer service. Telephones will be answered, T.C.I. has announced; repairmen will keep their appointments. And the company has begun replacing its coaxial-cable trunk lines with optical fiber, which will improve the signal and allow for a substantial increase in the number of channels.
 In October, T.C.I. also began running corporate-image TV spots on its cable systems and on broadcast stations in the company's biggest markets. The warm-and-fuzzy ads are in the tradition of the "morning in America" spots that were so effective for President Reagan during his 1984 campaign -- and, in fact, were produced by the same ad agency, Hal Riney & Partners.
The T.C.I. ads interweave traditional family values with a cable-is-good-for-America theme. In one spot, as the screen shows a child on a tricycle, then a young woman in her wedding gown, the announcer intones a subliminal anti-reregulation theme: "We all grow up -- never fast enough for some, and yet altogether too fast for others."
 Malone's board in October approved his idea to spin off T.C.I.'s minority investments in cable systems and programming -- except for Turner Broadcasting and the Discovery Channel -- into a new company to be called the Liberty Media Corporation. If and when the plan is implemented, T.C.I. would still largely control Liberty and its assets, which analysts have valued as high as $3 billion. Moreover, T.C.I. could always buy it back if the atmosphere improved.
 It "would be logical to assume," says Malone, that he hoped the spinoff would make the F.T.C. see the proposed Showtime transaction in a more favorable light. It might also serve to make T.C.I. look less monolithic in the eyes of key Congressmen.
 But on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers will return next month, Malone's antagonists remain grim and unforgiving. "In January, this thing is going to come back on T.C.I. and its pals with a vengeance," says Roy Neel, chief of staff to Senator Gore. "They have done everything in their power to stifle and kill competition. Next year, it will catch up with them. This arrogant chicken is about to come home to roost."

HEADLINE: Commercial Brokers Striving to Survive

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
HOW do brokerages survive in a sagging market for commercial real estate? In the present downturn, some of the largest offices in the county have closed, including all those of Coldwell Banker and the Helmsley Companies. But other brokers, if not prospering, are at least coping, often by learning new strategies to take advantage of the opportunities that do exist.
 "We're in for hard times that are bound to get even worse, because we haven't hit the bottom yet," said Carl Austin, head of Austin Corporate Properties in Tarrytown, the commercial brokerage concern he founded 25 years ago. "The market may not recover for another four or five years." 
 In the county, Mr. Austin said, overbuilding has produced so much office space that there has to be a psychological adjustment to bridge the gap between what owners are asking and what buyers or renters are willing to pay. "And that won't come until the banks start foreclosing," he said. "Bank foreclosures act as a catalyst, and the smart money then will be able to cash in on some tremendous opportunities that are out there."
But the opportunity has to be created, Mr. Austin emphasized. "I compare the market to a mountain that has to be scaled, right now. In the 80's, it was an easy staircase up to the top. Now we have to carve out niches and gain footholds. It's not an impossible procedure. It can be done."
 
County Regarded Favorably
 Normal leasing activity has fallen off, with vacancy rates in Westchester at more than 20 percent for the second year. "Significant lease commitments have been made, however," Mr. Austin said, "and will continue to come -- primarily from relocating companies in New York City who are looking at Westchester more favorably because of economic conditions in the city.
He said his firm was also looking for new areas of business. "We're taking a look at the retail industry, for instance, in which we haven't been active since the 70's, when we were the brokers in the sale of land to Bergdorf Goodman. Just recently, we completed a deal for the sale of a two-acre parcel of land that will be incorporated into the Nordstrum Fashion Mall in White Plains."
More joint ventures and more consulting work are all part of doing business in the 90's, Mr. Austin said. "The ability to adjust to the times is absolutely critical," he said.
"This market has forced us to develop different aspects of our business, which I expect will stand us in good stead when the upturn comes. For instance, we've been making studies of the development potential of properties for several corporations, and the blueprint for activity will already be laid."
Although 11,000 real estate agents in the state have given up their licenses, and many commercial brokerages have left the field, others have changed direction and stayed in the industry.
Take Harold Wagner, for example. Mr. Wagner, a former head of a commercial brokerage company in White Plains, saw the handwriting on the wall right after the stock market plunge of October 1987, when, he said, he felt it was time to "become a player instead of a coach."
"I decided to close my brokerage company that employed eight brokers and to become a real estate consultant to corporations," said Mr. Wagner, who heads the Wagner Group in Bedford Hills. "And what has happened is that as companies downsize, one of the first things they let go is their in-house real estate departments. So in essence I fill that gap. I become the company's real estate department, either on a fee arrangement or a commission."
 
Opportunities for Mavericks
 Mr. Wagner said the soft commercial real estate market was full of opportunities for a "maverick like me."
Mr. Wagner, who took charge of the relocation of the Municipal Bond Insurance Association from its rented offices in White Plains to its new corporate headquarters building in Armonk, said:
"M.B.I.A. had a great opportunity to buy a 100,000-square-foot building in Armonk, ideal for its corporate headquarters. But the problem was it also had five years remaining on its lease in White Plains. And some creative financing had to come into play. So as a precondition of the deal, we made the owner of the Armonk property, who was anxious to sell, take over M.B.I.A.'s remaining lease in White Plains, which he agreed to do. Subsequently he was able to sublet the space. It just shows that he, too, had to be adaptable to make the deal."
Mr. Wagner said he was financially better off now than when he was running a commercial brokerage office. "In a way I'm lucky because I have always been intuitive," he said. "I knew it was time for change. New York City and Westchester have always been pretty well insulated from severe busts, but the S.&L. disaster is broader and deeper than anything that caused the other recessions."
 
Leaving the Helmsley Office
 Jack Pancaldo, head of First Corporation Property Consultants in Purchase, said he also felt intuitive.
"I had been a vice president and the manager of the Helmsley commercial real estate office in White Plains since 1976," Mr. Pancaldo said. "But in January of this year, I had a strong hunch it was time to leave. When I had an opportunity to become a broker/consultant, I took it.
"What happened was that in August, Helmsley closed all its commercial real estate offices and when I left there was no inkling of that. Now, most of the brokers who worked with me at Helmsley are with me again."
 
'It's Not All Black'
 Real estate in the 1990's, Mr. Pancaldo predicted, will require managing brokers to work much more closely with tenants.
"It's not all black," he said. "There are good deals around. A lot of New York companies are taking advantage of them and leaving the city. I know of 18 active transactions in Westchester that involve New York City companies. We're involved in 12 of them, and we're the exclusive agents for 4 of those."
Mr. Pancaldo stressed, however, that "people who are going bottom fishing, looking for absolute bargains, aren't going to find them. No owner is going to make a deal that loses him money."
Speaking about the number of projects now in default in Rockland and Fairfield Counties, John Rostenberg, a principal in Rostenberg/ Doern, a commercial brokerage house with offices in Purchase and Stanford, said: "Developers are walking away from projects in both places. That hasn't happened yet in Westchester."
Mr. Rostenberg also predicted that conditions would get worse before they get better. "We've been in business for 25 years and seen recessions come and go," he said. "Westchester/ Fairfield, with its diverse types of tenants, has pretty well escaped from serious recessions before. But this one, which involves the monetary system, is deeper. It's a time of change.
"A year ago, I predicted one-third of the brokers in Westchester would be gone by year's end. And I was right. I believe the same thing will happen this year, bringing the total number of brokers gone from the market to 60 percent."
Yet, there is business for the brokers who understand the market, Mr. Rostenberg emphasized. "We've noticed that a lot of firms are taking advantage of the times and moving from B space to A space," he said. "And there are leases coming from smaller companies that don't make big news. Tenants are more demanding and owners expect more from brokers in this climate."
Brokers who want to do business in the 1990's, he said, are going to have to work hard. "For one thing, they'll have to screen the financial profiles of prospective tenants very carefully, because the worst thing that can happen to a landlord is to have a tenant default on a lease."
 
Views of Tenants and Owners
 Mr. Rostenberg's office is handling the leasing of 10 Bank Street, the newest office complex in downtown White Plains, as well as the Center at Purchase, and Saxon Woods Office Park.
"Even though rents have come down, it takes longer to find tenants," he said. "But owners are very aggressive. In the better buildings, the trend is to write leases with staggered rentals and automatic step-ups in rent."
But the slump in the economy means that the price of housing and labor and the cost of relocating employees have gone down. "It's made Westchester look even more attractive to companies thinking of leaving New York City," Mr. Rostenberg said. "And that's the good news."

THE NEXT OIL SURPRISE

BYLINE: BY DANIEL YERGIN; Daniel Yergin is the author of "The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power," which will be published this month by Simon & Schuster. He is the president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an international consulting firm.

 BODY:
THE SUDDEN JUMP IN OIL PRICES IN THE aftermath of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait is the most recent of a series of surprises that has, since the early 1970's, shaken not only the world oil market, but the world economy and world politics as well. Each time, after the fact, the evidence has been reviewed and sifted, leaving little doubt that the surprise should not have been so much of a surprise.
Half a year before the October 1973 Yom Kippur War, which led to the Arab oil embargo and the quadrupling of oil prices, Egypt's president, Anwar el-Sadat, was talking aloud about using the "oil weapon" -- this at a time when the oil market was already tightening, eroding the surplus supplies that buffer the market against serious disruption. Early this year, six months before the invasion of Kuwait, the public rhetoric of Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, was becoming increasingly belligerent in tone -- even while the oil market was once again tightening rather rapidly.
Where is the brew of political and economic forces that could produce the next oil surprise? Most eyes are still focused on the Middle East, yet there are good reasons to look elsewhere -- toward the Soviet Union, or whatever that huge land mass will be called a few years from now. What kind of surprise is it likely to be? Will it contribute to a new crisis -- or actually help avert one? 
 Though the fact is little recognized, the Soviet Union is the world's largest oil producer, last year churning out more than twice as much as Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the Soviets are second only to the Saudis as oil exporters. Since the days of the czars, Russia's petroleum industry has had a far-reaching impact on the global economy. And that history holds clues to what may happen in the next decade.
Back in the 1870's, the world oil industry was dominated by one company, John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company of Ohio, and virtually all of the world's supply came not just from one country, the United States, but from a corner of a single state, Pennsylvania. Then the Russian Imperial Government changed the game.
Centuries before, Marco Polo had reported signs of oil in the Caucasus near the port of Baku on the Caspian Sea. In the early 19th century, a tiny, Government-run oil operation developed there, depending not on wells but on hand-dug pits. When the czarist regime eliminated the oil monopoly at the beginning of the 1870's, opening the door to private enterprise, it ignited a burst of investment and development, and there emerged a large, dynamic industry led by the Nobel and Rothschild families. Standard Oil's grip on the world market was broken, never to be regained, and by 1898 Russian oil production actually exceeded that of the United States. Therein lies one clue to the future.
Another clue is to be found in the Russian Revolution of 1905, which in the oil region primarily took the form of an ethnic civil war. The Moslem Tatars -- today generally known as Azerbaijanis -- rose up in rebellion, slaughtering Christian Armenians and setting the oil fields ablaze. The upheaval in the Caucasus constituted the world's first major political interruption of the oil supply, long before anyone had ever heard of an "oil weapon," and it threw the global market into turmoil.
Yet a third clue to the future of the Soviet oil industry arises from the 1920's. The new Bolshevik Government, desperate for hard currency, glutted the world market with Russian oil, driving down the price. That inspired the oil tycoons of the day to meet in August 1928 at Achnacarry Castle in Scotland, where they set about creating a worldwide cartel to manage prices and supply. This arrangement -- openly called the As-Is system -- lasted until World War II, and for a time even the Soviets participated.

IN THE LATE 1950's, THE SOVIET UNION, desperate once again for hard currency, launched another, even larger oil export campaign, part of what became known as the Soviet Economic Offensive. Allen W. Dulles, the Director of Central Intelligence, warned President Eisenhower, "The free world faces a quite dangerous situation in the Soviet capacity to dislocate established markets." Senator Kenneth B. Keating, the New York Republican, went even further, declaring: "Khrushchev has threatened to bury us on more than one occasion. It is now become increasingly evident that he would also like to drown us in a sea of oil if we let him get away with it."
In the Soviets' drive to win customers, they took to selling oil at enormous discount. In response, Standard Oil of New Jersey made what turned out to be the most famous oil price cut in history, a 7 percent reduction that amounted to 14 cents a barrel. The oil exporting countries were so furious that they came together in Baghdad in September 1960 and formed the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
The record of past Soviet oil surprises offers some clues to what form the next surprise might take. So does the particular nature of that nation's petroleum industry today.
The Soviet Union's exports of oil and natural gas provide more than 60 percent of its hard-currency earnings, which in turn make it possible to buy the food and technology that keep the beleaguered country afloat. But the Soviet oil industry is in the grip of its own crisis, brought on by inefficiency and low productivity, poor organization and technological backwardness, wasteful expenditure and environmental neglect. "Energy policy has been the single most disruptive factor in Soviet industry since the mid-1970's and one of the leading proximate causes of the downturn and stagnation of Soviet economic growth," according to Thane Gustafson in "Crisis Amid Plenty," his most recent book on the industry. "For the reformers under Mikhail Gorbachev, no other issue of economic policy is so great an obstacle to their plans."
In the late 1970's, to take advantage of higher world oil prices, the Kremlin dramatically increased investment in oil production, actually starving other essential parts of the economy.
On one level, the spurt of investment worked: production continued to climb. But that success came at great cost in terms of wasteful expenditure and distortion of overall investment. And over the last two years, as the Government curtailed its investment in oil production, the effects have been dire. Production has plummeted by almost a million barrels a day since 1988, an 8 percent decline. The Soviet Union has been able to maintain its exports to the hard-currency West only because it has cut supplies to Eastern Europe -- and because the deeply depressed Soviet economy is using less oil.
Yet even that level of production will be hard to sustain. The Soviet oil industry is suffering from the same internal disorder and, indeed, demoralization that afflict the society as a whole. In western Siberia, where two-thirds of Soviet oil is now produced, massive unrest among oil workers, including the threat of a general strike, jeopardizes the operations of the petroleum industry. Moreover, the uncertainty over who currently controls oil resources -- Moscow or the would-be independent republics -- adds to the chaos.
Ethnic conflict represents another threat to oil production. Last year, a civil war between Azerbaijanis and Armenians led to bloody violence that was startlingly similar to that of 1905 -- except it was acted out with automatic weapons, not single-action rifles. Azerbaijan is not, as it was in those days, a center for oil production. It is, however, the main service and supply center for the nation's oil fields.
Two months ago, Moscow ordered an emergency allocation of $1 billion in hard currency to try to stem the production decline and reduce industry unrest. Still, based upon current trends, Soviet production could easily fall by another 1 million to 1.5 million barrels a day by mid-decade. And unless the oil requirements of the Soviet domestic economy are miraculously trimmed, that shortfall in production will come out of Soviet exports. If that reduction in world supply occurs at the wrong time, it could send prices spiraling upward again, renewing pressure on an already strained global market.
In other words, the next oil surprise could be a repeat of the past, complete with soaring gasoline prices and long lines at the gas pumps -- and with the Soviet Union playing the role previously reserved for the Middle East.

YET EVENTS COULD move in quite a different direction. Back in the 19th century, the breaking of the czarist Government's monopoly in the oil region and the introduction of Western capital and technology led to the development of the modern oil industry. Today, the Communist Government's monopoly is being broken, and the industry is once again eager to attract Western money and know-how.
Many Western companies are already actively seeking exploration and production opportunities, though they find themselves hindered by the political conflicts, confusions and uncertainties that characterize the entire Soviet system today. In some cases, even when the companies receive approvals from Moscow and the individual republics, they still run into environmental opposition from local groups. Yet the companies seem determined to drive ahead, convinced that the various governments in the Soviet Union will eventually remove most obstacles to foreign participation.
So the next Soviet oil surprise might be a sharp drop in production and exports in the next few years -- or, later in the decade, a sharp rise in production and exports. Perhaps both scenarios will take place -- yet another surprise! If the political situation there stabilizes, and Western companies are permitted to operate on a large scale, the Soviet Union could be an even more significant player in the global oil market by the end of the 90's.
In the West, a resurgence of oil exports from a one-time enemy would most likely be accorded a warm welcome -- not least because the increased exports would lessen the world's overdependence on the Middle East.

HEADLINE: Calhoun County Goes Global

BYLINE: BY JON BOWERMASTER; Jon Bowermaster is the co-author, with Will Steger, of "Saving the Earth: A Citizen's Guide to Environmental Action."

 BODY:
FROM HIS THIRD-FLOOR OFFICE, Mike Clayborne looks out over the verdant hills of Calhoun County, Ala., through the haze of a steamy spring afternoon. While the view is distinctly Southern, the conversation is purely global. Now in his second year as president of the local Chamber of Commerce, in Anniston, Clayborne is describing how his community is participating in the world marketplace: competing for branch plants from Southeast Asia, marketing a variety of services across Europe and Asia, selling Alabama-made goods to markets from Norway to Saudi Arabia.
On the credenza behind him sits a small black flag holder, with miniatures of the Stars and Stripes and the Alabama state flag protruding at angles from each side. Between them is the flag of South Korea. While Clayborne holds forth about the county's latest trade mission (to Japan) and the Memphis public relations firm that was recently hired to help promote Calhoun County worldwide, I ask if that little Korean flag is aimed at a particularly ripe prospect. He smiles and reaches into his desk drawer and comes out with a fistful of miniature flags -- from Great Britain, Japan, Finland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Taiwan and a couple of countries he can't identify. "These are key economic development weapons today," he says, brandishing the flags that he picked up for a dollar apiece at a variety store in Gatlinburg, Tenn. 
 "We feel the world's economy is a two-way street," Clayborne says with a determined grimace, "and that there's plenty of room for all of us. If these little flags help one iota, the symbolism is worth every penny."

IT IS HARDLY A SECRET THAT THE WORLD ECONOMY HAS become one big, evolving, complex international bazaar. Chopsticks are made in Minnesota for export to Japan. Schwinn bicycles are made in Hungary; so are G.E. light bulbs and Levi's
jeans. Silos made in North Dakota are cut in half and shipped to Norway as warehouses. Chicken feet -- once the refuse of Virginia poultry fanciers -- are sent to Hong Kong, to be made into soup. In Japan, Mazda manufactures the Ford Probe, partly owned by Ford. It's sold as an American car. "There is no longer such a thing as an 'American economy,' " insists Robert B. Reich, an economist and Harvard professor.
As a result of all this global economic shrinking and booming, industrial development has taken on new twists in places like Calhoun County, Ala. Until recently a slick economic development presentation consisted of sending out a couple of officials with a slide projector to show pictures of vacant industrial land. Today those officials are as likely to be courting new businesses in Cairo as in Chicago.
It used to be that to woo new business to town, Calhoun's leaders would gather prospective investors over tables full of barbecued pork, char-grilled catfish, fried chicken, corn on the cob, coleslaw, fries and an array of spicy sauces at Betty's Bar-B-Q or the Goal Post. They would boast about the county's cheap wages and lack of unions. Today those pitches are more likely to take place over kimchi at one of several local Oriental restaurants.
Yet Calhoun County, Ala., couldn't be more red, white and blue. Giant American flags decorate the water towers across the county; three more hang, hugely, from the rafters of the Quintard Mall. Most offices and front porches boast the Stars and Stripes, and not just on holidays.
The 158-year-old county is wedged into a narrow sluice cut through the foothills of the Appalachians in eastern Alabama; Atlanta lies 90 miles to the east, Birmingham 60 to the west. Between are long stretches of blacktop lined by little but scrub pine, sandy soil and smaller, quieter towns. The biggest employer in the county is the Federal Government: the Army's Fort McClellan pumps more than $300 million a year into the local community, the Anniston Army Depot an additional $260 million. The county's economy has been steeped in small manufacturing since the 1870's: pig iron, textiles and cast-iron pipe have been its backbone. Bass fishing is the biggest participant sport, football and stock-car racing the activities most favored by spectators. There are no liquor sales on Sunday, no parking meters on the wide cement streets of Anniston, the county seat, (population 35,000). This is no new-age suburb -- no "penturbia" nor "micropolitan" -- but small-town America in the deep South.
Despite the pervasive aura of Americana -- from the strip malls to the Stars and Bars -- around every corner in this rural county lie hints of an encroaching world. Five of its bigger manufacturing plants -- employing 10 percent of its work force -- are foreign-owned. Of the top 25 businesses in the county, 20 face stiff foreign competition. Three hundred jobs at Magic Chef are threatened by South Korea's entry into the microwave-oven market. Nearly a third of the local Monsanto plant's output was shut down after the financial instability that ensued from Tiananmen Square. A yellow, red and blue billboard on Highway 21 advertises "Full Gospel Korean Church." The local daily paper has recently hired its own foreign correspondent. At a Hardee's one early recent morning, conversation among several retirees revolved around the best way to pick huckleberries (seated, with a constant eye out for rattlesnakes) and the recent economic turmoil in Georgia. Soviet Georgia.
You might expect the long tentacles of the international economy to have infiltrated New York, Los Angeles and Miami. Yet there may be no better place to illustrate just how drastically the world economy has shrunk in recent years than in rural Alabama. In fact, virtually every town and county in the nation has stepped -- some boldly, some with hesitance -- into this changing marketplace. Many say just in time. From 1984 through March 1989, Japan invested $72 billion in the United States. Between 1987 and 1989, United States imports to Mexico increased by 70 percent, to $24.9 billion. In 1989 the United States sent $79 billion worth of goods to Canada. In Europe, 12 countries are working to create the world's largest common market, with 325 million consumers and a combined gross national product of nearly $5 trillion. Like everybody else, folks in Calhoun County want a piece of the action.
Competing in this new world mart is arduous, especially in Alabama. Most foreign investors know all about California and New York. Many think Atlanta is a state. But when it comes to Alabama, they generally think first of George Wallace, not exactly a selling point. The state ranks near the bottom in many categories deemed necessary to lure investment -- safe environment, good education, sound economy. Yet despite such apparent roadblocks to economic growth, Alabama has more than 190 foreign-based manufacturing investments from 22 nations, and finances three overseas development offices, in Tokyo, Seoul, and Eschborn, Germany.

BEYOND THE BORDERS of Calhoun County there is a feeling that it may soon be too late for some American industries to jump into the increasingly crowded global marketplace. As a result, some experts insist, American industry -- and government -- must make this new game a priority. Yet the question persists in many quarters: Is this a good thing? The answer is: It is unavoidable and inevitable.
"New technologies of worldwide communication and transportation have redrawn the playing field," Robert Reich says. "American industries no longer compete against Japanese or European industries. Rather, a company with headquarters in the United States, production facilities in Taiwan, and a marketing force spread across many nations competes with another, similarly ecumenical company."
Reich says places like Calhoun County are ripe for inclusion in this marketplace if they act now. "The new economy operates on a smaller scale and is far better suited to rural environments," he insists, but cautions that rural America must shift its dependence from productions of low-value, high-volume products like grain and simple manufactured goods to high-tech manufacturing services.
Others believe that sending local chamber representatives out after foreign investment is a boondoggle that brings little improvement to local economies. Carol Conway, deputy director of the Southern Growth Policies Board, says Calhoun's leaders should leave such tasks up to people with more experience: there are now a multitude of state and Federal agencies that specialize in working with foreign investors. "Even if they do get face to face with a potential foreign client, are they up on global policy enough to not insult their audience?" Conway wonders. "Do they understand foreign protocol? Not even a lot of state international development offices are as knowledgeable as they should be."
There are also pros and cons to the methods used to attract foreign investment, whether it be the sale of an existing business or a new branch operation. "The pros are -- especially with the Japanese -- you are bound to have fresh investment, not just mergers and acquisitions," Conway says. "It also gives an international flavor to the community, which we desperately need. The cons are dependent upon how you attract them, what you're promising them. If you're promising tax breaks that last for years and years, that's hardly the best use of public funds."
Reich says: "The mistake often made by local chambers of commerce and state governors when drumming up business is that they focus only on the number of jobs, not the quality of jobs. Attracting Volkswagen or Honda to set up a facility nearby employing 5,000 routine assembly-line jobs at a cost of $5 million in tax abatements may not be a great accomplishment.
"Ultimately for a British, Dutch or Japanese company to come into town isn't necessarily better or worse than a California or Massachusetts company. If they bring good jobs, build up the ability of the work force, this type of 'foreign' investment is probably a big plus. But if jobs are unskilled or routine, and fail to add new skills, the investment may ultimately cause small towns to suffer in the long run." Another generation of assembly-line workers is not what we need.
Not everyone in Alabama thinks jumping into the global marketplace is a good idea. June Collier, president and chairman of National Industries, a $124-million-a-year auto parts company based in the state capital, Montgomery, is a loud critic of United States companies who allow themselves to be bought by foreigners: "The first thing I would advise these 'leaders' is that they are derelict in their duty if they don't realize they are selling out our country." Once foreign companies have bought American businesses, Collier insists, they'll start using economic leverage to control politics and government. She would like to see a law that aims at shutting down foreign investment in the United States. "If you're not a citizen of this country," she says, "you should not be able to buy anything you can't take home with you."
Harvard's Reich maintains that Collier is out of step: "Whether she realizes it or not, we are all part of a global economy. Money is now international. It can be passed by a flick of a button from nation to nation. To try to put barriers across borders is as foolish as it fruitless."

BLUE MOUNTAIN (population 250) sits smack in the heart of Calhoun County. Its frame houses are crumbling and peeling; their predominantly black residents are old, veterans of decades of factory and field work.
The focal point of the tiny village is Blue Mountain Industries, a 93-year-old manufacturer of yarn, twine, rope and other textiles. Its sprawling red-brick plant has tin roofs and metal awnings. The whir of machinery drifts from inside the plant, through large windows open to the spring breeze. Behind, in an overgrown field, are two horseshoe pitches, a long-abandoned backstop and rickety bleachers. In front, an American flag waves against a bright blue sky.
The absentee owner of Blue Mountain Industries is Hanson Trust Ltd., a $12.5 billion British conglomerate that bought the mill in 1975 (the company's third foreign owner). Hanson owns many businesses in many countries -- Blue Mountain is just one in its portfolio. But according to Blue Mountain's president, Al Rothwell, who has been with the company since the 1950's, it makes little difference to Calhoun County who owns the company, as long as it stays profitable. The pluses of foreign ownership? "You never have a cash crunch; there are plenty of dollars in hard times," he told The Anniston Star, the local newspaper. The downside? "When you're with a conglomerate, everything's for sale."
Blue Mountain Industries is just one of five foreign-owned manufacturers in Calhoun County. Defense Research Inc., a small-weapons-component maker, was sold to a West German defense contractor in May 1989. Jenkins Manufacturing Company, which sells wood and steel doors, has been owned by a British hardware manufacturer since 1987. Three Southern Ready-Mix plants are owned by a leading Finnish construction-materials maker. Southern Tool Inc., employer of 410, is owned by a $350-million-a-year British-based company, Triplex Lloyd.
County leaders expect that more home-grown manufacturers will sell out to foreign companies in the next few years, keeping pace with a national trend: the Bureau of Economic Analysis in Washington reports that in 1988, 24,460 non-bank companies in the United States were partly owned by foreign investors. The reasons for selling are varied but simple: sales bring expansion capital, openings to new markets and provide a base for further investment.
H. M. (Mack) Burt Jr. is chairman and chief executive officer of Southern Tool. A native of nearby Talladega, he has been with the company since 1968, and rose through the ranks until he was made a group vice president in 1979, charged with overseeing the Calhoun County factory, three plants in Atlanta and one in Scotland. In 1983 he put together a leveraged buyout of the precision castings maker. A year ago he closed the deal that sold the company to the British. Today a Union Jack flies briskly in the breeze in front of his factory.
Why did he sell and run the risk of raising local ire from businessmen who would prefer to see industry in town remain home-grown? "In late 1987 I could see that we were reaching the end of our ability to finance our own growth," says Burt, relaxing in a leather chair in his company's Oxford, Ala., headquarters. "Receivables and inventory were both up and cash had disappeared. But I could see there was still room to grow. We had to either borrow more money -- which venture capitalists are against -- or find another investor. And this one was not to be a financial play, but a strategic one."
With the help of a regional brokerage firm, Burt began looking for a buyer. "We had been approached by companies, most from the United States, but the chemistry just wasn't there. Then Triplex Lloyd surfaced. They wanted to establish a presence in the U.S., and they wanted a base company to build from." Burt checked them out, while they pored over his books. The deal was signed in July 1989. They have already assigned him the task of searching out more American businesses to buy, while the sale has opened doors for Southern Tool across Europe and given Burt $2 million or $3 million to invest in expansion.
Burt and Southern Tool are emblematic of one kind of cross-border investment -- selling existing businesses -- that has become prevalent across the United States. But many local governments are still making efforts to entice foreign investors to build new plants and branch operations in their town. Perhaps the most inventive -- some would say outlandish -- toolCalhoun County leaders are using to attract such investment is a planned Japanese school. Spearheading that effort is A. W. Bolt, a lawyer who attended Jacksonville State and has practiced in town since 1977.
Silver-haired and patrician, Bolt gets red-faced with frustration when talking about the forces that have compelled the town to go to such economic-development lengths. "We're just trying to play the game according to the rules that others have made," Bolt says. "If American industry continues to have the philosophy of 'Let's don't make it, let's just sell it,' and continues to try to make the easy buck on the sell -- if foreign countries are the only people who've got the guts and the know-how and the capital to manufacture, then they may be our ultimate saviors. So far we've found foreign investors to be right good citizens and we're glad they're here."
The Japanese school had its origins in one of the Chamber of Commerce missions to the Far East. "We found," Bolt says, "that one concern of Japanese businesses was that the executives they would send to America would bring their families, and their children's education would suffer by comparison to their peers back home. They were concerned they would be out of sync with language, math and the discipline the Japanese use in their educational system."
Based on those concerns, other communities in the United States have started "Saturday schools" -- classes intended to keep young Japanese students on a par with their competition back home. As an enticement to potential Japanese investors, a group of Calhoun County leaders raised $20,000, secured space at Jacksonville State, purchased textbooks and lined up a teacher. Now all they need are students. Clayborne, the chamber president, insists a Japanese company is one of his most desired goals -- nearly 6,000 Alabamians already work for Japanese-owned businesses, but none yet in his backyard.
While attempts to attract foreign investment get a lot of attention, many of Calhoun County's businesses have already plunged deeply into the changing marketplace. Ribbon, pool tables, twine, ball bearings, pumps, auto carpets, lumber, jet engine components, lamps, children's clothing -- all are made in Calhoun County and sold overseas from Scotland to Saudi Arabia. Steve Lopiano at Samson Cordage Works sells braided rope in Japan. Jim Ulrey at Southern Metal Processing licenses his company's technology across Europe. Roy Hathorn, chairman of R & J Machinery in Anniston, has sold his foundry equipment in 16 different countries since 1961, and is in the process of importing Chinese-made tractors for sale in the United States and elsewhere. "International sales could easily be 100 percent of our business one day," he says.
Trying to educate the local community about the changing world around it is the responsibility in part of The Anniston Star, published and edited by H. Brandt Ayers. His grandfather was an early publisher of the county's first paper, The Daily Hot Blast, which was founded in 1883; the paper's motto was: "Three essentials of a good home -- 1. Pure Air; 2. Good water; 3. A salubrious climate." Ayers knows that if his hometown is to prosper, that motto must be stretched to include "international understanding."
Ayers has been involved in foreign affairs all his life. His grandfather sold the paper to become the first Southern Baptist missionary to China. When his father, Col. Harry Ayers, returned to Anniston and bought the paper back, his own worldly philosophy was wrapped up in the warning he gave his two children over the nightly dinner table: "He who fails to take heed of problems far away will soon find trouble near at hand."
As a result of that early indoctrination, The Star includes an abundance of foreign coverage. Recently, Ayers hired a reporter to work half time covering local business, and the other half traveling the world reporting economic and social stories from a Calhoun County perspective. "It's a world that's gotten very, very small," he says, "and if we're going to try and deal with it, we've got to know the competition. What they're thinking, what their lives are like. What we want our guy to send back are Ernie Pyle-like stories. I want him to go to Korea, to a microwave plant, and ask them if they give a damn about Magic Chef in Anniston. I want him to give us a glimpse of that worker's life, so that we can better understand the competition. We can't wait to get that news from other news organizations, it'll be too late."

CALHOUN COUNTY recently had good economic news -- namely, that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's proposal to shut down 35 military bases (one of which was Fort McClellan) has been shelved. People are also less concerned about the possibility of layoffs at the county's biggest employer, the Anniston Army Depot. The future of the nation's only Army base for rebuilding tanks has brightened considerably since troops and tanks were sent to Saudi Arabia.
Yet, if in years to come, defense budgets are slashed, the price of peace could still cost Calhoun County jobs. Elmer Wheatley, economic development guru of the Anniston Chamber, insists that now is the time to diversify the local economy by whatever means necessary. He is convinced that foreign investment is the county's ultimate economic savior, and that ultimately what is good for the businessman's pocket will prove good for the community at large. Wheatley points out his window where a pair of window washers dangle three stories above the sidewalk. "See these guys? They don't care who owns the businesses, as long as they get their paycheck every week, can stop at the Quik Mart on their way home and get a six-pack and watch the Atlanta Braves win a couple times a week on the tube."
For all the fast-coming economic changes, Calhoun County's leaders insist they are optimistic about the future. "There are only two basic human tendencies, fight or flight," A. W. Bolt says. "I think communities are much the same way. Most people in this community love it here. They're going to stay and fight."
And if in the next decade 50 percent or more of the local populace is employed by companies with foreign flags flying proudly in front of their Alabama plants, will Calhoun County have won the fight? "Probably," Bolt says with a frown. "Probably."

HEADLINE: Make Fuel Efficiency Our Gulf Strategy

BYLINE: By Amory B. Lovins and L. Hunter Lovins; Amory B. Lovins and L. Hunter Lovins are director of research and executive director of the Rocky Mountain Institute, an energy policy organization.

DATELINE: SNOWMASS, Colo.

 BODY:
Are we putting our kids in tanks because we didn't put them in efficient cars? Yes: We wouldn't have needed any oil from the Persian Gulf after 1985 if we'd simply kept on saving oil at the rate we did from 1977 through 1985.
Even now we could still roll back the oil dependence that perpetually holds our foreign policy hostage and distorts other U.S. priorities in the Middle East. Just by aiming at greater efficiency, we could eliminate all gulf imports by using only an eighth less oil. 
 A great place to start would be personal vehicles. Improving America's 19-mile-per-gallon household vehicle fleet by three miles per gallon could replace U.S. imports of oil from Iraq and Kuwait. Another nine miles per gallon would end the need for any oil from the Persian Gulf and, according to the Department of Energy, would cut the cost of driving to well below pre-crisis levels without sacrificing performance.
The Reagan Administration doubled 1985 oil imports from the gulf when it rolled back efficiency standards. Today's new cars average 29 miles per gallon; the fleet, only 20. Yet 10 manufacturers have built and tested attractive, low-pollution prototype cars that get 67 to 138 miles per gallon. Better design and stronger materials make some of these safer than today's cars, as well as more nimble and peppy.
And efficiency needn't mean smallness: only 4 percent of past car-efficiency gains came from downsizing. Some of the prototype cars comfortably hold four or five passengers, and two of them are said to cost nothing extra to build.
Many other oil savings can help. Boeing's new 777 jet will use about half the fuel per seat of a 727. Technical refinements can save most of the fuel used by heavy trucks, buses, ships and industry. Insulation, draftproofing and simple hot-water savings can displace most of the oil used in buildings. Superwindows that retain heat in winter and reject it in summer could save each year up to twice as much fuel as we get from Alaska.
In all, we know how to run the present U.S. economy on one-fifth the oil we are now using and the cost of saving each barrel would be less than $5. Even achieving just 15 percent of that potential oil savings would displace all the oil we've been importing from the gulf. Doing that requires only a small additional step. Since 1973, we've reduced our oil use per dollar of gross national product four and a half times as much as we'd need to reduce it today in order to eliminate all gulf imports.
How can we promote fuel efficiency? Higher gasoline taxes are a weak incentive to buy an efficient car, because gasoline costs four times less than the non-fuel costs of owning and running a car. And, since the often higher purchase price of an efficient car about cancels out the lower gasoline bills, the total cost per mile for 20- and 60- mile-per-gallon cars is about the same.
But the 40-mile-per-gallon difference represents more than twice America's imports from the gulf. If the security and environmental costs of inefficient cars had to be paid up front, buyers would choose more wisely. The best way is "feebates." When you register a new car, you pay a fee or get a rebate, depending on its efficiency. The fees would pay for the rebates.
Rebates for efficient cars should be based on the difference in efficiency between your new car and the old one -- which you'd scrap -- thus getting the most inefficient, dirtiest cars off the road first. That's good for Detroit, for the poor, for the environment and for displacing gulf oil sooner.
The California legislature recently approved car feebates by a margin of 7 to 1; Connecticut, Iowa and Massachusetts are weighing them. Feebates are also being considered for new buildings in California, Massachusetts and the four northwestern states and could be applied to trucks, aircraft, appliances and other energy-consuming goods. Unlike miles-per-gallon standards, feebates reward maximum performance and encourage businesses to bring superefficient models to market.
Energy efficiency is also the key to the decades-long transition to nondepleting, uninterruptible energy sources. Government studies confirm that sun, wind, water, geothermal heat and farm and forestry wastes can cost-effectively provide, within 40 years, half as much energy as America uses today. Efficiency would raise that share and buy the time needed for graceful conversion.
The military alternative to energy efficiency isn't cheap. Gulf jitters have added more than $40 billion a year to U.S. oil imports. Counting military costs, gulf oil now costs in excess of $100 a barrel.
The roughly $20 billion net cost of U.S. forces in the gulf just from August through December 1990, if spent instead on efficient use of oil, could displace all the oil now imported from the gulf. It could also create jobs and wealth, improve America's trade balance, stretch domestic reserves, clean urban air, cut acid rain and global warming and help the poor at home and abroad.
In 1989, the Pentagon used about 38 percent as much oil as the U.S. imported from Saudi Arabia, and estimated that its consumption could readily double or triple in a war. An M-1 tank gets 0.56 miles per gallon. An oil-fired aircraft carrier gets 17 feet per gallon. And no good outcome, in dollars, oil or blood, is in sight.
But from inside an efficient car, the gulf looks very different. From inside enough of them, its oil becomes irrelevant. National security, peacetime jobs in a competitive economy and the environment demand immediate mobilization -- not of tanks but of efficient cars, not of B-52s but of 777's, not of naval guns but of caulk guns.

HEADLINE: Doubts About Magnetic Train Mount

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your "Sakaigawa Journal" on Japan's planned 27-mile test track for superconductive magnetically levitated trains (Nov. 8) is a good description of the maglev project but fails to take account of its dangers and rising public resistance to it.
The highly respected Japan Environment Monitor (partly funded by the Toyota Foundation) notes that "while proponents of the maglev see this super express traveling at 350 m.p.h. aiding a booming economy with speed and convenience, they do not see the energy waste, environmental destruction and possible damage from nonionizing radiation." 
 Prof. Kawabata Toshio, the first to do research leading to the maglev and known as the father of the maglev, is now firmly against it. His chief criticism is its enormous waste of energy in a period of declining energy resources. Japan's railway system acknowledges that the maglev will consume at least three times as much power per passenger as the old bullet train (shinkansen); some critics say up to 40 times.
Unlike conventional trains, the maglev will carry little or no freight. Standing room will be far more limited because there are dangers involved in standing in the aisles at 350 miles per hour.
Dr. Nakahara Hideomi, a geneticist at Yamanashi Medical University, believes there is a problem "that affects everyone -- possible gene damage from electromagnetic radiation resulting in cancer and birth defects. They must clearly show that the radiation will not affect our genes or the fetus of a pregnant woman."
Grass-roots opposition began in Yamanashi Prefecture, where the experimental line will be built. The main opposition group is the Blue Sky Society led by Ueno Sakaru. It is coalescing with movements opposing nuclear power and dams. A national rally was held in Tokyo in October.
The Germans are working on a similar maglev. The United States, given its attitude toward mass transportation, has no plans now for such a project. It is important that Americans should be aware of the potential dangers that may arise if the United States undertakes a magnet-type train.

HEADLINE: Ex-Vernon Owner Testifies

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DALLAS, Dec. 2

 BODY:
The former owner of the Vernon Savings Association, Don R. Dixon, has testified at his bank fraud trial that the savings institution courted risky commercial loans to help it out of a financial slump.
Mr. Dixon, who is 50 years old, said on Friday that economic reasons were also behind Vernon's decision to seek new financial markets in California, where prosecutors contend that the institution's money was used to pay for two beach houses and prostitutes. 
 Mr. Dixon was indicted on 38 counts of conspiracy, misapplication of funds, making false statements and other crimes. If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to as long as 190 years in prison and fined as much as $9.5 million.
Federal regulators say Vernon's failure in 1987 cost taxpayers an estimated $1.3 billion.
Under questioning by his lawyer, Bill Ravkind, Mr. Dixon testified that he knew after acquiring Vernon in 1982 that he would have to go after risky commercial loans instead of safer investments to help the institution survive.
"Vernon financially was in the hole," Mr. Dixon said. "We were perfectly aware that to get out of the hole, we had to make those high-yield loans."
During Mr. Dixon's trial, which has lasted six weeks, prosecution witnesses have accused him of using money from Vernon for prostitutes, political contributions and the lease of a $2 million house in Solana Beach, Calif.
Mr. Dixon is scheduled to resume his testimony on Monday. Lawyers said closing arguments could take place late this week.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Rise Predicted

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The nation's unemployment rate could rise past 6 percent next year, the White House's chief economist said Friday.
Joblessness is not, however, likely to reach "anything as massive" as what occurred in previous recessions, said Michael Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
"Unemployment could rise to the low- to mid-sixes next year," he said in a speech to the Japan Society.
The nation's unemployment rate stood at 5.7 percent in both October and September of this year. In 1982, during the last recession, it peaked at 10.8 percent.
Mr. Boskin declined to comment on November employment figures, which are scheduled to be released next Friday.
He said the economy was currently under strain because of higher oil prices as well as more restrictive bank lending. Oil prices should decline in the second half of 1991, he said.

HEADLINE: Profit Decline Projected For Chemical Industry

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Hard hit by the cost increases brought about by the crisis in the Middle East and by overcapacity at home, the American chemical industry will see its after-tax profits fall this year for the first time since 1985, the industry's trade association has reported.
The report, released over the weekend by the Chemical Manufacturers Association, forecast that after-tax profits this year would total between $19 billion and $22.5 billion, down from $24.8 billion last year. The chemical industry has been one of the most profitable in the recent years and has seen robust growth in earnings in each of the last five years. Industry profits have climbed steadily from $9.5 billion in 1985. 
 But higher crude oil prices in the second half of this year have begun to affect prices for products that are important components in making chemicals, and chemical manufacturers have not been able to pass along all of those higher costs to their customers.
The association, which compiled its information in part from a survey of its members, predicted that sales for the industry would rise 3 percent this year, to $263 billion, and that continued high exports would contribute to that increase. The association represents about 90 percent of the nation's chemical manufacturers.
"This is a period of profitless prosperity in the chemical industry," said Anantha K. S. Raman, president of Anantha Raman & Company, an investment firm based in Parsippany, N.J., that specializes in the chemical industry. "Demand is very strong and people are buying hand over fist. On the other hand, there is the assumption on the part of buyers that the economy has slowed and that the buyer is in control and not the seller."
Allen J. Lenz, chief economist with the Washington-based trade association, said, "It's safe to say that there will be instances where we won't be able to pass cost increases on."
Higher costs have been a particular problem for chemical manufacturers since the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on Aug. 2. For example, the price of naphtha, a product that comes out of refineries and is used in making propylene, ethylene and benzene, has soared from $160 a metric ton before the invasion to $320 a metric ton. And there have been similar increases in the spot prices of other products like benzene, a key ingredient of plastic packaging, and xylene, a chemical used as an octane enhancer and an important ingredient in making plastic bottles.
The report forecasts the operating rates in the nation's chemical plants will average 81.7 percent of capacity this year, down from 83.4 percent in 1989. The report says members of the association forecast that operating rates will fall to an average of 80.7 percent next year.
 
Increase in Capital Spending
 Still, the report stated that chemical manufacturers planned to increase their capital spending by 13 percent, from $20.8 billion in 1990. The 1990 figure was up slightly from last year's level. Also, research and development spending is projected to reach a record $12.7 billion in 1990, up from 11.7 billion last year.
"The chemical industry has been heavily buffeted this year by downward economic pressures at home and unexpected raw material increases brought on by the Iraqi invasion," Mr. Lenz said. "Still, the industry has shown itself to be remarkably resilient in 1990, and this bodes well for the future."
Employment in the chemical industry posted a small gain this year, with an average 1.08 million jobs, up slightly from 1.07 million last year.

HEADLINE: A.T.&T. Strained by a Success

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company's Universal card has been a bigger success than the company ever anticipated -- and that is exactly the problem.
Consumer demand for the card was so heavy after its introduction in March that A.T.& T. was unprepared to handle the millions of applications. The result was delays, billing errors and other problems that irritated some customers and led some to cancel their cards. 
 The company says the problems have been solved -- partly because it has reduced advertising and let demand drop. But the card remains a big success, with 4.1 million accounts opened in just eight months. Only Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Bank of America and First Chicago have more bank credit card accounts in use.
Analysts attribute the fast start largely to A.T.& T.'s guarantee that it will never charge an annual fee to anyone who applies for the card in 1990 and uses it at least once a year. Tomorrow, the company plans to announce whether it will extend that offer. Credit card industry experts expect a short extension, possibly combined with a slight tightening of rules, such as requiring that cards issued after Dec. 31 be used twice a year to avoid fees.
The Universal card is a Mastercard or Visa credit card combined with an A.T.& T. Calling Card. Consumers can use it to buy merchandise and make long-distance telephone calls at a 10 percent discount off A.T.& T.'s regular rates. Merchandise charges may be paid off in monthly installments, at an annual interest rate now at 18.9 percent, roughly the industry average. All telephone charges are required to be paid in full each month.
A.T.& T.'s growth has not gone unchallenged. Its rivals from both the charge-card and long-distance industries have scrambled to come up with countermeasures and form new marketing alliances. On Friday, Visa U.S.A., a trade group of banks that oversees the Visa credit card program, announced that it was temporarily banning financial institutions owned by nonbanking companies from setting up Visa card programs.
The president of A.T.& T.'s Universal card unit said in a recent interview that he has been seriously considering buying or setting up a special credit card bank to run the Universal program. Friday's ban, which will last until June 4, 1991, could represent a considerable obstacle.
 
Ran Out of Blanks
 Some snags were inevitable in starting an entirely new business and quickly setting up such a large organization, said David Robertson, a vice president of the Nilson Report, a credit card newsletter based in Santa Monica, Calif. "Once this initial 'getting out of the gate' process is over, they'll settle down," he said.
But along the way, A.T.& T. ran out of blank cards in August. As a result, customers who applied for the card in July had to wait up to a month for delivery, twice as long as the company's goal of just 15 days.
An unanticipated flood of applications in June and July also forced the company to hire hundreds of new employees, some of whom had little or no experience handling orders over the phone. What followed, said Paul Kahn, the president of A.T.& T.'s Universal card unit, was a surge in errors. For example, some customers who asked for the premium or "gold" version of the Universal Visa card were sent the regular Mastercard version. Then they were mistakenly told to cancel the card and fill out a new application.
A.T.& T. sharply reduced advertising for the card in the summer, when fewer people are watching television, he said, and used the resulting lull to fix shortcomings in the application and credit-checking procedures.
 
Depressed Earnings
 Paradoxically, A.T.& T.'s success has depressed the company's second- and third-quarter earnings. Consumers have charged more than $2 billion worth of purchases to the Universal card, and with new charges coming in much faster than consumers pay their bills, A.T.& T. has had to pay out the difference.
In the long run, the rapid expansion may mean that A.T.& T. will develop a large, stable portfolio of interest-paying customers sooner than if it acquired customers at a more sedate pace. Robert E. Allen, the chairman of A.T.& T., predicted on Oct. 30 at a meeting of Wall Street analysts that the card might become profitable within two years, the low end of the company's initial estimate of two to five years.
But the unexpected popularity of the card helped to derail A.T.& T.'s plans for 10 to 12 percent growth in earnings this year, and the company's stock has slid sharply since management acknowledged the slower earnings growth in late June.
The success has also provoked regulatory and legal challenges by other Visa and Mastercard issuers. And one of A.T.& T.'s strong initial marketing edges, the combination of a credit card and a discount-calling card, has faded quickly.
Several dozen card issuers, including Citibank on June 26 and the American Express Company on Oct. 29, announced alliances with the MCI Communications Corporation and U S Sprint to allow their credit cards to be used for calls. On Nov. 15, U S Sprint and Visa International, an association of national Visa groups like Visa U.S.A, announced an agreement to allow holders of Visa cards issued abroad to use them for phone calls in the United States.
 
Increased Work Force
 To cope with the increased business, A.T.& T.'s Universal card unit , based in Jacksonville, Fla., ballooned this year to 2,200 employees, from 200 on March 1.
One of A.T.& T.'s big problems has been keeping straight which customers asked for which of the four versions of the Universal card.
"I originally applied for the A.T.& T. Universal Visa gold card," said Joy R. Van Elderen, a book researcher in Washington. "I was sent a regular Mastercard, then I was sent a regular Visa card, and finally a Visa gold."
Universal card representatives required Ms. Van Elderen to fill out separate applications over the phone for all three cards, and separately cancel each of the first two cards.
Inquiries to credit bureaus about card applications remain on a person's credit record for two years, and can make it hard to obtain other cards, said Elgie Holstein, the president of Bank Card Holders of America, a consumer group based in Herndon, Va.
 
Interest Charges
 Sharon J. Kalin, a Wall Street arbitrager, had no problem getting her Universal card. But A.T.& T. never deposited one payment check, and was late depositing another check, charging her interest both times on amounts she had paid.
Ms. Kalin complained repeatedly and ended up dropping the card, although the company gave her credit for the interest both times. "I took it because it looked like a good deal," she said. "But I had a perfect credit rating, and now it was beginning to make my credit rating look funny because of late payments."
Mr. Kahn said such problems were rare. A.T.& T. hired its Universal card executives, including him, from the top credit card issuers, he said. "We do a better job than any of the banks that any of us came from."
When A.T.& T. surveyed some of its customers in September, it found that 52 percent rated the application process better than expected and none rated it worse, said Bruce E. Reid, a company spokesman. And 93 percent of those surveyed rated service for the Universal card as good or excellent, he said.
The popularity of the Universal card has also irritated established issuers of credit cards, who object to A.T.& T.'s complex arrangements to sponsor the card.
The cards are issued by the Universal Bank in Columbus, Ga., a three-employee subsidiary of the Synovus Financial Corporation. The bills are processed by Total System Services Inc., another Synovus subsidiary. The bank was set up last spring only to handle the Universal card, and at the end of each day sells all card charges to A.T.& T.
 
Banks Urge Legal Reviews
 Several big banks have urged four state and Federal agencies to review the legality of A.T.& T.'s arrangements, particularly whether A.T.& T. controls Universal Bank without having to obey banking laws and regulations.
The Visa group introduced new rules on Oct. 9 to prevent other industrial companies from making similar arrangements and said it would consider retroactively applying the rules to the Universal card. Friday's ban prevents companies from going around the rules by buying a bank or savings institution.
The Federal Reserve will probably make a decision within three or four months, while it may take six months to a year for the Federal Communications Commission to act, Mr. Kahn said. The Georgia Banking Department has dropped its investigation without taking action, but the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is still reviewing the matter.
A.T.& T. has said that these complaints have no merit but that it is prepared, if necessary, to buy a special credit card bank to issue the Universal card, which would eliminate most grounds for the criticisms. The banking laws in Delaware, Ohio, Nevada and South Dakota would lend themselves to such a move, Mr. Kahn said. He added that A.T.& T. had no particular bank in mind and might charter a new one. But Friday's ban by Visa could block these plans.
Bank credit card executives also say that A.T.& T. cannot make money on the card without an annual fee. But Mr. Kahn said the banks' credit card profit margins had been so large with fees that A.T.& T. can do without them and still make money.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS;
Ex-Defense Secretaries Advise Patience in Gulf

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Nov. 30

 BODY:
Most former Defense Secretaries counsel patience in resorting to military force against Iraq, saying that the United States should give economic sanctions more time to work.
The views of the former Pentagon chiefs were expressed in recent interviews and at a conference here at the Southern Center for International Studies. 
 The advocacy of restraint by most of the former Secretaries was generally consistent with the views of two former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who testified on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that they think economic sanctions against Iraq should be given a year or more to work.
"I would continue with diplomatic and economic sanctions for some time," said former Defense Secretary Harold Brown, who served in the Carter Administration.
 
 McNamara's Position
 Robert S. McNamara, Defense Secretary during the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, emphatically urged that sanctions be given 12 to 18 months to work, saying, "We have not by any means proven that they will not achieve their objective."
Critics of the Administration say there is no sense in risking American casualties if economic sanctions will work over time, and argue that the measures have not yet been fully tested. But supporters of the Administration say that further delay in taking military action will only enable Iraq to strengthen its hold on Kuwait and add that the prolonged presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia risks destablizing that desert kingdom and the fraying of the multinational coalition.
Wishing to avoid the appearance of undercutting the Bush Administration's campaign to press President Saddam Hussein to withdraw his forces from Kuwait, all of the former Defense Secretaries agreed that the United States needed to retain a credible threat of using force against Iraq.
Even so, some former Defense Secretaries from Republican as well as Democratic Administration were generally cautious about using force.
"War probably would create more problems than it would solve," said Frank C. Carlucci, Defense Secretary at the end of the Reagan Administration.
Mr. Carlucci also said it would be difficult to keep American troops in Saudi Arabia for a long period.
 
 Weinberger Favors Sanctions

Caspar W. Weinberger, who ran the Pentagon for most of the Reagan Administration, did not attend the conference. But he said in a recent interview that he thought sanctions would probably be effective in persuading Iraq to withdraw its forces from Kuwait if given time to work.
"If we apply the sanctions longer, we may well be able to accomplish what we want," Mr. Weinberger said. "I understand people get impatient and all, but I do not believe in rushing in and attacking early."
Mr. Weinberger also said that he believed Iraq was "some years away" from developing nuclear weapons, a threat that has been cited by some Bush Administration officials as possible ground for a strike against Iraq.
Elliot L. Richardson, who served briefly as Defense Secretary in the Nixon Administration, argued that American troops would not be misused by a long deployment on the Arabian Peninsula. "We ought not to assume that they are unable to display patience," Mr. Richardson said.
 
 Rumsfeld Sees Merit in Attack
 Of the former Pentagon chiefs, only Donald Rumsfeld, who served at the Pentagon in the Ford Administration and was a longtime political mentor of the present Defense Secretary, Dick Cheney, stressed the merits of an attack on Iraq.
Mr. Rumsfeld said that American air superiority could be used to destroy Iraqi nuclear and chemical weapons plants, decisively resolving Western and Saudi worries about those weapon programs.
"I am not the slightest bit uncomfortable with military action" to destroy such installations, he said.
But Mr. Rumsfeld also said that he was "not terribly enamored" of suggestions that the United States launch a ground attack to pry the Iraqis out of Kuwait, and added that the Bush Administration had put too many troops in Saudi Arabia to maintain a long-term presence there at that level.
Melvin R. Laird, a Defense Secretary during the Nixon Administration who has been advising the Bush Administration on the gulf crisis, said that it would be a mistake to signal Mr. Hussein that the United States would rely entirely on sanctions during the next several months and would be unlikely to use force during that period.
"The important thing here is that we have until the 15th of January to get down to some very serious business with Saddam Hussein," Mr. Laird said. "It would be a very grave error to send a direct message about what we will or will not do."
 
 Support for Cheney

Mr. Laird said that "we have one Secretary of Defense at a time," adding that he would support the testimony that Defense Secretary Cheney gives on Monday to the Senate Armed Services Committee.
James R. Schlesinger, Defense Secretary in the Nixon and Ford Administrations, has previously urged that sanctions be given a year or more to work and repeated those points today.
Mr. Schlesinger said he approved of the United Nations Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force as a means of keeping up the pressure on Iraq. But he added, referring to military force, that "there is no necessity to use it or to say now that we will use it."
Clark M. Clifford, Defense Secretary at the end of the Johnson Administration, was not at the conference and has not responded to recent requests for comment.

HEADLINE: Israelis Go On Strike to Fight a Tax to Absorb Emigres

BYLINE: By JOEL R. BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Israel's national trade union all but shut the nation down today with a general strike protesting the Government's plan to tax Israelis to pay for the absorption of Soviet immigrants.
The Histadrut union, which represents workers in virtually all areas of public and private enterprise, shut down radio, television, air traffic, telecommunications, Government offices, banks, most schools, postal and port services. It put a number of other fields, including health services, on holiday schedules. 
 Ignoring a court order last week requiring many Histadrut workers to remain on the job, the union threatened to continue the strike indefinitely, until the Government reversed or modified its decision last week to raise taxes, lower the minimum wage and carry out other economic steps to pay for the resettlement of immigrants.
"The Government is exploiting the situation in the country to cause damage in matters vital to the workers that have nothing to do with the objective of absorbing immigrants," the Histadrut said last week.
 
Shift to the Taxpayer
 "We are ready to continue striking tomorrow and the day after that," Chaim Haberfield, the trade union chairman, warned today.
Until this year, the Government relied almost exclusively on donations from abroad, chiefly from the United States, to pay for resettlement costs. American Jews were repeatedly solicited to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars.
The immigrants are now arriving in such large numbers that even the foreign contributions are insufficient. Jewish fund-raisers abroad said they realized they could return to the well only so many times.
Still, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said last week that when he meets with President Bush this month in Washington, he will ask for hundreds of millions of dollars in American loan guarantees, apart from the $400 million already provided.
Today the Israeli Government said that 30,000 immigrants arrived in November, 28,000 of them from the Soviet Union. The precise number is not known because the Absorption Ministry, which gathers the figures, is on strike.
 
Big Increase From October
 A total of about 30,000 would represent an increase of more than 40 percent over the 21,163 who arrived in October, which was a record number.
So far, 165,000 immigrants have arrived this year. And it now seems clear that the total for 1990 will be higher than for any year except 1949, the newly founded state's first full year, when 239,576 immigrants and refugees poured in.
Thousands of the immigrants lived in tents that year. Despite a year's warning, Israel has been so slow to build housing for this wave of immigrants that thousands of them may have to live in tents or similar temporary housing starting early next year.
No matter where they live, newcomers in 1991 will receive fewer benefits than the immigrants who are arriving now. Because the Government is running out of money, it has cut the amount of money and services that immigrants receive upon arriving, in some cases sharply.
But the strike today is a response to new economic steps affecting workers, not immigrants.
 
20 Percent Wage Cut
 As part of a package worked out last week for the 1991 national budget, the Government agreed to cut the minimum wage by 20 percent for the employee's first six months of work, from $521 a month to $417. The Government also proposed to place a 20 percent tax on certain types of interest earned by pension funds. Those are the provisions that most irked the workers' union.
The Government has also proposed a 5 percent surcharge on income taxes for all Israelis. With a top rate of 52 percent, Israeli taxes are already among the highest in the world.
The Government also plans to raise the national sales tax, applicable to nearly all purchases, from 16 percent to 18 percent.
Although the strike virtually closed the country down, it was peaceful and relatively quiet. Israeli strikers seldom organize pickets or hold large-scale public demonstrations. Strikers are more likely to stay home, or to go to the beach if the weather is warm.
Since a member of nearly every Israeli family belongs to the Histadrut, there is seldom much public complaint about the inconvenience caused by a strike, and that was again the case today.
 
Peres Sides With Workers
 The Labor Party leader Shimon Peres sided with the workers today and said the Government had been insensitive to their concerns.
"I think the Government behaved foolishly because the Histadrut is not against immigration and not against absorption," he said. The union has close ties with the Labor Party.
Politicians across the spectrum realize that Soviet immigration will be a potent issue in the next election.
More than 200,000 new Soviet immigrant voters will clearly have an impact on the nation's politics. And the wave of immigration is so important to most Israelis that successful integration of the newcomers will probably be viewed as the most important test of the current Government's success or failure.
Union officials have said repeatedly that they, too, are happy that so many Soviet Jews are choosing to move here. At the same time, they say they do not want to suffer economically as a result of the influx of newcomers.
Government officials were angered by the strike. Economic Minister David Magen said, "All those who heard the declarations of the Histadrut leaders could not but conclude that this strike is against the immigration."
 
Sharansky's Warning
 But Natan Sharansky, who has come to be viewed as a spokesman for the Soviet immigrants, warned that regardless of the reluctance of workers to pay for the absorption of immigrants, Israel had better find a way to come up with more jobs and housing.
Private organizations monitoring the immigrants' progress have determined that of the 3,000 Soviet scientists who have arrived so far this year, only 160 have found jobs. Mr. Sharansky said he was worried that many of the others would give up on Israel and emigrate to the United States.
And as for those who stay, Mr. Sharansky said, "I am worried that in half a year, there will be half a million immigrants in the streets or in tents, and then we will really have a civil war here."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Drop in Global Interest Rates Seen

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Global interest rates are likely to slide in coming months if war does not break out in the Middle East.
"Right now the United States is sort of out in front of the rest of the world," said Gary Schlossberg, a vice president and senior economist at the Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. "But we are probably going to see some decline in global interest rates. That is one reason why some of us feel the decline in the dollar is about over, because interest rate differentials will start to narrow." 
 Early in the year the promise of German unification, a stronger and more unified European Community and political problems in Japan helped to push foreign interest rates sharply above those in the United States. The increase intensified the struggle for investment capital.
 
Competition Still Intense
 Competition for capital is just as intense, but interest rates are expected to drop because of the general economic slowdown. Yet a number of credit market analysts and economists said that for the first time since World War II a downturn in the United States was not likely to mean that the rest of the world will fall into a recession.
Recessions were under way in Australia, Britain and Canada before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August sent oil prices skyrocketing. The oil shock almost certainly added the United States to the list, economists said.
Unless oil prices remain high for a protracted period of time, a possibilty if a Mideast war breaks out, some analysts say the downturn will be contained.
 
Impact Viewed as Minimal
 "The Anglo-Saxon countries don't account for as much of global output as they did even 10 years ago, so that minimizes the impact," said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs International. "But the oil crisis, which comes at a time of an international capital shortage and more stringent lending requirements at banks around the world all work in the direction of a general global slowdown in growth."
Mr. Hormats predicted that trade would be a less important mechanism for spreading recessions in the 1990's than it has been in the past. Countries that are relatively energy efficient and have strong balance sheets will be the ones whose economies will slow but not stop. "If you are energy inefficient and overleveraged, you are doubly hurt," he said. "The United States falls into both those categories."
Of the industrialized countries, Japan and Germany appear best able to prevent a slowdown from turning into a recession. But growth in these countries will be crimped.
 
Japanese Slowing Forecast
 In a new forecast, analysts at Salomon Brothers projected last week that growth in Japan will slow to just over 3 percent next year, from 6.1 percent in 1990. And a slowdown in its principal trading partners will blunt the economic stimulus of unification and bring German growth down to about 3 percent next year from just over 4 percent in 1990, the Salomon analysts said. In anticipation of slower growth, Japanese interest rates are starting to fall.
By comparison, from the fourth quarter of 1990 to the fourth quarter of 1991, output in the United States is projected by Salomon to decline by 1.5 percent, the worst performance among leading Western economies.
"The 1991 economic outlook for the Group of Seven industrialized countries is the weakest since the early 1980's, but we don't think there will be a worldwide recession," said Anita Lauria, an economist at Salomon. "But if the average world oil price next year is higher than the $28 per barrel we currently assume, there will be a lot more pain in a lot of corners of the world."
Closer to home, those looking for additional signs of economic weakness in the American economy will probably find them in reports to be released this week, analysts said. If those forecasts are borne out, further declines in interest rates are almost certain to follow.
"The economic numbers will reinforce the concept that rates will come down," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank. "November is shaping up as being equally as weak as October was."
 
Jobless Data on Friday
 A snapshot of how the manufacturing sector fared last month is expected today, when the nation's purchasing managers release their survey. But truly substantive information will not be available until Friday, when November employment data are scheduled to be issued by the Labor Department.
Mr. Fine and other analysts predicted that the report will probably remove any residual doubt that the economy is sliding into a recession.
Propelled by additional layoffs in goods-producing industries like autos, nonfarm payroll employment fell sharply last month, analysts agree. The only question is by how much.
As of late last week, optimists were projecting a decline of 50,000, while pessimists were expecting a decline of 150,000. Analysts said the report would also show that the unemployment rate, which stood at 5.7 percent in October, probably shot up last month, perhaps to as high as 6 percent.
Those sorts of numbers would probably persuade the Federal Reserve to push for another quarter-point reduction in the overnight Federal funds rate, which the central bank only recently lowered to 7 1/2 percent, analysts said.
"We feel the numbers will be weak enough to encourage the Fed to ease one more time before the year is out," Wells Fargo's Mr. Schlossberg said.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Bishop Sends Diocese A Pastoral Letter Against Racism

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
In his first pastoral letter to Roman Catholic congregations in Brooklyn and Queens -- the setting for some of the worst racial incidents in New York City -- Bishop Thomas V. Daily called for a fight against racism.
"If God is our Father, we must be related to one another as brother and sister," said Bishop Daily, in the first such letter he has issued to the diocese, which covers Brooklyn and Queens, since his installment in April. "Race, creed, color, sex, national origin, language, culture or condition in life are irrelevant." 
 Bishop Daily called upon educators, politicians, business leaders, police officers and journalists to fight racism and the attitudes and institutions that perpetuate it. He also implored city residents to rid themselves of the tendency to stereotype and to make judgments about people based on physical characteristics and economic status.
He alluded to several racially motivated crimes in the diocese that have grabbed national headlines in the last few years.
 
 'The Right to Travel Safely'
 In August of last year, a group of white youths swinging baseball bats and yelling racial epithets attacked three black teen-agers in Bensonhurst. In the incident, one of the blacks, 16-year-old Yusuf K. Hawkins, was killed. And in 1986, Michael Griffith, 23, a black man who was trying to escape an attack by several white youths, ran in front of a car on a highway in Howard Beach, Queens, and was killed.
"Every citizen should have the right to travel safely into and through any neighborhood, unmolested by insult or physical assault," Bishop Daily wrote. "When a black man is attacked in a white neighborhood, racism is often the root cause."
The pastoral letter also drew attention to anti-Semitism, quoting from a declaration issued after the second Vatican Council that said the Catholic Church rejected any discrimination and harassment based on religion. Last year three Jewish students were attacked outside a Brooklyn College fraternity house by several white men who pummeled them with feet, fists and beer bottles.
Although he is not the first bishop to issue such a letter focusing on racism, Bishop Daily indicated that he has placed paramount importance on the issue by making his comments in a pastoral letter. Pastoral letters, which are not binding on Catholics, place special emphasis on issues and set guidelines for church policy and for training seminarians and children who attend Catholic schools.
In an interview on Saturday, the Bishop noted that people of almost 100 different nationalities speaking roughly 70 languages lived in his diocese. He said that such diversity, concentrated in the dense urban environment of Queens and Brooklyn, could heighten racial tensions.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Top Official at GATT Faces a Round in Crisis

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, Nov. 29

 BODY:
With the shadow of failure hanging over the global trade talks that begin in Brussels on Monday, Arthur Dunkel, the Director General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is all too aware that he can neither take sides nor impose solutions. "All I can do is to put them at a table and make them negotiate," he said.
After four years of the current round of trade talks, real negotiations -- in the sense of tit-for-tat concessions between major trading blocs on issues like agriculture, services and textiles -- have been left to the final hour. 
 "The round is in crisis, and the negotiators have to get out of this crisis in the first hours and days in Brussels," he warned. "If governments are not prepared from the very start of the conference to abandon well-known positions, then the conference will be a missed opportunity."
 
Cannot Decide Who Wins
 Mr. Dunkel, 58 years old, feels he has done all he can so far. He sees himself as manager of "a system of rules" who cannot decide who wins. Unlike the heads of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, he is a man "with totally empty pockets," he says, lacking the clout of a checkbook to make his views known.
His words nonetheless carry the weight of experience. Born in Lisbon and fluent in five languages, he spent 25 years as a Swiss Government official working on trade questions, including the Tokyo Round of trade negotiations that ended in 1980. And since then, as head of GATT, he has been preparing for this current round, known as the Uruguay Round because it began in that nation.
He is not a man given to hyperbole. Many governments are warning darkly of the dangers of protectionist trade wars if the Uruguay Round ends in failure, but the tall chain-smoking civil servant talks of "a slow erosion" of economic confidence and security -- "with occasional explosions" -- as a more likely consequence.
 
Taking a Broader View
 While attention has been focused on the deadlock over farm subsidies between the United States, which wants such programs cut sharply, and the 12-nation European Community, Mr. Dunkel looks further afield, underlining the political risks of failure to Latin American and Eastern European countries that are for the first time opening their economies to market forces.
"Those who have taught them the virtues of the market economy have a special responsibility now," he said in an interview in his office overlooking Lake Geneva. "Take the Poles. They abolished all agricultural subsidies. Now they look at the rest of the world and wonder, are we foolish?"
Yet, after 10 years in the job, Mr. Dunkel is not allowing himself to be pessimistic. "I knew it would be difficult," he said, "and it's more difficult than I expected one year ago. But if we can get agreements on agriculture, services and textiles, the rest will fall into place."
 
Effect of Deadline Pressure
 He hopes deadline pressure can help. Washington and other major capitals recognize that they have five days in which to achieve a political breakthrough.
"It's easier for a politician to go home after giving up an entrenched position if he can explain that, otherwise, he would have blown up the whole thing," Mr. Dunkel said.
One of Mr. Dunkel's weapons is his "green room," a conference room with green wallpaper where negotiators are frequently sequestered until they settle trade disputes. "He sits at the top of the table and fills the room with smoke until they agree," one Latin American ambassador to GATT recalled.
 
'Force of Personality'
 In general, delegates speak warmly of Mr. Dunkel as a personable civil servant and good negotiator who occasionally adopts the tone of a university professor. "His power comes more from force of personality and his ability to master details than from his office," one Western ambassador said. "And also, of course, we all need him."
Mr. Dunkel was reminded of the limits on his power only days ago, when he was reprimanded by the European Community simply for preparing a series of questions to be taken up by ministers from the 107 participating countries in Brussels.
"I have to take calculated risks because one of my roles is to help bring people together," he explained with a shrug. "You take risks when you think you can help the process. I was asked to put key questions on agriculture. I did it, and apparently I'm under strong attack from one of the sides."
To Mr. Dunkel, however, the many issues in dispute are closely interrelated, as ministers prepare to link concessions in one area to gains in another. "It's now a question of governments balancing off different pressure groups and defining their national interest," he said.
"That's the game," he went on. "How can some developing country come here seeking market openings in textiles and return home to say they got nothing on textiles but have reduced protectionism for local pharmaceutical companies? It's all a question of linkage now."
Mr. Dunkel is also looking beyond the Uruguay Round to two new subjects. "One is trade policies in the context of protection of the environment," he said. "The other is private restrictive business practices that fall outside traditional government control."
 
Leaving Post at End of 1992
 Those talks, however, may not take place on Mr. Dunkel's watch. He steps down from his post at the end of 1992, and he is already planning to see whether, as a business executive, he can apply some of the lessons he has been offering governments over the last decade.
"I come from a family of traders," he said, recalling that his father was a textiles designer who moved to Portugal in the 1930's to escape recession in Switzerland. "I spent a lot of my youth discussing business at the family table. But then I got caught up in government."
After 1992, though, he said he would end his career of public service. "Then I will go out into the real world," he added with a laugh.

HEADLINE: A.T.& T. Might Shift Cable Ships Abroad

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company is considering a plan to operate two new undersea cable-laying ships under foreign flags.
That would enable the company to employ foreign seamen at a fraction of the wages, perhaps one-tenth, of what an American crew could command. 
 "The primary reason if we did go this route is economics," said Michael D. Miller, a spokesman for A.T.& T., which has more stockholders among the American public than any other company. "With the present union setup on the ships, we are paying a substantial premium. We feel we could economize with a nonunion crew."
One of the two ships is scheduled to be christened next Monday in Singapore, and a decision is expected by next month, when the vessel is scheduled to go into service.
"You're talking about a lot of American jobs here," said an A.T.& T. employee who serves aboard the Long Lines, the company's main cable-laying vessel. "It has got a lot of us worried here."
The employee insisted on anonymity, saying he might be disciplined if he were identified. He said he thought A.T.& T. might register the ships in Greece.
Mr. Miller said no final decision had been made on whether to register the ships abroad or what crew to employ. He declined to comment on whether Greek registry was being considered.
The ship to be christened next Monday is the Global Link. The Global Sentinel is to be christened later. Both ships were completed in Singapore.
A.T.& T.'s consideration of foreign registration reflects a broad trend in American shipping.
The number of active deep-draft vessels flying the American flag has fallen to 379, from 770 in 1970. Besides the higher wages received by American crews, a variety of taxes, laws and more stringent safety rules that require additional safety equipment have prompted many companies to register ships abroad.
One result is that American-flag ships are in short supply for mobilization during crises, like the one in the Persian Gulf. The Defense Department has mobilized more than a dozen commercial vessels to ferry goods to American forces stationed in Saudi Arabia.
A.T.& T.'s cable-laying ships hold laboratories and rooms full of communications gear and are among the most technologically advanced vessels afloat. The company said it expected little difficulty in hiring foreign workers who could operate such equipment.
One A.T.& T. vessel, the Long Lines, was built in West Germany and has a crew four times as large as that on a supertanker. The big crew is needed to allow sailors and officers to maneuver the vessel carefully as it lays cables across undersea canyons and mountains. The crew also recovers and repairs broken cables at sea.
"It's a skilled job, and it's the type of job we'd like to have permanent crews on," said Edward B. Kelly, a vice president of the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association, which represents low-ranking officers aboard the Long Lines.
A.T.& T. has no plans to register the Long Lines abroad, Mr. Miller said. The union contracts for the vessel do not expire for two years.
The Long Lines has a crew of 70 and is based in Baltimore. A.T.& T.'s other cable-laying ship, the much smaller Charles L. Brown, was built in Naples, has a crew of 40 and is based in Honolulu. No foreigners serve aboard either vessel.
As demand increases for international telephone circuits, competition in the cable-laying business is increasing and more companies are building ships.
"We want to be a worldwide competitor in cable provision," Mr. Miller said. "Obviously we're concerned about the jobs on those ships, but behind those jobs are 2,000 jobs at Bell Labs and elsewhere that depend on our winning those cable contracts."
The result is more bidding for cable-laying contracts. A.T.& T. recently lost out on a $140 million contract from the United States Navy to construct a 500-mile underseas cable between Japan and Okinawa.
The contract went to STC P.L.C., a British company, which operates a cable factory in Portland, Ore. STC plans to load its vessel in Portland for shipment across the Pacific.
A.T.& T. sued the Navy, contending that the contract had violated a Federal law that required all American military cargoes to be carried in American-flag vessels.
The suit was filed in the Federal District Court in Alexandria, Va. The court ruled that the trans-Pacific shipment was not a big enough part of the contract to justify overturning the award to STC.
A.T.& T.'s two maritime unions, the Marine Engineers and the Seafarers International Union, with two trade associations of American shipping companies, joined A.T.& T. in the original suit and are appealing the ruling.
A.T.& T. has refused to join the appeal.
"Since they no longer have to be American-flag to get American contracts, why stick with American flags and American crews?" said J. Dinsmore Murphy, a lawyer representing the unions and the trade groups.
 
Negotiating With Unions
 A.T.& T. is negotiating contracts with the unions for its new ships, the Global Link and the Global Sentinel. Mr. Miller said the company's consideration of foreign registration was prompted by concern about the growing fleets of foreign cable-laying ships.
"This is a competitiveness issue, not a union issue," he added.

HEADLINE: Way Cleared On Alaskan Oil Project

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Production at a large Alaskan oilfield, discovered in 1989 two miles north of the vast reserves of Prudhoe Bay, is expected to begin within two years now that oil producers and the Federal Government say they have resolved an environmental dispute that had stalled the project.
The agreement was announced late Friday by the Army Corps of Engineers, ARCO, BP Exploration and Exxon. The Corps of Engineers was the main opponent of the project. It was not clear today whether other challenges might be brought during further licensing steps that might be required. 
 It was the second time in a week that big oil companies said they planned to pump more oil from large fields where production was blocked by disputes over environmental worries. The Chevron Corporation said Tuesday that it anticipated that a group of 18 oil companies it heads will produce as much as 20,000 barrels a day from the Point Arguello field, off the California coast near Santa Barbara, by next summer.
Negotiations in both cases were mediated by high-ranking officials at the Energy Department. The Administration has sought to increase domestic oil output because imports of 200,000 barrels a day of Kuwaiti oil were halted after the invasion by Iraq on Aug. 2.
Officials at the Army Corps of Engineers and at the Environmental Protection Agency held up production in the Point McIntyre field because they considered existing gravel causeways that extend from land into the shallow waters of the Beaufort Sea a threat to fish that migrate in those coastal waters.
A commercial fishery situated more than 100 miles west of the causeways relies on the Arctic char, broad whitefish, least cisco and Arctic cisco for its operations. The view of Federal officials was that the causeways appeared to raise salt concentrations and the temperature of the water to levels in some areas near the coast that would be harmful to the fish.
 
Oil Companies' Argument
 The oil companies disagreed, saying years of study at their expense had not indicated any bad effects from the causeways. "It has been and continues to be our position that variations caused by natural factors, like wind and current, far exceed any variations that you could attribute to the causeways," said Paul Laird, a spokesman in Anchorage for BP Exploration, a unit of the British Petroleum Company.
ARCO, B.P. and Exxon agreed to spend $50 million to clear several water passages in the gravel roadbeds first built for exploration drilling at the Point McIntyre field as well as at the nearby Endicott field.
The roadbeds extend 2.5 miles to the Point McIntyre field, and 5 miles to Endicott. The oil companies agreed to add a total of 650 feet of clearance for water at several locations in the causeways. The Endicott causeway was built initially with 700 feet of openings; the Point McIntyre causeway contains a 52-foot breach.
Brian Davies, a vice president for development at B.P., said the settlement announced Friday enabled the oil companies to move ahead with production and "avoids years of dispute and possible litigation."
 
Called a Reasonable Conclusion
 Col. William W. Kakel, Alaska district engineer for the Army Corps of Engineers, said the pact was a reasonable conclusion to the disagreement. He added that the agreement "recognizes that environmental quality and economic reality are both important in North Slope oil and gas decisions."
The oil companies own rights to an estimated 300 million barrels in the Point McIntyre field. Production from Point McIntyre and from the nearby Lisburne field could reach 100,000 barrels a day by 1994, said Al Greenstein, a spokesman at ARCO's headquarters in Los Angeles.
Output at the Lisburne field, already in production, is 40,000 barrels a day. The combined output of Lisburne and Point McIntyre will exceed 60,000 barrels when output from Point McIntyre begins by late summer in 1992, Mr. Greenstein said. An expansion set for the summer of 1993 should increase output in the combined project to between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels a day, he said.
Oil produced from the fields will flow through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline to the tanker port at Valdez, Alaska, with most of the output then shipped by tanker to West Coast refineries.
 
Pipeline Found Sound
ANCHORAGE, Dec. 2 (AP) -- The company that oversees the Trans-Alaska Pipeline said today that it had completed an investigation of reported corrosion and found the 800-mile pipeline to be sound. State and Federal regulators who supervised the monthlong inquiry by the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company said they had not decided whether to allow the company to increase pressure in the line. Oil producers want to increase the amount of crude pumped through the line, which links the North Slope with Valdez, to about 2.1 million barrels a day, from 2.06 million.

HEADLINE: New Aggressiveness at Times Mirror

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
When Thomas Plate left New York Newsday last year to become editorial page editor of The Los Angeles Times, the meeting to announce his arrival turned into a fiasco. A member of The Times's editorial staff abruptly stood up, asked, "Is this a meeting or an announcement?" and then embarked on a fiery 15-minute diatribe against the appointment of somebody from outside the paper.
This unusual outburst, which stunned the editors and executives present, reflected uneasiness about change at the Times Mirror Company, the diversified media giant that owns The Los Angeles Times and Newsday on Long Island. It is a company unused to upheaval. Indeed, The Times was once dubbed "the velvet coffin" because of its reputation for stability and paternalism. 
 But the velvet has recently turned to something more like sackcloth. David Laventhol, who was editor and then chairman at Newsday for a total of 18 years before becoming the publisher and chief executive of The Los Angeles Times last year, is a man who hides a tough business sense and a taste for challenges beneath a mild and amiable manner. In his appointment of Mr. Plate, and in other changes reflecting a more aggressive attitude, Mr. Laventhol is now making his presence felt throughout a company that had revenues of $3.5 billion last year. Mr. Laventhol, who is also, president of Times Mirror, is widely viewed as likely to become the company's next chief executive.
The changes at Times Mirror amount to what David Shaw, The Times's media reporter, called "the completion of a move from a family-run enterprise to more of a corporate, bottom-line business." They come at a time when tremendous opportunities and serious difficulties have abruptly arisen for Times Mirror on both the East and West Coasts.
On the one hand, the strike at The Daily News in New York has given an extraordinary boost to New York Newsday, which Mr. Laventhol started five years ago, and has brought it within sight of profitability. The publisher of Newsday, Robert M. Johnson, said its New York City edition was selling about 120,000 more copies during the week, bringing its circulation to 340,000, and 225,000 more copies on Sunday, putting that circulation at 373,000. New York Newsday has gained about 120 new advertisers since the strike began five and a half weeks ago.
Over all, Newsday now has a weekday circulation of about 870,000 and accounts for about 12 percent of Times Mirror's revenue. A paper strong in both New York City and its Long Island suburbs would be very attractive to advertisers, so this growth -- if it lasts -- is an important breakthrough.
"Suddenly, there is the possibility that Newsday could become an East Coast cash cow for them," said John Morton, a newspaper industry analyst at Lynch, Jones & Ryan.
On the other hand, Times Mirror is being severely hurt by the advertising slump that has affected its Eastern papers, which include The Baltimore Sun and The Hartford Courant, and has just hit the flagship paper, The Los Angeles Times.
Operating profits in the company's newspaper division, which account for close to 60 percent of the revenues, plunged 61.2 percent in the first nine months of 1990. Although the company's other activities -- which include a book publishing division, cable and broadcast television operations and specialty magazines -- have generally fared better, overall net income was down 40 percent, to $134.9 million, in the same period.
 
'Worst of Both Worlds'
 "They are getting the worst of both worlds," said Ed Atorino, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. "There's been a severe slump on the East Coast, and the West is moving into recession."
This trend is not likely to change soon. "I do not see any immediate turnaround," said Robert F. Erburu, the 60-year-old chief executive of Times Mirror. "I guess most people would hope for a bottoming-out and some recovery beginning in the second half of 1991."
In a joint interview with Mr. Erburu at Times Mirror's headquarters in Los Angeles, Mr. Laventhol said: "The whole company is focused on the question of costs right now. We want to be more efficient and more productive. It's a good issue to look at, both now and for the longer term."
The "long term" is a favorite expression of Mr. Laventhol, 57, an utterly unpretentious former reporter and founding editor of The Washington Post's Style section. He combines a belief that "God is in the details," as one collegue put it, with an ability not to get bogged down in them. He asks his staff, for example, whether The Times has enough boxes on Los Angeles's new Metro Rail transit system, while pursuing a plan for the paper in 2005.
 
'Long-Term Opportunity'
 Mr. Laventhol said a conviction that there was "a long-term opportunity" for Newsday to be the strongest paper in Brooklyn and Queens led him to get Times Mirror behind a New York City edition in 1986. He felt the paper could offer more serious and in-depth coverage of local news and sports than The Daily News.
At the time, The Daily News was dominant in Brooklyn and Queens, but its circulation was declining.
Newsday, meanwhile, was dominant on the rest of Long Island, but looking for ways to grow. "We saw an opportunity in New York if we could cover New York better than anybody else," Mr. Laventhol said.
New York Newsday -- once called "the tabloid in a tutu" because of its format and serious content -- grew steadily, from a circulation of about 87,000 in 1986 to 221,660 in September of this year.
But that was still far short of the break-even point, which Mr. Laventhol estimates at "between 300,000 and 400,000" and Mr. Johnson, the Newsday publisher, at "around 300,000." Although Times Mirror does not disclose the finances of its individual papers, analysts believe that New York Newsday has so far lost in excess of $100 million.
But as a result of the Daily News strike, Mr. Johnson believes New York Newsday can be profitable next year. He is convinced that even if The News survives, New York Newsday can hold at least half of its new readers and that "the longer the strike goes on, the more we'll get."
The strike has helped New York Newsday exactly where it wanted to grow. Circulation in Queens is up to 170,000, from 120,000 two months ago, Mr. Johnson said, and up to 90,000, from 50,000, in Brooklyn.
Both Mr. Johnson and New York Newsday's editor, Don Forst, contend it will now be very difficult for The News to recover, and they say The New York Times will become the main competitor if The News closes. "We aim to get younger New York Times readers," Mr. Forst said, adding that New York Newsday would not become more sensational to compete with The New York Post.
Still, one media analyst who insisted on anonymity said New York Newsday still had much to prove because, even at a price of 25 cents compared with 40 cents for The Post, it appears to have gained fewer readers. The Post claims its circulation is up by more than 200,000.
Moreover, the analyst pointed out that Newsday had not yet raised its ad rates in the New York edition, so that, for the moment, "the more copies they sell, the more they lose."
Mr. Laventhol takes a prudent view, describing the New York situation as too volatile for firm predictions. But although he and Mr. Erburu stressed that "the context of change here is evolutionary," Mr. Laventhol's actions in his 14 months as publisher of The Los Angeles Times suggest that Times Mirror will move aggressively to capitalize on New York Newsday's gains.
 
Buying and Selling Properties
 It is not that Times Mirror was inactive in the 1980's. Indeed, it sold some businesses, including its newsprint operation, for about $1 billion, and acquired new ones, including The Baltimore Sun and magazines like Field & Stream, for $1.5 billion.
But Times Mirror officials agree that the pace of change has accelerated since Mr. Laventhol's arrival. Indeed, the very presence as heir apparent of Mr. Laventhol, an Easterner in a corporation long dominated by Westerners, is widely regarded as confirmation of a new era -- one in which the Chandler family, which still owns the largest single stake of Times Mirror stock, has retired from active management.
Under Mr. Laventhol and the editor of two years, C. Shelby Coffey 3d, The Los Angeles Times has changed the format of its editorial page, introduced a "faster format," started a weekly showcase for its foreign correspondents, become more competitive in its reporting and changed the editors of most sections.
Like Mr. Laventhol, Mr. Coffey is a relative outsider to The Times. He previously was editor of The Dallas Times Herald when Times Mirror owned the paper.
The Times has also moved forcefully to counter the growth of strong suburban papers in neighboring Orange and Ventura Counties. Indeed, it is locked in an all-out war with The Orange County Register, which still outsells The Times in Orange County by a solid margin.
"The corporate culture is change," said John Lindsay, the editor of The Times's Calendar section, which covers arts and entertainment. "Whether you like it or not, that is absolutely it."
 
Circulation of 1.2 Million
 In the last year, The Los Angeles Times surpassed The Daily News as the nation's largest metropolitan newspaper. The Times's circulation has grown to 1.2 million a day. More than 100,000 of that gain came after The Los Angeles Herald Examiner closed in November 1989.
Mr. Erburu said the company aimed to become even stronger in the 1990's. "I would be surprised if Times Mirror does not acquire other papers in the next decade," he said.
Analysts like the company's new aggressiveness. "They will come back very strongly when the economy comes back," Mr. Atorino predicted. They also like Mr. Laventhol, who "knows the newspaper business better than anyone else they've had running it," Mr. Morton said.
Asked about his plans, Mr. Laventhol said, "We want to hook the Los Angeles Times up with Newsday in St. Louis!" Then, with his shy smile, he added, "That's a joke, of course."
It may be a joke, but Times Mirror's new-found restlessness and ambition clearly are not.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Democrats, Albeit Late, Ponder Presidential Bid

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
With the 1990 midterm elections finally over, Democrats with Presidential ambitions are entering a season of decision.
It is already a remarkably late-starting campaign, given the norms of modern politics. By this time in 1982, Gary Hart was making the case for his "new ideas," while Walter F. Mondale was trying to pick up support from Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who had already withdrawn from the race for the 1984 Democratic nomination. By this time in 1986, Representative Richard A. Gephardt and former Gov. Bruce Babbitt were already fixtures in Iowa. 
 But in December 1990, not a single paid worker for a Democratic Presidential campaign plods the streets of Des Moines, says a somewhat mystified Iowa Democratic Party. Elsewhere in political circles, there are quiet whispers in the clubby world of fund-raisers and nervous rumors in the ranks of consultants, but little real action and perhaps even less real information.
As one prominent Democrat groused about Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's plans, "What I'm hearing is he's absolutely running or he's absolutely not running."
 
Time to Decide
 Over the next two to three months, to the relief of political aficionados and probably the dismay of everyone else, this eerie calm will end as potential candidates finally make up their minds. The dance is beginning. The hopefuls are showing some leg.
Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, who was resoundingly re-elected to a second Senate term last month, said last week: "I said throughout the campaign, when asked, that I wasn't even going to think about it until the campaign was over with. Now that it is over with, I'm going to follow through, sit down and think about it."
Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, whose interest in the Presidency seemed lukewarm to many Democrats recently, reignited speculation a few weeks ago when he said, "The 1992 Democratic Presidential nomination is a lot more attractive than it was eight months ago."
Mr. Bentsen, who was apparently referring to President Bush's recent political problems and accompanying plunge in public opinion polls, plans a series of major economic speeches when Congress returns next month.
"He's weighing in his own mind, first and foremost, his chances should he decide to explore this further, and whether or not he wants to make the total commitment that he sees something like this requiring," said a friend of the 69-year-old Mr. Bentsen, the 1988 Democratic candidate for Vice President.
 
Nunn Well Positioned
 Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, who sets hearts fluttering in the party's Southern-conservative wing, is well positioned as chairman of the Armed Services Committee to be a leading Democratic voice in the Persian Gulf crisis.
And Mr. Gephardt, the House majority leader, emerged strengthened from the recent budget talks, with some of his partisans urging him to consider a race in 1992, even though he promised not to do that when he ran for majority leader in 1989.
Governor Cuomo's unimpressive re-election and his state's budget woes have prompted some reassessment of his strengths, but he is still widely considered the heavy of the field.
Others who usually get mentioned whenever two or more Democrats are gathered together include Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, who has maintained a notable national travel schedule; the Rev. Jesse Jackson, automatically considered a factor in Democratic campaigns; Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, although he says he intends to serve out his new term as Governor; Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, although Democrats are still buzzing about his political near-death experience in last month's election, and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. The list could go on.
Deciding whether to run for President is never easy, but there are a number of factors that make it particularly difficult this time around and are slowing the process.
"Essentially, people are making decisions that could involve putting together a $100 million-plus operation, involving maybe 25,000 people, which has a substantial impact on their lives, other people's lives and potentially the country," said Paul Tully, the political director of the Democratic National Committee.
"It is irresponsible to make that decision without being aware of the terrain you're operating on," Mr. Tully added. "Is there going to be a war or is there not going to be a war? That's not a small side issue."
Combined with the uncertainty over the economy, the Persian Gulf crisis makes it hard to assess Mr. Bush's vulnerability in 1992. "Bush could either be politically enshrined or politically deceased based on a couple of events," said Harrison Hickman, a Democratic poll taker.
Democrats know how quickly a President's fortunes can change. President Reagan looked very different in 1984 than he did just after the 1982 midterm elections, when Republicans lost 26 seats in the House and were buffeted by recession.
Beyond complicating the decisions, the Persian Gulf crisis has generally had a chilling effect on Presidential maneuvering: "There's a genuine concern that you not engage the President in partisan bickering while he's trying to manage a crisis," said Thomas E. Donilon, a Democratic lawyer involved in several Presidential campaigns.
Each of the hopefuls has his or her own career arc to consider. For example, Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Gore ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in 1988 and need to be careful about when they take their next shot. A tested candidate is one thing, a perennial also-ran another.
Moreover, Mr. Gephardt, who as majority leader is the House's No. 2 Democrat, is on the ladder to the Speaker's job. Should he jeopardize that in a attempt to unseat an incumbent President? For now, he is pledging his commitment to his current job.
 
The Cuomo Factor
 There are other variables in the race, like the Cuomo factor. "Will he be in or not in? If he's in, what's the best type of candidacy to push off him with?" as one Democratic strategist put it.
Because of his name recognition, fund-raising ability and political base, Governor Cuomo has longer to make his decision than some of the other candidates, in the view of many Democrats, making the Cuomo factor all the more unpredictable.
In general, presidential hopefuls have felt less pressure to jump into early. Several of the most prominent, including Mr. Gore, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Bradley, had re-election campaigns to occupy them in 1990. As long as they were tied up, others felt free to wait.
Mr. Gore also said there was a "kind of psychological arms control agreement" among potential candidates. "I think there's a feeling on the part of many potential candidates that the race last time really was too long and everybody pays a very high price politically, not to mention personally, in a two-year campaign," he said.
There could be another interpretation for the quiet in the Presidential wing of the Democratic Party: It has yet to find the idea, the issue or the message strong enough to propel candidates onto the field.
For all of that, the hopefuls are beginning to stir. "The fact of the matter is, the nomination is too big a prize and there will be people grabbing for it before long," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker.
Campaign 1990 is over. Campaign 1992, perforce, must begin.

HEADLINE: Failed Dreams - The Collapse of a Harlem Bank;
Freedom Bank's Demise: A Trail Of Risky Loans and Fast Growth

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Earl Dicks remembers the day back in 1964 when he and several co-workers at a Harlem building-supply company scraped up what money they could and bought shares in a new bank opening on 125th Street. Civil rights fervor was coursing through the nation, and Freedom National Bank promised to do what establishment banks had not: to finance the economic aspirations of the nation's pre-eminent black neighborhood.
Three weeks ago, a team of Federal agents strode into the bank, plastered the automatic teller machine with masking tape and padlocked Freedom's doors forever. After a quarter-century of some success and much more struggle, the bank had failed. 
 "You have to remember, this was a bank that had so much promise," Mr. Dicks said a few days later as he stood on 125th Street, a witness to the end of the first black-owned bank in New York and one of the largest minority banks in the nation. "We really wanted it to work, and now it's gone."
While Freedom's depositors and some elected officials complained of the haste with which the Federal Government acted to shut down the bank on Nov. 9, the bank's officers and board members were well aware that it had been severely troubled for years. Freedom National Bank went under because of financial disorder -- imprudent lending practices, good investments spoiled by poor management and sloppy record-keeping that obscured those problems.
 
Short on Economic Resources
 The problems were compounded by Freedom's raison d'etre: to provide money to a community short on economic resources. Its mission was to lend to businesses, homeowners and other consumers in neighborhoods underserved by larger banks. But the neighborhoods Freedom served, and thus the bank's potential borrowers, often did not have enough of the resources and experience that make people good credit risks.
"I tried to balance loans with the community -- often time-consuming loans that weren't really that profitable -- with loans to major corporations," said Sharnia Buford, Freedom's president from 1979 until 1987. "In the minority community, most often we didn't have certified financial statements and other means of checking creditworthiness, so we did a great deal of lending with our hearts, which is risky."
The history of Freedom is also a cautionary tale of an incautious era. Most of the loans that later bankrupted Freedom were made between 1985 and 1987, as shifting alliances ultimately produced a majority on the board that favored fast growth.
Freedom's fall is also a story of the constant tension between the bank's risky mission and its bottom line, of how the battle between an old guard of Harlem business leaders and a new guard of Wall Street professionals toppled that uneasy balance and of 1980's financial ambitions faltering as the decade's boom ended.
"I hate to use a cliche, but when downtown catches a cold, Harlem gets pneumonia," said the Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker of the Canaan Baptist Church, who headed Freedom's board from 1982 to 1985 and served for more than a decade as a director.
 
Bad Loans and Mismanagement
 Federal regulators will only say the bank failed because of "bad loans" and "mismanagement." But through interviews with former bank officials and a review of Federal bank examiners' reports, there emerges a detailed account of the bank's snowballing decline. These are some of the bank regulators' findings:
*Before the bank was closed, it reported that more than 11 percent of its loan portfolio was either in default or far behind in payment, twice the city average. Many of those loans were made without adequate collateral, regulators said. And though most of Freedom's loans did go to minority entrepreneurs in New York, Federal regulators say that as a small community bank, it made an unusual number of loans outside its lending area.
*A small number of unsound investments cost the bank almost $1 million, and its high-quality investments lost money because the bank did not adjust to swings in the stock market after the Wall Street collapse of 1987.
*Poor record-keeping let bank employees conceal mistakes. And Federal bank examiners found a variety of unorthodox procedures, like approving overdrafts on checking accounts so otherwise bankrupt customers could make loan payments.
*Though the bank's board was so involved in day-to-day management that it wanted approval of pamphlets and forms inserted in customers' bank statements, it waited until the final months before the bank's failure to try to save it.
Freedom's last chairman, Isaiah E. Robinson, says that "the board did everything it could to save that bank."
"We had problems, but we were not the only bank with problems," he added, "and it seemed discriminatory to us that the regulators moved so fast to close us down."
Last Thursday, under pressure from New York State officials, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation agreed to pay 50 cents on every uninsured dollar to depositors whose accounts totaled more than the insured limit of $100,000. Many of these are nonprofit community development groups, and they still must struggle to maintain their services on unexpectedly reduced budgets.
In Washington, Federal banking officials are sorting through Freedom's records. In New York, business leaders, civil rights groups, ministers and politicians are trying to raise money to establish a new bank. Out on 125th Street, former customers are trying to decide where to put their money now.
Mr. Dicks never made much on his handful of shares, and stood to lose very little. Neither did most of the hundreds of others waiting in that long cold line to withdraw their money; only deposits above $100,000 were at risk. But for Mr. Dicks and the others, Freedom's failure was the passing of a neighborhood dream of economic independence.
"It has been here so long that it's just hard to believe it's gone forever," said Essie Farrington, treasurer of People Who Care, a community group with a small account at Freedom. "I grew up with Freedom National Bank and it's sort of like losing a friend."
 
Goals and Setbacks
'Bank of Last Resort' For Many in Harlem
 Founded by a group of black and Jewish entrepreneurs led by Jackie Robinson, Freedom made loans that other commercial banks avoided. "In many cases," Isaiah Robinson said, "Freedom was the bank of last resort."
While fulfilling that role, Freedom frequently ran into trouble. By 1974, more than $2 million of its $19 million loan portfolio needed to be written off as losses. A consortium of major banks came up with $3.7 million for Freedom -- investments now unlikely to pay off -- and in the early 1980's Freedom was turning a small profit.
But the bank was soon in dire straits again. Its deterioration, bank regulators and people involved with the bank say, began as many contemporary financial disasters did -- with a divisive takeover attempt.
 
Downtown Fever
 Freedom caught downtown fever about 1982, when Travers J. Bell Jr., the head of the only black-owned brokerage on the New York Stock Exchange, accumulated about 17 percent of Freedom's stock and sought control.
"There was this tension among board members over the Bell assault on Freedom," Dr. Walker recalled. "There were those who were resistant to the Bell group, and there were those who favored the Bell group, and there were those sitting on the fence, and in trying to sort the allegiances, we got distracted from running the bank."
Although the takeover attempt failed, Dan Bell Group, Mr. Bell's holding company, gained three seats on the board. For the first time, outsiders had a hand in running the bank, and they began pushing their growth strategy of more aggressive investments and loans and acquisition of smaller banks.
For more than two years, the Bell group jockeyed with board members backing the bank's president, Mr. Buford, a slow-speaking Texan known as Tab. He favored slow growth, balancing community loans with loans and services for major corporations like Heublein and Philip Morris.
"Since I got there in 1977, the bank had grown from $35 million in assets to $125 million, and we had established another branch," in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, said Mr. Buford, who now owns a Westchester banking and management consulting firm. "I've always said, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' They said different."
In 1988, fresh from a highly touted four-year tenure as Boston's city treasurer, George A. Russell Jr. arrived at Freedom to further this growth. Mr. Bell, who recruited Mr. Russell and had championed the bank's growth, died five days after the new bank president's arrival. But instead of expanding the bank into a $500 million institution to finance minority businesses throughout the New York area, Mr. Russell spent his years as president dealing with the consequences of what Federal regulators called "highly questionable credit underwriting practices."
"I found myself really having to go in and clean up one big mess," he said recently.
Bank examiners' reports describe several loans that were unsecured or granted with little regard for customers' creditworthiness. Freedom lost $806,000 on a loan to the Argrett Enterprises Corporation, a concrete contractor, that was secured against a condominium contract, instead of completed work, the standard way of securing a loan.
An unsecured 1985 loan to the Western Oil and Refining Company of Arizona was not repaid and cost Freedom $293,000. The company's last financial statements were dated September 1985, even though banks are supposed to keep current financial statements.
"Most of these inferior credits were originated under prior management," an examiner from the Federal Comptroller of the Currency's office said in 1989. "This legacy of the past has clearly had a catastrophic impact upon the bank's earnings and capital and jeopardized its very survival."
 
Losses or Potential Losses
 In 1988, the Comptroller's office reported that $7.3 million of Freedom's loans -- more than 7 percent of its portfolio, well above average -- was either in losses or potential losses. About 20 percent of banks Freedom's size had similar losses. In 1989, that loan percentage had risen to what Federal regulators called "an astonishingly high" 9.21 percent.
While by far the largest part of the bank's troubled assets were problem loans, Freedom was also losing money on investments.
When Mr. Russell arrived in 1988, about $60 million, almost 60 percent, of the bank's assets were investments, with most of the rest in loans. It was "more of an investment bank than a commercial bank," he said.
But, he said, no one was tracking the turbulent financial markets to take advantage of their swings. From 1987 to 1990, the difference between what the bank had paid and the investments' market value resulted in an average annual loss of more than $2 million.
 
Some Substandard Investments
 Nearly all the investments were in high-quality securities, but bank examiners in 1988 classified more than $500,000 of them as substandard. Mr. Russell said the bank sold $492,000 of M Corp securities for 24 cents on the dollar, resulting in a $372,268 loss. In 1988, Freedom had taken a $419,000 loss on First Republic Bank holding company notes, sold for 16 cents on the dollar, he said.
The Harlem bank's balance sheets and earnings reports obscured the troubled loan portfolio and poorly managed investments.
In 1988, regulators identified $2 million in problem loans that were not in the bank's reports to the Comptroller's office. Over all, $6.8 million in commercial loans lacked current credit information, the examiner wrote.
One case highlighted by the regulators involved the Johfra Construction Company, a Brooklyn company that was lent $350,000 in 1985. When the owner failed to make the interest payments, his loan officer approved a checking overdraft that added $71,000 to the total owed to the bank. The bank finally charged off $421,000 as a loss.
 
Battling for Bank's Survival
'All Sorts of Problems' In the Last Three Years
 The last three years were a perpetual battle to stay alive.
Mr. Buford resigned in a power struggle with the board in January 1987, some months after a management study by Arthur D. Little concluded that excessive influence by the board over daily operations hampered the bank's performance.
Mr. Russell recalls one board meeting at which instead of discussing ways to attract new capital, directors bickered with management about a standard form used to confirm that customers held accounts.
"We had all sorts of problems, problems that threatened the very existence of the bank, and they were arguing about when we should send out a routine piece of paper work," he said.
Reports show that since at least 1988, Federal regulators had repeatedly demanded that the board find new capital. As loan losses increased from 9.21 percent of assets in 1989 to 11.1 percent in 1990, capital shrank and the need to increase it became more urgent.
In 1988, the regulators prescribed harsh medicine, demanding that the board increase capital, write off bad loans and build up its reserve against loan defaults. But even as the board failed to attract new money, the need to build its defenses reduced its capital pool and its ability to make money through new loans.
"It was circular," Mr. Russell said. "The higher the bank's potential loan losses got, the more capital we had to set aside for reserves and the less capacity we had to lend."
 
Investors to the Rescue
 That fall, Mr. Russell proposed a plan to save the bank. It was approved by the board, Mr. Russell said, and the bank's two major stockholders -- the Harlem Commonwealth Council and the Washington-based Opportunity Funding Corporation, two nonprofit development groups that together controlled just under half the stock -- agreed to put up $1 million each.
But, Mr. Robinson, the bank's last chairman, said, the two groups were hamstrung by Federal laws requiring those holding a majority stake in a bank to divest themselves of other interests.
In late 1989, Federal examiners again downgraded their assessment, warning, "Failure to achieve this objective within a reasonable time period may directly jeopardize this bank's prospects for survival." The board began working to find new investors; it also issued new stock, but the offering did not sell well.
 
Several Plans Dismissed
 After Federal regulators dismissed several recapitalization plans that would have involved Federal assistance, the board approved a merger with the Boston Bank of Commerce, Mr. Robinson said. On Nov. 7, the board and the Boston bank presented the plan to the Comptroller's office, which asked for time to review it.
"Nothing was said to us that day or the next that indicated they were not going to accept that offer," he said. "At least somebody could have said to us, 'Friday is the deadline.' "
Ronald A. Homer, chairman and chief executive of the Boston Bank of Commerce, said regulators informed his bank late that Thursday night that they were unsure that the bank had enough time to raise the money for a merger.
Mr. Russell quickly got in touch with more than 15 potential investors, from the Tisch family to Bill Cosby. But, he said, "the climate, because the S.& L. crisis was so bad, was such that nobody was rushing to buy a bank."
On Nov. 9, the F.D.I.C. closed Freedom forever.
Perhaps Wilbert A. Tatum, publisher of The New York Amsterdam News, expressed the sentiment in Harlem best. "No matter how badly managed it may have been," he said, "it was ours and it was all we had."

Baker Cites 2 Aims: Kuwait and Captives

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said today that the United States would not attack Iraq if President Saddam Hussein withdrew his forces from Kuwait and freed the hostages it holds.
In one sense, Mr. Baker was doing no more than restating the United States intention to enforce the United Nations Security Council resolutions, which are limited to ending Iraq's occuption of Kuwait, restoring the legitimate Government of Kuwait and gaining the release of the hostages. 
 But in recent weeks Administration officials have cited a reason to consider military action that goes beyond the United Nations resolutions: Iraq's continuing efforts to develop nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
While the Administration has never threatened to attack Iraq even after it evacuated Kuwait, some officials have pointed out that such a course has not been explicitly ruled out either.
 
 Bush's Rationale
 President Bush, for example, during his Thanksgiving visit to American troops, cited Iraq's drive to develop nuclear weapons as part of the rationale for considering offensive action. President Hussein has "never possessed a weapon he did not use," Mr. Bush warned.
And in his press conference on Friday, the President again cited Iraq's nuclear capabilities as one of several reasons why the United States has sent troops to the Persian Gulf.
"Imgaine his ability to blackmail his neighbors should he possess a nuclear device," Mr. Bush said on Friday.
Since highlighting the nuclear issue, the Administration had not said authoritatively whether, presuming Iraq withdrew from Kuwait, the United States would rule out attacks on Iraq like the sort that Israel launched to disable Iraqi's Osirak nuclear reactor.
And the Administration's repeated reference to Iraqi nuclear capabilities, as well as President Bush's strong denuciations of President Hussein, has led some lawmakers, such as Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, the second-ranking Democrat on the House Foreigh Affairs Committee, to argue that Mr. Hussein is likely to be uncertain whether the ultimate objectives of the United States go beyond liberating Kuwait to include "the removal of Saddam Hussein from power or the removal of the exotic weapons" in Iraq's arsenal.
Baker Discusses Trip
Mr. Hamilton had urged that the United States open talks with Iraq to clarify its objectives, a step President Bush announced on Friday.
Discussing his upcoming mission to Baghdad, Mr. Baker said in an interview on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" that no military action would be taken if Iraq fully complied with the United Nations resolutions.
"There's never been any suggestion that force would be used if the U.N. resolutions were fully complied with," Mr. Baker said, without specifically addressing the recent comments on Iraq's nuclear program by President Bush, Vice President Quayle and the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft.
"And, if fact, if they were fully complied with, the resolution recently passed by the United Nations would not be self-executing and wouldn't come into force," Mr. Baker asserted, referring to the Security Council resolution on Thursday authorizing the use of military action against Iraq.
"That would give some assurance, it seems to me, that if he complied with the resolutions, his reward for that would not be a military attack by the United States," he said.
 
 Other Issues Left Open
 Mr. Baker said Iraq's compliance with the United Nations resolution was not negotiable, but he was careful to leave open the possibilty of substantive discussions on other issues, such as how to assure stability in the Persian Gulf.
"We will not be negotiating backwards from those United Nations resolutions," Mr. Baker said. "So there won't be a negotiation in that sense."
"The President said we could talk about aspects of the gulf crisism" he said. "Now what the President means by that is political, economic and military." He did not elaborate.
 
 Iraq Test-Fires Missiles
 Mr. Baker's comments came as Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Iraq has test fired Scud surface-to-surface missiles, in a move that some Administration officials take as a demonstration by Iraq of its military abilities.
An Administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the Iraqis test-fired two Scud missiles over a distance of about 200 miles. The missiles were launched inside and landed inside Iraq, and they flew on a southeast to northwest trajectory.
Missles would be launched on an east to west trajectory if Iraq launched an attack on Israel or Sryia. But one senior Administration official said that the trajectory chosen may have represented an effort by Iraq to fire the missiles away from American forces in Saudi Arabia and into an unpopulated area.
Mr. Cheney said on the ABC News program "This Week" that it was the first time the missiles have been flight-tested since April. Mr. Cheney added that the missiles have a range of 360 to 400 miles, depending on which variant is used, and that they are accurate enough to hit cities but not accurate enough to hit more specific targets.
Iraq has previously armed the missiles with high explosives, but American and Israeli officials assume for the purposes of military planning that Iraq may be able to arm them with poison gas.
 
 Several Questions Raised
 Mr. Bush's decision to open talks with Iraq and Mr. Baker's clarification today of American objectives raised several key questions.
If Iraqi forces leave Kuwait and a settlement is reached, how will the United States slow down the Iraqi nuclear program and reduce Iraq's other military abilities, such as its ballistic missiles, that threaten the area?
Would the current blockade against Iraq's oil exports be maintained to deprive Baghdad of revenues needed to maintain its weapons programs?
Would some American forces continue to be based in the Persian Gulf as a military counterweight to Iraq? Where would they be deployed and at what strength?
Iraq's Ambassador to the United States, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, said today that American efforts to disable Iraq's military were unacceptable.
 
 Further Sanctions Seen

Mr. Cheney -- who is scheduled to testify with Gen. Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Monday -- said some form of international sanctions would still be needed to prevent Iraq from acquiring dangerous military technologies, but he was not specific on how they would work.
In other developments, Mr. Bush's statement that he would invite ambassadors from several of the nations in the multinational coalition against Iraq to take part in the Baghdad talks appears to have been dropped in light of Iraq's statements that it would invite "countries and parties that are connected with unresolved disputes and issues," an apparent reference to the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Mr. Scowcroft said today that "perhaps the best thing to do is to make the talks bilateral on both ends so that we don't get to haggling about the shape of the table."
He also said on the CBS News program "Face the Nation" that Iraqis have continued to supply some provisions to the American Embassy in Kuwait, which is running short of food. The Iraqi move appears to reflect concern that the United States might use its concern over a shortage of food at the embassy, which Mr. Bush has pledged to keep open, as a rationale to intervene militarily.

HEADLINE: Holding Recession at Bay

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, admitted to Congress last week that the nation's economy is shrinking. One day later the Government reported that its index of future economic activity had fallen for the fourth consecutive month. That's compelling, though not foolproof, evidence that the economy is headed for recession.
To many private economists Mr. Greenspan's admission is belated, a sign perhaps that the Fed has relied too long on outdated statistics that fail to capture the relevant indicators of recession in today's economy. Worse yet, his admission was unaccompanied by a stated resolve to turn the economy around with a modest easing of interest rates to spur economic activity. Mr. Greenspan's position is that there is little the Fed can do to offset the impact of the crisis in the Persian Gulf and other recessionary forces. 
There's an important middle ground in this debate. No one would want the Fed to engage in an inflationary increase in the money supply. But the Fed could modestly nudge interest rates lower and reign in overzealous bank regulators who are inadvertently contributing to a credit crunch. This might not be enough to keep the economy growing. But it's the only relief in sight.
Mr. Greenspan has received high marks for his stewardship of the Fed by liberal and conservative economists alike. He's kept monetary policy loose enough to permit modest growth for the past several years, but not so loose that inflation spiraled. That's not been easy, especially in the wake of stock market crashes and oil shocks.
But the Fed chairman is getting somewhat lower marks for current policy. He's kept the money supply growing near the bottom of the Fed's targeted range, allowing only a minor fall in interest rates. Perhaps that's because, as Prof. Jeremy Siegel of the Wharton Business School suggests, the Fed's forecasting tools are outdated. Past recessions have started in goods markets, like autos and steel, where forecasting measures have been developed to track changes in production and inventories. But this recession is different. It has begun primarily in the service sector, for which economists have not yet developed useful indices of future activity.
Many economists are now calling for the Fed to become more aggressive. That would not necessarily require a change in Fed policy, just an increase in money supply growth rates toward the top of the targeted range. Some estimate that would be enough to lower interest rates by about one percentage point.
The advice is sound. Inflation, once the temporary impact of higher energy prices is excluded, is in check. The Fed has room to loosen credit without worry.
The Fed could also deal with the problem of "credit crunch." Banks aren't lending the funds they already have on hand. A shaky real estate and business climate has sobered loan officers. But part of the problem, at least judging from anecdotal evidence, lies with bank regulators who are scaring lenders away from all but their blue-chip customers. Here, Mr. Greenspan could exert moral suasion to get the loan officers back on track.
There is no cause for panic or hysteria. The economy is limping, but not lame. The unemployment rate is still an enviable 5.7 percent and, with wages rising slowly, shows no signs of exploding. Yet the risk of serious recession now outweighs the risk of serious inflation. That should embolden the normally cautious Fed to act a bit less cautiously.

HEADLINE: Consumers Borrow Less

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Consumers were scaling back borrowing in the July-September quarter as the economy appeared to be headed toward a recession, a banking group said Monday.
The percentage of consumer loans 30 or more days delinquent was a seasonally adjusted 2.56 percent at the end of the third quarter, virtually unchanged from the 2.55 percent rate at the end of the April-June period, the American Bankers Association said. 
 The rate was 2.46 percent at the end of the first quarter and 2.64 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 1989.
"Consumers are well aware of the slowing economy and are making efforts to consolidate and repay debts, rather than take on new ones," said Robert H. Dugger, chief economist of the trade group.
Government data show consumers are taking fewer loans, he said, while anecdotal evidence from bankers indicates financially strong households may be taking out less expensive and longer-term home equity loans to pay off other consumer loans and reduce their monthly payments.
Mr. Dugger said he expected the number of consumers behind on loan payments to be higher when figures are reported for the final three months of this year.
Michael K. Evans, a Washington economist and consultant, said consumer loan delinquencies generally did not rise significantly until well into a recession.
The lack of movement in the national delinquency rate masks sharp variations among regions. Consumers were hit hardest in the Northeast and least in the West and Midwest.

The Squeeze On Drugstores

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH few doctors make house calls, many drugstores still deliver prescriptions to the homes of elderly customers. Scrambling to retain customer loyalty in the highly competitive retail pharmacy business, many drugstores specialize in advice and services. Eighty-five percent have also purchased computer systems that cost $10,000 and up, and some even have satellite links to keep supplies and insurers' payments flowing.
The McKesson Corporation's PCS pharmacy card unit, for example, operates a national electronic claims-processing network. An identification card with a magnetic stripe is passed like a credit card through a $200 device, which quickly tells the druggist what the customer's health plan pays for. The bill goes electronically to a data processing center in Scottsdale, Ariz., which pays the pharmacies every two weeks. 
 Prompt payment is vital to the nation's 55,000 pharmacies, for their pretax profit margins have fallen to 3 percent from 5.5 percent in the 1960's. Pharmacists are being squeezed by insurers, which increasingly insist on price discounts. Insurer guidelines on prescribing drugs are followed by about 22 percent of all office-based doctors, and the number is growing, said John Schaetzl, vice president of Scott-Levin Associates, a consulting firm in Newtown, Pa., that surveys physicians.
As retailing categories overlap and blur, retail druggists have had to compete with big discount chains like K Mart and Wal-Mart Stores, each with 1,000 or more pharmacies; mail-order pharmacy services, and supermarket chains, which are accustomed to even lower profit margins, based onmoving products off the shelf faster than drugstores do. And in the front of their stores, the druggists compete with the health and beauty aids sections of groceries, convenience stores, variety stores and specialty discount stores.
But the pharmacy business can also be difficult for such competitors. Joseph Thomas 3d, an economist at Purdue University, said the expenses in operating a pharmacy "are very different from operating a grocery." He added, "You need pharmacists, people with knowledge and time, willing to answer questions about over-the-counter products." A sign in the West Main Pharmacy, an independent store in Penns Grove, N.J., says, "Please ask our pharmacists questions before you purchase over-the-counter drugs."
"We foresee gross margins in the pharmacy business continuing to drop," said David D. Bernauer, vice president and treasurer of the Walgreen Company, which is based in Deerfield, Ill. "The bottom line to the whole thing is: Who can most efficiently distribute that prescription to the customer?" Walgreen stores, which deal with 800 insurance plans, are linked by satellite to a computer center in Mount Prospect, Ill. "In five seconds, we check the patient's eligibility and other parameters like which drugs are covered, the number of days' supply, whether generics are mandatory," he said. "The system greatly reduces the percentage of rejects and dishonored claims and the cost of shipping paperwork." Sales at Walgreen's 1,575 stores are growing by 20 percent annually, reflecting rising drug prices and the addition of 110 stores this year, Mr. Bernauer said.
To compete with the chains, independents like the West Main Pharmacy work on customer service. "We can't always match the dollar figure," said Louis A. Mitchell, the owner, who is in the store daily from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M. "My main concern is that the patient has to be satisfied that what they are doing is based on good sound advice."
Don Moore, an independent pharmacist who is president of the Moore Drugstore in Kokomo, Ind., maintains a staff nurse for consultations.
"All retail drugstores, whether they are independent or chains, are being squeezed much more today," said David Malmberg, vice president for strategic planning with McKesson's wholesale unit, the nation's largest drug wholesaler.
Insurers that pay most of the cost of drugs directly to the store may account for 75 percent of the prescription business by the end of the decade, said Robert J. Mandelbaum, a pharmacist who is a vice president of the 1,136-store Revco chain, based in Twinsburg, Ohio. Revco is adding patient counseling areas to its stores.
Some druggists are developing niche markets like joint ventures with hospitals to supply equipment for home health care. And Fay's, based in Liverpool, N.Y., which has 185 drugstores, is opening free-standing operations just to supply nursing homes. "They are a large growth end of our prescription business," said Henry A. Panasci, Fay's chairman.

HEADLINE: VIETNAM PUBLISHES PLAN FOR ECONOMY

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Vietnam has devised a new plan to end decades of poverty that is intended to double the nation's income by the year 2000, cut inflation to single digits and increase export values five times.
Officials said the ruling Communist Party hoped the economic blueprint and a political platform, which were published on Friday, would give Vietnam's aging socialist system a facelift but maintain the state's grip on society. 
 "Until now we are still among the poorest countries of the world," was the beginning of the plan, published in three leading state newspapers.
The draft was approved by Communist leaders last week and will be debated nationwide before being submitted to a full congress in May, officials said.
 
Uneven Economic Growth
 Vietnam's economy, ravaged by poor state management and war with the United States and others, has grown unevenly since limited economic reforms were instituted three years ago. Moves to increase rice production and end inflation last year proved short-lived.
The plan -- called the Draft Strategy of Socio-Economic Stabilization and Development Up to the Year 2000 -- blamed many of the problems of the last few decades on Communist dogmatism. It listed three main goals: making people richer, introducing a multi-faceted economy and creating a more open economic system.
Among the Government's goals are doubling the country's per-capita income, which was given as between $200 and $210, and raising rice production by 50 percent, to 30 million tons. Electricity output would triple under the plan and inflation, hovering around 50 percent after reaching nearly 1,000 percent in 1988, would be less than 10 percent by 1995, the newspapers said.
The draft plan set as a goal a fivefold increase for the value of exports by the year 2000. In 1988, Vietnam's exports were worth $1.07 billion.
 
Hard-Liners Giving Way
 Diplomats said the targets were ambitious but not unattainable.
In recent years, hard-line Communist officials who dealt with economic planning have given way to educated technocrats, and party ideologues have stressed the value of basic market forces.
But Vietnam, denied aid and Western investment because of its 1978 invasion of Cambodia, has yet to secure investor confidence or enough capital to dent shortages in basic infrastructure and industry.
It has also failed to address short-term problems that have aroused fears of a Soviet-style crisis in basic foods.
Severe cuts in aid from the Soviet Union, its chief ally, have distorted the limited reforms that have been undertaken. Many civil servants have not been paid for five months. Hopes for a bumper rice crop this year are being threatened by a fertilizer shortage.

HEADLINE: Neediest Cases Fund Helps a Divorced Father

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
It is the type of story that movies are based on. A divorced man is frustrated in his efforts to raise his four daughters. A young housekeeper arrives, dissipates the atmosphere of chaos, charms the girls and teaches him to be the perfect father.
The real-life version is set in the streets of the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, and the co-producers are the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service and The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
 Jeffery A., a 37-year-old unemployed man, lives in a third-floor walk-up apartment with exposed nails, chipped paint and holes in the ceiling. The lobby smells of urine. Four men have been shot on this block in the last year. His daughters occasionally find crack vials and hypodermic needles in the halls.
But these problems are nothing, Jeffery said yesterday, compared with the difficulty of dressing, feeding, bathing and disciplining four daughters who are 10 years old or younger. "Chaos" is the word he used to describe it.
 
Awarded Custody
 In 1988, Jeffery was awarded custody of his four girls after his wife, from whom he was separated, was diagnosed as mentally ill. After a year, social workers visited and saw a loving, devoted father struggling to get by. His daughters had uncombed, matted hair. The youngest, then 2 1/2 years old, needed to be toilet-trained. The clutter in the apartment made it a fire trap.
Through the assistance of the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, Jeffery was assigned a homemaker who comes to his apartment five days a week to help organize the housekeeping and child care. Money from the Neediest Cases Fund helps to pay for this service.
Jeffery's family is one of hundreds that the fund has assisted. All the money that is raised goes to the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service and six other charities that use it to help the sick and the needy. Along with providing the poor with food, shelter, clothing and other services, the Neediest Cases Fund helps about 120 families to receive regular homemaker visits from the Brooklyn agency.
 
Trouble With Braids
 Yesterday morning, Jeffery sat with his youngest daughter, Erin, now almost 4, perched on his knee. Her hair was in neat cornrows with a top knot and braided pigtails, held in place by two heart-shaped white barrettes.
"There are a lot of things I can do around this house, but these braids aren't one of them," he said. "My hands just can't do that. I can comb out and take care of my oldest's, but Erin's hair is too short for my fingers."
The homemaker, Sharon Taylor, 22, does Erin's braids, and many other household chores. When Miss Taylor arrived yesterday morning, she immediately started sweeping the apartment. Erin followed her as she went from room to room.
This is Miss Taylor's fourth -- and favorite -- placement as a homemaker. In past jobs, she has been threatened by a mother with a knife and had children scream and hit her, she said. It is unusual to be working for a single father since most of the homemakers' cases involve single mothers, but it has worked out well.
Miss Taylor has also taught Jeffery how to do better at many chores -- like planning his children's meals and buying in bulk. (There are 15 boxes of cereal in the kitchen.) And the girls' clothing is no longer in piles on the floor but organized in an old dresser and in garbage bags.
Jeffery is almost ready to survive on his own, Miss Taylor said. "All he needs to learn now is braids, and he's got it all down," she said. In the next year, her services will be phased out, and he will be on his own again -- and better prepared.

HEADLINE: New York Adopts Rules to Spread Projects Fairly

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
The New York City Planning Commission adopted final guidelines yesterday aimed at distributing city projects, from homeless shelters to libraries and from jails to parks, more evenly among both rich and poor communities.
Required under the new City Charter, the guidelines are the first such municipal rules in the nation. They are intended, in part, to end the city's practice of placing a disproportionate share of programs for the homeless, the mentally ill and drug abusers in the poorest neighborhoods. 
 Such programs have often beenplaced wherever there was available low-cost city-owned land or buildings, and under the new guidelines that will undoubtedly still happen. But now economic considerations are to be among a variety of other considerations the Planning Commission will have to take into account.
The guidelines, which take effect immediately, apply to the opening, closing and major expansions or reductions of a city project from landfills to police stations.
"Certainly the commission is going to be sensitive to the costs to the city," said its chairman, Richard L. Shaffer. "But the financial cost is only one kindof cost. There are other kinds of costs as well."
He also said: "I think what this will do is insure an open process with full information. My hope is that that will bring some more rationality to the process."
 
 7 Hearings Lead to Changes
 After seven public hearings since Mayor David N. Dinkins first proposed the guidelines last summer, the commission revised them in a number of ways.
One of the biggest changes was to minimize strict numerical calculations in determining whether the addition ofa particular residential project -- like a 100-bed shelter -- to a neighborhood would push that area over the citywide average for such programs.
Under the original proposals, if a project pushed a community over the threshold, the city could proceed only after making a number of public findings, including certifying that the site was the only feasible one.
Now, the commission still has to take such comparative ratios into account, but need not make such highly specific explanations for exceeding them.
The final guidelines also specify that the city must take into account existing private, state and Federal programs as part of the base of projects in a neighborhood when making decisions about where to place new projects of its own. The guidelines now define a significant expansion or reduction of a program asa change of 25 percent, rather than 50 percent.
And the revised guidelines also require the commission to consider the compatibility of any new project with existing ones, and the extent to which a neighborhood's character would be hurt by a concentration of programs.
Joseph Rose, director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a nonprofit research group, said the rules were a fine start at adressing complex issues. But he said the real test would come when the Planning Commission tried to apply them to individual projects.
"The particular cases are going to be very tough," he said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Jumps and Gold Falls After Reports of Joint Steps

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed sharply higher yesterday, lifted by reports that the leading industrial nations will step in to halt the currency's recent slide.
In response to the dollar's advance, gold prices tumbled more than $6 an ounce in New York. 
 Analysts said the dollar was lifted by reports that the Group of Seven industrial nations would meet in January to discuss actions to stabilize the currency.
Those seven nations -- the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada -- have said little as the dollar plunged in recent months. That reticence contributed to the currency's slide as traders took the lack of public statements as a sign that the Group of Seven wanted a lower dollar, so speculation that the group was about to take a stand sent the dollar higher.
Barbara Clay, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, declined to comment yesterday on the speculation.
Kevin Lawrie, senior foreign exchange manager at the Bank of Boston, said the Persian Gulf crisis continued to affect dollar trading, with rumors alternately prompting buying and selling. The dollar is seen as a relatively safe investment in times of international strife.
"We're all looking over our shoulder," he said. "It's very volatile and confusing."
Overseas traders said the dollar was also supported by the Treasury's twice-a-year report to Congress on international economic and exchange-rate policy. The report stressed the Government's desire to see improvement in the trade deficit through fundamental economic factors rather than through a weak dollar.
The dollar surged against the British pound, which fell to $1.9180 in New York, from $1.9430 late Friday. Earlier in London, the pound fell to $1.9205, from $1.9400 late Friday.
The dollar also jumped against the Japanese yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 134.74 yen, up from 132.50 late Friday. In Tokyo trading overnight, the dollar rose 0.25 yen to close at 133.00 yen, and it was quoted later in London at 134.35 yen.
Against the German currency, the dollar rose to 1.51395 marks, from 1.5020 on Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with the late Friday prices, included: 1.2935 Swiss francs, up from 1.2770; 5.1135 French francs, up from 5.0580; 1,138.00 Italian lire, up from 1,125.25, and 1.16625 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16475.
Gold prices fell as the dollar rose, amid some optimism that the Persian Gulf crisis might be peacefully resolved.
In New York, an ounce of gold closed at $376.60 on the Commodity Exchange, down $6.70. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $375.50, down $6.50.
Silver prices rose. In New York, silver gained 1.6 cents to close at $4.138 an ounce on the Comex. Silver had risen earlier to a late bid price in London of $4.16, from $4.11 on Friday.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Rise in Slow Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose in sluggish trading yesterday, pushed higher by a round of foreign buying during overnight trading.
The gains, which amounted to as much as 3/4 point for some securities, were not sustained after trading shifted to the United States, even though a survey of the nation's purchasing managers showed that conditions in the manufacturing sector deteriorated in November. 
 Most economists had been expecting that the monthly Purchasing Managers Index would show a decline, but the drop, to the lowest point since November 1982, when the economy was in recession, exceeded expectations.
The index surveys manufacturers' plans to purchase raw materials for their products. A drop in the index indicates lower production plans. The recessionary implications could be expected to cause fixed-income securities prices to rise, as investors buy bonds to lock in current rates.
"The number was a great one for the market, but we couldn't hold the highs," one trader of government bonds said. "There was no retail follow-through on a very, very bullish number."
 
 Too Much Bullish Sentiment?
 Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., research firm, said that "given the lack of reaction to the purchasing managers' report, you have to wonder if, for the short term, there isn't too much bullish sentiment already built into prices."
Mr. McCarthy and other market participants said that a rise in oil prices and remarks by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney might have dampened enthusiasm to buy Treasury securities.
Mr. Cheney told Congress yesterday that he was skeptical that negotiations with Iraq would lead to a solution to the gulf crisis. He added that military force rather than economic sanctions was the only sure way of forcing Iraq to end its occupation of Kuwait.
"If you could pinpoint one event that took the starch out of the market, it was Cheney's remarks," Mr. McCarthy said.
Nevertheless, prices closed higher on the day.
 
 30-Year Bonds Up 3/8
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered late yesterday at a price of 104 1/4, up 3/8 point, to yield 8.35 percent, compared with 8.39 percent late Friday.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 14/ 32, up 10/32, to yield 8.36 percent. And the 7 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 30/32, up 1/8 point, to yield 7.88 percent.
At the Treasury's weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills, the three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.06 percent, up from the average 7.02 percent rate at last week's sale.
Six-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 6.96 percent, unchanged from the auction a week ago.
 
 Ford Motor Offers Notes
 In the market for investment-grade corporate bonds, the Ford Motor Credit Company offered $300 million of three-year notes through an underwriting syndicate led by the First Boston Corporation.
The 9 1/8 percent notes, which mature Dec. 15, 1995, were priced at $99.78, to yield 9.18 percent, 1.3 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 3/4 percent three-year notes at the time of pricing.
The notes, which are noncallable for life, are rated AA-3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and AA- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The decline in interest rates made November a good month for all investors in fixed-income securities, including the high-yield "junk bond" market.
 
 Positive Returns
 Last month, an index of 344 securities compiled by First Boston posted a positive return of 2.01 percent, the first positive month since July. By comparison, 10-year Treasury notes posted a positive return of 2.88 percent, First Boston said.
Yields on the bonds included in the index declined to 18.74 percent, from 19.12 percent in October.
Prices of most high-yield issues were little changed in light trading yesterday, dealers said.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, prices of most issues were unchanged.
Meanwhile, participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds said that prices of most widely quoted issues rose by 1/8 point to 1/4 point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Shakeout Begins Among British Sunday Papers

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
A shrinking British newspaper market has claimed its first victim, The Sunday Correspondent, and some in the industry believe the Sunday market for serious papers is still too crowded for all to survive through the current advertising recession.
The Correspondent, in which the Tribune Company of Chicago held a 17.5 percent stake, was closed last week just 14 months after its debut. The paper represented Tribune's attempt to get a toehold in the European market. A Tribune spokeswoman, Martha Lindeman, said the company had invested "between $7 million and $10 million" in the venture. 
 The closing comes at a time of extreme flux in the British newspaper market. Several papers are losing money. Meanwhile, media companies from Spain and Italy are investing in British newspapers in preparation for the creation of a single European market in 1992.
 
 Tribune's Problems
 The Correspondent was started as a serious, balanced, full-sized paper. In September, it became a tabloid in a bid to raise its slumping circulation.
Ms. Lindeman denied that the decision to close The Correspondent was related to Tribune's problems at The Daily News in New York, where analysts believe the company is losing $15 million to $20 million a month because of a strike that has cut The News's circulation in half. "We were just one of many stockholders in The Correspondent, and The Daily News was not a factor," she said.
But Peter Shott, the chief executive of Sunday Newspaper Publishing P.L.C., which published The Correspondent, said he had extensive talks with Scott C. Smith, Tribune's chief financial officer, during last-ditch efforts to save the paper. Mr Shott said the essential message from Chicago was that "we have enough on our plates with The Daily News and the general recessionary climate in the newspaper business." Mr. Smith declined to comment.
When it closed, The Correspondent had a circulation of 207,000, far short of the 400,000 that management said was needed to break even. Even the 207,000 figure was not accepted by Britain's Audit Bureau of Circulations, because it included promotional sales. The last audited circulation figure, for August, was 149,241.
 
 $60 Million Invested
 Other shareholders in the paper included The Guardian and Manchester Evening News P.L.C. with about 10 percent, Robert Maxwell's Mirror Group with about 15 percent, two Middle Eastern investors with about 17 percent each, and investment firms with a total of about 12 percent.
Mr. Shott said that about $60 million had been invested in The Correspondent and that 200 jobs were lost when the paper closed.
When The Correspondent was started last year, the British newspaper market was still riding a wave of innovation and optimism that began in 1986, when Rupert Murdoch overcame fierce union resistance and succeeded in introducing new technology at The Times and his other papers. Costs tumbled, and new newspapers like The Independent flourished.
But toward the end of last year, a steep advertising recession began and readership started to slip. Moreover, The Correspondent's debut was followed last January by the introduction of The Independent on Sunday, giving readers a choice of five serious Sunday papers. Analysts believe that only the runaway market leader, The Sunday Times, is profitable. The other two papers are The Observer and The Sunday Telegraph.
 
 'Beginning of a Severe Downturn'
 "It was very unfortunate that two new Sunday papers were launched at the beginning of a severe downturn," said Carla Tammenoms Bakker, European media analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company. "It would have been a miracle if all had survived."
Even without The Correspondent, "things are so bad at the moment that it would be foolhardy to rule out more casualties," said Stephen Fay, the deputy editor of The Independent on Sunday.
Henry Porter, an associate editor of The Independent on Sunday, said that although it expected to gain 25,000 to 30,000 readers from The Correspondent's collapse, the paper would still be more than 60,000 short of the roughly 470,000 circulation needed to break even.
Start-up costs at The Independent on Sunday have strained the finances of its parent company. For the year ended Sept. 30, Newspaper Publishing P.L.C. posted a pretax loss of close to $8 million.
 
 Stakes in The Independent
 Last month, the company said El Pais, a newspaper in Barcelona, Spain, and La Repubblica, based in Rome, were each acquiring a 14.9 percent stake in The Independent and The Independent on Sunday for a total of $86 million.
Mr. Shott said the last attempt to save The Correspondent involved an effort to merge it with Today, a money-losing tabloid owned by Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation. But The Correspondent was unable to raise $40 million in new equity needed for the venture.
Ms. Tammenoms Bakker of Morgan Stanley predicted that "newspaper advertising will be weak through most of next year," suggesting that the problems of British papers are far from over.

HEADLINE: At Trade Talks, Fear of Collapse

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 3

 BODY:
At the end of the first day of a pivotal week of talks to liberalize world trade, fears grew that a continuing stalemate in negotiations on farm trade could lead to a collapse of the negotiations.
After two hours of talks on agricultural trade ended tonight, officials from the United States and several other farm-exporting countries voiced dismay about the European Community's failure to make concessions to reduce protection to farmers. 
 With officials from more than 100 nations meeting here today, numerous ministers said that to conclude in an agreement before Friday's deadline, progress had to be made in the next day or two on the central issue: reducing subsidies to farmers.
The United States and 13 other farm-exporting nations have proposed slashing farm subsidies by 75 percent over the next 10 years, while the European Community has proposed cuts of 30 percent. Canada, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and the United States have criticized the community for opposing greater cuts, and ministers grew worried tonight after European officials did not make a more liberal offer.
After tonight's talks on farm trade, Donald F. Mazankowski who is Canada's Farm Minister and its Deputy Prime Minister, said that unless there were some substantial indications of change from the European Community, "there is not much point in continuing the discussions."
Clayton K. Yeutter, the American Agriculture Secretary, added that "there was essentially zero support for the European Community position" at the meeting, the first session in which agriculture was discussed.
A four-year round of talks aimed at liberalizing world trade rules is scheduled to end with five days of this week's talks in Brussels. The goal of the negotiations is to promote economic growth by setting new, more liberal rules for the world's $4 billion in trade and for the first time including agriculture, textiles, financial services and intellectual property under the trade rules.
The talks are sponsored by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based organization, and are called the Uruguay Round because they began in that country in 1986.
Early today, European Community officials had sought to put the United States on the defensive by asserting that Washington was demanding unrealistically large cuts in aid to farmers. They also sought to go on the offensive by calling Washington protectionist for having proposed that several key sectors -- shipping, aviation and telecommunications -- be excluded from international trade rules.
 
Protest by Farmers
 Community officials seemed heartened that 25,000 European farmers gathered in Brussels today for a raucous protest against further cuts in farm aid. They pointed to the rally as evidence of how difficult it would be for them to agree to the cuts in farm aid that the United States and other nations are demanding.
Daniel Gremillet, a dairy farmer from the Lorraine region in France, said: "The American proposals are unrealistic. They would crush us." He and other farmers said that if approved, the American proposals would drive half of Europe's farmers out of business in the next 10 years.
Frans Andriessen, the community's Trade Commissioner, said that if the 12-nation community was to make further concessions on farm trade, then other nations, especially the United States, must make concessions, too.
"How can you expect me to make new proposals on agriculture, when we don't get anything in return?" Mr. Andriessen said.
Many officials here expressed profound uncertainty over whether this week's talks would result in an agreement.
"I am cautiously optimistic because everyone is saying what a catastrophe would be if the talks fall apart," said Willy de Clerq, the chairman of the European Parliament's delegation.
 
 Talk of a Bluff
 Nonetheless, the threat of collapse hung over the conference. This afternoon Australia's Trade Minister, Neal Blewett, said there was no point continuing the talks if the European Community did not come forward with a broader offer to cut farm protecton by Tuesday night.
He said he hoped European Community officials would not succumb to the pressures of the protesting farmers. "I'm disappointed that European leaders have not prepared their farmers for change," he said.
Some Europeans said that Australia's implied threats to walk out of the talks was a bluff to put more pressure on the community to make concessions.
To break the deadlock in agriculture, Washington wants the European Community to agree to reduce protection in three areas: internal supports, import barriers and export subsidies. The community has agreed to cut internal subsidies, but the United States and other farm-exporting countries say it has been vague about reducing protection in the other two areas.
In another area, reducing trade barriers in services, European officials criticized Washington for blocking progress. Peter Lilley, Britain's Minister for Trade and Industry, said the United States had originally pushed to include services in the Uruguay Round. Now, he said, "there seems to be a reluctance in the United States to go the whole hog."
European officials said American officials had bowed to domestic corporate pressures and were seeking to exclude shipping, aviation and telecommunications from new trade rules. Washington has also been criticized for proposing that most-favored-nation status not be granted to all nations in services, with American officials saying that only when a nation has an open market should it be granted that status. Under that status, if a country gives preferential trade treatment to one nation, then all nations should receive that treatment.

HEADLINE: Economic Index Hits 8-Year Low

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Hit hard by lower production and a decline in new orders, the nation's manufacturing economy slowed in November to the lowest level since the recession of the early 1980's, a survey of purchasing managers has found.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said yesterday that its index of economic activity fell to 41.3 percent, the weakest showing since November 1982, when the index stood at 39.2 percent. In October, the index was at 43.3 percent. 
 Economists said the report underscored their feeling that the nation's economy was heading into recession. The Commerce Department said on Friday that the Government index of the leading economic indicators fell in October, for the fourth consecutive month, by 1.2 percent. And Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress on Wednesday that economic activity had been contracting since last month.
 
 Wide Range of Industries
 The purchasing managers' report is considered an important economic indicator because it is based on a survey of managers from a wide range of the nation's industrial companies. It is also the first important indicator released each month.
The report for last month also stated that the December index, if unchanged from the November level, would mean that growth in the gross national product for the entire year would be nine-tenths of a percent and that G.N.P. would decline in the fourth quarter by about six-tenths of a percent.
In contrast, G.N.P. rose by 2.9 percent in 1989, and by five-tenths of a percent in the fourth quarter of last year.
 
 Weakness in New Orders
 "The negative growth in the United States economy, registered in October for the first time in 10 years, has deepened in November," said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the purchasing managers' business survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc. "With the engine of the economy, new orders, at its lowest point in over eight years, it appears likely the negative trend will continue for some time."
The weakness in new orders reported by the purchasing managers was cited by economists as the greatest indicator of troubles in manufacturing. The index of new orders dropped to 39.4 percent in November, from 43.8 percent in October. The November level is the lowest since May 1982, when the index stood at 38.1 percent.
"The economic decline will not bottom until this index stops falling," the report said.
Neal Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation, said: "The industrial sector has been in recession for some time and there is nothing that suggests an early rebound. New orders are weak and inventories are already low, which suggests that you won't get the rebound that sometimes comes when there is too little inventory."
Production fell in November for the fourth consecutive month, with the association's production index falling to 41.8 percent, from 43 percent in October. "Considering that the new-orders index is the weakest in over eight years, it is unrealistic to expect a reverse soon," the report said.
 
 Prices Rise Again
 Prices that manufacturers pay for goods rose in November for the sixth consecutive month, but the rate of increase dropped from that of October. The report said that despite increases in the costs of raw material to manufacturers, customers had resisted price increases. The report said that inflation as a result of the crisis in the Persian Gulf had probably peaked and that price increases would largely subside in the next year or so.
The level of exports continued to increase in November, with the association's index of new export orders rising to 55 percent, from 51 percent in October.
The level of imports declined in November for the seventh consecutive month, with the imports index dropping to 42 percent, from 46.5 percent in October.
Prices of several items were said to be higher in November, including chemicals and other items that contain crude oil or derivatives. Other items that were higher priced included solvents, sulfur, ammonia and caustic soda, which is heavily used in making paper.

HEADLINE: As Airlines Stumble, Rivals Circle

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
If the combination of high jet-fuel prices and low-paying passengers persists through the winter, the unrelenting consolidation in the airline industry that pushed Continental Airlines into bankruptcy will claim other weakened carriers, several analysts said yesterday.
"It's a Darwinian situation," said Timothy Pettee, transportation analyst at Alliance Capital Management, a money management firm in New York. "The strong shall survive and the strong will pick off what's left of the weak airlines. There will be more bankruptcies." 
 With operations hurt by jet-fuel prices that have doubled since summer, and an economy that appears to be growing weaker by the month, the nation's airlines expect total losses of at least $1 billion in this quarter alone, industry experts say. They add that losses will possibly be that high in the first quarter of next year.
 
 Costly 2-for-1 Programs
 Adding to their problems, the airlines began a costly wave of two-for-one fare promotions last month, when they could ill afford them.
Analysts said the airlines that outlast the industry's latest turmoil will probably be those holding at least 10 percent of the market for domestic air travel, which include American, United, Delta and Northwest. Others with smaller market share, like Pan Am and Trans World Airlines, are candidates to join Continental in bankruptcy, or to sell most assets to larger rivals.
Indeed, Wall Street saw the Continental bankruptcy as good news for the strongest carriers. The shares of AMR, the parent of American Airlines, rose $1.25, to $48.50. The stock of UAL, the parent of United, moved up $1.875, to $99.375, and shares of Delta Air Lines rose $1.75, to $58.50.
Kevin C. Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, said one reason airlines suffered low profits in the 1980's, compared with other domestic industries, was that most operated with more aircraft than passenger demand could support. Before Congress deregulated the industry in 1978, routes and prices were controlled by the Government.
 
A Better Return Ahead
 "This is the last stage of the post-deregulation era," Mr. Murphy said. "With the move toward fewer carriers and higher fares, it will mean you have a better rate of return for investors, creditors will be able to get paid, and employees will have more job stability."
Some analysts said airline stocks rose because the big carriers were likely to chip away at Continental's share by adding competing flights on its most profitable routes. They expressed doubt that Continental would emerge from bankruptcy as a potent, if smaller, carrier.
Continental was particularly vulnerable because of the interest costs for its huge debts. It had been flirting with bankruptcy for months.
 
 2 Others in Deep Trouble
 Pan Am and T.W.A., two others that were considered weak long before the current troubles began, could be pushed over the brink, the analysts said. Both have pared operations in recent months.
T.W.A. laid off 950 of its 33,000 employees in the last two months, and reduced daily flights 14 percent. Its St. Louis hub, for instance, will have 247 departures by the middle of this month, compared with 302 a year ago.
Pan Am dismissed 2,500 of its 29,000 workers in the last two months. Last month, it announced a deal with United to sell its London routes and one aircraft, and said it would work with United on marketing programs.
Northwest, facing a $1 billion increase in jet-fuel costs for 1991, if prices stay above $1 a gallon, said it had cut $200 million from its 1991 budget by eliminating flights.
Reeling from both the self-inflicted wounds and those caused by outside forces, many industry executives want the Bush Administration to pressure the oil industry to ease prices for jet fuel, much as the President asked oil companies for restraint on gasoline prices after the Kuwait invasion in August.
Lee Howard, head of Airline Economics, a consulting firm in Washington, said jet-fuel costs now represent about 25 percent of an airlines' operating expenses, compared with an average of 15 percent in 1989.
In a statement today, Robert J. Aaronson, president of the Air Transport Association, the industry's chief lobbying arm, sharply criticized the Government for not responding to airlines' concerns. He said the airlines' financial condition was vital to the national economy and the Administration should give "special attention" to its growing losses.
"Unless something is done to stabilize jet fuel prices, it is only a matter of time before other airlines will be forced to take drastic measures," Mr. Aaronson said.

HEADLINE: Consumer Group Questions Milk Hormone's Safety

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports, today questioned the safety of an genetically engineered growth hormone that is used to increase milk production in dairy cows, and urged the Food and Drug Administration to immediately halt sales of milk in which traces of the drug are found.
Spokesmen for the manufacturers say the experimental hormone, which increases milk production in cows by 10 to 25 percent, is being tested in more than 100 herds around the country. In 1985 the F.D.A. declared that the hormone was safe, and milk from the experimental herds has been sold in commercial markets ever since. 
 The growth hormone has never been shown to be a hazard, and the questions raised today were meant as a caution before the drug is widespread in the nation's milk supply.
"This is a very powerful growth hormone and the Government has not looked at all the potential health effects," said Dr. Michael K. Hansen, a biologist at the Consumer Policy Institute, the research division of the 54-year-old consumer group and the author of the report criticizing the drug. "They are playing roulette with the nation's milk drinkers."
But a physician for Eli Lilly, one of the manufacturers of the hormone, bovine somatotropin, said today that the issues raised by Consumers Union had been thoroughly reviewed by the F.D.A. in a paper published in August in the weekly journal Science, and the drug was found to be safe.
"In the several years since scientists gained the knowledge to synthesize bovine somatotropin, opponents of this and other modern technologies have tried to frighten the public into believing a litany of unsupported statements," said Dr. John H. Holcombe, q clinical research physician at Eli Lillyin Indianapolis. "You can be assured that milk from BST-supplemented cows is safe for humans, young and old."
The Consumer Union's report, which is based on an analysis of publicly available studies, comes two days before the National Institutes of Health plans to hold a national conference in Bethesda, Md., on the drug's safety.
Bovine growth hormone is the first economically important product of genetic engineering to emerge from the agricultural biotechnology industry. Since the late 1970's, Lilly and three other chemical and drug companies -- the American Cyanamid Company, the Monsanto Company and the Upjohn Company -- have spent more than $500 million on its development, hoping to exploit a worldwide market estimated at more than $1 billion annually. The drug's success or failure is seen by many industrial analysts as an important indicator of the public's willingness to accept genetically engineered products in food.
 
Higher Growth Rates Found
 Dr. Hansen said a study by Monsanto showed that rats fed high concentrations of insulin-like growth factor exhibited higher growth rates. He said such effects indicated that the same could happen in people, particularly children, who are fed hormone-treated milk, and urged the F.D.A. to study the issue more thoroughly.
But Dr. William H. Daughaday, a professor emeritus of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, said today that the amount of extra insulin-like growth factor in the milk of cows treated with the gene-altered hormone was trivial compared with the levels already in human blood.
Normally, adults and children have 200 micrograms per liter of insulin-like growth factor in their blood, said Dr. Daughaday, who has studied the effects of hormones on people and animals under a research contract from Monsanto. Milk from cows treated with bovine growth hormone has an average of 20 micrograms per liter. Moreover, because it is a protein, much of the insulin-like growth factor would be broken down during digestion, which would further reduce concentrations of the substance in a person's blood.

HEADLINE: Riverboat Gambling Gets a Chance in Mississippi

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VICKSBURG, Miss., Dec. 1

 BODY:
Mississippians are flirting with legalized casino gambling on riverboats to spur economic development. And as might be expected in this Bible Belt state, the voters' decisions have been mixed.
Voters in the area around Greenville in western Mississippi defeated a gambling proposal two weeks ago. But down river in Natchez, voters approved one last week. 
 Referendums will be held Tuesday in Hancock, Harrison and Jackson counties on the Gulf Coast. Many observers predicted that gambling would be approved in Harrison County, which includes tourist-oriented Biloxi and Gulfport, and defeated in the other counties.
"We're fledglings in the gaming area and we are just trying to find our way," said Charles A. Marx, chairman of the Mississippi tax commission, which will regulate gaming until the state establishes a permanent commission.
 
Authorized by Legislation
 Legislation passed this year authorizes 11 counties on the Mississippi River and three on the Gulf of Mexico to have riverboat gambling on cruise vessels setting sail from those counties or on outfitted barges tied up at the docks.
On Dec. 11, voters in Vicksburg and surrounding Warren County will decide whether to burnish their antebellum cast and Civil War-era attractions with Las Vegas-type glitz along the riverfront. The debate has elements that were crucial to gambling's defeat in Greenville as well as elements which contributed to its success in Natchez. Most observers expect the vote here to be close.
The law requires a referendum in counties where operators submit proposals for gambling and opponents gather petitions with at least 1,500 valid signatures within 60 days. If a proposal is unopposed, the person making it undergoes a background check.
So far, Mr. Marx said, there have been unchallenged proposals in only two counties, Tunica and DeSoto, which are just below Memphis.
 
A Paradox in Mississippi
 The Mississippi bill passed as other states, like Iowa and Illinois, have approved riverboat gambling. In those states, too, the purpose was to spur economic development in river towns that once thrived as centers of manufacturing, agriculture or commerce.
The riverboat gambling bill passed in Mississippi even as lawmakers were emotionally debating both the constitutionality and the morality of statewide legalization of video-poker machines, lotteries and Bingo.
Wilson Golden, a state Democratic committeeman and a lawyer for some of the gambling interests, said the gambling measure may have passed because "the riverboat gambling idea seemed to confine the sin, because it was for 14 other counties and not everybody's county." In addition, he and others said, the referendum clause seemed to guarantee that local standards of morality would triumph.
The Rev. Paul Jones, executive director of the Mississippi Baptist Convention, which has been a leader in opposing gambling in eight counties, said, "The gambling proponents are starting to see that it is difficult to get statewide support for any form of gambling in the South." Mr. Jones said Texas and Tennessee had in recent years adopted local-option measures for parimutuel betting after it was clear that statewide approval was unlikely.
 
Friendly Persuasion
 In the Vicksburg Veterans of Foreign Wars hall, about 100 people picked over a Friday lunch of chicken-neck bones, black-eyed peas and turnip greens as William M. Dougall, the chief executive officer of the Aladdin Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, told the group what his company hoped to do in the city.
Mr. Dougall's company negotiated with the city and got tentative approval to invest up to $25 million to develop a fixed gambling barge and a touring gambling riverboat. "We hope to make this more of a tourist destination than a gambling destination," he said.
He said gambling would provide up to 1,500 new jobs with an estimated $13 million annual payroll, contribute $3 million a year to city and county government, pay $4 million in various state taxes and spend another $16 million locally for goods and services.
Jimmy Heidel, chairman of the Warren County Chamber of Commerce and the county port commission, said that Vicksburg had an unemployment rate of 7.7 percent and that gambling could spur economic growth.
 
Emphasizing 'Development'
 Trying to tap in to this fear of economic stagnation but aware of the religious feelings in the community, proponents of gambling urge people to vote yes on "riverfront development" and only secondarily mention gambling.
That approach angers Charlie Caldwell, an engineer with the Army Corps of Engineers who heads SIGNET, the major opposition group here. The acronym stands for "Standing in the Gap Network" and uses a phrase from the Old Testament.
"It's deceptive to talk about riverfront development without talking about gambling," Mr. Caldwell said. Proponents do not deal with the possible increase in crime and other physical and social costs, he said.
Vicksburg officials, including Mayor Robert Walker, have remained neutral. In Greenville, officials also stayed out of the fray. Harold Duke, the organizer of the local pro-gambling campaign, cited that as a reason the measure failed, by fewer than 250 votes out of nearly 13,000 cast two weeks ago.
But in Natchez, said Mr. Golden, who ran the campaign for gambling proponents, there were strong endorsements from local officials. There, as in Vicksburg, he said, the campaign emphasized riverfront development and rarely mentioned riverboat gambling.
Mr. Golden also credited the narrow victory of the gambling proponents in Natchez with a strong effort to get out the black vote. But Mr. Caldwell said that the Vicksburg debate is not racial and that SIGNET had black members. Among them is Max Tyler, also an engineer with the Army Corps, who said, "This is a united front."

HEADLINE: First Executive Refinancing

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 3

 BODY:
The First Executive Corporation said today that it planned to refinance $275 million of bank debt, putting off large payments to lenders for several years to protect its capital base. Under the plan, dividend payments to common and preferred stockholders would be stopped.
First Executive, an insurance holding company based in Los Angeles, had been considering such a restructuring for several months to postpone making the first of three large payment to lenders next year. Payments were coming due of $46.5 million on March 31, $184.5 million in 1993 and $44 million in 1995. 
 While First Executive maintains that it could have made the $46.5 million payment due next March, a restructuring would prevent a further drain on company finances.
Under the preliminary agreement, the company will make a $30 million payment to borrowers participating in the restructuring. Then about $245 million in new notes at a higher interest rate will be issued, coming due in equal installments in 1996, 1997 and 1998.
First Executive also said it had told the Securities and Exchange Commission that it might restructure its preferred stock obligations. The company said there was no guarantee either restructuring would be consummated.
First Executive has been hurt badly by losses of hundreds of millions of dollars caused by the declining value of the company's "junk bond" portfolio.
The well-publicized problems caused concern among policy holders and for a time surrenders of policies were well above normal levels, though the company says that is no longer the case. In the wake of the crisis, the company's ability to borrow large sums has been shut off.
Regulators in California, who are conducting a special review of First Executive's insurance activities, have prevented the company from transferring large amounts of money from its California subsidiary to the parent company.

HEADLINE: Continental's Risks in a Chapter 11 Filing

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER

 BODY:
The words "Chapter 11" have never helped a company's public image. The question facing executives of Continental Airlines is just how serious the damage will be.
In filing for bankruptcy protection yesterday, Continental has taken great pains to reassure its customers and travel agents that it will be business as usual for the nation's fifth-largest airline. While many travelers say they will indeed continue to fly the carrier, some remember Continental's bankruptcy filing eight years ago, when some flights were canceled and some passengers were left with worthless tickets. 
 One travel agent said yesterday that he had temporarily stopped booking tickets on Continental.
 
 A 'Dangerous' Move
 "In this environment, it's dangerous to go into Chapter 11," said Raymond Neidl, an analyst with Dillon, Read & Company. "Other airlines will pounce on you and try to steal customers and scare travel agents."
Hollis H. Harris, Continental's chairman, said yesterday that the airline would continue to fly its normal schedule, would honor its contracts with travel agents and other airlines and would refund money to any customer who wanted it.
"The travel agent and consumer can book Continental Airlines with absolute confidence," said Ned Walker, a Continental spokesman. He said that of the airline's approximately 1,400 scheduled flights yesterday, not one was canceled because of Continental's financial condition. Of 4,600 calls to its reservations line surveyed by the company, only nine cancellations were reported, which was a lower rate than average, Mr. Walker said.
But the real test of consumer confidence, industry analysts said yesterday, will come early next year, when demand for travel historically falls off. By filing for bankruptcy protection in the midst of the busy holiday travel period, Continental has cushioned itself against, or at least delayed, any consumer backlash.
"They picked a good time," said John Pritchard, a New York lawyer specializing in bankruptcy law. "No judge is going to want to strand these people." A bankruptcy judge has broad powers in deciding how a company would operate and could, as a last resort, call for liquidation.
With flights already booked through the end of the month, most Continental ticket holders have few options.
Ron Smith, the executive vice president of the American Society of Travel Agents, said the trade group was telling its members to book customers on Continental. "We're telling people to hang loose and keep booking them," he said.
To some, the stigma of Chapter 11 may not be as strong as it once was. "The public is more callous about these things," said Russ Thayer, the senior vice president of Airline Economics, a consulting firm in Washington, noting that at least three well-publicized airline bankruptcy filings have occurred in the last decade. In only some of the cases did the airlines stop flying altogether.
Travelers flying Continental from Newark International Airport yesterday had mixed reactions to -- and varying degrees of understanding about -- the filing. "I hope it doesn't go through for at least five days because that's when our flight home is," said Leo Bergeron of San Francisco.
Others showed greater loyalty. "It's a temporary setback," said Gene Carter of Columbia, S.C. "It's a great airline."
But some travel agents are suggesting that their clients not fly Continental, at least for now. "We are suggesting alternative airlines until the smoke clears," said David Perelman, the owner of the D.M.S. Travel Group in New York. "In the past, the passenger and travel agent have been left holding the bag," he said.
In recent years, the travel industry has been seeking greater protection for itself and its clients, should an airline stop flying. The industry has been pushing for a small "default" fee to be collected on each ticket, with the amassed funds to be used to reimburse passengers and travel agents should a carrier stop flying.
The law currently affords passengers little protection. "Passsengers are unsecured creditors who go to the end of the line," said Cornish Hitchcock, legal director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, a group based in Washington.
 
 'Put Me on Someone Else'
 Other travel agents said they were informing passengers of Continental's financial situation when making reservations. Thomas Nulty, the president of Associated Travel in Santa Clara, Calif., said that after being told of the filing, "every single person said put me on someone else."
Most of Continental's 37,000 employees learned of the filing from the news media. One pilot, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said he was not concerned about his job security, but he added, "It's aggravating to have it hanging over our heads all the time."

Excerpts From Gulf Testimony

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee today by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as provided by the Federal News Service, a transcription service:
MR. CHENEY: Let me say just a word about sanctions. . . . We think we've shut down much of the flow of goods into Iraq from outside. We don't think it is totally successful but, clearly, he cannot get anything through the Persian Gulf or through the Red Sea. A little bit of air traffic going in, and there's some smuggling. . . . But, basically, in terms of major international commerce, we think we've been able to pretty well dry that up. 
 The question that comes up with respect to sanctions, though, is -- I think it is important for us to focus upon what our objective is and, of course, that's the goal of getting Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. So, when you talk about sanctions and sanctions working, I think it has to be with that caveat that sanctions working doesn't mean just destruction of the Iraqi economy, it means getting Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. That's our goal; that's our objective; that's why the sanctions have been employed.
In terms of trying to assess whether or not that will happen, we have to look at several things; we have to look at circumstances inside Iraq. . . . Iraq has been through an eight-year war with Iran. They clearly have the capacity to hunker down, if you will, and operate on a subsistence basis. It's been suggested that if you compare the pain -- the economic pain that he feels now -- with the pain that the population felt during the Iraq-Iran War, that today the pain is not as significant as it was then. Because, of course, then, not only were they faced with the burden of the war, they were also faced with the propositions of casualties and attacks on Iraqi territory.
 
 Iraqi Food Resources
We think we clearly have been successful in closing off the flow of spare parts and military supplies from the Soviet Union and France, which previously were his major suppliers. But, with respect to food and agriculture, the picture is somewhat murkier.
. . .Iraq is not a desolate country by any means. In the valley of the Tigris and the Euphrates, there's a lot of good farmland there. And there are three occasions in the last 25 years when they've been able to double from one year to the next the total amount of cereal production, for example, in country. . . .
Another key element from the standpoint of the sanctions that we have to keep in mind, I think, is that sanctions do not impose pain just on Iraq. They impose pain on everybody who used to do business with Iraq. So, to say that we're going to shut off the flow of commerce to Iraq, it is important for us to remind ourselves that commerce is a two-way street and that when you close the pipeline from Iraq across Turkey, Turkey loses the value and the benefits and the earnings of having operated that pipeline, a significant loss to a nation that obviously is very important to us and a key partner in the coalition.
There are other problems that I think have to be kept in mind as we contemplate what the right course of action might be. While we wait for sanctions to work, Saddam Hussein continues to obliterate any trace of Kuwait and her people. While we wait, he continues to dig in in Kuwait, to send more forces south, to deploy and mobilize additional manpower, to dig more formidable fortifications, so that it's possible that at some point the military effort that might be required to get him out will be more difficult in the future than it is today.
While we continue to wait, he also continues, obviously, his efforts to improve his weapons arsenal, continues to work to see if he can acquire more weapons of mass destruction. And while we wait, he continues to hold hundreds of Americans hostage.
 
 Basic Propositions
So the questions, it seems to me, Mr. Chairman, that have been asked by this committee and that you've addressed over the last few days, are vital ones. But the notion that we can in fact wait a year or two, as some have suggested, that we can wait indefinitely for him to withdraw, comes back again to a couple of very basic, fundamental propositions.
Can we make the judgment that sanctions will achieve the desired result of forcing him out of Kuwait? I don't know. I don't think we can make that judgment. They might, but then again there's a lot of evidence that they won't.
Will the coalition hold? Will this relatively fragile, complex enterprise that we've organized internationally produce the kind of ongoing support, international effort, for the next year or two, that it has for the last four months?
Will the economic pain be greater for Saddam Hussein than it will be for members of the coalition, or for some of our other friends around the world? Will we be in a better position ourselves, as a coalition and as a nation, to use military force in the future than we are now?
. . .If Saddam wins, if he keeps Kuwait, if the coalition falls apart, if economic sanctions don't work, if we don't use military force, if that's the only way to achieve our objective to force him out, then we've got a hell of a problem because of course he will, given his current location and his ability to dominate the gulf, constitute a significant threat to the world economy.
 
Threat to U.S. Allies
He clearly will constitute and does today, a significant threat to our friends in the region, especially to those Arab governments who have had the courage to stand by us to try to stop Saddam Hussein. He clearly represents a threat to Saudi Arabia, to the gulf state governments and, I would argue as well, to President Mubarak's Government in Egypt. . . .
He clearly constitutes a significant threat to Israel. And the United States has long-standing, indeed, commitments and an important strategic relationship with the State of Israel. . . .
My own personal view is that it's far better for us to deal with him now while the coalition is intact, while we have the United Nations behind us, while we have some 26 other nations assembled with military forces in the gulf, than it will be for us to deal with him 5 or 10 years from now when the members of the coalition have gone their disparate ways and when Saddam has become an even better armed and more threatening regional superpower than he is at present.
SENATOR NUNN: Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.
General Powell?
GENERAL POWELL: . . .What I would like to do in my oral statement is to build on Secretary Cheney's comments and provide you some insight into our military planning, why we recommended what we did, and the underlying military rationale for our deployments and our campaign planning.
. . .The mission is not to punish, the mission is not to retaliate, the mission is not to see if Saddam Hussein will change his mind. The mission is to take action to achieve our political objective if Saddam Hussein does not change his mind.
Many experts, amateurs and others in this town believe that this can be accomplished by such things as surgical air strikes or perhaps a sustained air strike. And there are a variety of other nice, tidy, alleged low-cost, incremental, may-work options that are floated around with great regularity all over this town.
 
 Hussein Can't Control
The fundamental fatal flaw in all such strategies is that it leaves the initiative in Saddam Hussein's hands. He makes the decision as to whether or not he will or will not withdraw. He decides whether he has been punished enough so that it is now necessary for him to reverse his direction and take a new political tack.
Those strategies may work, but they also may not. The initiative is left in Saddam Hussein's hands. These strategies are not decisive; they are not success-oriented. Saddam Hussein has demonstrated for 10 years his willingness and his ability to absorb punishment and to callously expend Iraqi lives and to care not a whit about what happens to the citizens of his country.
Another flaw in such strategies is that it allows Iraq to concentrate essentially on one threat -- as you pull apart these alternative strategies, an air threat. I know the deserts of Kuwait and Iraq are quite different from the triple-canopy jungles of Vietnam or the forests of Germany, and I have no question about the competence and ability of our United States Air Force to inflict terrible punishment.
But one can hunker down, one can dig in, one can disperse to try to ride out such a single-dimension attack. Recognizing that such attack will do grievous damage to the defenders after such a strategy has been executed, the decision is still in the hands of the defender to decide whether or not he has had enough punishment. Such strategies are designed to hope to win, they are not designed to win.
General Schwarzkopf, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and I believe strongly that if the armed forces of the United States are asked to go into combat to achieve a decisive political objective, we must implement a decisive military strategy that seizes the initiative -- one that is designed to win.
 
 Move It or Lose It
The second factor in our consideration is the enemy. We do not overestimate or underestimate the capability of the Iraqi armed forces. We have studied them very closely; we understand their strengths, we understand their vulnerabilities. We must have a military strategy, and I believe we will have a military strategy, that uses our strengths against their vulnerabilities, avoids their strengths and protects us against attacks directed against our vulnerabilities.
Based on our analysis of the mission, the enemy and other factors, we recommended and the President approved a force buildup capable of accomplishing the mission which seizes the initiative and which forces the Iraqis to consider the consequences of a combined overwhelming air-land-sea campaign against a powerful coalition force. The question they will have to consider is, do they move it, or do they lose it?
We don't want a war; we aren't looking for one. The President doesn't want one. The Secretary doesn't want one. No one in uniform wants one. No American wants one. And certainly, no loved one waiting at home wants one. War is a terrible thing with unpredictable consequences, but my job, and the job of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the commanders involved in this operation, is to make sure that if it is necessary to go to war, we go to war to win. That is the surest way to achieve our objectives and to minimize casualties.

HEADLINE: Argentine Army Revolt Is Crushed Days Before Planned Bush Arrival

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Several hundred army dissidents rebelled early today and captured the Argentine Army headquarters and four other installations, creating battlegrounds in an area that President Bush is scheduled to visit on Wednesday.
But loyalist troops, acting on President Carlos Saul Menem's demand for a complete rebel surrender, moved quickly and forcefully to retake the installations and declared tonight that the mutiny had been put down. 
The defeat of the rebels seemed to assure that Mr. Bush would go ahead with his visit, spreading the message of a "new dawn in the New World" that he proclaimed in Brazil today. [Page A14.]
 
'There Is a Surrender'
 "There is a surrender -- it is over," a lieutenant colonel told journalists tonight outside the Libertador Building, the army headquarters, which sits on a small plaza opposite the rear of Casa Rosada, the presidential palace. The army said that it had retaken al of the sites captured by the mutineers and that most of the rebels -- thought to number about 300 -- had been taken prisoner in a succession of operations that lasted some 12 hours.
At about the same time, President Menem told reporters in the palace that "the painted-faces are finished." The dissidents' camouflage-painted faces have become symbols of the four rebellions they have staged in the six years since Argentina returned to civilian government.
The army headquarters fell after nearly two hours of intense firing between loyal troops and those inside the immense structure as four warplanes swooped overhead. Threats to bomb the headquarters were not carried out.
 
Bullets Riddle Vehicles
 Automatic weapons firereverberated through the capital during most of the day, causing pandemonium in rush-hour traffic. Cars and buses in the combat area were riddled with bullets. Many people, unable to believe the extent of the danger on a pleasant, sunny day, gathered on street corners and in plazas as snipers exchanged fire and troops moved into place to retake the 15-story army headquarters.
Late this morning, the army command announced the first of the recaptures, saying it had retaken a battalion headquarters in the suburb of Palomar, and in midafternoon navy rebels surrendered at the coast guard headquarters just two blocks north of Casa Rosada.
Then loyalists in tanks recaptured a regimental headquarters in the Palermo neighborhood, an area of luxury apartment buildings where the United States Embassy is located, and a tank factory taken by the rebels in Boulogne, a suburb northwest of the city. The army said the rebels in the tank factory were attacked from the air. Both actions dragged out for most of the afternoon.
Loyalist forces also cut a highway leading toward the city from the northern province of Entre Rios, from which a rebel column was reported trying to advance in armored vehicles. In early evening, air force planes reportedly bombed the column as it tried to advance at the town of Gualeguaychu, 150 miles north of Buenos Aires. Other provinces were reported calm.
 
At Least 13 Reported Dead
 In late afternoon, the authorities moved journalists away from the Gothic-style army headquarters, with the announced intention of bombing it. Loyalist troops in full battle gear took positions at the rear of the presidential palace and behind trees and other places of cover in the plaza separating the army building from the Casa Rosada as planes roared overhead.
During the day, at least seven loyalist soldiers, one rebel and five civilians were killed, the Government news agency Telam reported. A colonel of unknown affiliation was reported found dead in a tank outside the factory at Boulogne. The army said the five civilians were killed when a tank collided with a public bus outside the tank factory. At least six loyalist soldiers, about a dozen civilians, four of them journalists, and an unknown number of rebels were wounded.
The uprising was the first during the 16-month administration of Mr. Menem, and could not have come at a more difficult time for him. He has been counting on the Bush visit to give a symbolic shot in the arm to his program of privatizing state-owned companies, encouraging foreign investment and finding a place of respect for Argentina.
The Economy Minister, German Gonzalez, said the rebellion raised questions about whether Argentina was mature enough to live in democracy and expressed fear that would-be foreign investors would rethink their plans.
But the United States Ambassador, Terence Todman, tried to allay such doubts even before the uprising was crushed, assuring authorities "in the most firm manner" that President Bush intends to go ahead with his plans to visit Argentina as part of his tour of five South American countries that began Sunday.
 
Martial Law Decree Signed
 The army said the mutineers took over the five sites in a coordinated action beginning at 3:30 this morning. President Menem arrived at the presidential palace from his suburban residence by helicopter at 5 A.M. and remained in his offices throughout the day. Before 7 A.M. he signed a martial law decree. Otherwise, he treated the event like an internal army problem, leaving it to the army Chief of Staff, Gen. Martin Bonnet, to issue the ultimatums and communiques.
Spokesmen for the rebels said that this uprising, like the three previous rebellions, was not intended to overthrow the Government but to force changes in the army command and win better treatment for the military.
But unlike the previous rebellions, which were drawn out and almost bloodless because the loyalist troops felt sympathy for the rebels, both sides in this rebellion showed much more determination to fight things out. The fact that the rebels killed three men at the regimental headquarters in the Palermo neighborhood apparently helped to polarize the situation.
The President apparently also had more active support from the air force and navy than in previous uprisings. None of their men were involved in the rebellion, which was an army affair aside from the participation of some dismissed port police officers in the capture of one building at the coast guard headquarters.
 
Loyal to Jailed Colonel
 Although the leader of today's action was identified by army intelligence only as a Colonel Baraldini, Miguel Angel Toma, chairman of the defense committee of the Chamber of Deputies, said the rebels were loyal to Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin, who led one of the three previous rebellions.
Colonel Seineldin is now serving 60 days' detention in San Martin de los Andes, a remote mountain town, because of statements he made a few weeks ago about unrest in the army. Because of his popularity with some of the troops, Colonel Seineldin was not cashiered after the last rebellion, two years ago, but was stripped of all responsibility.
Some rebels interviewed by radio stations said one of their goals was for Colonel Seineldin to replace General Bonnet as army chief.
The three previous rebellions occurred during the Government of Raul Alfonsin, leader of the party called the Radical Civic Union, and had the dual purpose of blocking trials of military officers for human rights abuses committed during the so-called dirty war against leftist subversion during the mid-1970's and of winning better salaries and other treatment for the armed forces.
Under the pressure of the successive rebellions, the Alfonsin Government negotiated and gradually gave in to the demands to halt the efforts to prosecute members of the armed forces. The top military commanders and two former Presidents have continued to serve sentences they received before the uprisings.
Mr. Menem, a member of the Justicialist Party founded by Argentina's longtime leader, Juan D. Peron, has promised to pardon the imprisoned officers before the end of the year.
Their continued detention does not appear to have been an issue with the army dissidents who mutinied today. Their primary concern now is a perceived lack of financial and other support.

HEADLINE: CONTINENTAL FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Continental Airlines filed for protection from its creditors under bankruptcy laws yesterday, attributing the step to the jump in fuel prices and the cost of interest on its huge debts.
The airline, the nation's fifth largest, has been flirting with bankruptcy for months. Since the crisis in the Persian Gulf sent fuel costs sharply higher, Continental's $2.2 billion in debt -- a legacy of a high-growth strategy in the 1980's under its former chairman, Frank Lorenzo -- suddenly loomed as a far greater burden. 
 Eastern Airlines, also acquired by Mr. Lorenzo under that strategy, filed for reorganization under the bankruptcy laws in March 1989. It is now operating under the direction of a trustee.
Continental's bankruptcy filing will give the airline a reprieve from paying its debts so that it can continue its regular flights as it tries to work out a way to pay its bills and return to financial health. In the filing, Continental said that it had $138 million in cash.
Continental executives stressed that the airline planned to continue its flights as usual. They said that frequent-flier programs would continue as before and noted that Judge Helen S. Balick, who is handling the filing in the United States Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, had permitted Continental to keep paying its work force of 37,000 and to pay for ticket refunds to any customers who wanted them.
In addition, other airlines were ordered to continue to honor their operating agreements with Continental. These agreements are crucial to the airline's survival because they enable Continental customers to check through their baggage if they are connecting with another carrier and to have their tickets honored by a connecting airline.
"The consumer should not notice any change in operations," said Hollis L. Harris, the line's president, chairman and chief executive.
Many anxious Continental ticket holders called the airline and travel agents asking if they should change their bookings to another carrier. So far, at least, most were apparently reassured by Continental's intention to keep operating normally. Richard Lisser, a vice president of Continental at Newark International Airport, said he had not seen any increase in cancellations because of the filing.
The problems of Continental, which is a unit of Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., are particularly severe, but its bankruptcy filing underlines the financial pinch being felt throughout the United States airline industry. Most major carriers are suffering under the pressure of higher fuel costs and competition for passengers as the economy weakens.
One airline consulting firm, Airline Economics Inc., has estimated that the industry as a whole will have an operating loss of about $1.5 billion this year compared with an operating profit of $1.4 billion last year. Almost all of the loss came in the second half of the year, as fuel prices soared.
 
88 American Cities Served
 Continental serves 88 American cities and 55 international destinations with 338 aircraft. It is a major carrier along the East Coast with one of its main hubs at Newark International Airport, where it has 305 daily flights and employs about 6,000 workers. The carrier also has a strong route system with other major hubs in Houston and Denver, and it is building up a fourth hub in Cleveland.
Industry analysts were guarded in their assessment of Continental's chances of being able to use the protection afforded under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws to work its way back to financial health. They noted that the airline had a valuable route system and had considerably improved its performance in the last few years.
Still, the twin burdens of higher fuel costs and stiff debt payments make its future uncertain. During the first nine months of this year, Continental Airlines Holdings, the airline's parent company, lost $97 million, compared with a loss of $522.8 million for the period last year.
 
'Step in Right Direction'
 The bankruptcy filing "is a step in the right direction," said Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company, "but they are a long way from the road of recovery."
Since Iraq invaded Kuwait in early August, the price of jet fuel has roughly doubled to about $1 a gallon. The increase is greater than the rise in oil prices largely because much of the refining capacity was in Kuwait.
At Continental, fuel accounts for an estimated 25 percent of the airline's operating costs. During the last four months, the airline says it will pay about $230 million extra for fuel because of the price runup since the start of the Persian Gulf crisis.
Given the big increase in fuel costs, the airline must renegotiate its schedule of debt payments with its creditors. At $2.2 billion, Continental's debts are roughly twice that of each of the three largest United States carriers, American, United and Delta. Continental's interest costs alone total about $300 million a year.
 
Debt Is Called Key
 "The key is their debt," said Raymond E. Neidl, the airline analyst for Dillon, Read & Company. "If they get the cooperation of the creditors for their long-term viability they can come out of this."
The creditors will have to be persuaded, analysts note, that they have a better chance of recovering what is owed them by supporting a long-range plan to keep the airline going rather than pushing for liquidation.
Moreover, the continuing difficulties of Eastern Airlines since it filed for bankruptcy protection in 1989 raises questions about Continental's chances of success, analysts say. But they note that there are major differences between the carriers. Continental has not been locked in a bitter strike with its employees. Instead, in recent interviews, Continental employees said that they had confidence in the current management and believed that it was making an effort to expand the airline.
 
Not a Surprise
 The bankruptcy filing was not a surprise. The airline had prepared to file late in October, but its board decided to try to avoid the drastic step.
Mr. Hollis and his managers tried to raise cash by seeking to sell Continental's international routes and other assets. The airline was able to reach an agreement to sell its Seattle-Tacoma-to-Tokyo route to American Airlines for $150 million. The deal must be approved by the Department of Transporation and the Japanese Government before it can be completed. Approval in Washington for the sale is expected to be expedited because of Continental's cash problems.
But a bigger deal to sell the airline's Pacific routes to Delta Air Lines fell through last week. Then, Delta learned that the bankruptcy court handling Eastern's own attempt to return to financial health, begun in 1989, had allowed Martin R. Shugrue, its trustee, to spend $135 million in an attempt to make Eastern profitable.
 
Reasons Not Spelled Out
 Delta abandoned its talks with Continental without detailing the reasons. However, analysts say that Delta did not want to pay heavily for new routes at a time when Eastern, a major competitor, would have additional funds to compete for business by offering low fares.
This is the second use of a bankruptcy filing by Continental. Under Mr. Lorenzo, the airline went into court-protected bankruptcy in the fall of 1983, starting a period of bitter confrontation between Mr. Lorenzo and the workers over cuts in manning and pay.
Recently, Continental has been praised for shedding its reputation for unreliable service and was winning back business passengers.
The complaint rate of the carrier has declined sharply and its on-time performance has improved. For example, Continental's complaint rate as compiled by the Department of Transporation has fallen from 38.6 per 100,000 customers in August 1987 to 1.71 last August.
 
$14 a Share Paid by S.A.S.
 One of the big losers from Continental's financial troubles, at least on paper, is the Scandinavian Airlines System, which bought a 16.8 percent interest in Continental last September. S.A.S. paid $14 a share for 2.25 million shares of Continental for a total of $31.5 million in September. Shares of Continental dropped severely yesterday, down $1.375 and closing at $2 a share in trading on the American Stock Exchange. That would put S.A.S.'s holding at a worth now of $4.5 million.
But S.A.S. executives expressed confidence yesterday that Continental could work out of its difficulties and said that Continental was generating increased traffic for S.A.S. by feeding passengers at Newark into the Scandinavian carrier's international flights.
Jan Carlzon, the president of S.A.S., said there would be no interruption of service by the two carriers. "As Continental now enters negotiations with its creditors , the company's management will get breathing space to solve its problems,"he said.

HEADLINE: Bush Begins His Latin Tour in Brazil Amid Worry Over Argentina Strife

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Dec. 3

 BODY:
President Bush began a six-day trip through Latin America intended to show support for strapped democracies today, telling Brazil's Congress that it is time "to end the false distinctions between the first world and third world that have too long limited political and economic relations in the Americas."
But even as Mr. Bush spoke of helping Latin America enjoy a "new dawn in the New World," a coup attempt in Argentina overshadowed the beginning of the trip, causing White House advisers to worry that President Bush might have to cancel his visit to Argentina. But they insisted all day that the Argentine President, Carlos Saul Menem, would bring things under control and that the trip was on. 
 After his talks in Brazil with President Fernando Collor de Mello, Mr. Bush is scheduled to go to Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela, before returning to Washington on Saturday night.
 
Supercomputer Sale Approved
 The biggest substantive development in the day of meetings in Brazil was Mr. Bush's announcement that he would permit the sale of a high-performance supercomputer to Brazil's state aircraft company, Embraer.
Critics have said that Brazil should be denied such sensitive technology because it can be used to design advanced nuclear weapons. Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger said that Brazilian officials renewed promises today to use the technology under safeguards.
The computer at issue is manufactured by IBM. Information on the cost was not immediately available. Mr. Eagleburger said it was of "relatively high quality but not at the top of the line."
Last week, Mr. Collor cleared away many American worries about his nation's nuclear program by agreeing with President Menem of Argentina to forego the development of nuclear weapons and to place their nuclear installations under bilateral safeguards.
 
Technology Transfers Speeded
 As a result of Brazil's willingness to institute safeguards, the United States and Brazil agreed to set up a bilateral commission to speed the transfer of technology.
Much of the day was taken up with the developments surrounding the coup. The Presidential spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said that it "seems likely" that the military uprising was meant to embarrass President Menem before Mr. Bush's visit.
"The President wants to express his confidence in President Menem and his support for democracy in Argentina," Mr. Fitzwater said. "We intend to proceed on our original schedule."
Mr. Eagleburger was asked this evening in a press briefing whether the uprising underscored the fact that even in the region's democratically elected leaderships, officers in the military still hold positions of authority and are prone to use force when they feel threatened.
"It certainly demonstrates that the military, on occasion, or small portions of the military on occasion are prepared to use force, yes," he replied. But he warned reporters not to take the incident "out of perspective."
"As far as we know, this is a small group of officers," he said. "My argument would be that, fundamentally, democracy in Argentina is working and that this will, when this is over, demonstrate that the roots of democracy in Argentina are fairly deep."
 
Seeking Hemispheric Unity
 Despite the tensions over the Persian Gulf, President Bush decided to make this trip because he wanted to promote unity in the Western Hemisphere during a year when a great deal of attention has gone to the fledgling democracies in Eastern Europe.
Speaking to the joint session of the Brazilian Congress, Mr. Bush inserted a few critical comments about the Iraqi President into his remarks.
He said that he had been told by President Collor that "the brutality and aggression of Saddam Hussein" had cost Brazil $5 billion in higher oil prices "for your economy, struggling to move forward."
Ronan Tito, the Senate leader, welcomed the American President by noting that "we have had a long, difficult change" moving away from "the military and authoritarian regimes which have been the scourge of our region since the Cuban Revolution."
 
Foreign Debt Cited
 Mr. Tito urged Mr. Bush to renegotiate Brazil's foreign debt, which now totals $115 billion. "We are inviting our creditors to become our partners in development and growth, not our partners in poverty," he said.
The lawmakers who spoke before Mr. Bush offered veiled criticisms of the Administration's "demeaning" conditions for renegotiating the region's debt and trading techonology, and about stereotypes in America about Latin America.
Ricardo Fiuza, a Brazilian legislator, asked that the region not be viewed "only as debtors, as producers of drugs and exporters of immigrants," but as partners in commercial enterprises. Before traveling here, Mr. Bush had warned in a press interview that talks on Brazil's $115 billion foreign debt would not be a "central" issue.
The United States is Brazil's largest trading partner, investor and creditor. Brazil is $8 billion in arrears on payment of its private debt and talks in New York have stalled. Nicholas Brady, the Treasury Secretary, discussed the debt issue with Zelia Cardoso de Mello, Brazil's economy minister.
 
Emphasizing Free Trade
 "We recognize that the North American Government cannot lobby private banks," Foreign Minister Francisco Rezek said today of the debt talks. "But it is not in the interest of the creditor country that the debtor cannot recuperate its economic vitality."
Another major American-Brazilian issue is trade. In June, Brazil abolished a list of prohibited imports and set a four-year schedule for reducing tariffs; it also announced plans to open up its computer industry to foreign investment and imports and agreed to discuss joining multilateral trade agreements that regulate services, investment and intellectual property. In return, the United States dropped Brazil from a watch list of major trading violators.
In his public addresses to Brazilian legislators and businessmen, Mr. Bush advocated his plan to create a hemispheric free-trade zone from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego.
Known as the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, the plan calls for free trade, easier access of foreign investments and reduction of Latin American countries' debts to the United States Government.
American officials have also expressed concern that deforestation in the Amazon contributes to a global warming process known as the greenhouse effect.
Brazil has ended Government subsidies that encouraged ranchers to cut down the rain forest and started a campaign against using fire to clear forest. In return, Brazil wants the United States to cut carbon dioxide emissions and to give financial aid for Amazon conservation projects.
The last American Presidential visit was in 1982, when Ronald Reagan offended many Brazilians with a dinner toast in which he referred to Brazil as Bolivia.
The reception for Mr. Bush was oddly subdued. No crowds lined the street. The modernistic chamber of the Brazilian Senate was only partly filled and many seats on the main floor and in the balcony were empty.

HEADLINE: Brussels Talks Not the Only Trade Game Around

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 3

 BODY:
This week's conference involving more than 100 countries may be the biggest trade game in the world, but it is not the only one.
The United States, Canada and Mexico have just concluded important talks in this city on coming negotiations to shape a North American common market. And President Bush is visiting Latin America to promote trade agreements. 
 To many people here for the conference sponsored by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the most ambitious effort ever to liberalize trade, the timing of these events is more than coincidental.
Should the conference collapse because of the huge differences separating its participants, the United States wants to emphasize that it has alternatives to the global, multilateral process.
"Let's face it," said an American negotiator who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, "there are other avenues that we can take -- bilateral arrangements not only with Latin America but countries of the Pacific basin. It's chiefly developing countries that will be hurt by a collapse here."
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher put it more succinctly in a conversation with several American reporters today: "We could be O.K. either way. The U.S. always could make regional or other agreements. In all truth, we're doing this now."
The United States has been able to use this situation as a means of strengthening its bargaining hand, especially in the battle with the European Community over trying to cut billions of dollars in agricultural subsidies.
For example, it now has many developing countries as allies in the farm conflict, putting further pressure on the 12-nation community to cut its subsidies.
When senior officials met tonight to try to break the farm deadlock, the Europeans found themselves completely isolated. Most delegates say a failure to reach agreement on agriculture in the next 48 hours could mean collapse of the conference.
With the expansion of the European Community in recent years, along with growing interest in regional trading arrangements in the Western hemisphere, most analysts think the world is headed toward a system of preferential trading blocs. The question, most analysts say, is whether they will be benign or belligerent.
"If we have a strong multilateral system, they can be benign," said C. Michael Aho of the Council on Foreign Relations, one of the American observers at this conference.
 
 Impact on Poorest Countries
 Belligerent blocs would fight trade wars that could curb global trade flows. This could be especially harmful to the poorest countries not associated with any of the blocs because they could find themselves frozen out of the mainstream of world trade.
The multilateral system under the 43-year-old GATT permits the creation of geographical trading arrangements, like the European Community or the Free Trade Area between the United States and Canada, provided they do not erect barriers against other nations. Under the Enterprise for the Americas program that President Bush announced last June, the United States offers both to write free trade agreements and provide debt relief for countries that pursue market-oriented economic restructuring, as is the case now with most countries in the region.
Hector Gros Espiell, the Foreign Minister of Uruguay and president of the GATT Trade Negotiating Committee, told reporters the trading arrangements the Bush Administration contemplates with the Latin American countries "are not incompatable with the GATT and will reinforce multilateral trade."
Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, heads the American negotiating team here. She met yesterday with her Mexican and Canadian counterparts -- John C. Crosbie, Canada's Minister for International Trade, and Jaime Serra Puche, Mexico's Trade Minister -- on the projected North American common market.
The issue was Canada's participation in the negotiations the United States is preparing on the establishment of a free trade area with Mexico, following the arrangement Washington concluded with Ottawa in 1989.
Canada wants to join the talks, but some American officials and lawmakers are worried that Canadian participation could complicate and delay the projected agreement with Mexico.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS;
CHENEY SEES NEED TO ACT MILITARILY AGAINST THE IRAQIS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told Congress today that military action rather than economic sanctions was the only sure way of forcing Iraqi troops to leave Kuwait.
Mr. Cheney rebutted suggestions from leading Democrats and many former military officials that the United States wait a year or more to see if economic sanctions work. He told the Senate Armed Services Committee that delaying military action that long would further damage the world economy, allow Iraq to stiffen its defenses and risk the erosion of the international effort to compel President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to remove his forces. 
 "There is no guarantee that sanctions will force him out of Kuwait," Mr. Cheney said, adding that the United States does not have "an indefinite period of time to wait for sanctions to produce the desired result."
 
'He Can Ride Them Out'
 "Given the nature of the regime, given Saddam Hussein's brutality to his own people, his very tight control of that society, his ability to allocate resources for the military, their ability to produce their own food basically inside, he can ride them out," Mr. Cheney said, referring to sanctions. [Excerpts, page A12.]
Mr. Cheney's remarks seemed intended not only to defend the Administration's decision to get a United Nations Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force after Jan. 15, but also to step up pressure on the Iraqi Government. Many Administration officials contend that calls for a longer period for the sanctions to work have sent the wrong signal to Mr. Hussein.
The Defense Secretary's arguments prompted a quick rejoinder from Senator Sam Nunn, the committee chairman, who challenged Mr. Cheney's assertions that Washington could not afford to give sanctions time to work.
 
Nunn Wants Time
 "If we have a war, we're never going to know whether they would have worked, would we?" Mr. Nunn, a Georgia Democrat, said. "The way you find out if sanctions are going to work is to give them enough time to work."
Mr. Nunn's comments echoed testimony to the committee last week by two former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William J. Crowe and Gen. David Jones, who urged the Administration to postpone military action against Iraq and give economic sanctions a year or more to work. In interviews and at a conference in Alabama, most former Defense Secretaries have also urged patience.
In his appearance today, Mr. Cheney also asserted that President Bush had the authority to order an attack on Iraq without Congressional approval, in remarks that were criticized by Senator Edward M. Kennedy and other Democrats.
"I'm concerned that we don't have a consensus here in this country that would support a war," said Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, a member of the panel and President pro tem of the Senate.
As Mr. Cheney outlined the rationale for possible early military action, Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, described war plans for the Persian Gulf, saying American forces were preparing for a combined air, ground and sea attack seeking to win a quick victory, rather than wage an escalating air campaign against Iraq.
Mr. Cheney and General Powell repeatedly told the panel that Mr. Bush had not yet decided to order an attack on Iraq. To some extent, their remarks were intended to keep the pressure on Mr. Hussein as Washington prepares for talks with Baghdad.
Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, is expected to visit Washington next week for talks with Mr. Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3rd, and Mr. Baker is likely to go to Iraq sometime before Jan. 15 to meet with Mr. Hussein. The talks were proposed last week by Mr. Bush after the United Nations Security Council approved a resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq after Jan. 15 if it does not withdraw from Kuwait by then.
 
Appeals to Congress and Public
 But as thousands of American reinforcements head toward the gulf, the top Pentagon officials were addressing Congress and the American public, as well as Iraq, in making the case for possible early military action should the diplomatic effort fail.
While most of these arguments have been made by other officials in recent weeks, Mr. Cheney's presentation, buttressed by General Powell, was the most systematic effort by the Administration to lay the groundwork for possible military action against Iraq early next year.
The Defense Secretary maintained that Iraq was likely to cope with the sanctions by increasing its agricultural production and holding military activity to a minimum to curtail the demand for spare parts.
He also argued that the economic sanctions were hurting American allies like Turkey, which has lost revenues by closing its oil pipeline with Iraq, as well as other countries that are hard hit by the increase in oil prices.
As Washington waited for the sanctions to work, Iraq would continue to destroy what was left of Kuwait, strengthen its defensive fortifications there and mobilize additional troops, Mr. Cheney said.
In addition, he argued, the "relatively fragile" multinational coalition might falter if military action was deferred."
"It is far better for us to deal with him now than it will be for us to deal with him 5 or 10 years from now, when the members of the coalition have gone their disparate ways and when Saddam has become an even better armed and more threatening regional superpower than he is at present," Mr. Cheney argued.
 
Shift Since October
 His statements against waiting for economic sanctions to work ran counter to arguments he made in mid-October, when the Administration appeared to be relying on the sanctions. Mr. Cheney said at a news conference then with Defense Secretary Tom King of Britain that the sanctions and the embargo were beginning to have an effect,
"I would think if I were in his place tonight, I would be concerned that over the next few months he will see the erosion of his political base within Iraq, the erosion of his economy within Iraq and the erosion of the capability of the enormous military machine he's deployed in Kuwait and against Saudi Arabia," Mr. Cheney said at the time.
Though Mr. Cheney was not asked about those comments today, he said he had modified his thinking on the utlity of sanctions because of Iraq's decision to call off gasoline rationing and new Administration analyses about Iraq's ability to increase farm production and to mobilize additional troops.
The Secretary's argument for early military action were skeptically received by Democrats on the panel.
Senator John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat, said the argument about the weakness of the coalition was a "Chicken Little approach to our policy: the sky is falling and the only option is war."
And Senator Nunn disputed Mr. Cheney's argument that the United States should force a resolution of the gulf crisis to alleviate the economic hardships experienced by Eastern European and other nations hit hardest by rising oil prices. Instead of staging an attack, Washington should ask Saudi Arabia to contribute its "windfall profits" from increased oil production and rising prices to such hard-hit nations, Mr. Nunn said. He cited figures indicating that Saudi Arabia's oil revenues have shot up $30 billion because of the gulf crisis.
 
Rebuts Other Experts
 As Mr. Cheney outlined the rationale for early military action, General Powell sought to rebut experts -- including Senator Nunn, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and others -- who say the United States should rely largely on air power in any attack, instead of waging a ground campaign, which critics fear could involve many casualties.
General Powell argued that reliance on air power might not decisively defeat Iraq, would not allow the United States to maintain the military initiative and would allow Iraqi forces to concentrate on a single American threat, air power.
"I have no question about the competence and ability of our United States Air Force to inflict terrible punishment," General Powell said. "One can hunker down, one can dig in, one can disperse to try to ride out such a single-dimension attack.
"Recognizing that such attack will do grievous damage to the defenders after such a strategy has been executed, the decision is still in the hands of the defender to decide whether or not he has had enough punishment. Such strategies are designed to hope to win; they are not designed to win."
In contrast to the critics, General Powell said the American military was planning a "combined overwhelming air, land, sea campaign."
But Senator Glenn, a former pilot, questioned General Powell's military approach, saying the United States should apply the embargo for an extended period to deprive the Iraqi military of needed supplies. If war comes, the United States should then rely on an extended air compaign, Senator Glenn said, so casualities can be held down.
"I don't have much doubt that sometime we may have to wind up in combat over there, but let's do it embargoing him to as weak a position as possible," Senator Glenn said. "I don't see why we want to rush that schedule and not let these steps take their normal course of events, to make certain that we keep casualties as low as possible."

HEADLINE: 200 Contract Words Stall News Talks

BYLINE: By DAVID E. PITT

 BODY:
Forty days after the start of a bitterly divisive walkout, The Daily News and its unions still insist that they are willing to negotiate new contracts to replace the ones that expired last spring.
But despite some 200 bargaining sessions since January -- nearly a dozen of them since the strike began on Oct. 25 -- both sides remain oceans apart over management's demands for up to $70 million in labor cuts, including elimination of what it sees as needless overtime, rampant labor abuses and outdated work rules, like one that requires up to 700 drivers when The News says far fewer are needed. 
 Yesterday, leaders of the 700-member local of the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers of New York and Vicinity -- the first of nine unions to strike after The News replaced 60 drivers over a seemingly minor labor dispute -- showed up for their second negotiating session since the strike began.
There was no immediate word on the outcome of talks, held in lower Manhattan under the eye of a Federal mediator. But union officials said beforehand that they were not optimistic.
 
$150 Million Damage Suit
 In the last week, the negotiating atmosphere -- already poisoned by a vicious circle of public charges and countercharges -- grew worse after The News filed a $150 million damage suit in Federal court accusing labor leaders of racketeering. The suit repeated charges of a union-led conspiracy to terrorize news vendors, despite the findings of police investigators that no such conspiracy existed.
But the chief sticking point in the talks, labor leaders say, remains the same one that has bedeviled the negotiations for nearly a year: The News's insistence that new contracts include a paragraph of slightly more than 200 words titled "Management Rights."
The publisher, James Hoge, describes the paragraph as no more than contractual language expressing the fundamental right of any business to control itself. A spokesman, John T. Sloan, added, "That clause is found in 90 percent of all contracts in the newspaper industry today."
But union leaders say that if they were to agree to the broadly worded provision, they would be granting The News the right to modify or eliminate every agreement that the unions have won over decades of collective bargaining. It is thus not surprising, they say, that the phrase is repeated like a mantra by The News's chief negotiator, Robert Ballow, a Nashville lawyer reviled by organized labor for his success in breaking newspaper unions.
"I ask him, 'Tell me what you need for relief,' " Michael J. Alvino, the drivers' union president, complained over the summer. "And he always says, 'Give us management rights and we'll tell you.' "
The management rights clause, included in copies of proposed contracts delivered to union leaders last January, begins: "The union recognizes that any and all rights concerned with the management of the business and the direction of the work force are exclusively those of the Publisher."
It ends by saying that management may "take any other measures which the Publisher deems necessary for the orderly, efficient and profitable operation of its business."
Under Federal law, management and unions are required to bargain collectively -- and in good faith -- even in the event of a strike.
But union leaders complain that their acceptance of the management rights clause would would give The News virtual fiat to modify any contract. Moreover, they assert that Mr. Ballow (pronounced buh-loo) -- who has been in charge of the negotiations since they began -- has made management rights a nonnegotiable item.
Repeated efforts to reach Mr. Ballow for comment were unsuccessful. But Mr. Sloan denied the accusations.
Management rights, he said, would be subject to negotiation. He added that if after accepting management rights, a union were to object to any contract provision pertaining to hours, wages or working conditions, "then they are welcome to submit their own language" for further negotiation.
 
Strikers Demand Old Jobs Back
 The unions counter that several other major problems are standing in the way of a settlement, including what to do about the nonunion substitutes. The unions have insisted that all strikers must be given their jobs back.
But by far the biggest stumbling block, said George E. McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, is labor's belief that The News has never had the slightest intention of negotiating new contracts.
The chief exhibit in the unions' evidence is a deposition from Vincent Tese, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Commissioner of Economic Development, who swore in May that Mr. Hoge had visited him on April 17 and "made it clear that management was looking to achieve significant changes in the contracts and that the unions would never agree to the changes."
Mr. Hoge denies the accusation, saying Mr. Tese's statement is "riddled with errors."
A News spokesman added that Mr. Hoge remained hopeful about talks.

HEADLINE: Dow, Retaining Momentum, Rises by 5.94

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Building on Friday's gain, stock prices continued to advance yesterday, propelled in part by A.T.& T.'s $6 billion proposal to buy NCR, the computer giant once known as the National Cash Register Company.
High-tech stocks were especially strong following the offer. 
 NCR soared 24 3/4, to 81 1/2, with 8.5 million shares changing hands. A.T.& T. fell 2, to 30 1/8, on 5 million shares, as traders bought NCR and sold A.T.& T. in a standard Wall Street strategy to hedge their bets in case the deal eventually collapsed.
Airline stocks gained after Continental Airlines' said it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
And retail stocks strengthened after Joseph H. Ellis, retailing analyst for Goldman, Sachs, mentioned several on Friday on the television program "Wall Street Week."
Changing directions drastically several times during the day, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 16 points at the opening and then fell back by the same amount. By 2:30, the Dow was ahead again 15, only to slide 18 within an hour.
The Dow recovered somewhat in the final half-hour, ending the day at 2,565.59, up 5.94. Trading volume fell to 177 million shares, from 192.4 million on Friday.
"What we're seeing is a buildup of investor conviction," said Eugene E. Peroni, chief technical analyst for the investment firm Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, adding that "the market handled itself well last week, despite all the economic ambiguities and military uncertainties."
"It was largely tied into the price of oil," said Edgar Wachenheim 3d, chairman of Greenhaven Associates, a Manhattan investment manager. Crude oil, which plunged $4.06 a barrel on Friday, rose only 30 cents yesterday, to $29.25.
Program trading was also strong, tending toward selling. Birinyi Associates, which monitors such activity, said three selling waves took nearly 14 points off the Dow.
Among the high-tech issues, Digital Equipment rose 2 3/4, to 54 1/2; Apple Computer 1 3/8, to 38 1/8; Microsoft 1 5/8, to 73 7/8; Cray Research 1 7/8, to 31 3/8; Motorola 1 1/2, to 52, and Compaq Computer 1 3/8, to 54 1/2.
In the airline group, Continental fell 1 3/8, to 2 1/8, but Delta rose 1 3/4, to 58 1/2; UAL 1 7/8, to 99 3/8; Southwest Airlines 1 3/8, to 18 7/8, and AMR 1 1/4, to 48 1/2,
Among the retail sector mentioned by Mr. Ellis, the Goldman, Sachs analyst, Home Depot rose 2, to 37 3/4; the Limited 1 1/2, to 17 1/4; Wal-Mart 3/4, to 30 7/8 and Toys "R" Us 1 1/8, to 24 3/8.
 
 Stocks Drop in Tokyo
 TOKYO, Tuesday, Dec. 4 (REUTERS) -- Stock prices were sharply lower today, with the Nikkei index of 225 issues closing below 22,000 for the first time since Oct. 1. The Nikkei ended 863.38 points lower, or 3.8 percent, at 21,862.61. Brokers reported that heavy index selling, amid thin overall trading, depressed a market that was already suffering from the effects of a weaker yen.

HEADLINE: FREER TRADE TIES TO MOSCOW BACKED

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
The National Conference on Soviet Jewry, a confederation of more than 300 Jewish organizations, announced today that it would support President Bush should he decide to waive trade restrictions against the Soviet Union that are tied to the free emigration of Soviet Jews.
The organization released a statement noting that 180,000 Soviet Jews have left or are about to leave the Soviet Union this year, compared with 70,000 in 1989. 
 "We expect that the President will confirm that he has the assurances for the waiver required" the organization said, referring to conditions for easing trade with Moscow that are contained in the Jackson-Vanik ammendment.
 
'Goal of Freer Emigration'
 Martin A. Wenick, executive director of the group, said that "if by waiving Jackson-Vanik, it will contribute to the goal of freer emigration, then the President ought to do it."
The amendment, an irritant in United States-Soviet relations since it was enacted in 1974, linked most-favored-nation tariff treatment for Communist countries directly to their emigration policies. The provision was approved principally to encourage Moscow to rescind laws that prohibited millions of Soviet Jews from leaving the country.
The Soviet Union has yet to change its basic emigration laws, but it has significantly altered the ways the laws are applied, thus expediting the departure of many of the Soviet Jews who sought to leave.
A senior State Department official said the Jewish group's decision would make it politically easier for the Administration to issue a waiver of Jackson-Vanik as well as to provide credits for purchases of American grain to forestall possible food shortages in the Soviet Union this winter.
 
'Economic Migration' Feared
 The official said the Administration's "old position" of insisting that emigration laws be changed "is beginning to haunt us" now that fears are growing that a sweeping emigration revision might send millions of unwelcome "economic migrants" into Eastern Europe, swamping the attempts to transform centralized economies into ones that embrace free markets.
Mr. Bush said on Friday he was asking his principal advisers for recommendations on a possible Jackson-Vanik waiver to be delivered this week. Senior officials in the Agriculture and State Departments, as well as American farmer groups, have already endorsed a reversal.
Administration officials said they believe that Mr. Bush would like to waive the amendment as a way to show his support for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at a time of growing economic and nationalistic pressures in the Soviet Union.
 
'Sustained High Levels'
 The National Conference on Soviet Jewry statement said that "truly free emigration does not yet exist in the Soviet Union." But it noted that its re-examination of the issue comes "against the backdrop of almost two years of sustained high levels of Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union."
The group's statement was far more sympathetic in its assessment of the Soviet position than other groups pressing for freer Soviet emigration.
In a letter to Mr. Bush sent last week, the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews argued that a waiver of Jackson-Vanik would signify "that we are letting the U.S.S.R. off the hook" for continued human rights abuses.
"The agreements of the Helsinki Process, requiring freedom of emigration, no less than the strictures of Jackson-Vanik, compel the conclusion that this is the moment to press, not release, the leverage," it said.

HEADLINE: A Lilliputian Paris of the 40's Opens at Met Museum

BYLINE: By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO

 BODY:
Don't be surprised if next fall's fashion collections have a strong air of the 1940's. Designers who visit this year's Costume Institute exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which had a gala preview last night, could be influenced by the full skirts, wasp waists, gently tailored suits and feminine evening dresses. Some women were already in the mood. Donna Karan, Kimberly Farkas and Marina Schiano wore fairy-tale ballgowns reminiscent of the 40's. They laughed as they jumped over rain puddles and hitched up their skirts in a dash up the museums steps. "Everything in fashion has its relevance," Ms. Karan said as she headed into the show. 
 The exhibition, "Theatre de la Mode," comprises 150 miniature mannequins in French haute couture styles from spring 1946 with strong harbingers of the New Look of 1947. The mannequins are displayed in sets that were originally designed by leading artists and designers of the era and have been recreated for the show, which ran in Paris from May to September of this year.
 
A Memory of 1946
 Bill Blass saw the exhibition in 1946 at the Whitelaw Reid mansion on Madison Avenue. "I had just come out of the Army," he said, "and I remember it well. Those clothes are still totally contemporary."
"Especially the Jacques Fath," said Pat Buckley, chairman of the evening. "He did my trousseau."
Among the other couturiers represented in the Met show are Lucien Lelong (whose designer at the time was a man named Christian Dior), Nina Ricci, Molyneux, Maggy Rouff, Jeanne Lanvin, Schiaparelli, Marcel Rochas, Robert Piguet, Balenciaga and Pierre Balmain. There are tiny handbags by Hermes, platform-soled pumps and ankle-strap shoes.
"Oh, those divine little shoes," murmured Mary McFadden, who had also seen the exhibition before. "But not in the 40's," she said, laughing and leaning on the arm of her husband, Kohle Yohannan. "We saw it in Paris last summer."
Those who paid $900 each to see the show last night included Ivana Trump, Sonia Braga, David Bowie, Valentino Garavani, Blaine and Robert Trump, Nancy and Henry Kissinger, Kelly and Calvin Klein, Carolyne Roehm and Henry Kravis. And Isabella Rossellini, daughter of one of the premiere movie stars of the 40's.
When the war ended in 1945, France was in economic ruin, said Katell le Bourhis, associate curator of the museum's Costume Institute. "The only industry that could be revived very quickly was couture because it didn't need factories," she said. "It depended on creativity and skills, and the skills were still there."
So the French fashion industry, contrived a traveling exhibition in miniature to show the world that Paris was still the capital of fashion. In addition to the publicity value, the exhibition was intended to entice wealthy women to order clothes from the miniature samples.
The first show, in Paris in March 1945, and an updated version in 1946 traveled to London, Leeds (origin of many couture fabrics), Stockholm, Copenhagen, Barcelona, Vienna, New York and San Francisco. Admission was charged to help French war relief.
The original 15 sets, designed by the likes of Jean Cocteau and Christian Berard, were lost. But the dolls ended up at the Maryhill Museum in Goldendale, Wash. They were returned to Paris for restoration in 1984.
 There are vestiges of the tailored suits and shoulder bags of the war years in the mannequins on exhibit, alongside full-skirted dresses based on couture styles of the late 1930's. Even an amateur can see how the full-skirted dresses with belted waistlines evolved into Dior's New Look.
The beaded and bejeweled evening dresses with their sweeping long skirts make dramatic tableaux, especially in a three-dimensional theater set by Berard with red drapes, a crystal chandelier and box seats on two sides of the stage. The evening dresses are almost timeless; the day clothes really tell the story of the fashion of the day.
 
Mannequins Strolling
 Among the sets displaying daytime suits and dresses are scenes of mannequins window-shopping in the Place Vendome and strolling outside the Palais Royal. A setting of the Ile de la Cite has mannequins modeling the couture equivalent of sportswear, including a pants costume with a bright green hacking jacket over a matching vest by Freddy Sport.
The only set that relates to the war itself is Cocteau's surrealistic bombed-out maid's room with a witch in a gray tulle Balmain dress flying from the rafters.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
McGee Signed by Giants; Expos Retain Martinez

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROSEMONT, Ill., Dec. 3

 BODY:
The collusion settlement between baseball's owners and the players may not be ready for ratification at their respective meetings this week, but it nevertheless had a profound impact today on the San Francisco Giants and the Montreal Expos.
Reacting to the impending "free-look" free agency that will be part of the settlement, the Expos kept Dennis Martinez, their No. 1 pitcher, by signing him to a three-year, $9.5 million contract. The Giants, however, decided to let Brett Butler, their center fielder and leadoff hitter, leave them, and instead signed Willie McGee, a free agent, to a four-year contract for $13 million. 
 In other free-agent signings, Terry Pendleton, the St. Louis Cardinals' former third baseman who this year batted a career-low .230, joined the Atlanta Braves with a four-year, $10.2 million contract, and Kevin Gross, a pitcher with an 80-90 career record who hasn't had a winning season since 1985, became a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers' starting rotation with a three-year, $6.4 million contract.
 
Rosen Explains His Motives
 Al Rosen, the Giants' general manager, explained his stunning announcement here at baseball's winter meetings by saying he did not want to sign Butler to the four-year, $15 million contract the player wanted to remain with the team. If he remained, Butler would waive his right to leave as one of 16 players who will become free agents as soon as there is agreement on the settlement of the collusion case, in which an arbitrator ruled the owners colluded to hold down free-agent salaries.
Kevin Mitchell and Will Clark each have four-year, $15 million contracts with the Giants. Rosen had offered Butler $10 million for four years, the same deal he gave Bud Black, a free-agent pitcher with a career 83-82 record. The general manager did not attempt to negotiate from the respective proposals.
"I felt the asking price was more than we could meet and I didn't want to leave here without a center fielder," Rosen said.
McGee, 32 years old, won the National League batting championship this year with a .335 average even though he finished the season with Oakland of the American League. Butler, who batted .309, scored 108 runs and had 51 stolen bases this season, has two years left at $1.35 million a year on his existing contract.
Richard Moss, Butler's agent, said that Rosen told him the Giants would be willing to release Butler as soon as the collusion settlement is ratified so he could begin talking to other clubs immediately.
 
A Number of Possibilities
 "Brett is interested in the possibility of a number of clubs," Moss said. "What we discussed with the Giants was in the context of the Giants, and that does not mean we will insist on those figures with other clubs."
The Expos took the opposite approach to the Giants. They wanted to make sure they did not lose Martinez.
"The Player Relations Committee recently had a briefing on the settlement, and after hearing what they said, we had the strong feeling that he would be a second-look free agent," Dave Dombrowski, the Expos' general manager, said. "There's no question about it. We dealt with him as if he were a free agent."
Fifteen other players, including Jack Clark, Jack Morris and Butler, will become free agents as soon as the settlement talks are completed. One lawyer involved in the talks said today that the two sides were exchanging drafts but that some issues remained to be resolved and it was possible that an agreement would not be ready for Wednesday, when the owners hold their final meeting of the annual winter meetings here.
Martinez, 35 years old, had a 10-11 record this year, but the Expos' made him baseball's fifth highest-paid pitcher. With an average annual value of $3,166,667, he only ranks behind Dave Stewart, Nolan Ryan, Mark Davis and Mark Langston.
 
55-41 Record With Expos
 Martinez, who has compiled a 55-41 record in five years with Montreal, was the 21st player and McGee the 22d to sign a contract worth $3 million or more, an economic category of players that did not exist 54 weeks ago. He had a contract calling for a $1.6 million salary for next season, but the Expos tore that up and gave him the new deal.
"We were very concerned we would lose him," Dombrowksi said. "We didn't feel we could go into the season losing our No. 1 pitcher. To compete, we needed to sign him."
In another free-agent matter, Bill Goodstein, Dave Righetti's agent, checked in today, seeking to continue his talks with the Yankees.
"We haven't made a proposal," Gene Michael, the general manager of the Yankees, said, "because we can't get the number of years straightened out. If we get that straightened out, I think we'll work it out."
Goodstein declined to identify other teams interested in Righetti, but a friend of Righetti said Minnesota and California are two.

Union-Management Plan To Help Young Players

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROSEMONT, Ill., Dec. 3

 BODY:
A long-sought thaw in baseball's labor relations appeared closer to coming to fruition today as a first-ever joint venture between management and the Major League Baseball Players Association was outlined here at the winter meetings.
The new program, revealed by Commissioner Fay Vincent in his annual state-of-the-game address, is one designed to better prepare young players for the pressures of the big leagues. The plan, along with the imminent naming of a joint committee to study the economics of the game, was portrayed by Vincent as yet another example of efforts "to establish some common ground" between players and management. 
 Vincent, whose speech was delivered in written form because he is continuing to recover from pneumonia at his home in Greenwich, Conn., also referred to an arbitrator's recent settlement in a case that ruled baseball's owners colluded in trying to lower payments to free agents. He said both the owners and the players were days away from deciding whether to approve the $280 million settlement.
"Should it be approved," Vincent said, "then finally we can put this episode behind us for good, and move forward."
 
Concept Developed by N.B.A.
 Donald Fehr, executive director of the players union, acknowledged on-going attempts to improve the relationship between players and management.
"The fact is, if the relationship improves, it hinges almost entirely on whether the collusion settlement goes through and whether the free-agent market continues to show signs that it is operating and well," Fehr said by telephone from Orlando, Fla., where the union's representatives are about to begin their own meetings. "If the relationship does improve, everybody has to be encouraged. It doesn't mean you agree on everything; if it could avoid unnecessary squabbling, that could be a step in the right direction."
Fehr has been invited to join in the leadership for the joint venture. He will propose the idea to his union this week.
"This is a concept that was developed by the N.B.A. and it's our understanding that it's been reasonably successful over there," Fehr said.
 
Common Ground
 The very idea that such an effort is being made may be as important as the program itself, said the program's architect, Steve Greenberg, the deputy commissioner, who is designing what is tentatively called the Player Personnel Development Committee.
"The key thing is that we are doing something constructive with the union," Greenberg said. "The common ground between the union and the clubs is much greater than one might think."
Officials hope to have the committee in place by February.
 
Little Progress
 Also today, baseball released hiring statistics in its annual equal-opportunity employment report, and major league officials admitted that the numbers were flat.
In 1990, there were 305 Asian, black and Hispanic front-office employees, compared with 273 the year before and 142 in 1988. The percentage remained at 15 percent, the same as 1989.
As for on-field positions, Asian, black and Hispanic managers, trainers, scouts, coaches and instructors numbered 324 this year as opposed to 313 in 1989 and 199 in 1988. The percentage remained at 20 for a second consecutive year, however.
Greenberg said: "The numbers are flat, but I take that as not really a negative sign, because our office has not been as active in this area as we have wanted to be and have vowed to be because of the number of activities that have kept us very busy during the commissioner's first year in office. But we have reaffirmed our push in this area and I would expect to see an up tick in the numbers a year from now."

HEADLINE: U.S. Pushes for Lead Over Japan With Chips Etched by X-Rays

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
ENGINEERS have switched on an innovative machine that could help the United States win a clear lead in the international race to pack more circuits onto computer chips, seizing the initiative back from Japanese manufacturers.
The device, at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, is the nation's first compact synchrotron, a small, ring-shaped particle accelerator that emits X-rays to etch exceptionally fine lines on the slivers of silicon that lie at the heart of most complex electronic devices. The $32 million machine is a mere 13 feet long and 7 feet wide, a far cry from giant particle accelerators from which it descends. Small size means its offspring could easily fit into chip factories. The machine began its first phase of operation in October. 
 "It's got the possibility of being a winning ticket," said Dr. Gwyn P. Williams, a Brookhaven physicist who believes the United States leads Japan in perfecting the X-ray technology. "We could capture some huge percentage of the world market."
Japan's share of the world chip market soared in the 1980's, even as America's dropped. Between 1980 and 1990, the United States semiconductor industry saw its market share fall to under 40 percent from 60 percent. Worse, the American share in chip-making equipment also fell dramatically, leaving the industry increasingly dependent on foreign suppliers.
Today the Japanese have an X-ray effort larger than that of the United States. But experts here are eager to push ahead, noting that technological shifts are often the time when market leadership can be wrested away by bold entrants. The Brookhaven machine, financed by the Defense Department, is a prototype meant to help American manufacturers master the field of X-ray lithography in the mid to late 1990's. The X-ray process can easily etch circuit lines of about 0.1 micron (one-thousandth the width of a human hair), which in theory would allow the equivalent of four billion transistors to be crammed onto a computer chip. In comparison, the standard etching process today works at around 1 micron (one-hundredth the width of a human hair) to make computer memory chips equivalent to one million transistors.
X-ray lithography is not the only aspirant for the task of etching finer lines. Scientists around the world are racing to invent new ways to cut tiny circuits as traditional techniques using visible light reach their limit. Candidates for the next generation of chip-making machines include electron beams, ion beams and X-rays produced by a variety of devices, including particle accelerators and lasers.
X-rays are seen as a top choice for advancing the field, with some experts saying their production by accelerators is crucial to the international chip race. "If we don't develop it we'll lose the lead for sure," said Dr. Franco Cerrina, director of the Center for X-ray Lithography at the University of Wisconsin.
The Brookhaven machine and complementary X-ray devices at Wisconsin and other academic research centers are important examples of how Congress is quietly putting money into high-technology research, largely over the objections of free marketers in the Bush Administration who would leave the job to industry. For the fiscal year 1990, Congress put some $30 million into the work. For the fiscal year 1991, which began on Oct. 1, it doubled the figure. The X-ray work is administered by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
Today ordinary light is the main tool in making chips. The light passes through a "mask" much like a photographic negative and then onto the surface of a silicon wafer coated with photosensitive chemicals. This process is known as lithography. The end result is an etched chip. Over the years, etched lines have become increasingly fine and circuits more complex, vastly increasing the power of computer chips and the electronic devices they drive.
The natural limit to that process is now on the horizon. The consensus among experts is that light will work down to about 0.3 microns, a micron being a millionth of a meter. Below that, light waves are too large to render sharp images.
X-rays are a leading candidate for the next step in chip making because of their exceedingly short wavelengths. A crucial question is how to generate them. Medical X-rays are too strong, penetrating most matter. In contrast, "soft" or low-energy X-rays interact well with chip-making materials. But the best way to make them in the needed quantities has been with huge, costly, unwieldy particle accelerators known as synchrotrons.
These machines push electrons to nearly the speed of light. As the electrons zip around the large circular rings, they shed enormous numbers of soft X-rays in a process known as synchrotron radiation. Today the world's largest synchrotron center is at Brookhaven. Its two main rings are 50 feet and 180 feet in diameter. The International Business Machines Corporation, considered the world leader in X-ray lithography for chip making, has done much work on the rings at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.
Synchrotrons were pioneered in the United States. But their adaptation for chip making, a matter of shrinking their size, has been led by the Japanese, who in an aggressive program have built at least three very small synchrotrons for X-ray lithography and more than a half dozen larger ones.
"It's the same old story," said Rick Cole, a Wisconsin X-ray lithography expert. "The U.S. develops the technology and then Japan takes it and beats us at our own game."
The key to shrinking a synchrotron is to use superconducting magnets, which when cooled to near absolute zero become much more powerful than ordinary ones. Magnets of greater strength allow a small ring to considerably boost its energy, giving a richer shower of X-rays.
Though ahead in making small synchrotrons, Japan is seen as trailing the United States in the art of actually using the machines to etch experimental chips. Moreover, some American experts say the sheer size of the Japanese synchrotron push is actually diluting the effort.
 
I.B.M. Leading Way
 "They're overinvesting," said Philip Webre, an analyst at the Congressional Budget Office who recently wrote an X-ray lithography report. "Realistically, there are only a handful of teams that can handle the research job."
In the United States, the industrial leader in the push to make smaller synchrotrons is I.B.M. It has designed and ordered from Oxford Instruments Group in England a superconducting synchrotron about 20 feet long and 7 feet wide, which it hopes to have running next year at its research center in East Fishkill, N.Y. Teaming with I.B.M. to explore the process is Motorola Inc., the chip maker. I.B.M. has calculated that a single synchrotron would be powerful enough to annually make nearly six times the amount of computer memory used worldwide last year.
Dr. Daniel J. Fleming, director of the research center, said I.B.M. already has used X-ray lithography to make experimental chips with line widths of 0.5 microns and has demonstrated the technology down to 0.25 microns. The new synchrotron made by Oxford Instruments, he said, will be a production device to etch wafers.
A step beyond the I.B.M. effort is Brookhaven's new machine, which is smaller and more powerful. At the moment, its magnets operate at room temperature. But Brookhaven scientists are preparing superconducting ones, which, when installed in 1992 or 1993, will considerably boost the machine's output. It is to generate a current of 0.5 amperes, a measure of electron flow through the ring. That level, which is quite large for a small synchrotron, is considered good enough for highly advanced chip manufacturing. In contrast, the I.B.M. machine is to have a lower power level of 0.135 amperes.
The wavelength goal for both the I.B.M. and Brookhaven machines is about 0.001 microns -- far smaller than the finest circuit lines now foreseen as feasible by computer chip makers.
"Contrary to what people think, these machines are not easy to build," said Dr. Richard N. Heese, head of the Brookhaven project. For one thing, the synchrotron's small size means the difficult job of creating a strong magnetic prison to guide speeding electrons must be accomplished in a smaller space, around a "short radius of curvature," Dr. Heese said. For another, the whole system must withstand the intense pressures generated by super-strong superconducting magnets, which can exert 200 tons of force.
"You have to do so many things in a small space," said Dr. Heese.
 
The Matter of Money
 At Wisconsin, scientists are pursuing complementary work aimed at perfecting ways to handle the X-rays for chip making. Since X-rays are impossible to manipulate with ordinary lenses, many new kinds of equipment are being created. The problem of making "masks" that can withstand a barrage of X-rays has been largely solved, said Dr. Cerrina, head of the Wisconsin center. The greatest challenge today, he added, is to draw circuit patterns on these masks with extreme accuracy.
"Precision is the problem," Dr. Cerrina said.
Perhaps the main hurdle for the field is not technical but financial. Chip factories based around X-ray synchrotrons are estimated to cost in the neighborhood of $500 million or more. I.B.M. estimates that by the time it starts full-scale production with X-ray lithography in the mid-1990's, it will have invested $1 billion.
Because of these high costs, many American chip makers are sitting on the sidelines, waiting to see if the work pans out.
"There's always a period of euphoria with these technologies," said Dr. Fleming of I.B.M. "With X-ray lithography in the last three years, people went from complete ignorance to a euphoric peak, to realizing that you can't buy it off the shelf, that it takes a lot of work, and that it's expensive. Besides which, now is not the best of economic times. People are trying to understand the cost."
Many scientists in the field say the Japanese are showing little or no hesitancy in pursuing the idea, no matter how expensive, and that it is in America's best interest to do likewise.
"We're in an interesting situation," said Dr. Williams of Brookhaven, who was the lead author of a report saying the United States has a one- to two-year lead over the rest of the world in most aspects of synchrotron X-ray lithography.
"It's a pity more people aren't putting their money on it," he said. "It's disappointing to people who would like the U.S. to maintain its competitive edge."

For Whom the Tolls Toll

 BODY:
Commuters won't like it. And with their states facing budget deficits that require many other painful steps, the timing isn't great. But Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey and Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York can no longer deny the need for a $1 toll increase on bridges and tunnels run by the Port Authority.
A plan submitted by the agency's new director, Stanley Brezenoff, would increase round-trip tolls from $3 to $4 early next year on four bridges and two tunnels. Commuters who buy monthly passes would pay $72 for a 20-trip package, up from the present $40. The $1 fare on PATH trains would rise to $1.25.
A similar proposal by Mr. Brezenoff's predecessor died last spring after a chilly response from the two Governors, who share veto power over any toll increase. About $100 million in essential capital improvements had to be postponed. Further delay could risk the region's long-term economic health.
The interstate transportation network operates at a heavy deficit, and revenues from the region's airports and from the World Trade Center, also operated by the Port Authority, can no longer provide big subsidies. Those facilities urgently require major renovations themselves.
The Automobile Club of New York complains about charging automobile commuters more to cover PATH's operating losses. But the proposed $4 toll is still a relative bargain; the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority charges $5 round-trip on its crossings. Moreover, drivers clearly benefit when commuters are diverted from congested roadways and onto mass transit.
The task may be politically difficult. But it shouldn't be too much to ask Mr. Florio and Mr. Cuomo to face up to reasonable toll and fare increases needed to rehabilitate the region's infrastructure.

HEADLINE: Left Behind in Germany

 BODY:
The latest milestone of German unity has brought results that are simultaneously obvious, surprising and deceptive.
The governing right-center coalition was surely expected to win the first all-German elections since 1933. The surprise came in the size of the losses suffered by the opposition parties. How could the left lose, given the addition of all those former East German Communists to the electorate? 
 The answer, and the deceptive aspect of the returns, is that the right and center ate the left's lunch. Now the winners will have to pay for their campaign promises and Americans will have to recognize that, if only for reasons of domestic politics, Germany will have to find its own way.
 To former East Germans, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his coalition partner, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, promised economic deliverance. Millions responded enthusiastically to their message of hope, rather than to that of the Social Democrats, who played to blue-collar resentment of welfare for the east.
Mr. Genscher's Free Democrats won 11 percent of the vote, up from 9 percent in 1987, and Mr. Kohl's Christian Democrats held their 44 percent. The Social Democrats slipped to 33.5 percent. The western Greens plunged to 5 percent, below the level needed to qualify for Parliament.
Now, however, the coalition will have to make good on the promised deliverance. German reports estimate that 1,000 former East Germans a week are still moving west, in search of jobs and prosperity. The victors did little in the campaign to prepare the German people for the cost of deliverance. The Government will almost certainly have to scale back spending on defense if it is to provide the necessary social welfare for 16 million Germans in the east.
The opposition can learn to make promises too, and to avoid being outbid Mr. Kohl and Mr. Genscher may try to change the political agenda. Just as they rightly insisted that German unification was for Germans to decide, they could begin now to reassert sovereignty over reducing foreign nuclear weapons and loosening Germany's military integration with NATO.
The United States can help manage this transition. Getting on with negotiations to eliminate short-range nuclear arms would probably relieve hasty pressure to remove all nuclear weapons. Cutting U.S. troop levels substantially would make it easier for a modest force to remain.
A sovereign Germany cannot be expected to follow Washington on security issues as faithfully as before. But that is no reason for Americans to be alarmed. They know what a united Germany is discovering: Politics is promises and promises have their price.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
A Week in Jerusalem

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

DATELINE: JERUSALEM

 BODY:
For seven days, I have been talking with a full range of top-rank Israeli civilian and military leaders. This is an attempt to distill the essence of what they said about two war-or-peace crises central to this country's existence.
One is relatively new -- the situation in the Persian Gulf. The other has dominated life in the Middle East for almost a half-century and is at least as important and dangerous as ever -- the struggle between Israel and those Arab nations that in heart and action still resent and challenge Israel's existence among them. 
 Since I wanted as much candor as possible, the understanding was that the Israeli leaders would not be quoted by name. I did not attempt to get a "consensus" from men of different responsibilities and duties, but I think most of them would agree with most of what follows.
On Saddam Hussein: if the United States and its Western allies want to keep the Arab Middle East, its oil riches and its political destiny out of the hands of Saddam Hussein it will have to fight him, now or later.
The Israelis think he is strong but beatable now, but will be stronger later. Examining the economic planning of Iraq known to them and the profile of his entire political life, they believe he will keep using the oil billions of the future for two military objectives: development of his chemical weapons and the achievement of nuclear weapon power.
The major concern is his approaching ability to parcel out nuclear weapons among extremist allies, which would make international supervision an evil joke. The estimate for this is three to five years.
This is a long way from saying that the Israelis "want" war. As a matter of fact, a few days in Israel would convince anybody but a fool or an incurable Israel-hater that the last thing in the world that this country "wants" is war. The whole picture of an Israel macho-mad for war in the gulf or anyplace else becomes an absurdity. It would be comical if it were not so often painted with ugly motivation.
This country has lived through one war after another with Arab nations, who lost everything but their hatred. The U.S. likes to pretend Israel has no role in the Persian Gulf crisis, but Israelis are entirely intelligent enough to know that in case of a gulf war they would have to expect an Iraqi attack on Israel.
The only thing that could prevent it is Saddam Hussein's understanding of Israel's ability and readiness to retaliate with enormous power. They remind him of this fact in a variety of ways without having to send their Foreign Minister to Baghdad.
But nonetheless they know he may not go down without trying to change the war into an Arab crusade against Israel. They are not trying to push the United States into a war, which they could never do. In any case, that is now the full-time pursuit of Washington's new allies such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait and Syria, which have at least as much to fear from Saddam Hussein as does Israel. But Israelis add up the cost of fighting now or fighting later, and they come to their own conclusions -- without any pleasure either way.
Some of the most informed men with whom I talked have strong professional respect for the maneuvering talents of both Saddam Hussein and George Bush. They do not expect the Iraqi to collapse in terror when Secretary of State James Baker looks him straight in the eye.
They think that instead he will begin unwrapping his proposal for a "compromise" under which he would withdraw from most of Kuwait -- except for this oilfield and that gulf island.
They do not know what Mr. Bush will do after the pressures mount on him to accept. But they think Mr. Bush knows that air attacks in strength could cripple Iraq and lessen -- although not eliminate -- the need and cost for ground combat.
On the Israel-Arab confrontation, they know a one-word answer: Sadat. Anwar el-Sadat moved for peace between Israel and Egypt and the Israelis rushed toward it, willing to pay the price -- the land of Sinai, so dear to both nations.
They do not see another Sadat now. But they think that whatever happens in the gulf, the monarchies and despotisms will eventually begin to fall apart. Fanatic fundamentalism may be the major result. But perhaps one day change in the Arab world will bring forward another leader ready to risk peace. Until then, Israel must swim in hostile seas.
In the seven days of talk, there was not a moment of bluster, drama or pretense. There seemed too much at stake for anything but calm.

HEADLINE: Budget-Deficit Plan Closes Gap in Albany Without Gimmicks

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Before the Nov. 6 elections, I announced that New York faced a significant budget deficit this year that we needed to overcome without raising taxes or borrowing. I was pleased at that time to hear a chorus of state legislative candidates ratify both the problem and the solution. Now I have given the Legislature a proposal to reduce spending this year by $1 billion through recurring cuts in local aid, social services and the state's work force. This plan will close the budget gap and without gimmicks.
It does not do it without pain. I have worked hard, however, to see that the pain is shared in proportion to the ability to make sacrifices. Cuts in education aid, for example, reflect a school district's wealth. I have minimized the need for employee layoffs through furloughs, attrition and voluntary retirement. This means, regrettably, that a rejection of my proposal for furloughs would force thousands of people out of work.
The deficit equals only about 2 percent of the state budget. Many states around the country and, of course, the Federal Government face greater imbalances.
Even with the cuts I have proposed, budget growth in such areas as education and mental health during my first two terms as Governor will have exceeded 90 percent, or three times the rate of inflation. It will be difficult to argue, in light of that growth, that any of the proposed cuts is intolerably deep or that they will leave local governments with no choice but to raise their taxes.
Our deficit-reduction plan is designed not to weaken our government, but to insure that we preserve government's capacity to meet its obligations over the long term.
Indeed, this period of revenue shortfalls presents an opportunity for re-examination and reform that can make our government more efficient than ever. I look forward to the analysis and recommendations of the Legislature and timely enactment of a plan that will balance this year's budget and prevent future deficits.
I ask for your help, especially in pointing out that it is not enough to reject the reductions; whatever is rejected must be replaced with an alternative cut. We can't pretend we can make the problem disappear because the solution is inconvenient or even painful.

HEADLINE: Stangl Is Said To Be Choice For M.T.A.

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 3

 BODY:
The president of the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, Peter E. Stangl, is the leading contender to fill the vacancy at the top of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Cuomo administration officials said today.
He would replace Robert R. Kiley, who announced his resignation as M.T.A. chairman early last week. 
 The M.T.A. chairman, one of the state's most powerful non-elected officials, oversees a far-flung transportation network that includes New York City's subway and bus lines, two commuter rail lines, seven bridges and two tunnels. Each day, roughly six million New Yorkers rely on the M.T.A. and its subsidiaries -- Metro-North, the Long Island Railroad, the New York City Transit Authority and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority -- to get from place to place.
Mr. Stangl, 49 years old, has been president and general manager of Metro-North since 1983. In recent months, he has been credited with increasing ridership on the commuter line at a time when the number of riders on the M.T.A.'s other rail lines has been dropping.
 
Job Offer in a Few Days
 Cuomo administration officials, noting that standard background checks, which are conducted by the state police, had not been completed, stressed today that Mr. Stangl had not yet been formally offered the M.T.A. chairmanship. But they said that unless the background checks uncovered damaging information, they expected Mr. Stangl to be offered the job within the next few days.
The nomination would be subject to approval by the State Senate.
"It's safe to say that he's the leading candidate," one administration official said.
Mr. Stangl was out of town today and could not be reached for comment.
Mr. Kiley is widely credited with having lifted the sagging image of New York City's subway and commuter lines during his seven years in office, and his successor will inherit a rail system in which more than 90 percent of the cars have been rebuilt or replaced. But revenues and ridership have flagged in the last year, and the system will need a large infusion of new funds to continue its rebuilding efforts beyond next year.
All three rail lines -- the L.I.R.R., Metro-North, and the New York City subway system -- are currently considering fare increases and service cuts to close growing budget deficits.
Since January, when fares were last increased, ridership on both the L.I.R.R. and the city subways has dropped by about 4 percent, according to figures provided by the M.T.A. But during the same period, ridership on Metro-North trains has, in contrast, increased about 1.5 percent.
"Assuming Stangl does get the job, we hope he will do for the subways what he's done for Metro-North," said Gene Russianoff, a staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a transit advocacy group.
Probably the most daunting task facing the new M.T.A. chairman is securing new financing for the authority's ambitious capital improvement program.
 
Seeking $12 Billion More
 Money for the current phase of the program -- $8.6 billion -- is scheduled to run out at the end of 1991. M.T.A. officials have already said they plan to seek an additional $12 billion from the State Legislature to carry the program through 1996, but the state's own budget problems are likely to complicate this effort.
Several officials today described Mr. Stangl, who holds a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in economics from the University of Connecticut, as well suited to confront the interlocking financial and transportation issues facing the M.T.A. From 1972 to 1973, Mr. Stangl served as a budget administrator for the New York City Transporation Administration, and before that as a program planner for transportation at the city's budget office.
Members of the Straphangers Campaign said that they expected Mr. Stangl, whom they described as talkative and expansive, to be a more outgoing and accessible M.T.A. chairman than Mr. Kiley, who maintained an unusually low profile for such a high-ranking public official.
"This is good, because the key job is going to be getting the $12 billion," Mr. Russianoff said. "And you don't do that by being a shrinking violet."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Syndication Trek: Journey Continues

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
SEVEN years after President Reagan parried their last lobbying assault, the television networks are again preparing for war with Hollywood over the right to market programs after they have been shown in primetime. Why, the networks ask, should the Japanese, Australian and Italian carpetbaggers who have snapped up Universal/MCA (Matsushita), MGM/UA (Pathe), Columbia (Sony) and 20th Century Fox (News Corporation) have freedom to syndicate programming that is denied to NBC, ABC and CBS?
Why, indeed. Alfred C. Sykes, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, favors repeal of the regulatory limits the commission imposed in 1970. And now that the Gipper has hung up his shoulder pads, Hollywood can no longer count on help from higher places. 
 The demise of the syndication rule would not upset Peter Pitsch, a former F.C.C. staff member who consults in Washington. Like many economists, he has never been persuaded that the studios needed protection from network avarice. But Mr. Pitsch is more puzzled than elated by the latest turn of events. In his view, there is less at stake here than meets the eye.
The studios assert that the rule is a matter of economic life and death. Payments for prime time, they note, do not cover the full cost of production. Thus, if Big Peacock and the other network bullies were allowed to grab syndication rights, the studios might never make a profit.
Independent television stations, which compete with network affiliates, stand with Hollywood: the networks, they fear, would warehouse reruns to bolster the audience for their own new shows.Mr. Pitsch does not share their alarm. The three networks might have once had the leverage to play rough with the studios because they were the only program buyers in town. But today, he notes, they face competition from cable, as well as from independent stations that buy original programming direct from studios. And it is almost inconceivable that a network would withhold popular (but perishable) programs from syndicated reruns when it would have to divide the resulting gain in audience share with a dozen or more rivals.
In any case, Mr. Pitsch points out, the syndication rule never really protected sellers from network power. Taking one item of value -- syndication rights -- off the bargaining table could not prevent the networks from using their leverage to exact other valuable concessions, notably cuts in the portion of production costs that would be covered by payments for prime-time viewing.
By the same token it is not obvious why the networks are so eager to go into the business: In a competitive market, the studios would not part with syndication rights for less than their worth.Lawrence Summers, a Harvard economist who consults for the networks, argues that the inability of the networks to pay up front for syndication rights forces independent producers unable to bear the risk of deficit financing to share their best ideas with big studios. The net effect, he suggests, is to raise the cost of the programming and reduce its diversity.
That argument is plausible. But Mr. Pitsch wonders why there is insufficient competition among the eight major studios to drive out excess profits. And he is perplexed by the support by independent producers for the syndication rule, which, by Mr. Summers's logic, hardly serves their interests.
The best explanation Mr. Pitsch can conjure runs something like this. If networks could contractually share in syndication rights, they would have an incentive to enhance syndication value in ways that could not be pinned down in contracts with producers. They might, for example, keep a slipping show on the air for an extra 13 weeks to improve its prospects for syndication later on.
That might increase the total value of syndicated shows -- part of which would presumably trickle down to producers. But it would also increase the number of shows competing for air time in syndication, increasing competition among syndicators and driving down studio profits.
This does not explain why independent stations also oppose the move by the networks into the syndication business. But it at least offers a rational peg for the networks and the studios to hang their hats on.
It is also possible that the fight is an artifact of the unusual culture of the business. In the feudal economy of mass entertainment, where everyone from stagehands to the owners of broadcast licenses is perpetually manuevering for a larger slice of what is widely seen as a fixed pie, it is only natural to assume that the gain of the networks must be someone else's loss. Only natural -- but in this case, probably wrong.

British Say Allies Must Erase Doubts

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Britain's new Prime Minister, John Major, repeated his Government's strong support today for international demands that Iraq pull out of Kuwait by Jan. 15. But members of his Government warned that if Iraq balks, the allies must leave no doubt about their willingness to use military force.
One high-ranking Government official, referring to growing opposition in Congress to the use of force, said the United States would have to "fish or cut bait" soon after the United Nations deadline in mid-January. 
 "We want to see a peaceful solution in the gulf," Mr. Major told a group of Conservative Party supporters today. But he said that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq would have to pull his forces out of Kuwait unconditionally if he wanted to avoid an attack.
"It is in his hands," Mr. Major said.
 
'Short and Sharp' War
 His Defense Minister, Tom King, told the House of Commons today that if war did break out, it would be "short and sharp and quick." He said Britain and the United States were sending reinforcements to the Persian Gulf to insure "that the casualties on the allied side could be kept to a minimum."
Mr. King announced that Britain was sending 14,000 more troops to the gulf on Nov. 22, the day that Margaret Thatcher announced that she would resign as Prime Minister. The deployment will bring the total number of British troops there to more than 30,000, amounting to a tenth of Britain's total active duty force, by the end of next month. The United States expects to have more than 400,000 troops in the area by then.
Brig. Patrick Cordingley, commander of the British Seventh Armored Brigade in Saudi Arabia, said last week that a war would be "particularly unpleasant" if it came.
"There are going to be a lot of casualties and inevitably one has to be prepared for unpleasant things to unfold," press accounts quoted him as saying. The reports said his chief of staff had estimated that casualties could run to 15 percent of the total force.
 
Limited Time Frame
 No official here would speculate on when the forces allied against Iraq would be most likely to strike. But several said that if fighting did not begin by the end of March or early April, when hot weather returns to the Arabian desert, it would be difficult to sustain such huge deployments.
Before the Chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin L. Powell, arrived here today for consultations, a senior official in the British Government said the vast allied force would suffer humiliation tantamount to defeat if President Saddam Hussein of Iraq refused to leave by mid-January and the force did not act.
"It would soon be time to fish or cut bait, as you say," the official said. "Would you not agree that if this huge force assembled in Saudi Arabia were to go home a few months later without having achieved the objective of forcing Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, that it would have suffered defeat?"
General Powell met with Mr. Major, Mr. King, and British military officials here today, the United States Embassy said. It declined to reveal the substance of the discussions.
British officials profess to be unconcerned about polls showing an erosion in support among the American public for military action in the gulf. Nor do they acknowledge any worry about warnings against war from influential senators like Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, who has said that an attack on the Iraqis would be "unwise."
 
Nervously Watching U.S.
 But the British Government is clearly somewhat nervous about what its principal ally is going to do. Mrs. Thatcher was initially skeptical about the need for a United Nations resolution authorizing the use of force if Iraq did not pull out, but went along with it when the United States asked for Britain's backing. Under Mr. Major, Britain voted for the measure last week in the Security Council.
A Foreign Office minister, Douglas Hogg, told the House of Commons on Monday that the British Government had been notified of President Bush's decision to send Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to Baghdad to press for an Iraqi withdrawal before Mr. Bush announced the mission on Friday.
Mr. Major said today: "We fully support President Bush when he says that he is prepared to travel the extra mile to achieve such a solution. So are we. But there can be no question of negotiations, concessions, partial solutions or linkage to other issues."
His office said today that Mr. Major would be traveling to the gulf in the near future to visit British troops there.
 
Britons Support Policy
 British public opinion remains solidly behind Government policy on the gulf crisis. Its decisions have also been supported by the leaders of the two main parties in the opposition, Neil Kinnock of the Labor Party and Paddy Ashdown of the Liberal Democrats. Both men been kept closely informed by the Government.
"We've had a long history of involvement in the region, we're familiar with most of it, and people here are outraged at Iraq's treatment of the British hostages," a Government official said.
A Gallup poll of 977 adults conducted between Nov. 21 and 27 and published in The Daily Telegraph today showed that 57 percent would prefer a successful blockade over military action to force Iraqi troops to leave Kuwait. But it said that 63 percent would support military action against Iraq if the economic blockade failed.
The results were not significantly different from those of a similar poll in mid-September, when 61 percent said they would support the use of force against Iraq if sanctions failed, the Telegraph said.

HEADLINE: China Ready to Try (and Forget) Dissidents

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WUHAN, China

 BODY:
Perhaps what is most remarkable about Zhu Jianbin is not that he has spent the last nine years in prison for trying to promote democracy, but that he has been so totally forgotten in the labyrinth of the Chinese penal system.
Mr. Zhu is evidence that repression sometimes works, for the authorities have locked him up without attracting any significant criticism or tarnishing their image. 
 His very existence has been virtually obliterated, for most democracy advocates here and abroad have neverheard of him, and even in this city where he worked and dreamed of democracy, people shake their heads and say they have never heard his name.
The Chinese leaders appear ready to go ahead soon with criminal trials of some major figures in the 1989 democracy movement, and the Government may well believe -- based on the evidence of Mr. Zhu and countless others -- that the harm to its image will be slight and transitory.
Beijing may well believe that such a temporary setback is an acceptable price for making an example of some activists and frightening the rest intosubmission.
Hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of people remain in Chinese prisons and labor camps for their involvement in the 1989 democracy movement. Last week, the Government formally charged two editors of an economics journal, Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming, with counterrevolutionary crimes because of their participation in the movement. They and others are expected to face trial soon, and perhaps prison sentences of up to 15 years.
The result has been a flurry of foreign indignation -- just as there was a burst of outrage a decade ago when China imprisoned the leaders of the1978-79 Democracy Spring movement. But that outrage gradually dissipated, and only Wei Jingsheng is much remembered now, in China or abroad. Mr. Wei, an electrician and essayist, is now in the 12th year of his 15-year prison sentence. He is said to be in solitary confinement, with even the guards ordered not to speak with him.
Mr. Zhu's case never attracted much attention, partly because he lived and worked here in Wuhan, where there are no resident diplomats or foreign journalists. Mr. Zhu, who is now 35 years old, was a worker at a big steel mill in Wuhan and an editor of a journal about democracy, "The Bell Tolls."
"We've been sending letters, but we've never heard anything," said Barbara Krasnoff, a member of an Amnesty International group in New York that has "adopted" Mr. Zhu as apolitical prisoner. "We never found out if he has any family."
"It's very hard not to lose interest in a case," Ms. Krasnoff added in a telephone interview. "We're human and if you don't hear anything from somebody for so many years he becomes almost fictional. Every once in a while we have to take out his picture and remember that this is a real person."
The way in which Mr. Zhu has been forgotten, except to the Amnesty group, raises larger questions about the democracy movement in China. Nelson Mandela managed to inspire many South Africans while he was in prison, and in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union dissidents kept alive the memories of many who were in labor camps.
But Chinese intellectuals say that the tendency here has been to forget thosewho are locked away. Many of the students involved in the 1989 Tiananmen movement had never heard of the leaders of the Democracy Spring Movement a decade earlier -- names of men like Xu Wenli and Wang Xizhe, who are serving 15- and 14-year prison sentences, respectively.
Fang Lizhi, the Chinese dissident now living in England, wrote in an essay this year about "The Chinese Amnesia" -- the tendency for society to forget and ignore past repression -- as a factor inhibiting the emergence of greater democracy in China.
While Professor Fang argued that the Communist "Technique of Forgetting History" was losing its effect with regard to the 1989 crackdown, there is no sign of greater interest in those who remain in prison for their efforts a decade ago to promote democracy.

HEADLINE: Leverage on Pretoria: Mandela's Group Turns to a Mass Protest Campaign

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Dec. 4

 BODY:
As it maneuvers for advantage before negotiations proposed by President F. W. de Klerk on the nation's future, the African National Congress has replaced its former at least rhetorical commitment to armed struggle against white minority rule with a strategy of coordinated protest marches, strikes, consumer boycotts and work stayaways.
Though protests against apartheid are not new and Mr. de Klerk has tolerated peaceful dissent since taking office, mass action, as the Congress's current policy is called, has become a key point of contention, delaying talks between black and white leaders on a new national constitution. 
 From the perspective of the African National Congress, giving up mass action as a tactic would mean going into negotiations with far less political clout. For Mr. de Klerk, mass action complicates negotiations because his white electorate would see any concessions to the Congress as coerced.
 
A Victory for Hard-Liners?
 Some analysts like Ronnie Bethlehem, an economist who has studied revolutionary change, speculate that the Congress's call for mass action signals a victory for its hard-line strategists, who did not want to give up the guerrilla option, over its pragmatists, who view negotiations as the best route to a post-apartheid society.
"It is a victory which could assist strategists and racial ideologists against pragmatists on the Government's side also," Mr. Bethlehem wrote in the financial newspaper Business Day.
At a politically charged funeral here on Sunday for a man shot by the police at a unapproved march here on Nov. 17, Nelson Mandela declared that the African National Congress would not give up mass action.
"We will not trade off our mass struggle for negotiations," said Mr. Mandela, who is deputy president of the Congress. He called for more demonstrations, even if the authorities refused permission, as happened on Nov. 17.
 
The Remnants of Apartheid
 The civil disobedience campaign has sought out flaws in Mr. de Klerk's policies of change. As Mr. Mandela keeps pointing out, he and other blacks still cannot vote and many other structures set up to enforce apartheid remain in place.
The African National Congress suspended its armed struggle, adopted in 1961 after nearly half a century of non-violence, at the last full round of talks with the Government on Aug. 6. In military terms, the guerrilla warfare achieved little because of a ruthlessly efficient counter-insurgency and had grown quiescent months before its suspension.
The international isolation of South Africa began to unravel after Mr. de Klerk declared the African National Congress and other liberation movements legal, freed Mr. Mandela and began dismantling apartheid. Though he has far to go, Mr. de Klerk has been warmly received in Washington and other Western European and African capitals.
 
New Attitude in East Europe
 Eastern European countries that championed the African National Congress with money, weapons and political support have also shifted interest to Mr. de Klerk's Government. Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have established informal diplomatic links and last week a Soviet delegation visited Pretoria for talks. The Soviet Union, which awarded Mr. Mandela the Lenin Peace Prize while he was in prison, has yet to arrange for him to collect it.
Economic sanctions are also starting to slip, raising the prospect that by the time the Congress consents to their removal, they may be ineffective. Though the case for sanctions could be reviewed at the Congress consultative conference opening here on Dec. 14, Mr. Mandela told foreign correspondents on Nov. 15 that "we have no plans to call on countries and the world to review sanctions."
At home, the African National Congress has failed to translate widespread admiration for Mr. Mandela into equivalent grass roots support. Only one in 250 South Africans has joined the Congress, though many more endorse its aims. The Congress has admitted signing up 150,000 members out of a total population of 37.5 million inhabitants, only 5 million of whom are white.
There are reasons for the lackluster showing. The Congress's claim to lead was hurt by its inability to stop factional violence exploding around Johannesburg in August and September. And the poverty, illiteracy and backwardness afflicting many blacks is so severe that a recent survey of farm laborers in the rural Eastern Cape reported that only 60 percent had heard of the African National Congress and only 30 percent of Mr. Mandela.
 
Tactics of the 1950's
 Because it cannot afford to lose credibility before it feels ready to negotiate with the Government, the African National Congress has reverted to the kind of tactics it used before the adoption of armed struggle, like the campaigns of the 1950's to defy restrictive pass laws and other apartheid legislation.
Mr. Mandela has likened mass action to demonstrations by Americans against the war in Vietnam or by Western Europeans against the deployment of nuclear weapons.
"We have reached the position where we are precisely because of mass action," Mr. Mandela told journalists on Nov. 10.
Last month, Mr. de Klerk accused the African National Congress of "a clearly defined strategy of intimidation and undermining of local authorities, regional and self-governing states." He called it a form of violence that the African National Congress pledged to stop when it suspended the armed struggle on Aug. 6 and urged that it express dissatisfaction through the channels created in their ongoing contacts.
 
'Peaceful Search for Solutions'
 "I expect from them an unqualified stand against everything that is not conducive to the peaceful search for solutions," Mr. de Klerk said. At a private meeting last Tuesday, President de Klerk and Mr. Mandela failed to resolve their differences over mass action.
The mass action campaign has set complex goals, like the nonracial election of a constituent assembly and interim government during negotiations and the collapse of black township councils created by Pretoria, both of which the Government opposes.
The New Nation, a weekly newspaper that reflects the views of the African National Congress, insisted recently that mass action was essential to maintain pressure on the Government.
"It is asking too much that, having abandoned the armed struggle to help facilitate the process of negotiations, the A.N.C. must now be expected to give up its sole legal and legitimate means of organizing?" The New Nation said.
 
Congress's Motives Assailed
 The Citizen, a daily tabloid that supports the Government, accused tbe African National Congress in an editorial this week of being motivated by self-interest.
"Mass protests, marches, stayaways and boycotts, which President F. W. de Klerk says can lead to violence and are therefore unacceptable, are not simple expressions of mass feeling; they are organized to disrupt life as well as to demonstrate the A.N.C.'s strength so that blacks are convinced of the A.N.C.'s invincibility," The Citizen said.
Because mass action needs community mobilization, participation tends to be enforced by unemployed youths who have intimidated those who want to go to work or shop. When rival black political groupings oppose such tactics, factional violence can result.
"There can be no denying that there have been instances of A.N.C. supporters displaying intolerant behavior and at times even employing strong-arm methods to bully political rivals into silence," Mr. Mandela said Friday in Cape Town.
"We want to take this opportunity to denounce in the strongest terms any such tactics as completely contrary to A.N.C. policy."
He promised that those guilty of intimidation would be punished.

HEADLINE: Day by Day Economics As Seen in Reading, Pa.

SERIES: Downturn of a City: First visit of a periodic series.

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: READING, Pa., Dec. 2

 BODY:
Here in this row-house industrial city 50 miles northwest of Philadelphia, evidence of economic malaise abounds, from the closing of Georgia-Pacific's fine-paper plant to a subtle shift in demand toward the cheaper brands of the Bachman Company's snack foods.
Throughout the nation, from automobile factories to dairy farms, businesses and workers are hearing talk of recession and fearing its consequences on their lives. No one place is a perfect microcosm of the United States. But the Reading area reflects both the weaknesses and the partly offsetting strengths of the economically floundering mid-Atlantic region. While its large manufacturing base tends to reflect contraction quickly, Reading's economy as a whole is diverse, and occasional visits here may provide a look at how one city deals with difficult economic times.
 
Drop in an Important Gauge
 Some analysts think recession has already put its clammy grip on Reading and the rest of Berks County. One important gauge is a drop in the amount of electricity used by industry. This proxy for industrial output has trailed 1989 levels in three of the last four months. And the unemployment rate, though below the national average, has climbed one and a half percentage points since September 1989. 
 The immediate concern is not whether proud Reading, its namesake railroad a Monopoly board fixture, will reverse the decades-long eclipse it shares with many former industrial powerhouses. The question is how this area, the early home to Daniel Boone, Abraham Lincoln's ancestors and John Updike, will weather an incipient, possibly severe, cyclical downturn in the American economy at large.
Scores of interviews here recently found a general sense of apprehension combined with a belief -- in many cases probably only a hope -- that a likely slide will be neither deep nor lengthy. At the same time, many companies here continue to grow, even thrive. These seem to underscore the country's economic resiliency and the intricate ways people and businesses adapt to circumstances.
Yet the fundamental message these days is clearly downbeat. Most manufacturers cite flat to shrinking orders. Shoppers at the city's renowned outlet malls talk about buying less. Workers throughout the county ponder closings, announced or actual, of Sonoco Fibre Drum's plant here in town, the Caloric Corporation's appliance plant in nearby Topton and Adidas's shoe plant in Kutztown, which failed despite the efforts of Dae Yang Inc., a Korean company.
"I personally think we're in a recession now," said Ezekiel S. Ketchum, the president of Meridian Bancorp Inc., which is based in Reading and commands 36 percent of the Berks County banking market, giving it an exceptional vantage point on the local economy.
Meridian, an $11.8 billion regional institution, is suffering from serious deterioration in its loan portfolio. The bank announced in September that it was making a special $75 million addition to bad-debt reserves, part of a plan that also includes selling its credit-card, indirect auto-loan and title-insurance businesses.
 
Long-Gone Glory
 Its glory days are long gone. The Reading Railroad, once, briefly, the biggest anywhere, went bankrupt and was folded into Conrail. Yet in the city, long a world-class producer of such disparate goods as textiles and cigar boxes, manufacturing still plays a substantial role. More than 32 percent of the county's non-farm jobs are in factories, well above rates of 22 percent statewide and 19 percent nationally.
Such businesses, with high fixed costs and stocks of materials and the purchase of their products generally deferrable, are particularly susceptible to downturns. They also face intense world competition that in many industrial spheres has induced excess capacity.
Mainly reflecting the loss of factory jobs, Reading's unemployment rate climbed to 4.7 percent in September, the latest month for which data are available. This is a percentage point below the current national rate but, consistent with the national trend, Reading is now suffering from a paucity in new service jobs as well.
Automobiles and trucks is one area of overcapacity. The current slump in sales, though not as bad as had been feared after oil prices soared when Iraq invaded Kuwait, is putting pressure on at least two Reading businesses -- the Dana Corporation's Parish frame division and the Carpenter Technology Corporation, formerly Carpenter Steel.
"It looks to me like the recession has hit the county," said Richard Harman, Dana's division controller, He declined to talk specifically about Dana other than to note that the company, based in Toledo, Ohio, laid off 60 of its 2,400 Reading workers in October and to hint that rumors around town of large additional layoffs may prove well founded.
 
Demand for Replacement Parts
 Carpenter produces specialty steels, and its 2,700 employees make up the county's third-biggest work force after an A.T.&T. semiconductor plant and the Reading Hospital. Its chairman, Paul R. Roedel, said orders by automotive and military customers were slipping but were being made up elsewhere. He said orders were relatively strong for products used in power generation, chemical processing and oil-drilling equipment, with a special Cartech drill collar in particular demand.
But analysts here also note that a weak market for new cars implies better demand for the area's substantial production of replacement parts, like Exide batteries.
In fact, throughout the county one hears about strengths offsetting weaknesses, particularly in the recession-resistant candy and snack-food industry where Luden's Inc. (5th Avenue bars as well as cough drops) and Bachman (best known for pretzels) have many smaller competitors.
Bachman's chief, Joseph F. Welch, said unit sales continue to run about 5 percent ahead of 1989 levels despite a decision to cut the company's promotion budget. But he has noticed that the company's premium brands of popcorn and tortilla chips have faded as consumers here and elsewhere seek to economize.
Such trading down is clearly evident in the city's half-dozen outlet malls where legions of bargain-seekers, many on bus excursions from out of state, spend close to $1 billion a year.
 
The Draw of the Malls
 "They're buying the basics; they're buying quality," said Jay R. Titsworth, president of VF Factory Outlet, noting that the malls this year are attracting an increasing number of local residents. Area shoppers had spurned these malls, partly in reaction to congestion brought by the tourist hordes.
While some financially pinched shoppers no doubt have raised their outlet spending this year, the outlets over all are not benefiting from a rise in bargain hunters in hard times. Some recent weekends have produced declines. "In other years it's always been increases," said Mr. Titsworth. Bus arrivals to the city are reported down by 10 percent since August.
Soft sales probably prompted the VF apparel outlet to join the other stores in accepting credit cards. Until this year, VF, the area's biggest outlet, had declined to accept the cards, in the mistaken belief that they took more transaction time at the checkout counter than checks.
Yet for each negative in the Reading-area economy -- subdued consumers, cutback-minded executives and a real estate slump symbolized by the for-sale sign that has long hung on the Abraham Lincoln Hotel, site of John Philip Sousa's death -- there seems to be a counterweight.
The fruit-juice plant in Fleetwood, the town that gave its name to a line of Cadillacs, closed in February. But it is now being prepared by its new California owners, Sunsweet Growers, Inc., for reopening. Instead of Red Cheek apple juice, its traditional mainstay, the plant will produce Sunsweet prune juice.
 
No One Really Knows
 As for real estate, Aetna insurance has recently completed two new buildings, one in the suburbs and one downtown. Other major projects in the area include a Sam's discount store, a major addition to the county courthouse, a huge Ames Department Stores distribution center and, just over the county line, a new Pepperidge Farm bakery.
There are also companies like Arrow International Inc., a one-time moribund knitting-needle unit bought by local interests in 1975 and turned into world-class producer of catheters and other precision medical equipment now employing 1,200 people. Aided by a weak dollar, Arrow's export business is booming, and Marlin Miller Jr., Arrow's president, is constantly fending off potential acquisitors and underwriters.
The counterweights, which include measures taken by individual companies to produce more competitively and market more imaginatively, lead some to doubt that the Reading area -- or the national economy for that matter -- is in for sharp or prolonged economic contraction.
"Manufacturing there is going to get hit," said Richard M. Stein, an economist for Corestates Financial Corporation, a Philadelphia-based institution. "But I think they'll be able to skirt recession."
But no one really knows, and the usual uncertainty has been compounded by military confrontation in the Persian Gulf.
A restaurateur, Dan Gallagher, seemed to capture the city's mood when asked to explain why two dozen applicants sought an assistant chef job at his struggling Penn Street establishment in October, four times as many as when the job was advertised earlier in the year.
"It's the premonition of what's to come," he said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Fed Move and Iraq Report Cause Sharp Drop in Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against other major currencies yesterday, hit hard by the Federal Reserve's decision to relax its reserve requirements for banks and by a news report that Iraq may be willing to withdraw from Kuwait.
Gold prices were mixed, falling overseas and then rising in New York. 
 The dollar first slumped after the Fed announced its bank reserves decision, an unusual move aimed at stimulating the deteriorating economy by easing a shortage of credit.
The central bank said its action, the first change in reserve requirements since 1983, was taken in part for technical reasons but also to encourage banks to increase lending.
Ideally, if banks have more money to lend, interest rates would fall, although some private economists questioned whether that would in fact be the result of the Fed move. But the foreign exchange markets, taking no chances, sold the dollar.
The dollar draws support from higher interest rates, which make United States investments more attractive. When rates fall, the dollar tends to follow suit.
The dollar fell further shortly before the close of trading, after a British news report said Iraq might be ready to withdraw from most of Kuwait as long as it was allowed to keep the disputed Rumailah oilfield.
The report raised the prospects for a peaceful end to the Middle East crisis. The dollar, seen as a relatively safe investment in times of international strife, has advanced as tensions increased in recent months and dropped as they were defused.
The British pound rose against the dollar yesterday. In New York, sterling closed at $1.92925, up from $1.9180 late Monday. In London earlier, the pound rose to $1.9255, from $1.9205 late Monday.
The dollar fell to 133.30 Japanese yen in New York, from 134.74 late Monday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose 1.35 yen to a closing 134.35 yen, and it was later quoted in London at 134.00 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late quotes, included: 1.5030 German marks, down from 1.51395; 1.2825 Swiss francs, down from 1.2935; 5.0825 French francs, down from 5.1135; 1,129.25 Italian lire, down from 1,138.00, and 1.16325 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16625.
Gold advanced in New York, climbing $2.30 on the Commodity Exchange to close at $378.90 a troy ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $376.25, up 75 cents.
Silver prices advanced. The metal rose 1.3 cents on the Commodity Exchange, closing at $4.151 a troy ounce. Earlier, silver rose in London to a late bid price of $4.18 a troy ounce from Monday's $4.16.

HEADLINE: WORLD BANK LENDS CHINA $114 MILLION

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
The World Bank today approved the first loan to China since the student uprising last year that goes beyond the confines of meeting basic human needs.
The approval of the $114.3 million loan marked the first time in more than a year that the Bush Administration did not object to other than humanitarian assistance to China. 
 The World Bank's approval of the loan for technological improvements in rural industry had been expected for weeks, but it was uncertain whether the United States would vote against it. Such a move would have been largely symbolic, because both the European Community and Japan have resumed normal economic relations with China and both supported the loan.
 
Bush Met With Beijing Aide
 The decision comes less than a week after President Bush met last Friday for the first time since the crackdown with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen. The meeting occurred a day after China abstained, rather than opposed, a vote by the United Nations Security Council authorizing the use of force to expel Iraq from Kuwait.
While the World Bank is owned by 155 member Governments, an American has headed it since it was founded in 1945 and the United States has a 20 percent vote on all major issues. The bank makes loans and helps countries in other ways to strengthen broad economic sectors by building such projects as dams, fertilizer plants, irrigation works, ports and highways.
Before the military crackdown on the democracy movement in June 1989, China had been receiving World Bank loans of more than $2 billion annually. Largely at the insistence of the United States all loans were initially blocked to China as part of a sanctions package.
 
Hostility on Capitol Hill
 Since then, World Bank loans to China had shrunk to $650 million, primarily in the form of rural credits and assistance to small cooperative business enterprises in towns and villages.
The American position against non-humanitarian aid reflected opposition from Capitol Hill, where many lawmakers had been hostile to Beijing. But that opposition has been steadily softening since Iraq took over Kuwait in August and the Bush Administration began reaching out to a wide range of allies and other nations for support in challenging the invasion.
The package approved today consists of a $50 million loan and $64.3 million in credit.
Attila Karaosmaonoglu, the World Bank's vice president for Asian Affairs, said that other loans by the bank toChina were being prepared.

Mubarak Urges Alliance With Syrians and Saudis

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Dec. 4

 BODY:
President Hosni Mubarak today urged the creation of a new Arab alliance grouping Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia as "a foundation to serve the Arab people," as Arab nations drew diplomatic lines in response to Washington's latest initiative on the Persian Gulf crisis.
The United States has proposed talks with Iraq to urge it to pull out of Kuwait by Jan. 15 or face war with the United States and its allies gathered in Saudi Arabia. 
 King Hussein of Jordan and Vice President Ali Salem al-Beedh of Yemen, whose countries have both shown sympathy toward Iraq, flew to Baghdad today to meet President Saddam Hussein. At the same time, President Mubarak, the leading Arab supporter of United States regional diplomacy and one of Iraq's most powerful Arab adversaries, was host at a meeting here of the Foreign Ministers of his own country, Syria and Saudi Arabia.
Cooperation between the three, he said, should "transcend any specific situation to become part of a long-term policy to build a foundation to serve the Arab people."
 
No Immediate Response
 The suggestion, which drew no immediate public response from Damascus or Riyadh, reflected widespread Arab concerns that, however the gulf crisis is resolved, it will leave the Arab world questing for a new order to maintain collective security.
Egyptian officials said Cairo also urged "raising the level of military coordination and cooperation in the field of defense" between the three countries.
Egypt and Syria have both either sent or pledged to send thousands of troops backed by tanks to support the American-dominated military buildup in Saudi Arabia, thereby offering an Arab presence to soften the political impact of foreign troops being stationed in an Arab country that houses the holiest shrines of Islam.
"We believe that our positions are united with regard to this crisis," said Syria's Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, after a meeting with President Mubarak. "Dangerous developments" in the region could not be halted, he said, "unless Arab and international resolutions are implemented" obliging Iraq to leave Kuwait unconditionally and restore the country to its rulers.
 
Suggestion Reflects Breech
 Mr. Mubarak's suggestion of a three-way alliance reflected Cairo's breach with its previous partners in the defunct Arab Cooperation Council -- Iraq, Jordan and Yemen -- with whom it had formed a regional grouping supposed to promote stability and economic cooperation.
The grouping worried both Syria and Saudi Arabia because it was seen as a cloak for Iraqi designs on regional hegemony.
After the invasion on Aug. 2, Egypt led Arab condemnation of Iraq, while Jordan and Yemen both maintained contact with Baghdad and opposed the United States military buildup in Saudi Arabia, arguing that the Arab world should find its own solution to the crisis.
Saudi Arabia is already the dominant member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a six-nation grouping formed initially by the gulf oil nations, including Kuwait, to oppose Iran in its eight-year war with Iraq.
 
Assumptions Stripped Away
 The Egyptian suggestion for a new alliance, an Arab diplomat said, showed concerns that the Iraqi invasion had stripped away many of the assumptions on which the Arab world previously did business. "The aftermath of the invasion of Kuwait could be as destabilizing, or more so, than the invasion itself," the diplomat said.
In coming weeks, the Syrian Foreign Minister said, "the decisions that will be taken will be fateful for our three countries and the Arab world."
Since the crisis, he and his Egyptian counterparts have met with unusual regularity in the diplomatic turmoil caused by the Iraqi invasion. All three have said publicly that they support President Bush's invitation to Iraq to open discussions. But other Syrian and Arab officials have registered concern that the contacts between the United States and Iraq be restricted to the issue of forcing Iraq out of Kuwait, and should not lead to a negotiation or concessions.
The information ministers of Egypt, Saudi Arabi and Syria have also been meeting here for the past two days seeking ways to prevent Iraqi propaganda from igniting popular support for President Hussein in their own countries.
 
Maneuver to Avert War
 In today's diplomatic flurry, the trip to Baghdad by King Hussein and Vice President al-Beedh of Yemen suggested that the Jordanian King might once again be seeking some opening for maneuver to avert war, Western diplomats here said. While supporting most of the international economic sanctions against Iraq, Jordan has kept open the lines to its powerful eastern neighbor and has said its policy is to promote a peaceful resolution of the crisis.
The Western diplomats noted that King Hussein's visit coincided with news reports that he has decided to send his Ambassador back to Riyadh. The diplomat, Nasser al-Batainah, was recalled in September as relations between Jordan and Saudi Arabia soured after the invasion of Kuwait.

HEADLINE: Late-Month Vehicle Sales Off 20.5%

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Sales of cars and light trucks tumbled 20.5 percent in late November, deflating hopes that moderately strong demand earlier in the month would continue despite a weakening economy.
Seasonally adjusted, cars sold at an annual rate of 5.3 million late last month, the lowest rate for a 10-day period since early October 1982, when the economy was struggling out of a recession. 
 Analysts said today that the poor sales rate reflected flagging consumer demand more accurately than the data of the last few months, when deliveries to corporate and rental fleets made vehicle sales look abnormally high. Manufacturers do not differentiate in their sales reports between retail and fleet sales.
 
Prolonged Slump Seen
 "This is probably the pure underlying market that represents the private demand," said Maryann N. Keller, an analyst with Furman, Selz, Mager, Dietz & Birney Inc. in New York. Ms. Keller and other analysts said the late-November results could mark the beginning of a prolonged slump for the industry, lasting well into the spring.
Mark Brobeck, the general manager of Ricart Ford in Columbus, Ohio, said salesroom traffic was down 30 percent last month. "A lot of people seemed to be putting off the purchase decision," he said. "They talk about the economy in general; they don't know what will happen, and they don't want to get into a four- or five-year loan. It seems more people are buying on need than on impulse."
One bright spot, Mr. Brobeck said, was the strong demand for smaller, fuel-efficient cars, including the Ford Motor Company's Escort subcompact, which posted an overall gain of 18.6 percent in November, compared with last November's sales. Used cars sales have been steady, he said.
"I'm worried," said Jim Hoffer, the manager of Jordan Motors, a Ford dealership near Indianapolis. "Everybody is scared to death we are going to war, and they aren't in any mood to spend their money on cars or trucks." Car The 10 domestic makers said today that they sold 153,314 cars in the Nov. 21-30 period, a decline of 15.2 percent from the same period last year, when demand was also weak.
The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 5.3 million cars in the period lagged behind the sluggish rate of 6 million in late November of last year, and well behind the pace of 6.3 million for the entire month.
The sales rate for the last 60 days totaled 6.6 million; so far this year, cars have sold at an annual rate of 6.9 million.
The sales of pickup trucks, mini-vans and four-wheel-drive vehicles fell 28.8 percent in late November, to 82,453, continuing a three-month slide that analysts have tied to the lower fuel-efficiency of light trucks.
For all of November, car sales fell only 1.5 percent, to 668,008, reflecting fleet deliveries that propped up sales during the first half of the month. Sales of imported cars fell 10.3 percent in November, while those of Japanese cars produced in American factories -- transplants -- rose 19 percent. The Big Three's combined car sales were off six-tenths of a percent. The sales of light trucks declined 7 percent in the month.
The Big Three auto makers posted sales declines in late November, which had been foreshadowed by sweeping plant shutdowns announced by the General Motors Corporation, Ford and the Chrysler Corporation in recent weeks. The shutdowns will idle more than a third of the Big Three's 72 assembly plants in the United States and Canada, causing widespread layoffs among hourly workers.
If the car companies adhere to the latest production schedules, they will manufacture 2.3 million vehicles in the United States in the fourth quarter, 17 percent below their plans at the beginning of the period. Based on the slump in sales and the sharp production cuts now occurring as a result, several analysts predict that the Big Three will lose money in the fourth quarter.
General Motors said it sold 64,792 cars in late November, a decline of 17.3 percent The company's Saturn division, reporting its first sales results, said it sold 641 cars in November. A Saturn spokesman said most new cars were going to dealerships in the Southwest, the West Coast, and Florida -- "heavy import areas we wanted to hit first," he said.
 
Ford's Car Sales Off 3.3%
 Ford's November car sales fell 3.3 percent, to 128,346. Those of its light trucks were down 5.4 percent.
Chrysler sold 61,667 domestically produced cars last month, down 3 percent. Those of the company's light trucks, including mini-vans and Jeeps, plunged 18.9 percent, to 58,536.
Chrysler plans to stop reporting its sales results every 10 days and report figures only for the end of the month beginning in January, because of what it regards as adverse publicity arising from unfavorable comparisons with Japanese auto makers, who report their overall sales at the end of each month.

House Democrats Caution Bush on War

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
House Democrats adopted a nonbinding policy statement late today declaring that President Bush should not initiate any offensive military action in the Persian Gulf without the formal approval of Congress unless American lives were in immediate danger.
The resolution, adopted on a 177-37 vote after two hours of closed-door debate by the House Democratic Caucus, reflected the views that Democratic leaders in both the House and Senate have repeatedly expressed since Mr. Bush ordered more American troops to the Gulf last month. But it is the most explicit and formal statement to date of the Democratic position. 
 It also comes as concerns increase among lawmakers and outside experts about the Bush Administration's apparent impatience with reliance on economic sanctions to force the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Before approving the resolution, House Democrats agreed to accept modifying language that would also put them on record in support of the President's actions to defend Saudi Arabia and his efforts to use diplomatic initiatives and the economic sanctions to resolve the crisis.
 
Court Clash on War Powers
 The action today came as 54 Democratic members of Congress and the Bush Administration clashed in Federal Court over whether the President can wage war against Iraq without first getting explicit authority from Congress.
The confrontation, which involves questions of constitutional law dating back to the founding of the nation, came as the result f a suit brought by the lawmakers asking a judge to block Mr. Bush from going to war unless Congress first votes its approval.
Noting that no court had ever issued such an injunction, Judge Harold H. Greene said he would study the case and rule sometime in the future.
"The question before this court is straightforward," said Jules Lobel, a University of Pittsburgh law professor who argued the case for the lawmakers. "Can the President initiate a war against Iraq for the purpose of getting it out of Kuwait without the consent of Congress? The President says he can but the Constitution says he can't."
At issue is Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, which vests Congress with the sole authority to declare war. The question of how much of a role Congress should play in the use of combat troops abroad has vexed policymakers since the founding of the nation.
 
The Government's Stand
 Stuart M. Gerson, the assistant attorney general who argued the case for the Government, said Presidents have often sent troops into combat without a Congressional declaration of war.
Judge Greene interrupted Mr. Gerson's argument to ask when the declaration of war clause could be used.
"So when does it apply?" Judge Greene asked.
Mr. Gerson said, in effect, that the declaration of war power was optional, that it allowed Congress to take the initiative to start a war if it chose to do so, but did not limit a President from sending troops into combat.
Mr. Gerson also argued that the Constitution did not say when Congress had to declare war. "It doesn't have to be in advance of hostilities," he said, "it could be after."
Mr. Lobel, who was accompanied by four members of Congress at the counsel table, argued that it was useless for Congress to have the ability to declare war once a President has already sent troops into combat. Everyone knows, he said, that Congress has no choice but to support troops once they are engaged in combat.
The power to declare war, he said, "is before it begins, not while it's going on."
 
No 'Indefinite Threat'
 The buildup in the Gulf, he argued, provided Judge Greene with the clearest case in history for requiring the President to seek explicit approval from Congress. Noting the troop deployment and statements from Administration officials that they were running out of patience with the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, he said: "We're talking about the threat of war in six weeks. We're not talking about some indefinite threat."
In October, before Congress adjourned for the year, both the House and Senate overwhelmingly approved resolutions supporting President Bush's initial deployment of American troops to the Gulf.
But the resolutions were deliberately ambiguous about continued support if the President took military action without exlicit approval from Congress. The Senate measure for example, included language approved by the White House that tied future decisions to "United States constitutional and statutory processes," a statement vague enough to be open to different interpretations by the Administration and lawmakers.
 
Cheney Stirs the Pot
 The original House measure sidestepped the question of how or when force should be used. At the time those measures were passed, and in the weeks since, a number of liberal Democrats argued that Congress was too vague and had left the door open for the President to make a military move.
The action by the House Democrats today appears to have been prompted in part by statements on Monday by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney that the President has the authority to order an attack on Iraq without Congressional approval. Although lawmakers have generally given President Bush high marks for his willingness to consult with Congress on the Gulf crisis, they have failed to win either a public or private commitment from him that he would seek a formal declaration of war prior to committing American troops to military action.
The touchy issue was also raised today as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee opened a series of hearings on Gulf policy. When Democratic senators asked former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara whether he shared Mr. Cheney's view that Mr. Bush did not need approval from Congress, Mr. McNamara pointed to the bitter lessons of Vietnam.
"I do not believe the President should, and I do not believe he will initiate action without the approval of the American people expressed by the approval of Congress," he said.
Mr. McNamara, who was President Lyndon B. Johnson's Defense Secretary during the height of the Vietnam War, told the committee that the Bush Administration should continue to rely on economic sanctions for perhaps as long as 18 months as the means to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait. Democratic senators on the panel shared that assessment.
 
'Toughness in Patience'
 "Sometimes there is more toughness in patience than in lashing out," said Senator Paul Simon, an Illinois Democrat. "This is such a time." Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat, said, "We have time, I don't see any hurry." .
But Senator Rudy Boschwitz, a Minnesota Republican who lost his re-election bid and will not be returning to Washington when the new Congress convenes on Jan. 3, said he shared Mr. Cheney's conclusion that giving the sanctions more time to work also amounted to a decrease in pressure on Iraq that would allow President Hussein to marshall his resources and build military strength.

Japanese Bullish On U.S. Stocks

BYLINE: By Kurt Eichenwald

 BODY:
AS gloom is spreading among American investors about the state of the domestic economy and equity markets, one big group of investors is being told to buy American: the Japanese.
In a report being discussed with its large institutional clients today, Nomura Securities International, the world's largest securities firm, is saying that it views American companies as a better investment for the next five years than Japanese companies. 
 That viewpoint is based on several factors, including Nomura's conclusion that a number of Japanese industries have reached the peak of their rapid growth and should grow only at a stable pace over the next five years.
In the extensive report Nomura says the American marketplace is significantly undervalued, in part because of the troubles in the Middle East. And, contrary to popular conceptions, the Japanese securities firm says American corporate expenditures on research and development, as a percentage of sales, have kept even with or ahead of their Japanese counterparts' expenditures. The report, which was written in Japanese, was discussed by executives of the firm.
The report comes at a critical tie for the domestic securities industry. As the Tokyo stock market has fallen in 1990, the net investment by Japanese investors in United States securities has been falling, cutting back an important source of capital and liquidity for the marketplace. Through September, Japanese investors were net sellers of $144 million of American securities.
Executives with Nomura Research InstituteAmerica, the division that put the report together, said the recommendations were among the strongest they have ever made to Japanese institutional investors to purchase American securities.
One reason the Japanese have been pulling back on their investments, is concern about the disparate rate of growth in the real gross national product -- 2.5 percent in the United States through the 1980's and 4.1 percent in Japan, executives with Nomura said.
"We hope the Japanese clients will understand the actual truth about the United States," said Koichiro Aoyama, the chairman and chief executive of the research institute. "Corporate profit growth has nothing to do with G.N.P. growth."
Makoto Hiranuma, the senior analyst who worked on the report, added: "Usually, Japanese clients see only the inflation rate and the real G.N.P. rate, and forget to look at the companies themselves. There is an excellent opportunity for long-term investment in United States stocks."
According to the Nomura report, 13 corporate sectors stand to have earnings growth over the next five years of 13 percent in the United States, compared with an estimated earnings growth of 6.4 percent in Japan.
That difference assumes a 3 percent annual depreciation for currency fluctuations, which the firm foresees largely because of the differing inflation rates in the United States and Japan.
The largest percentage difference in earnings isexpected in the airline industry, where Nomura sees earnings growth of 47.8 percent in the next five years in the United States and only 5.4 percent in Japan. The only industry sector where the firm sees less earnings growth in the United States than in Japan is the utilities industry -- 1.9 percent in the next five years in America compared with 11.7 percent in Japan.
The overall conclusion, Mr. Hiranuma said, is simple. "The typical company in the United States should grow faster than their Japanese counterparts during the 1990's."
Among the companies that Nomura expects to experience strong growth over the coming years are Compaq Computer, Toys "R" Us, Wal-Mart and Procter & Gamble.
The report also concludes that much of the American market is extremely undervalued. In an analysis of the Standard & Poor's 400 industrial company stocks, Nomura concluded that as of Nov. 30 they were undervalued by a total of 29 percent. Much of that undervaluing, Mr. Hiranuma said, is the result of Middle East concerns. "After the Mideast crisis ends, there is nothing to stop the market from reaching its value," he said.
The report, which will also be shown to Japanese corporate clients, also has some strong suggestions for the future of management strategies in Japan. For example, the report says that strategic alliances with foreign companies will be very important for Japan during the 1990's to maintain competitiveness.
In addition, the report cautions that Japanese international companies must adopt local management cultures, so that American divisions are managed by Americans and European divisions by Europeans. In addition, they must establish local research and development divisions that would share information.
"Think global, manage local is a good phrase, I think," Mr. Hiranuma said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Center to Help Parents Choose Children's Schools

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos said today that his department would establish a research center to help give parents the power to determine what schools their children attend.
Although the Bush Administration has spoken approvingly of the movement toward parental choice in education, often called simply "choice," the new Center for Choice in Education is its first concrete action in support of the idea. 
 The center, which will soon be opened in the department's offices and run by department employees, will provide a toll-free telephone number, (800) 442-PICK, to answer questions about school choice; create a bank of experts who can provide help and information to educators and parents, and offer workshops and seminars for administrators, school trustees, teachers, legislators and parents.
 
Empowering the Poor
 Parental choice is based on the idea that if people can choose freely among schools, the competition will force schools to shape up or shut down. Proponents of the policy, which has been adopted in a half a dozen states in various forms, say it leads to better schools. Opponents reply that free-market principles will not eliminate underfinanced, inferior schools, and that those schools will simply become repositories for children who are poor or disabled, or whose parents may not be able to make informed choices.
Mr. Cavazos said the new center fitted into the philosophy of empowering people, particularly the poor, through programs based on market forces, individualism and decentralization. The idea is favored by many in the Administration, notably Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp. "The American economy and our democracy are products of empowerment," Mr. Cavazos said, "and this approach can revitalize our schools as well."
One widely publicized choice program, intended to serve low-income families in inner-city Milwaukee, goes a step further than others because it provides state financing for children to attend private schools. It has been operating since September, though on Nov. 14 a Wisconsin appeals court struck down the law authorizing it. The Legislature is revising the law to satisfy the judges.
Mr. Cavazos said the Administration took no position on using public funds to finance private schools, and added that budget constraints would make it impossible for the Federal Government to provide vouchers or direct support for such programs. But he said President Bush supported the Milwaukee choice program.
Supporters and critics were quick to respond to the department's action today.
Bella Rosenberg of the American Federation of Teachers said choice alone would not fix America's schools. "The notion that choice automatically, like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat, is going to lead to quality schools, is a joke, " she said. "I don't know whether to call it pathetic or an example of an Administration in Fantasyland as the Christmas season approaches."
Burton Yale Pines, a senior vice president at the Heritage Foundation, a nonprofit conservative research organization, praised the department for embracing the "fundamental populism of the Reagan world view," though he added that the Bush Administration had been pushed "kicking and screaming" into embracing empowerment.
Other researchers criticized the creation of the new center, in part because the Federal Government withdrew its financing for two established research centers -- one devoted to elementary and middle schools, at Johns Hopkins University, the other to secondary schools, at the University of of Wisconsin.

HEADLINE: FEDERAL RESERVE ACTS TO INCREASE LENDING BY BANKS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
In an unusual step to improve bank profits and stimulate the economy, the Federal Reserve announced today that banks would no longer have to keep a portion of certain types of deposits in reserve in cash or interest-free accounts.
With the American economy weakening, the move seemed to be a response by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, to mounting pressure from the White House to do something to turn the flagging economy around. If banks increase their lending, businesses and consumers will have more money to invest and spend to generate economic growth. 
 Mr. Greenspan has also been pressed by bankers to take some step to make lending easier. Many bankers have complained that Federal regulators have overreacted to the loan problems of some banks by twisting the screws so tight that banks in general could not conduct business normally.
 
'Contractionary Influence'
 The Federal Reserve said in its announcement that the action on reserve requirements was taken because tightened lending standards by banks had become "a contractionary influence on the economy."
The Federal Reserve has been increasingly concerned in recent months about the tightening of bank credit, a development Mr. Greenspan called a "credit crunch" in Congressional testimony last week. The chairman said this was a contributing factor to the shrinking of the economy since October, although he added that it was a less important element than higher oil prices and the general uneasiness over the possibility of a Persian Gulf war.
In the financial markets, the value of the dollar declined somewhat and bond prices rallied. The market reaction was based on the reasoning that if it becomes easier for banks to lend money, interest rates should fall.
 
Commercial Rates Cited
 A Federal Reserve Board official said another reason for the move was to help correct an anomalous situation this year that has made bank certificates of deposit unattractive to institutional investors at the end of the year, a circumstance that the board believes has led commercial interest rates to be higher than warranted.
The change, effective later this month, will increase bank profits by about $1 billion a year, the bulk of it going to a relatively few large banks.
 This is the first time the reserve rules have been changed since 1983. The rules require banks, savings and loan institutions and other depository institutions to hold a portion of their deposits in cash or in interest-free balances at regional Federal Reserve Banks.
The central bank said it was eliminating the 3 percent reserve requirement on certificates of deposit held by corporations with maturities of less than 18 months and on the small amount of Eurocurrency liabilities, which are dollar-denominated certificates of deposit purchased abroad. The requirement will be reduced to 1.5 percent on Dec. 17 and eliminated altogether on Dec. 27.
Personal deposits like checking accounts and certificates held by individuals make up the bulk of bank deposits, and the reserve requirement on these, 12 percent in most instances, will remain unaltered.
 
 Funds Rate Reduced
 Typically, when the Federal Reserve wants banks to increase lending, it reduces the Federal funds rate, the rate banks charge for overnight loans, or the discount rate, the rate the Federal Reserve charges for direct loans to banks. In normal times, banks react to those changes by charging their customers lower rates. That in turn leads the customers to borrow more readily and spend more, giving the economy a boost.
But the Federal funds rate has been lowered by three-quarters of a percentage point in three steps since July. Still, the prime rate, the benchmark for many bank loans, has not fallen, and banks have cut back on their lending. Mr. Greenspan is clearly hoping that an increase in bank profits will prove to be a stronger inducement for a reduction in commercial rates.
Bankers and economists generally welcomed the move today but said they were skeptical it would have much effect on bank lending or on the economy in general. They observed that the additional funds that would be available to banks for lending would be more than offset by the higher deposit insurance premiums banks must begin paying on Jan. 1.
"This may have a minimal short-run economic effect," said Jerry L. Jordan, senior vice president of First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. "But no one," he added, "would say that this will lead to a lot more bank lending or solve banks' problems."
To the extent banks are reluctant to lend, it is almost entirely because of the deteriorating economy, he said.
James E. Annable, chief economist of the First National Bank of Chicago, agreed with that analysis. "Yeah, it makes some difference," he said of the change. "But it's not that much. It puts a small Band-Aid on a large problem."
Reserve requirements were established in Revolutionary times when the Government first began chartering banks and have been in force in one form or another ever since. The purpose was to make banks keep a cushion as protection against a run or other short-term liquidity problem.
But almost all economists today believe they are an anachronism that has been kept on the books largely for political reasons. Bert Ely, a banking consultant in Virginia, expressed the prevailing view. He observed that the establishment of the Federal Reserve early in this century as the lender of last resort lessened the need for such a safety valve, and said the capacity of banks in recent years to borrow from other banks and raise money in various other segments of the financial markets made the required reserves unnecessary.
 
Tighter Credit Standards
 The announcement today stated: "The board took action at this time in response to mounting evidence that commercial banks have been tightening their standards of creditworthiness and the terms and conditions for many types of loans. While much of this tightening has been welcome from a safety and soundness standpoint, it has in recent months begun to exert a contractionary influence on the economy."
The action today was the kind of incremental step that Mr. Greenspan favors rather than the bold move many in the Bush Administration and Congress believe is now necessary.
With the budget deficit preventing tax and spending policy from being used to redirect the course of the economy, the burden is entirely on Mr. Greenspan's shoulders. Until now, the chairman has received high marks in political circles for keeping the economy on a steady course.
But if the economy slides into a serious recession, he will surely be blamed for being timid, and that could douse his chances for reappointment when his four-year term expires in August.
The view within the Bush Administration, for example, is that short-term interest rates should now be driven down by a percentage point or more to give the economy a jolt, but Mr. Greenspan is reluctant to make any move that might be inflationary.
A Federal Reserve official said the central bank hoped the change would ease an unusual development this year that threatens to keep interest rates unusually high at the end of this year.
Because banks are perceived nowadays as bad risks, many institutional investors that must make public their portfolios as of Dec. 31, particularly money market mutual funds, do not want to show bank certificates as among their holdings. "They want the stuff they print at the end of the year to look wonderful, first class, no risk at all," said Mr. Annable of the First National Bank of Chicago.
As a result, interest rates on certificates of deposits have risen recently. That in turn has forced the banks to keep their commercial interest rates high at the very time the Federal Reserve is trying to drive interest rates down.

HEADLINE: New York Sues Fast-Food Outlets on Fifth Ave. Over Signs

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Tired of seeing the once-subdued storefronts of Fifth Avenue disappearing under a blanket of gaudy plastic banners advertising $2.99 chicken fajitas, New York City has sued Irving and Murray Riese, among others, to get the illegal signs removed from three locations.
The Riese brothers run 178 fast-food outlets in New York, often in clusters that include Roy Rogers, Pizza Hut, Del Taco and Houlihan's restaurants. The three in question are all on Fifth Avenue -- No. 479, at 41st Street; No. 560, at 46th Street, and No. 604, between 48th and 49th Streets. 
 Often, Riese Organization restaurants are festooned with large banners, like those on a scaffold over the sidewalk in front of No. 604 or the pink-and-white sign draped haphazardly over a marble pilaster at No. 560.
But in the case of the special Fifth Avenue zoning subdistrict in which those three restaurants operate, the Zoning Resolution prohibits the display of banners or pennants from building exteriors.
"The continued maintenance of this public nuisance deprives the public of its right to economic and esthetic stability in one of the city's premier districts," the lawsuits declared.
 
Devising 'Another Way'
 Late yesterday afternoon, less than a day after legal papers were served, the chief operating officer of the Riese Organization, Vincent McCann, said: "If we shouldn't do it, we shouldn't do it. We'll have to devise another way."
"With the banners, I know we probably overstepped our bounds," Mr. McCann said. "I've instructed the removal of the banners."
Repeated earlier efforts to get the Riese brothers to comply with the restriction -- by request and legal summons -- were unavailing, said city officials and the president of the Fifth Avenue Association, whose 900 members include stores, banks and real-estate concerns.
The suit was undertaken by the Office of Midtown Enforcement, which coordinates law- and code-enforcement measures from 30th Street to 60th Street, between the East and Hudson Rivers.
 
'Ample Opportunity to Comply'
 "A lot of stores were violating the Zoning Resolution and a lot of violations and summonses were issued along there," said William H. Daly, director of the enforcement bureau."We've given these places ample opportunity to comply. The most egregious among those who haven't complied are these three."
"It's not targeted against the Riese brothers," Mr. Daly said. "It turns out that our code-enforcement people informed us that these three were the worst offenders as far as a failure to comply and also with respect to the number and size of signs. We may, indeed, bring more lawsuits along Fifth Avenue. These were the first -- the first and the worst."
Mr. McCann said that the Riese Organization did not "feel singled out," but that the lawsuits "seem like an overreaction."
In an affidavit supporting the city, Thomas Cusick, the president of the Fifth Avenue Association, said that the Riese Organization was the only company on the avenue that "completely ignored" notices from the association that they were violating the regulations.
 
Charges of Defective Locks
 In addition, he said, legal notices were "routinely ignored by the Riese Organization," which played "a game of 'cat and mouse' with the inspectors by removing the banners when a summons is issued, then waiting a respectable period and ultimately restoring the banner."
City officials also charged that the second, third and fourth floors of the restaurant at No. 604 were being used without the necessary public-assembly permit or certificate of occupancy and that the exits in the restaurant at No. 479 were locked or defective.
Mr. McCann said that he had only seen the suit involving No. 560 by yesterday afternoon and that he did not know about the other issues.
In their court papers, city officials seemed to acknowledge that signs might not be everyone's idea of a civic crisis.
"Although the harm engendered by the display of unlawful advertising banners and signs is different from the harm engendered by massage parlors, houses of prostitution or drug dens, it is nonetheless palpable and real," the suit said. "The defendants' intentional flouting of the Zoning Resolution will encourage further disregard for such laws."

Macy's Ad Assails Financial Rumors

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Frustrated by the continuing speculation about the financial stability of R.H. Macy & Company, Edward S. Finkelstein, its chairman and chief executive, took a full-page advertisement in a leading retailing trade paper yesterday to respond to "unfounded rumors and misinformation, which serve no one."
In the advertisement, which appeared in Women's Wear Daily at a reported price of about $15,000, Mr. Finkelstein leveled an attack on what close associates say is a pet peeve -- the growing conviction among suppliers and creditors that Macy's future is staked to sales performance this Christmas. 
 "No 'miracles on 34th Street' are required this Christmas," he stated in the advertisement, a reference to the holiday movie that is centered on Macy's flagship store on 34th Street in Manhattan. "The season will not make or break Macy's. We expect it to be slow and we are prepared for it."
The ad, which some in the industry say only lends credence to the rumors, was in the form of a letter from Macy's and signed by Mr. Finkelstein. It begins, "Dear Friends: It has become fashionable of late for uninformed outsiders to speculate about Macy's status and future."
The letter was also distributed to Macy's employees earlier this week, a company spokesman said.
Mr. Finkelstein declared in the ad, "We have $650 million less in inventory this Christmas season than last, so there is no need to resort to last year's level of markdowns, regardless of what others may do."
He added: "Our gross margins this Christmas quarter will be superior to last year's. We are focusing on profitability, not volume, and are committed to preserving traditional gross margins."
Mr. Finkelstein is said by people close to Macy's to have been especially irritated by recent news reports about the sharp increase in its losses, which rose to $66 million in the first fiscal quarter, ended Oct. 31, and by other articles suggesting that Macy's may face what Federated Stores confronted last January: a bankruptcy filing.
Last Thursday the Standard & Poor's Corporation said it was reviewing for a possible downgrading the speculative-grade rating for Macy's subordinated debt. The rating agency said the action reflected Macy's continuing weak retail sales in the context of the company's highly leveraged capital structure. Macy's is about $5 billion in debt from a 1986 leveraged buyout led by Mr. Finkelstein and a 1988 acquisition of the Bullock's and I. Magnin retail chains in California.
In the advertisement, Mr. Finkelstein tried to address the ramifications of some of these issues. "Macy's has ample liquidity to meet all of its obligations under any economic scenario we can foresee," he said. "In fact, even after making our $68 million debt principal payment later this month, we will be cash positive and have $475 million of excess bank borrowing capacity."
The advertisement drew mixed reactions.
"It's certainly a gamble that by running the ad he is reinforcing the rumors," said Bud Konheim, president of Nicole Miller Inc., a dress and sportswear maker. "It's obvious that Mr. Finkelstein is frustrated because no one is telling the story the way he wants it to be told. He probably feels embattled on several fronts. He used to make himself available to the media, but now he has other people doing it for him. But, in my opinion, he is doing well coping with all his problems."
Others doubted that the advertisement made a convincing case. "It's a bold move for Macy's to make considering that neither they nor anyone else knows that the retail business will be better in 1991 than it was in 1990," said David Rachman, professor of marketing at Baruch College in New York. "Ed Finkelstein must also be feeling pressure from suppliers. But if I were doing this, I would have my favorite banker also writing a statement in the ad or appearing with me on the six o'clock news."
He said the advertisement might have been a ploy to buy time. "I suspect that he may be in the midst of making a major or otherwise important deal and ran the ad to buck up the morale of factors and creditors until the deal takes place," Professor Rachman said.
In the ad, Mr. Finkelstein also stated: "Any comparison between Macy's and the situation in which Campeau Corporation (now Federated) found itself last winter is simply wrong. Campeau didn't have ample cash to meet its obligations -- we do; Campeau had huge, ballooning debt and interest payments to meet in a very short time frame -- we don't; and Campeau wasn't run by merchants who have seen hard times before and know how to plan for them -- we are."
Federated Stores, which owns Bloomingdale's and Abraham & Straus, declined to comment.

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Lowest in Eight Years

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Sales of new homes dropped by 3.5 percent in October to the lowest level in eight years, the Government reported today. But analysts said the free fall might be bottoming out and sales should begin rebounding by spring.
"Sales should be leveling off at this number in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year," assuming mortgage rates continue to fall and the gulf crisis is resolved, said David G. Seiders, an economist at the National Association of Home Builders. 
 Mark Obrinsky, an economist at the Federal National Mortgage Association, suggested that sales might zig-zag for several months, "but assuming no blowup in the Middle East," he said, "I expect to see a more sustained pickup by the spring of 1991."
 
Annual Rate of 491,000
 Sales totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 491,000, the Commerce Department and the Housing and Urban Development Department said in a joint news release. That was the lowest since 480,000 new homes were sold in October 1982, a month before the 1981-82 recession ended.
So far this year, the sales of new homes are off 15.8 percent from the 1989 period.
Sales fell by 4 percent in September and 2 percent in August. The September figure was revised upward from a 6 percent decline in the initial estimate by the departments, but the October total was worse than the 1.8 percent drop first reported.
Mr. Obrinsky said the main reason for the decline "is great consumer uncertainty and generally negative buying sentiment."
At the October sales pace, it would take 8.4 months to exhaust the inventory of unsold homes, up from 8.3 months in September. There was a seven-month supply of unsold homes in October 1989.
The median price of a new home in October was $121,800, up from $112,900 in September but down from $123,000 a year ago. The median means that half of the homes cost more, half less.
Mr. Seiders of the home-builder group attributed the price increase to a hefty 47.4 percent gain in sales in the Northeast, which has the highest housing costs in the nation. Sales there were at an annual rate of 84,000 units after falling 12.9 percent the previous month.
Sales in all other regions fell, including a drop of 18.2 percent in the West, to 112,000 units. That was the lowest since 106,000 homes were sold in September 1982.
In the Midwest, sales were off 11.7 percent, to 83,000 units, the lowest since 74,000 homes were sold in August 1986. Sales dropped 4.1 percent in the South, to 212,000 units.

HEADLINE: BUSH, IN URUGUAY, VOWS OIL PRICE AID

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay, Dec. 4

 BODY:
President Bush, on the second stop of his Latin American tour, gave a strong pledge today to relieve the economic burden that small countries face from rising oil prices in connection with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
Mr. Bush warned: "I can make clear that this is not going to go on forever. And it is not going to go on forever." 
 The coup attempt in Argentina on Monday and the situation in the Persian Gulf overshadowed the President's visit to Uruguay today.
Asked about the uprising in Argentina, Mr. Bush said he was looking forward to his visit to Buenos Aires on Wednesday. "I think that the incidents yesterday were aimed not at the Government, but it was a military-versus-military controversy," he said.
And when asked whether he thought democracies in South America were stable, he replied, "Yes I do."
 
Focus on Economic Issues
 The President spoke with reporters after meeting with President Luis Alberto Lacalle for talks that focused on trade and economic issues.
Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas F. Brady, who was accompanying the President on this trip, said today that Mr. Bush felt "very badly" that other events had distracted attention from his messages on free markets and blossoming democracy.
"We're missing a big opportunity to see how the President really feels" on the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade and the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, Mr. Brady said.
There was no question that Mr. Bush's message of "a new dawn for the New World," the stated theme of his South American visit, was diminished by Urugayans' expressed concerns about the situation in the gulf.
 
Warning From Uruguayan
 Gonzalo Aguirre, Uruguay's Vice President and President of the Senate. introduced Mr. Bush for his speech to a session of the Uruguayan Congress with a strong warning to behave with "infinite patience" and take the paths of "persuasion and dissuasion" in the gulf.
"The use of force is equivalent and tantamount to war, and war is tantamount to destruction, desolation and death," Mr. Aguirre said. "If the decision is for war, perhaps we will not justify it, but we will certainly understand it."
When it was Mr. Bush's turn to speak, he defended his bellicose turn in recent weeks.
"What the world faces in the Persian Gulf, believe me, is fundamental," he said. "We will not, we must not, reward a nation that would wipe another country off the face of the earth. We will not reward a nation that has literally -- and the tales are agonizing -- has literally raped and terrorized its smaller neighbor."
 
Cheney's Assessment Backed
 At a news conference, Mr. Bush backed Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's assessment that economic sanctions will not work and that military force should be used to force Iraq out of Kuwait.
Although Mr. Cheney's arguments before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Monday were swiftly challenged by the committee chairman, Senator Sam Nunn, and other Democrats, Mr. Bush said he was so pleased with the Defense Secretary's words that he had sent him a warm message.
Mr. Cheney's testimony, and the President's remarks today at the joint news conference with President Lacalle, may have been designed less to signal imminent war than to increase the pressure on President Saddam Hussein of Iraq by persuading him that war is near.
"I am convinced that Saddam Hussein, up until now at least, has not gotten the message," Mr. Bush said. "And the United Nations resolution speaks for itself. To me, it was loud and clear. But I don't think Saddam Hussein yet understands that. And therefore, the best hope for peace is for him to understand that and all means, all means, necessary to fulfill these resolutions will be used against him."
 
Some Boycott Speech
 About a dozen lawmakers in the leftist coalition of the Uruguayan Congress boycotted Mr. Bush's speech, and a score more left afterward without clapping or joining in the polite standing ovation for the President.
Outside the Congress, several hundred people demonstrated, chanting in Spanish that Mr. Bush was a "murderer." Thousands more residents of Montevideo lined the streets of his motorcade, some curious to see the President and others waving crosses and flags with skull and crossbones in protest.
Mr. Bush is on a six-day Latin American trip to promote free trade, democracy and growth in the Western Hemisphere, trying to give the countries here some attention in a year when the focus has been on Eastern Europe.
"The Western Hemisphere can take pride in having launched this worldwide transformation from dictatorship to democracy," he said at the Legislative Palace.
He praised President Lacalle for being the first leader to call him when he announced his Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, a plan to open up trade and investment possibilities in the region.
 
Flexible on Trade Issue
 At his news conference, Mr. Bush said he was flexible on the issue of reducing farm subsidies on the trade negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The negotiations on the world trade regulations followed by some 100 nations are now in a stalemate in Brussels.
He said the United States and Uruguay were in agreement that something must be done about the European Community's unwillingness to make concessions to reduce protection for its farmers.
The American and Uruguyan Presidents agreed that the agriculture issue must be addressed, but said they were not locked into a specific figure for reduction of the subsidies.
"We are taking a pragmatic view toward the negotiation," Mr. Lacalle said. "We are saying agriculture must be inside. I'm not telling you what kind of percentage I'm prepared to accept, but it must be in the package, and it cannot be the percentage that has been officially offered up to now."

HEADLINE: Debt and Democracy

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec. 4

 BODY:
President Bush has started his five-nation tour of South America speaking of democracy. His Latin hosts, all democratically elected presidents, are talking of debt.
 "To fulfill the New World's destiny, all of the Americas and the Caribbean must embark on a venture for the coming century: to create the first fully democratic hemisphere in the history of mankind," Mr. Bush said on Monday as he began the first tour of South America by an American president in eight years. 
 Later in the day, Brazil's president, Fernando Collor de Mello, touched on his major preoccupation: the nation's $115 billion foreign debt.
"We are not talking of a banking problem, but a question that involves 150 million people and one of the largest and most important countries of the world," the Brazilian said at a dinner for Mr. Bush. "My government cannot demand more sacrifices if it is not convinced that these efforts will be the price for a consistent, balanced and feasable solution."
 
Linking Debt and Democracy
 To some, the missed dialogue reflected two hemispheres permanently out of synchronization. Leaving winter behind, the American president arrived as South America started its summer.
To others, Mr. Bush's reluctance to confront the debt issue reflected new economic realities in the United States. The developed world's most indebted nation can ill afford to bail out the developing world's most indebted nation.
But many Latin Americans argue that debt and the future of democracy will be inextricably intertwined in the 1990's.
"The foreign debt problem has created hurdles for democratization," Paulo Nogueira Batista Junior, a Sao Paulo economist, said today.
The countries on Mr. Bush's route -- Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela -- collectively owe $250 billion to foreign creditors. With the exception of Venezuela, virtually all of the debt was run up by military dictators during the 1970's and early 1980's. When civilians started reasserting control in the mid-1980's, they inherited staggering debt obligations.
 
An Orthodox Way Out
 "Brazil's military Governments had ample credit -- the civilian Governments have had none," Mr. Batista said referring to the virtual halt of new commercial bank loans to Brazil after the debt crisis broke in 1983.
Heavy debt service payments -- the Brazilians calculate that they paid $60 billion in the 1980's -- helped depress growth to the extent that the 1980's were widely dubbed Latin America's "lost decade."
Seeking to restore their finances, the region's nations are now trying an orthodox way out --slashing Government spending, encouraging foreign investment and opening domestic monopolies to international competition.
Chile made the painful transition under the closed system of a military dictatorship. But the other countries are going through the turmoil as fledgling democracies.
 
Widespread Reactions
 Behind the braggadocio of the military revolt in Argentina on Monday was widespread discontent over military salaries that have fallen far behind inflation. In Brazil, where inflation is 17 percent a month, military and civilian workers are demanding that they receive raises before New York banks receive interest payments. In Venezuela last year, about 300 people died in rioting when an austerity plan went into effect.
But in an interview with South American journalists in Washington on Friday, Mr. Bush said of the debt problem, "While I will want to discuss this issue with President Collor, I do not see it as central to my discussions in Brazil."
To the disappointment of many Brazilians, the American officials visting Brasilia took the position that renegotiating Brazil's $60 billion foreign debt is a private affair between Brazil and the banks.
Mr. Bush preferred to talk of his Enterprise for the Americas initiative, which envisions a free trade and free investment zone extending from Alaska to Argentina. Under the intiative, the United States would forgive a portion of $12 billion in debt owed by Latin American nations to the United States Government. In addition, he called for reducing commercial debt service by channeling payments into local environmental projects.
 
Twisted Arms, Empty Sleeves
 "In the Mexico negotiations we twisted a lot of arms that turned out to be empty sleeves," one American official said, seeking to minimize the participation of the United States Treasury in a commercial debt reduction package for Mexico last year.
But in a move that visiting Americans did not trumpet in Brasilia, the United States, Europe and Japan acted last week to cut off all new loans from the Inter-American Bank to Brazil until the Collor Government makes significant progress with its commercial creditors.
Indeed, the deadlocked Brazil negotiations reflect the anguish that surrounds the debt issue in South America. Brazil has not paid interest on its commercial debt in 15 months, racking up $8 billion in arrears.
"When I saw President Collor in New York in September, he told me he wanted to get an agreement by the end of the year, but progress has been glacial," William R. Rhodes, a senior executive of the Citicorp group and chairman of Brazil's bank advisory board said in a telephone interview today from New York. At risk, two American economists in Brasilia said today, are access to short-term credit lines and continued foreign investment.
The Brazilians say they are holding out for a long-term renegotiation that will reduce annual service payments to a level that will allow resumption of economic growth in the 1990's.
"Portugal, Spain and Greece returned to democracy under prosperity," Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a Sao Paulo senator, said in an interview today. "Latin America is trying to establish democracy without prosperity."

HEADLINE: Nation's Image Worries Argentines

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 4

 BODY:
As the last of the Argentine Army rebels were being loaded onto trucks after giving up Monday, a nearby group of civilians began to chant, "Paredon! Paredon!" meaning that they should be lined up before a wall and shot.
Such disgust with the fourth army rebellion in less than four years was almost generalized across Argentine society today as people endorsed the tough handling of the uprising by President Carlos Saul Menem and fretted about how the revolt might damage Argentina's standing with the world. 
 "My husband, after he heard about the rebellion yesterday, woke me up saying we were a fourth-class republic -- worse than a banana republic," said a woman crossing the Plaza de Mayo in front of the presidential palace. It was a comparison that could not be resisted by many commentators.
With President Bush scheduled to arrive Wednesday on the first visit by an American President since Eisenhower, the Menem Government has been eager to show a nation leaving behind the political and military antics of the past and worthy of mature trade and investment relations with the leading nations of the world.
 
Menem Cites Determination
 While some Government officials worried that the rebellion would represent a step backward from that goal, Mr. Menem said Argentina would emerge "fortified at the international level" because of the determination with which he crushed the rebels.
Determination was also used to put things back to normal this morning. Banks, the exchange markets and the domestic airport were functioning on schedule after being closed Monday, and traffic flowed freely.
The Interior Ministry said 21 people -- five of them civilians, the rest loyalist and rebel soldiers -- were killed in the long day of fighting that ensued after about 300 men occupied the army headquarters, three other army installations and a small building of the coast guard headquarters before dawn Monday. There was also fighting in the northern province of Entre Rios as loyalist troops attacked a rebel tank column moving toward the capital.
Unlike what occurred in the three military uprisings faced by Mr. Menem's predecessor, Raul Alfonsin, this time the bulk of the army and the leadership demonstrated what appeared to be strong loyalty to the Government by quickly using firepower against their rebellious comrades.
The newspaper La Nacion reported that the army chief of staff, Lieut. Gen. Martin Bonnet, told his generals Monday that he wanted the rebels to give up "in their underwear, with their hands behind their neck, and barefoot."
 
No Deals Seen
 In the past, loyalist troops had waffled and delayed and fired hardly a shot as politicians negotiated. To all appearances, there were no deals this time.
It was also notable that the civilian population showed no sympathy for the rebel demands. In the previous uprisings, a key demand was the halting of efforts to prosecute military men for political killings committed during the so-called dirty war against leftists in the mid-1970's. That demand found many civilian sympathizers from the political right and center-right.
But Mr. Alfonsin subsequently halted such trials and he and Mr. Menem pardoned or amnestied most of those accused, so that was no longer an issue.
The rebel demands this time were largely related to the impoverished state of the armed forces and the status of the dissidents within the ranks. They demanded, for example, that General Bonnet be replaced as chief of staff by Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin, who led the last uprising two years ago and is now under 60 days' detention for recent public criticism of the Government.
 
Death Penalty Hinted
 Mr. Menem ordered summary proceedings against the rebels and hinted that he might permit the death penalty for the leaders, but other Government officials privately played down that possibility.
Foreign Minister Domingo Cavallo, arriving today from Brussels, said events such as those on Monday "always have a negative effect" on international public opinion but said the Government's rapid reaction had served to "mitigate" that effect.
Argentina, which is emerging from a long period of economic isolation and of cool relations with the United States, is looking to the Bush visit to help in its efforts to rebuild and restructure the economy with foreign investments and loans.
Mr. Menem would like to use what will be his fourth face-to-face meeting with Mr. Bush to seek better terms for Argentina's nearly $65 billion foreign debt and open new markets for Argentine agricultural exports. Although Argentina is siding with the United States in efforts to persuade the European Common Market countries to lower their agricultural subsidies -- the demand the Bush Administration makes for lowering United States subsidies -- there is still fear among producers and exporters here that the United States will never go far in reducing its own subsidies.
While the debt, most of which is with private banks, and the hope of increased foreign investment are not in the power of Mr. Bush to resolve, Mr. Menem is a man who believes that most things can be worked out by direct dealings among friends.
Like most Latin American leaders today, he wants to be friends with Mr. Bush.

HEADLINE: Alliance on Subsidies Pleases U.S.

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 4

 BODY:
In trying to force the European governments to cut the generous subsidies paid to their farmers, the United States is allied with the 70 developing nations represented at this week's trade talks.
Among the industrial nations, the Europeans give farmers by far the largest subsidies. The International Monetary Fund estimates that halting the industrial world's farm subsidies could raise third world farm exports by $50 billion a year. 
 American officials are delighted that many third world nations have made reducing farm subsidies their principal goal in the trade negotiations. Brazil, Argentina, Chile and several other third world nations have been at Washington's side in putting pressure on the European Community to slash farm subsidies.
But that support has its price. The developing nations have stressed that without a liberalization of farm trade, they will resist dropping barriers to protect their nascent service industries, which might be hurt by efficient competitors from industrialized countries.
"Without a significant result in reducing agricultural protection, our country cannot accept the other results of this round of talks," said Domingo F. Cavallo, Argentina's Foreign Minister.
 
Rejoicing Over Fiber Accord
 On the one hand, third world ministers are eager for the industrial world to agree to slash protection in trade in textiles and farm products. Asian, African and Latin American officials say protection in these two areas robs them of vital export markets and slows their economic growth.
At the same time, officials from many developing nations are uneasy about proposals to liberalize trade in services and curb government subsidies to industry. They fear, for example, that if Western or Japanese banks and insurers gain the right to operate freely in their countries, that could hold back development of their small financial services sectors.
Officials of third world nations are rejoicing that negotiators are near agreement on phasing out the multi-fiber accord, which rich nations long used to restrict imports of third-world apparel.
They are also optimistic about winning far lower tariffs on tropical products like bananas, peanuts and cocoa. Lower tariffs should help raise trade in third world farm commodities battered by low prices.
Many officials of developing countries are less than enthusiastic about liberalizing trade in services. Fearing that Western corporations may completely dominate their service sectors, they are asking that along with liberalizaton, the industrialized world provide aid to help develop the third world's service sector.
There is also ambivalence about the West's push to win more protection for intellectual property, including patents and copyrights. Some third world officials fear that this could slow much-needed innovation and the development of small business. One Indian official said that granting patents to Western pharmaceutical companies could aggravate problems in his nation where cheap medicine is needed.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
With Oil High, How About Wood?

BYLINE: By SALLY JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BURLINGTON, Vt., Dec. 4

 BODY:
With oil prices hovering near $30 a barrel, advocates of wood energy are calling on the Government to forge a national energy policy that would make wood once again an economically attractive fuel for generating electricity.
Improved technologies and environmental benefits should rekindle interest in wood and other vegetable fuels called biomass, advocates say. In Vermont, which has gone from 20 percent forest to 80 percent in the last century. some developers are taking a serious look at new wood-burning projects. 
 Environmentally, wood is attractive for several reasons. It has no sulfur, so burning it does not contribute to acid rain, said Robert Kennel, a vice president of Hadson Power Systems, who is in charge of developing wood and coal plants for the Southern California-based company.
Barry Commoner, a leading environmental expert, said that theoretically wood even could be preferable to fossil fuels. "Coal, oil or natural gas would contribute to the global warming effect," he said, "A tree would not," because it would be releasing carbon dioxide that was taken out of the atmosphere when it grew, whereas the other fuels represent much older carbon.
Professor Commoner, who is director of the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems at Queens College of the City University of New York, also said that emissions from wood-fueled power plants, like those from any other power plants, could be controlled through the use of electrostatic preciitators or scrubbers.
"The only way I know that the environmental issue has arisen from wood-burning," he said, was when people in Vermont and New Hampshire used wood-burning stoves and furnaces. Unlike a power plant, they do not have emission controls, so smoke accumulates.
Another advantage to the plants being tried in Vermont and California is that they use only waste wood from industry and agriculture, solving a waste-disposal problem, not cutting down trees to burn. Despite the environmenal advantages, the economic advantages are less clear-cut.
"Rising oil prices should have a positive effect on getting people and institutions thinking about alternative energy," Mr. Kennel said.
"The concern is that no one knows how long oil prices will stay high," he said. "The only thing that's going to get wood energy back into the picture is a solidly thought-out national energy policy, something we've never had in this country."
Wood burning, once promising, had a boom period in the 1980's, only to slow to a near-standstill by the end of the decade after the 1986 tax law curbed tax credits for alternative energy, along with many other tax breaks.
The most promising technologies would both reduce capital costs and increase the efficiency of biomass plants, said David Rinebolt, director of research for the National Wood Energy Association, a trade association of developers of wood projects.
Whole-tree burning allows trees to be burned in 20-foot sections, eliminating the need for processing the wood into chips and thereby cutting costs.
A technology called gasification involves "cooking," or heating, the wood in an oxygen-restricted environment and separating it into volatile gases, charcoal and tars. The gases can be fed directly into the turbines that generate electricity, eliminating the need for steam power.
Vermont has proposed using the gasification process with a highly efficient gas turbine engine, developed by General Electric for use in jets.
The Vermont Department of Public Service has won a commitment from the Federal Government of close to $1 million to pay for a feasibility study for a 20-megawatt wood-gasification power plant in Bennington, near the New York State line.
"Southwestern Vermont has the most underutilized forest, so the forestry people like it," said George Sterzinger, commissioner of the department. "We like it because it is one of the cleanest ways to generate electricity without a net addition of carbon dioxide to the environment."
In addition, the state signed an agreement with Brazil last May to explore the applications of the gasification technology for agricultural waste, specifically sugar cane.
"This project would have both local economic and global environmental benefits," Mr. Sterzinger said. "It potentially leverages a small amount of Federal money to attract a large amount of private money. Everybody's just been waiting to see if somebody else could make it work."
But others remain unconvinced that technology alone will bring wood back into play. Mr. Kennel argues that only national policy can do that.
Vermont was a pioneer in using wood as a fuel to generate electricity for commercial sale. The McNeil Generating Station, owned by the Burlington Electric Department, went into commercial operation in 1984. It used wood, taken from nearby forests, that was chipped for burning.
At 50 megawatts, it is the largest wood-fired plant in the country, capable of serving 100,000 to 150,000 people. There was trouble from the start, however, leading some detractors to write it off as a failure. But to backers of wood burning, McNeil became an object lesson for future plants.
The McNeil station, conceived in the years after the oil embargo when oil prices were high and Congress was enthusiastic about renewable energy sources, was built in a populated area.
Wood was plentiful, but there was poor road access. And by the time the plant, which was expensive to run, started up, oil prices had dropped. Also, it was noisy and dirty, angering its neighbors just outside the city.
"I have to say the Burlington Electric Department showed some pizazz in attempting McNeil," said Mr. Kennel, whose company, Hadson Power Systems, has developed eight wood-burning plants. "It is certainly the granddaddy of wood plants. What we all learned from it is that 50 megawatts is too big. We also learned that a location with good road access is critical."
Despite McNeil's problems, national interest in wood burning, spurred by Federal tax policy, grew quickly. In 1986 alone, 1,839 megawatts of electricity from wood-burning generators went into operation, more than half the 3,054 megawatts of power introduced from 1980 to 1985.
Over all, Mr. Kennel estimated, there are 1,000 wood-fired plants in the country, typically ranging from 10 to 25 megawatts. A 20-megawatt plant burns 600 tons of wood a day and can serve 50,000 people, but only a third of the plants offer electricity for sale. The rest are owned and operated by the forest-products industry for its own use.
Wood energy has been tried principally in New England and California, where it has been seen as an alternative to failed nuclear plants.
But in 1989 Mr. Rinebolt of the wood energy association said that without the tax credits only 614 megawatts of wood-fueled electricity were brought into operation. This year, he expects the number to be even smaller: 250 to 300 megawatts; plants are under development in Vermont, Connecticut, Maine and Michigan.
Mr. Rinebolt said, "Coal projects are getting bid in at 3.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, while wood is at 5 cents."

HEADLINE: Puerto Ricans' Alienation Is Cited in Miami Rampage

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 4

 BODY:
A rampage on Monday night in which hundreds of youths looted stores and set fires was touched off in part by a sense of alienation and powerlessness among Miami's tiny Puerto Rican population, neighborhood residents and leaders of Puerto Rican organizations said today.
"We want the people to know that we exist," said Clemente Montalvo, who has lived in Miami's predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood, Wynwood, all his life. 
 The disturbance in Wynwood, small compared with outbreaks of ethnic violence in recent years here, came hours after a Federal jury acquitted six members of a police drug squad of conspiracy in the beating death of a Puerto Rican drug dealer, Leonardo Mercado. The jury deadlocked 11 to 1 for acquittal on the more serious charge of violating Mr. Mercado's civil rights by killing him,
 
'Cubans Get Everything'
 "It's not just because of the Mercado trial," Mr. Montalvo said. "Cubans get everything; we get nothing. When the Cubans jump, they get what they want."
During the rampage, several youths clutched Puerto Rican flags, and shouts of "Viva Puerto Rico!" mixed with chants of "Cano!" which was Mr. Mercado's nickname.
Puerto Ricans said today that their lack of status here was reflected in such things as the absence of Puerto Rican music on Spanish-language radio stations and the dearth of Puerto Ricans in powerful positions in local government and business.
"I dare you to find in the city of Miami a Puerto Rican in a position of authority," said Emilio Lopez, president of the Borinquen Health Care Center in Wynwood. "If he is, he is so entangled with the establishment that he won't do anything for his people."
In fact, Maurice Ferre, a former Mayor, was born in Puerto Rico.
The police and some Wynwood residents attributed the rampage to neighborhood toughs whose sole motive was to cause trouble and steal. "All these criminals saw this demonstration taking place and they started taking advantage of it," said Sgt. David Rivero, spokesman for the Miami Police Department. "You had hoods, dope dealers, alcoholics, dope users who decided to have a good time."
Numbering about 12,300 people, or about 4 percent of the city's population, Miami's Puerto Rican residents have for years quietly existed on the fringe of the political and commercial establishment. In a city often defined by its ethnic crosscurrents, the Puerto Ricans have largely been missing from the spotlight that shines on Cubans, blacks and non-Hispanic whites.
"The perception here is that when you speak about Hispanics, you only speak about Cubans," Mr. Lopez said. "When you speak about the poor, you speak about blacks."
Monday's disturbance grew out of a demonstration by friends and relatives of Mr. Mercado in a neighborhood park.
 For nearly three hours Monday night, hundreds of youths roamed with impunity through Wynwood, pelting passing cars and buses with stones, overturning vehicles, setting three buildings ablaze, igniting fires in trash bins and looting stores. More than 300 police officers, many in riot gear, finally moved in around 9 P.M. and began to quell the melee.
Fire officials set a preliminary estimate of the damage at $2.5 million. Other than two news photographers who were roughed up, there were no reports of injuries. At least 15 people were arrested.
Several Wynwood residents and merchants criticized the police for responding too slowly to the violence. The police acknowledged today that they had not expected the traditionally tranquil Puerto Rican community to become violent. As a result, they said, there was only a normal complement of officers on duty when the trouble began around 6 P.M., several hours after the verdict was announced.
 
Police on Guard Again
 It took the police about three hours to muster riot squads. Mr. Rivero, the police spokesman, said that any police presence in Wynwood before the arrival of the riot squads could easily have resulted in more people being hurt, as outnumbered officers without tear gas or riot gear might have had to resort to firing their weapons to protect themselves.
Since two of the six officers in the Mercado case were Hispanic, three were black and one was white, the disturbance is not being interpreted in strictly racial terms. The resentment expressed today by several Wynwood residents was against the police, not against a particular racial group.
Police were on guard tonight for further outbreaks of violence. Several Wynwood residents have expressed outrage not only at the verdict but also at Chief Perry Anderson's stated intention to reinstate the six police officers involved in the Mercado case.
The rampage has focused the city's attention on Wynwood, an area of grinding poverty where the windows on most of the one-story and two-story bungalows are covered by iron bars and where concertina wire tops fences around the parking lots of the few businesses. Miami officials say Wynwood is one of the city's poorest communities, though data on unemployment and income are from the 1980 census and are considered outdated.
"They're destitute, and they don't get much that help from society or government," said Mayor Xavier Suarez, who promised to divert more city resources to Wynwood. "We're a little embarrassed by that."
"It's a sad situation that this had to happen," said William Rios, executive director of the Wynwood Community Economic Development Corporation, a non-profit company that seeks to lure busineses to the area through tax incentives.
"It's going to be difficult for me to promote businesses in this area," he said. "But at least the community is getting recognition of its needs. Before, people didn't really know where Wynwood was. They didn't know there was a Puerto Rican community."

HEADLINE: Oil Rallies, Then Slips a Bit After Close on Iraqi Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil prices climbed more than $1.50 a barrel on the futures market yesterday, but then lost a large part of that gain in after-hours trading when a news report indicated that Iraq might leave Kuwait.
The benchmark grade of crude oil settled at $30.66 a barrel, up $1.51, at the New York Mercantile Exchange on contracts for January delivery. Later contract months all settled higher, mostly by more than $1 a barrel. 
 But soon after the Mercantile Exchange had closed for the day, oil traders were jolted by a British television news report indicating that Iraq might have a plan for pulling its army out of Kuwait.
Sky television news said Iraq might be ready to withdraw from most of Kuwait if it is allowed to keep the disputed Rumaila oilfield and if it received a guarantee that Western forces would not attack. A State Department official said the United States was unaware of any such Iraqi position.
Prices for petroleum at loading platforms and docks, commonly called the cash or spot market, tumbled by more than $1 a barrel minutes after the Mercantile Exchange closed, traders said. The cash market ordinarily follows the behavior of prices in the futures market at the exchange.
"That's a lot," said Thomas P. Blakeslee, an energy analyst with the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. "They usually don't move as dramatically as on the futures market."
In early afternoon trading on the exchange, oil prices had fallen on a report indicating that Kuwait might be willing to negotiate on the future of some of its islands if Iraq withdrew its troops, which invaded the country on Aug. 2.
 
'A Very Bullish Event'
 "But it did not continue to sell off; in fact it snapped back up," said Brian Tagler, a broker with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "Everybody interpreted that as as a very bullish event, the fact that the market did not collapse."
Crude oil futures shot up nearly $2 above their lows for the day, puzzling many traders.
Futures prices for refined petroleum products moved pretty much in tandem with crude prices yesterday.
Home heating oil rose 2.23 cents, to 86.90 cents a gallon, on contracts for delivery in January. Unleaded gasoline for January delivery rose 2.40 cents, to 75.92 cents a gallon.
Natural gas prices, which are not directly affected by the potential for a Middle East war, fell 3.5 cents, to $2.44 per 1,000 cubic feet, on contracts for delivery in January.
Later yesterday, the American Petroleum Institute reported that the nation's supply of crude oil fell last week to 335.5 million barrels from 337.1 million a week earlier and 351.9 million a year earlier.
The stockpile of gasoline was at 221.1 million barrels, up from 218.3 million a week earlier but down from 223.1 million a year earlier, the institute said in its weekly report. The stockpile of distillates, which include home heating oil, totaled 132.9 million barrels, down from 134.8 million a week earlier but up from 121.5 million a year earlier, the institute said.

HEADLINE: Miscalculations Put a Tight Lid On '92 Budget

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Bush Administration officials said today that they had discovered that less money would be available for new domestic spending in the 1992 fiscal year than White House and Congressional budget negotiators had expected.
The discovery reflects the fact that new budget procedures and spending limits were set in an atmosphere of confusion at the end of October. The negotiators were juggling large sums of money, and budget officials said there was apparently a miscalculation, the reason for which is not yet clear. Another factor is that Congress was at the same time adding money to the Federal budget for the 1991 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1.
 
Assigning the Blame
 As a result, there is less room for growth in the next fiscal year than the negotiators thought they were allowing. In fact, Administration officials said today that spending limits set in the new budget law were slightly lower than the amount needed to continue the services at existing levels, and hardly any money would be available for new domestic initiatives. 
 So far, there has been no finger-pointing, but budget officials and Congressional aides said that could come later.
The finding that the budget agreement's limits on domestic spending are tighter than people realized came to light in a memorandum sent to Cabinet officers by President Bush's budget director, Richard G. Darman. In responding to their budget requests for 1992, he said they had not caught up with "the new world of firm, fixed (and lower!) domestic discretionary spending caps," or limits.
He also scolded them, saying that they had submitted excessive budget requests for 1992. He said the Cabinet officers had displayed "near-universal expectations" that cuts would come in someone else's programs.
Mr. Darman and Congressional leaders set the domestic spending cap at $191.3 billion for 1992. They thought they were allowing a cushion for new spending, because the 1992 limit was nearly $30 billion more than the amount spent in 1990. But a late burst of appropriations pushed the 1991 spending close enough to the limit to eat up most of the cushion.
 
A Shocking Surprise
 In addition, Presidential appointees at several Cabinet departments said they had been told by Mr. Darman's staff that there had been "a miscalculation" or "a technical error" in computing the new limits for domestic spending.
"I have every reason to believe that this came as a surprise to Darman," said a senior official at one of the bigger Federal agencies. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
When White House and Congressional negotiators set the statutory limits on domestic spending for the next fiscal year, they envisioned small increases, in addition to increases to make up for inflation, in education, housing, law enforcement, environmental protection, scientific research and other national needs.
The chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, said at the time that domestic spending programs, which he called the "little runt pig" of the budget, had been starved for 10 years and would now get their "fair share" of Federal funds.
The budget bill signed by Mr. Bush on Nov. 5 established new budget procedures, including separate limits on "discretionary spending" for domestic, military and international programs. There is no evidence of a similar problem of miscalculations for military and international programs.
Congress sets the level of discretionary spending by passing appropriation bills each year. Discretionary spending differs from spending on benefits like Social Security, paid automatically to people who are eligible.
In his memorandum to the heads of Federal departments and agencies, Mr. Darman said he had "received and reviewed all agencies' budget requests for domestic discretionary programs" in the next fiscal year. "Unfortunately," he said, "the total requested for fiscal year '92 exceeds the legally binding cap by over $20 billion," or more than 10 percent.
"The excessive agency requests (in aggregate) would seem to have resulted" from "near-universal expectations that somehow cuts in someone else's area would be used as offsets" against increases in programs cherished by each Cabinet Secretary, Mr. Darman wrote.
Officials at the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office said Congress had already approved policy changes that would push Federal domestic spending above the new ceiling.
 
'A Big Windfall'
 A White House official said the 1992 budget would be tighter than Mr. Darman and Mr. Byrd initially assumed, in part because Congress approved "a big windfall" in domestic spending for the 1991 fiscal year just before adjourning.
As a result, he said, there will be substantial increases built into the budget for 1992, and those increases will eat up virtually all the funds available under the spending limit for domestic programs. The spending levels approved by Congress in one year are used as a starting point in preparing and analyzing budget requests for the next year.
"There was a one-year orgy, and now the chickens are coming home to roost," a White House official said, noting the increases in 1991 appropriations for many domestic programs.
Congress provided $182 billion in the 1991 appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services, up 14 percent from 1990. Spending for Federal highway projects will be allowed to rise more than 18 percent, to $14.5 billion in 1991. Congress approved a 9 percent increase in appropriations for energy and water projects, to $20 billion in 1991.
As a result of such increases in the current fiscal year, the White House and Congress will have little opportunity to spend money in creative new ways next year. They are already near the 1992 spending limits for domestic programs.
"We thought we would be in the land of milk and honey, with plenty of money to spread around in fiscal 1992," said the budget officer of a Cabinet department with many popular domestic programs. "But there was evidently a miscalculation of the spending caps. When the Administration and Congress were discussing those limits for 1992, they didn't know exactly what the 1991 appropriations would be."
Mr. Darman warned Cabinet officers to get ready for a new climate of fiscal austerity. The President's 1992 budget, which is to be submitted to Congress in two months, "will have to be far below agency requests, in aggregate," he said in his memorandum. "We must obey the legal limits on domestic discretionary spending."
Under the new budget law, there would be automatic across-the-board cuts in scores of domestic programs if the spending levels approved by Congress exceeded the statutory limit for domestic discretionary programs.

HEADLINE: State Arts Cutbacks Leave Trail of Inequity Among Applicants

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
In October, the Metropolitan Museum of Art received a check for $618,000 authorized by the New York State Council on the Arts to cover general operating expenses.
A few days later, the Museum of Modern Art was notified that its State Arts Council grant of $584,240 had been suspended by the state's emergency deficit-reduction plan. 
 Such inequities are now commonplace among state arts organizations as a result of cutbacks ordered by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
The Governor's package of proposed budget cuts -- a plan to reduce spending in order to help resolve the expected deficit in fiscal 1990-91 -- is expected to be acted on by the State Legislature next week before lawmakers adjourn for the holiday, even though the plan is now stalled by legislative wrangling in Albany.
 
A $1 Billion Cut
 In October, Mr. Cuomo proposed a plan to cut $1 billion from the state budget, and simultaneously ordered the suspension of a wide range of expenditures including grants to 567 arts groups.
While some institutions were staggered by the suspension, others were left unscathed, because the State Arts Council goes through five grants cycles each year. For convenience in processing, the 5,000 to 6,000 applications received annually are arbitrarily assigned for consideration to council meetings in February, June, August, October and December, and grants are dispensed five times a year.
The Governor's order became effective Oct. 30, so all groups in the summer cycle -- which included all of the local arts councils throughout the state, as well as the Metropolitan Museum and other institutions -- received their checks.
Those in the winter cycle, including the Modern, also received letters announcing their grants. But just before they were to receive their contracts, they got a second letter from the State Arts Council, dated Nov. 15, informing them that their grants had been suspended and might be permanently reduced.
 
Fewer Private Donations
 The suspension and potential cuts come at a particularly onerous time, many arts administrators have pointed out. Declining corporate profits and the threat of a recession have significantly reduced support for their institutions from the private sector.
The Arts Council remains hopeful that cuts will not be as deep as they appear to be. The Governor's order in October suspended $9.8 million in grants, but he has recommended to the Legislature that cuts in the Arts Council budget be held to $3.6 million.
"The arts groups will definitely get something back," said Tim Mulligan, a spokesman for the State Arts Council, "but everybody's going to have to take the medicine."
"We are hoping the Legislature will approve the Governor's package next week," said Diane M. Martuscello, the executive director of the Alliance of New York State Arts Councils, the central lobbying organization for state arts groups. "If it falls over to January, then we would be in the position of competing with ourselves, because January is when we try to talk to legislators about the 1991 budget. It would be like trying to read two chapters of a book at once."
"Compared to the cuts for mental health and education, the arts are not doing that badly," Ms. Martuscello said. "But arts organizations have no fat in their budgets. Many upstate organizations are not able to pay health benefits for their staff. So when you run like that, any cut hurts."
 
Across the Board
 The proposed cuts have gone out helter-skelter across the arts, striking the well-endowed and poor alike. Among the potential losers are The New York Shakespeare Festival ($308,500), the Roundabout Theater ($96,000), the American Spanish Dance Theater of Manhattan ($4,700) and the Albany Institute of History and Art ($37,000).
Hardest hit of all, thus far, is the Saratoga County Historical Society in Ballston Spa, N.Y., which has notified three of its four full-time staff members that they will be laid off by January because the organization's $56,400 in grants have been suspended. "The existence of the organization is threatened," said David Mitchell, director of the society.
The position of some arts groups has been made especially difficult because they signed contracts with performers after receiving the grant announcements. For example, Julianne Ramos, the executive director of the Rockland Center for the Arts in West Nyack, N.Y., said she must honor about $26,000 in contracts with performers signed just before she learned that her application for a $20,000 grant had been suspended.
"We have to replace whatever money we don't get from the state," Ms. Ramos said. "That's extremely difficult to do in the middle of the season. Everything has already been printed for those programs, so it would be difficult if not impossible to give any new sponsor proper credit."
She said she had "absolutely cleaned out" the center's bank account and could not rule out layoffs.

HEADLINE: Subtract Missiles, Add Food

 BODY:
It's within President Bush's grasp to build a foundation for friendly relations with Moscow for years. But first he must complete two major pieces of unfinished business when he meets Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow next month.
 One is an agreement reducing nuclear arsenals by a third. The other is emergency food aid for the Soviet people. Both items will be on Secretary of State James Baker's agenda when he meets with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard Shevardnadze, in Houston next week. 
 An arms accord will surely cause rejoicing in Washington and Moscow. But the reduction won't mean as much for anxious Soviet citizens preoccupied with their inability to get food. Emergency aid won't solve Moscow's shortages. But it will help prevent panic and buy time to reform the economy. It will show that Mr. Gorbachev can deliver and that Americans care. That could be as important as any cut in nuclear arms.
 Three small but sticky issues have to be resolved before the two sides can sign a strategic arms reduction treaty. One is the SS-18, a Soviet heavy missile that can be armed with 10 warheads and may have the accuracy to destroy U.S. missiles in their silos. The Soviets have agreed to cut the number of SS-18's in half, to 154.
 But critics of the treaty want the Soviets to agree not to upgrade the remaining SS-18's, or eliminate them altogether. The critics are too late; the Soviets have already fielded a new, more accurate version of the SS-18. But as soon as this treaty is signed, the two sides can move to negotiate further cuts.
bombers, has an obvious solution to anyone with a head for simple arithmetic. The Soviets are willing to limit their force to 600; the U.S. wants it reduced to 400. (Hint: Try 500.)
 The third issue seems well on the way to sensible resolution. Washington wants nothing to interfere with future sales of nuclear arms and technology to its allies. Moscow fears that more such deals will allow the U.S. to circumvent treaty limits. For now, Washington and Moscow seem prepared to agree to disagree on the issue.
 If an arms accord is one reassuring step Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev can take toward better relations, another would be a prompt decision by Washington to send emergency aid.
 Mr. Bush seems prepared to ship pharmaceuticals. But he seems strangely stubborn about food aid. America was willing to sell millions of tons of grain to the Soviet Union in Leonid Brezhnev's time. Why not give some now to the Soviet people of the Gorbachev era?
 Sure, Soviet farms produce enough to feed the Soviet population, though it doesn't always get to market. Sure, Mr. Bush is right to insist on reforms. And sure, fears of famine are exaggerated. But there are real shortages in some cities, and, a New York Times survey reports today, they are worsening. Suppliers, anticipating higher prices, withhold goods. Local authorities, expecting shortages, do too. Panicky shoppers, seeing little on the shelves, grab all they can.
 The certain knowledge that supplies are on the way could calm the hoarders and get the Soviet people through the winter.

To The Living Section:
My husband and I and thousands like us could be called "coppies" -- caring older people -- and we have mixed emotions about the feelings and attitudes of the big-spending yuppies now affected by the recession. 
 For the past 60 years, our lives have been influenced by a serious Depression, disrupted by a long war, buffeted by two other wars, shaken by a change in morals and standards and disturbed by the ceaseless and pernicious materialism and selfishness touted by the media and advertising.
Through it all, we worked very hard, saved as much as we could and paid our way, step by step. We took care of our parents, sent our children to college, lived through strikes, layoffs, recessions. We paid our taxes, without benefit of tax shelters, contributed to good causes and did without when we had to. Many of us, because of our thrift, were also there to help our children when they needed us. And we never cried, "Foul!"
We knew that whatever goes up comes down, that one should live within one's means, that all of us have a responsibility for those less fortunate than ourselves, that there is no free lunch.
For most of us, our prudent ways mean that between savings, Social Security and small pensions, we are not a burden on our children. We even can help them weather this economic storm. But please, no tears for those who mocked our values. It is time to treat us with honor and respect and maybe to learn something from our life experiences.

HEADLINE: Two Different Worlds

 BODY:
To The Living Section:
Regarding your feature on fallen yuppies ["Young, Successful but Between Jobs," Nov. 7] and the wave of prosperity they rode on during the high-rolling 80's, I can only ask: Were we living the same 80's? 
 Where did you find these people?
I am of the same age and of a parallel work history as many of the people you profiled, having graduated from college in 1982 and having been employed in several sectors of the economy that performed well during the 80's, including the insurance industry and Wall Street. I can assure you, times have never been high-rolling.
When we left school, most of us made between $12,000 and $18,000 a year. Most of us, and all of the women I know, had difficulty passing this entry-level threshold.
The reasons: in the early 80's the last major recession was on, and jobs were very hard to come by. Most of us were forced to take low-paying positions, not very often in the fields of our choice. In the mid-1980's when the so-called boom came, it's true that corporate America was doing well. On paper. Stock prices and earnings were soaring. How did the companies achieve this? Largely through streamlining, belt-tightening, mergers and acquisitions. This translated into budget-cutting and salary restrictions.
When it came time for raises and promotions, corporate policies were always cited. Over and over again, I heard the same story: that I should have been there 5 or 10 years ago, when annual raises were 9 to 12 percent and promotions for the deserving were routine.
Over the course of the 80's, such policies translated not only into frozen paychecks but an overall sense of hopelessness and depression, a perception of a lack of opportunities. What I saw were people delaying marriage, reluctantly living with their parents until the age of 28 or 30 in order to save a down payment for a co-op, single people of 32 sharing their one-bedroom apartments with strangers and enduring the discomforts of roommate living, something they thought they'd leave behind soon after their college days.
The only people I know who had lavish weddings or managed to save money for a house or a co-op while paying rent were those whose parents were liberally supplementing their incomes, just as they had relieved them of the burden of paying for their educations. This is not the case for most working people my age.
Perhaps the secret ingredient in the downfall of the yuppies you profiled is the parent factor. Perhaps the money pipeline from home, the executive-fathers who are finally losing their jobs in the current fallout, are the real reason for the drastic life-style changes you highlighted.
For the rest of us, adolescence has long been over.

HEADLINE: WASHINGTON AT WORK;
Snubbed, Hamstrung, but Ever So Diplomatic: He's Castro's Invisible Man

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Jose Antonio Arbesu is Fidel's man in Washington.
In a capital where politics and society mix as easily as wine spritzers, Mr. Arbesu, the Chief of the Cuban Interests Section, is so discreet he is the invisible diplomat. He will not identify his friends, nor the members of Congress and academics he meets. To do so, he said, would violate their confidence. He won't give out the address of his upscale Chevy Chase, Md., home because, as he put it, "some citizens of the neighborhood might be angered by my presence." 
 "Fortunately nobody recognizes me," the representative of President Castro said, pursing his lips into a self-contented grin. "I am a nonperson. I am the man who never was."
This invisibility follows him everywhere. Here he is, at the height of his career and professional powers, and he has no diplomacy to do. The United States is waiting for the successor to President Castro before the two nations start talking. "Sometimes I wonder what he does with his time," said one of the few Administration official who has met with Mr. Arbesu. Only middle-level officials meet with him and then only occasionally and on narrow consular and migration matters.
 
Some Unwanted Advice
 To make matters worse, wherever he goes, Mr. Arbesu said, Americans tell him what Cuba ought to be doing. "Everyone wants to give me advice," he said. "People say at parties and meetings, even in my own house, 'Why don't you do what they are doing in the Soviet Union?' One thing is to disagree, another is to patronize."
"When people ask me, 'Has socialism functioned well?' I ask them, 'Has capitalism functioned well?' "
Mr. Arbesu takes the indignities in stride. He predicts that despite growing shortages, rationing and decreased Soviet economic and political support, the Cuban revolution will survive after one or two difficult years.
"The fact that the cold war is over does not mean it has ended for everybody," he said. "It has not ended for us." His low standing in Washington, he added, is connected to the United States obsession with Cuba, which he said only a person trained as a historian or as a psychiatrist could explain.
The 50-year-old son of a middle-class Havana lawyer, Mr. Arbesu is a graceful and intelligent man who knows how to disarm with a professorial style, a kindly smile and a dry wit. "I came prepared for what I couldn't do," he said matter of factly, sitting in a parlor of his mission decorated with French Empire style furniture, ruffled curtains and portraits of Mr. Castro posing with champion boxers and a women's basketball team.
 
A Cloak Over the Past
 Before coming to Washington, he was the second-ranking official in the Americas Department in Havana, the Cuban Communist Party's bureau that handled relations with Latin American guerrilla groups and Communist parties. While he served there, the department clandestinely armed rebels throughout much of Central America and in Colombia and Chile, and he himself reportedly traveled to Panama in 1988 to advise Gen. ManuelAntonio Noriega on ways to resist United States efforts to depose him.
Mr. Arbesu, who has also represented his country in Indonesia, Egypt and Algeria, in secret talks with the Carter Administration, and in negotiations that brought about the independence of Namibia, won't comment on charges of Americas Department arms trafficking. He says little more about his current diplomatic activities, except to say that he is busy from 8:30 A.M. until well into the night nearly every day, dispelling the "misinformation" about his country prevailing in Washington in meetings with journalists and people from universities and other institutions that mold opinion here. "I'll explain my country's positions to whoever will listen to me," he said.
Few influential people do. Bush Administration officials almost totally snub him and members of Congress who met with him in efforts to improve relations when he first arrived in May 1989 are concentrating on more pressing international issues. Most on Capitol Hill are waiting for the Cuban regime to follow Eastern Europe's example and collapse.
"The highest level official who receives me here is a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State," Mr. Arbesu said, referring to Michael G. Kozak. "I never get access to higher levels."
"That's the way it is," he said, noting that United States diplomats in Havana can speak to anyone they like, including Mr. Castro, but adding, "I don't take it personally."
(A rare moment came on Nov. 25 when Under Secretary of State Robert M. Kimmitt called him in to consult on the Persian Gulf crisis and the position Cuba would take on the Iraq resolution as a member of the United Nations Security Council. Neither Cuban nor United States officials would comment on the meeting except to say bilateral matters were not discussed.)
 
Balanced, Low Key, Patient
 Wayne Smith, a former Chief of the United States Interests Section in Havana who sees Mr. Arbesu on occasion, said the Cuban diplomat "came at the worst possible time."
"Still," Mr. Smith said, "he's always been very balanced, very low key and very patient."
According to Mr. Arbusu, relations between Cuba and the United States are even worse under the Bush Administration than they were under President Reagan, even though Cuba has gone a long way to improve relations by withdrawing most of its military forces from Angola and Ethiopia. He said Washington always "moves back the goal posts."
"They believe the problems between our countries were invented by a group of people in 1959 in Cuba, but the problems began much much before that," he said. "It used to be that the concern was that Cuba was a threat to the security of the United States because of its relationship with the Soviet Union. But the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union has changed tremendously in the last couple of years."
Despite proclamations that the cold war has ended, the Bush Administration has refused to lift the 30-year-old economic embargo or restrictions on Americans who wish to travel to Cuba on vacation. Indeed, Mr. Bush has stepped up the pressure by opening Television Marti, a network intended to bring anti-Castro news and public affairs programming into Cuban homes.
 
A Prescription for the U.S.
 Mr. Arbesu says the United States needs to end transmissions of Radio Marti and Television Marti, drop the economic embargo, and eventually withdraw from its naval base at Guantanamo Bay before relations can become fully normal. But he says those basic issues are never fully addressed in his irregular discussions with State Department officials.
Even the bronze plaque outside the gate of the Interests Section, the Cuban Embassy in Batista's day, is a time warp.
Like his official vita, it says that he and his mission are attached to the embassy of the Czechslovak Socialist Republic. Not only is Czechslovakia not socialist anymore, but Prague has cut its lines of credit to its former Soviet bloc ally and is now a leader in the international campaign to censure Cuba for its poor human rights record.
Mr. Arbesu shrugged, saying that because the United States and Cuba did not have formal relations his embassy was still technically attached to the Czechoslovak Embassy, just as the United States Interests Section in Havana is technically attached to the Swiss Embassy.
 
'You Learn to Be Patient
 Despite the limitations of his diplomatic role here, Mr. Arbesu said he liked his job. "It's a challenge, and anything that is a challenge I like. After working on the United States for 17 years, you learn to be patient. If not, I better change my work."
Still, life could be easier. Mr. Arbesu said he misses his three grown children, two by his first wife, whom he divorced, and one by his current wife, Julia, who works in the Interests Section as a personal aide. All three children live in Cuba and reunions are infrequent. He and Julia find Washington's violence and poverty shocking, he said, and he complained a bit about the State Department rules that mean he must report when and where he travels far outside Washington's metropolitan area (while acknowledging that United States diplomats in Cuba have to undergo similar inconveniences).
But Mr. Arbesu said that he and his wife appreciated Washington's Southern charm, beautiful parks and museums, and the manageable traffic, which he noted beats the driving conditions in Havana.
"I have been interested in American culture since I was four years old, when I became acquainted with Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck," he said, displaying the affinity for things American typical of many Cubans' love-hate relation with this country. "And of course, there were the movies -- the westerns, the adventure films and the musicals. And the literature, of course -- Hemingway most of all."
Mr. Arbesu, who is an accomplished deep-sea angler, said his favorite literary character was Santiago, the fisherman hero in Ernest Hemingway's novella "The Old Man and the Sea."
"He caught the biggest marlin in the world, only to see it eaten by the sharks," he said. "All Hemingway's characters are losers in one way or another. But these are people who fight. I hope I will be a winner. At least I am not a marlin."

Saatchi Says Hard Times Will Stay With It a While

BYLINE: By Steven Prokesch

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
FOR Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C., the future looks even bleaker than the recent past.
The advertising giant yesterday reported a loss for the year ended Sept. 30 that was much greater than the loss in the previous year. And Saatchi executives stunned the financial community with an unusually grim forecast for next year. 
 Neil R. Blackley, an analyst at James Capel & Company in London, said the executives told analysts at a meeting yesterday that they expected their clients in the United States to cut their advertising spending by 8 to 10 percent next year. As a result, the executives expect Saatchi's American ad billings to be flat next year, excluding the operations of McCaffrey & McCall, an agency that Saatchi is in the process of selling to McCaffrey's management.
Saatchi's flagship advertising agencies are Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide and Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide.
Mr. Blackley said Saatchi expected ad spending by clients in Britain and Australia to be flat or slightly down in 1991 and to be up about 6 percent on the European Continent.
The forecast for American operations was much worse than many analysts' predictions. Other big ad agencies have been predicting advertising spending would be up 4 or 5 percent in the United States next year.
"They are talking very, very bearishly indeed," Mr. Blackley said of the Saatchi executives. "The outlook is a lot worse than previously thought."
Mr. Blackley has slashed his forecast for Saatchi's pretax earnings in the 15 months ended Dec. 31, 1991, to 24 million, or $46.1 million, from 50 million, or $96.1 million.
The major clients of Saatchi & Saatchi's agencies include Johnson & Johnson, Mars, Procter & Gamble, Metropolitan Life, British Airways, Visa International and Toyota's American operations.
Saatchi said yesterday that in the year that ended Sept. 30, it had a loss of 98.2 million, or $184 million, after taxes, extraordinary items and preferred dividends. That compared with a loss of 58.5 million the previous year.
Pretax earnings before extraordinary items were 35.8 million, or $67.1 million, on revenues of 808.1 million, or $1.51 billion. That was down 41.6 percent from the 61.3 million earned the previous year on revenues of 973.5 million, but it was in line with analysts' expectations.
The company said it expected its operating margins, or pretax profits as a percent of revenues, to sink below 7 percent next year from 8.1 percent. "That's worse than in the recession in the early 1980's," Mr. Blackley said.
On the London Stock Exchange, the price of Saatchi's shares fell 8 percent, losing 3 pence, or 5.8 cents, to close at 34 pence, or 65.4 cents. Another advertising giant, the WPP Group, which is the world's largest marketing-services company, saw its shares fall yesterday by 3 pence, to 94 pence, or $1.807. The stock of heavily indebted WPP has tumbled recently amid worries about its ability to weather the industry's tough times.
In the last year, Saatchi & Saatchi has sold most of its consulting operations, and write-offs related to that were the cause of much of the loss reported yesterday. It has also trimmed 500 jobs, and executives said more cuts might be made. Saatchi also said yesterday that dividend payments, which were suspended in June, would not be restored now.
"We are continuing to reduce our costs," Maurice Saatchi, the company's chairman, said in a statement. "Our cost-control procedures should additionally enable us to react more quickly to changes in revenue expectations, which is particularly important in current economic conditions." He added that "1991 will be a difficult year for the group."
Saatchi, which had previously been criticized for not having good cost controls, recruited Robert Louis-Dreyfus last year to be its chief executive and address the problem. Mr. Louis-Dreyfus, who had been head of IMS International Inc., the American market-research company, brought along Charles Scott, an associate from IMS, to be the chief financial officer at Saatchi.
Since March, Mr. Scott has reduced Saatchi's short-term debt by 29.6 percent, to 195 million, or $374.9 million at today's exchange rate. He is in the process of trying to refinance 211 million, or $405.6 million, in convertible bonds due July 1993.
There have been rumors in the trade press that the company has been negotiating with Electra, a British venture capital firm, about injecting equity into the company. Saatchi would neither confirm nor deny those rumors yesterday.
But Mr. Saatchi said in the statement that the company intended "to make proposals to the group's bankers and shareholders to strengthen the balance sheet and to insure that the business is adequately and appropriately financed.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Up by 2.8% On Transportation Strength

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Factory orders for manufactured goods bounced up 2.8 percent in October, the Government reported today, but analysts attributed the jump mostly to the transportation sector and the higher cost of oil.
"The October numbers are about as good as the factory orders are going to look for a while," said Robert Brusca, an economist at the Nikko Securities Company International in New York. He, like many analysts, contends the economy is in a recession. 
 Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI-McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass., said: "The strength was mostly in aircraft and in nondurable price increases. I don't see any reason to become particularly hopeful on the basis of this report."
 
Revising the Numbers
 Excluding transportation, October orders were up just nine-tenths of 1 percent.
The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and nondurable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $250.7 billion after a revised decline of two-tenths of 1 percent the previous month. The revision showed September orders even weaker than the gain of one-tenth of 1 percent initially reported.
Transportation orders jumped 14.8 percent, to $37.9 billion, reflecting gains in both the aircraft and automobile industries. But aircraft orders tend to be volatile, and analysts noted that car production was falling at the end of November.
Factory orders are a significant barometer of manufacturing. A decrease may indicate a slump in that sector and future job layoffs.
Durable goods, products like autos that are expected to last more than three years, were up 3.9 percent, to $129.8 billion, after dropping 1.6 percent in September and nine-tenths of 1 percent in August.
 
 Report Called 'Bleak'
 But Mr. Brusca said the October total was below the $131.7 billion level reached last December. "The orders situation is really pretty bleak," he said.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said on Monday that its index of new manufacturing orders dropped to 39.4 percent in November, the lowest since a 38.1 percent reading in May 1982 during the last recession.
The association said that in its survey of purchasing managers 43 percent reported their companies had fewer new orders in November, 18 percent said their orders increased and 39 percent said they were unchanged from October.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
SAUDIS PROMISING CAIRO $1.5 BILLION

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia promised Egypt $1.5 billion to offset losses from the Persian Gulf crisis today as Cairo prepared to commit more troops and armor to join the American-led military buildup confronting Iraqi troops occupying Kuwait.
The Egyptian troops, forming an armored division equipped with tanks supplied by the United States, will be deployed alongside other Arab forces, including other Egyptians and Syrians, on the western flank of the buildup along Saudi Arabia's border with Kuwait, diplomats said. 
 Egypt, a leading Arab opponent of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, has already sent several thousand commandos and a mechanized division to the gulf. But Egyptian officials have said the crisis will cost it between $4.5 billion and $10 billion.
After two days of discussions here with Egyptian and Syrian officials, the visiting Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, said his country would give Egypt $1 billion in grants and $500 million to finance development projects.
 
Increasing Oil Production
 The announcement reflected the way the Saudis are diverting some of its gains from increased oil production and prices to bankroll America's Arab allies against Iraq. Saudi Arabia has increased oil production to meet the shortfall in world markets caused by the invasion of Kuwait, while the crisis has driven up prices. It has thus increased its oil revenues by several billion dollars a year, according to Egyptian estimates.
Saudi Arabia is reported by diplomats in Damascus to have given "substantial" aid, possibly $1 billion, to Syria in return for the Syrian commitment of an armored division of 15,000 men and 300 tanks to the anti-Iraq buildup.
The latest announcement of Saudi aid to Egypt coincides, diplomats said, with the final stage of preparations for the deployment of an armored division that will reinforce Cairo's position as the biggest Arab contributor to the massing of forces in Saudi Arabia.
Since concluding its peace treaty with Israel in 1979, Egypt has received billions of dollars worth of American military aid, and large amounts of heavy military equipment, including tanks and armored personnel carriers. Diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity said the Egyptian armored division would leave soon for Saudi Arabia.
 
Economic Losses for Cairo
 Cairo's close association with the policy aims of both the United States and the so-called moderate Arab camp it leads has brought economic windfalls to offset the country's losses both from its profound economic malaise and from the gulf crisis.
According to official estimates, Egypt's revenues from tourism are down 65 percent, revenues from Suez Canal traffic are down 20 percent, and remittances from one million Egyptian workers in Iraq and Kuwait are down by half. The combined loss of revenue is estimated at $4.5 billion.

HEADLINE: Curb Sought On Investing

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions could effectively be barred from investing in certain mortgage-backed securities considered high risk by Federal regulators, according to a draft proposal obtained yesterday.
The move, which has been expected for some months, could force the banks, savings and loans and credit unions either to sell the securities or to price them at the present market value, which could take a big bite out of their balance sheets. 
 A board of Federal regulators -- the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council -- is to meet tomorrow to consider adopting the proposed policy. The council consists of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Thrift Supervision, Comptroller of the Currency and National Credit Union Administration.
Prices of some of the securities, held by banks and savings institutions for investment, have already been under pressure because of fears of just such restrictions.
According to the draft proposal, stripped mortgage-backed securities and certain types of collateralized mortgage obligation installments "are not suitable investments for the vast majority of depository institutions."
In a stripped security, principal and interest payments are divided into different securities. Considered very volatile, a stripped security moves sharply higher or lower as interest rates and the economy change.
A collateralized mortgage obligation is a bond that represents a bundle of home mortgages. The types of C.M.O.'s considered high-risk include those with a higher share of prepayment or interest rate risk than the underlying mortgages, the draft said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Trading in Dollar Is Mixed On Gulf and Economic News

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar turned in a mixed performance yesterday as foreign exchange traders watched the Middle East situation and the United States economy.
"The markets are still very nervous about peace, war, peace, war," and the dollar has fluctuated accordingly, said Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager with the Bank of New York Company.
 
Gains in Europe
 The dollar advanced against most major currrencies in Europe after Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d reiterated demands for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait. 
 Mr. Baker told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the United States would strike "suddenly, massively and decisively" if military force was needed to remove Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
The dollar has gained in recent weeks amid signs that Middle East tensions were increasing. But it has also fallen as those tensions seemed to ease or as the markets had second thoughts about the seriousness of the situation.
The dollar generally advances during international turmoil because investors view it as a safe currency. But the dollar was held down yesterday by the faltering United States economy and the belief that American interest rates would fall.
A Federal Reserve survey released yesterday showed the economy in all regions of the United States was either declining or growing sluggishly at the end of November.
Traders believe the Fed will be forced to lower interest rates. That would be a negative for the dollar, which like all currencies is supported by higher rates.
In New York trading, the dollar advanced against the British pound and the Japanese yen.
Sterling fell to $1.9260 in New York, from $1.92925 late Tuesday. In earlier London trading, the pound fell to $1.9225, from $1.9350.The pound is also facing the prospects of lower interest rates.
The dollar rose to 133.63 yen in New York, from 133.30 late Tuesday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar fell 0.93 yen, to 133.42, and it was quoted later in London at a higher rate of 133.95 yen.
Japan, which imports nearly all its oil, would be particularly vulnerable should war break out in the Middle East.
The dollar fell, however, against the German currency, closing at 1.49925 marks, from 1.5030 late Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's prices, included: 1.2795 Swiss francs, down from 1.2825; 5.0770 French francs, down from 5.0825; 1,127.685 Italian lire, down from 1,129.25, and 1.16295 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16325.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
Political Cost of Victory Questioned

 BODY:
The Bush Administration's decision to open talks with Baghdad follows a chorus of warnings about the potentially high political cost of a military victory over Iraq.
In recent weeks, some who had privately counseled the Administration against precipitous military action -- military and Middle East analysts, Foreign Service officers in the field and some Arab offiicials -- have expressed their concerns publicly. 
 There are few who doubt that if there is war in the Persian Gulf, the United States and its allies can "turn Baghdad into a parking lot," as an American diplomat in the Middle East recently put it. But many analysts are increasingly concerned about the probable effect of such a victory on longer-term American interests in the region.
William Crowe, a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned last week that "many Arabs would deeply resent a campaign that would necessarily kill large numbers of their Muslim brothers and force them to choose sides between Arab nations and the West."
 
Losing 'Even if We Win'
 "Even if we win," he concluded in testimony before a Senate committee, "we lose ground in the Arab world and generally injure our ability to deal in the future with the labyrinth of the Middle East."
His words have been echoed in many Arab capitals, even in Cairo, whose Government supports American policy and has sent 20,000 troops to join the multinational force in Saudi Arabia.
"Who can live with 100,000 Iraqi deaths in the Arab world?" asked Taseen Bashir, a former Egyptian official, articulating what other officials have said in private. "Of course, Saddam Hussein is a terrible man who did an unacceptable thing that must and will be reversed, probably through sanctions within 9 to 12 months. But what's the rush?"
Mr. Bashir said few Egyptians, irrespective of political orientation, "want a war in which Egyptians will kill Arabs with the Americans."
For Egypt, a war would mean Egyptians killing Egyptians, since some of the one million Egyptians living in Iraq are serving in the Iraqi armed forces. But Mr. Bashir and others argued that Egyptians would accept war if they were persuaded that diplomatic and economic sanctions had failed.
 
Feeling of Humiliation
 Another factor that would dilute the political value of an American military victory, Arab analysts maintain, is the Arab world's strong feeling of humiliation at the hands of the West. Nowhere is this more potent than in Algeria.
"We are a wounded people," said Sid Ahmed Ghozali, Algeria's Foreign Minister. "We lived under French domination for 130 years. Every 20 or 30 years or so, there was an uprising. When Algeria had only 10 million people, France had a million soldiers here. By the time we got our independence, one in six Algerians had died fighting."
"So how do you think Algerians will react to thousands of Iraqi deaths once again at the hands of the West, this time the Americans aided by the French and a few Arabs for window dressing?" he asked.
This attitude is shared in other Arab countries, especially those that have suffered defeats in wars with Israel, which is seen as America's proxy.
 
Damage to New Democracies
 A new Arab humiliation would not only promote political instability by strengthening extremist, anti-Western forces, many of them religious, but also jeopardize the nascent democratic movements in Jordan, Algeria, Yemen, and Tunisia, officials in those countries predicted in recent interviews.
The largely Palestinian majority in Jordan might rise up against the King they now claim to support, an official said. All agreed that a war would probably make the Palestinians, among the most Westernized of Arabs, even more deeply anti-American.
"You can flatten Iraq," said Mohammed Milhem, a Palestine Liberation Organization official in Amman, Jordan. "But no American plane will be safe in the sky, and you will need five bodyguards for every American in the Mideast."
Those who see war ultimately as the only means of prying Mr. Hussein out of Kuwait recalled that many of the same bleak predictions about the consequences of using force were made before the United States bombed Libya in 1986 in retaliation for terrorism. But other than the requisite condemnations from the Arab League and many Arab capitals, the raid had few adverse consequences for Washington.
But Arab critics of United States policy counter that Libya is not Iraq, and that Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the quixotic Libyan leader whom few Arabs fear or respect, is not Saddam Hussein. The bombing of Libya did not split the Arab world, but the gulf crisis has already divided the Arabs and shattered the Arab League. A war seen as premature or unnecessary would further polarize the Arab states.
Bernard Lewis, a leading Western scholar of Islam, stressed that limiting what he termed "psychic damage" to the Arabs should war come depended in part on changing the image of the impending conflict.
 
Iraqi Emigres Cited
 "Where is the Iraqi opposition, and why haven't the United States and its allies been more active in encouraging the one million Iraqi emigres to play a role?" Mr. Lewis asked.
He asserted that the political effect of a war would be quite different if the conflict was not seen as "America versus Iraq, but as Iraqis attempting to liberate their country by getting rid of Saddam Hussein."
A second way of diminishing the perception among Arabs that the crisis is a conflict between Iraq and the United States, he said, is to insist on maximum visibility for the Arabs allied with the United States. "And all talk of Americans staying on in the region should be avoided," Mr. Lewis said.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
Turkish Leader Sees Chance To Avert War Against Iraq

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, Dec. 5

 BODY:
President Turgut Ozal of Turkey said tonight that as a result of the United Nations Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq, there was a "big chance" now of averting a Persian Gulf war.
Mr. Ozal, whose country was an early and vital participant in the embargo against neighboring Iraq, also argued that economic sanctions were working, at least to the extent that they may "soften" Baghdad's military capacity in the event of a war. 
 But he implied in an interview that he was not fully persuaded that sanctions alone would force President Saddam Hussein to withdraw his troops from Kuwait, and said the anti-Iraq coalition had to stand firm. Turkey, for its part, was ready to take any necessary steps to protect its borders, he said.
"I think if President Saddam Hussein has logic, even a little logic, he should pull out of Kuwait," Mr. Ozal said, speaking in English. But he added: "That does not mean there will be no war. The other side has to be very straight: there will be a war if he does not pull out of Kuwait."
 
Intense Public Debate
 What Turkey's own next steps against Iraq might be has been a subject of intense public debate, with Mr. Ozal standing squarely in the middle.
On Monday, he was reported by a leading newspaper to have told aides that Turkey should sent a symbolic military force to Saudi Arabia, and, if war does break out, allow the United States to use an important NATO air base in southern Turkey. Washington reportedly has encouraged new Turkish measures to apply additional pressure on Iraq.
A close associate of Mr. Ozal confirmed that the news article had accurately reflected the Turkish leader's basic thinking. In addition, a senior official said the Americans undoubtedly would be given access to the air base, known as Incirlik, and that the only question was whether it would be for limited logistical operations or full-fledged strikes against Iraq.
"Incirlik will be used: that is clear," the official said. "One must be a realist."
 
A Considerable Stir
 The news report, however, touched off a considerable press stir in Turkey, where many people say they have already done more than enough by shutting down Iraqi oil pipelines that run across southern Turkey, by enforcing the economic embargo and by bolstering troop strength on the border with Iraq.
Mr. Ozal has personally come under attack from domestic critics who charged him with exceeding his constitutional authority and with being overeager to increase Turkey's military role. The dispute took on a new dimension this week when the chief of the Turkish armed forces suddenly resigned in what appeared to be a multilayered protest that included unhappiness over the direction of the country's gulf policy.
In the interview tonight, Mr. Ozal took a very cautious stand. Insisting that his position had been misrepresented by the Turkish press, he said no decision had been reached about what Turkey might do next. He also asserted that the Government was not hampered by internal dissent, that he had acted so far within constitutional limits and that his country had made "a very substantial contribution" that should be appreciated by its coalition partners.
 
More Strength on Border
 "I think the Government has the possibility of sending troops, but as far as I know it is not decided," he said. But he continued: "I think also that no troops are going to be sent because what is the benefit if you send a small detachment?"
Instead, he argued that it made more sense to augment Turkey's military presence on its own border with Iraq. Turkish troop strength there has been increased in recent months by about 50 percent, to 100,000, but Mr. Ozal said it was not clear that this number would be further increased.
The Turks face serious choices in figuring out how involved they should become in the next phase of the crisis. On the one hand, it is axiomatic here that no good can come from an entanglement in Arab disputes. The military and Foreign Ministry bureaucracies have been particularly cautious, and some news commentators interpret the resignation of the armed forces chief as a warning from the entire army leadership against going too far.
But on the other hand, some officials worry that a peaceful solution could leave Mr. Hussein in power, and that would leave them with a next-door neighbor of proven danger. So while Turkey may not want to join a war, they argue, it might need someone else to fight a war to rid them of this menace.
"Let's suppose Saddam withdraws from Kuwait," one official said. "That's the worst scenario for us."
 
'Let Them Worry'
 "We have no problem with the Iraqi people," he added. "But we would not like to see Saddam come out of this with any benefits, or that he remain in power, or that he remain on this earth, to be blunt about it."
Mr. Ozal, however, argued in the interview that any future danger from Mr. Hussein would threaten the gulf oil states and industrialized nations even more than Turkey. "Let them worry, not only us," he said.
But he also said Turkey had a stake in any post-crisis settlement, and its main interest was that Iraq's borders remain intact.
"There should be no change in geography," he said. "There should be no separate state in any part of Iraq." This was an apparent reference to suggestions that had been raised that Kurdish zones in northern Iraq be turned into a separate state. Any creation of a Kurdish state would be strongly resisted by Turkey, which has a sizable Kurdish population of its own in the country's southeast.

HEADLINE: Change of Administrations Unsettles Hartford Appointees

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 5

 BODY:
For hundreds of men and women who shaped the 10-year administration of Gov. William A. O'Neill as commissioners, agency heads and executive assistants, the end of power that will come with his retirement next month is shaping up to be neither clean nor painless.
With Mr. O'Neill's long years in office ending on a pronounced sour note for the state's economy, the white-collar jobs in insurance and banking that might have beckoned these appointees in better times must now be sought out and sometimes fought over. 
 And with an unpredictable, independent governor-elect, Lowell P. Weicker Jr., taking office on a pledge to create a hybrid government of Republicans, Democrats and non-political experts chosen on merit alone, some people are not sure that the party is over.
Mr. Weicker, a former Republican, was forced under state law to gave up his party membership after his election last month as a third-party candidate. He has already appointed one Democrat, and a close O'Neill associate at that, William J. Cibes Jr., to be his budget director. He has said he might appoint more Democrats and reappoint some now in office.
 
So Many Unknowns
 The result is a recipe for anxiety: Do you stay in place, trying to look indispensable, and hope for reappointment? Do you leap for what jobs in industry can be had and thus get an edge? Or do you transfer to the Civil Service, and thus stay in government by abandoning the ladder of executive promotions that can lead to the top?
"I don't think anybody approaches this with great ease," said John E. Saunders, a deputy commissioner at the State Labor Department.
Mr. Saunders, a 45-year-old former director of the Hartford Urban League, is one of those who hopes to hang onto his job. He has sent his resume to Mr. Weicker's transition team. But like most remaining O'Neill officials, Mr. Saunders is keeping his options open, and his mouth closed about them.
"In more secure times, people would be more willing to talk about it," he said. But with so much economic and political uncertainty, "you do try and keep the options you've explored fairly close to the vest."
 Some officials have already abandoned ship. Mr. O'Neill's Commissioner of Economic Development, Stephen B. Heintz, left in October to become deputy director of an Eastern European democracy training group based in Prague. The Governor's press secretary, Jon Sandberg, left for a corporate public-relations job.
Others are said to be close to taking new jobs, but with so many unknowns about what Mr. Weicker may or may not do, few want to appear committed to leaving.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Weicker, Avice A. Meehan, said that an initial pool of "more than 100" appointments would be made over the next few months, but Mr. Weicker has declined to even talk about how many current O'Neill officials might be retained.
Over the four-year term, Ms. Meehan said, about 2,000 appointees are expected to be named to the state's various boards, commissions and departments. More than 1,200 resumes have been received since Mr. Weicker's election.
Part of the tone of Connecticut's change in government results from the fact that Mr. O'Neill made that many appointments and more in his two-and-a-half terms, and thus has thousands of people who linked their lives and careers in some way to his.
Sworn in as chief executive after Gov. Ella T. Grasso resigned in ill-health in 1980, Mr. O'Neill was elected in 1982, then re-elected in 1986. He decided this spring not to run again. As governor, he appointed or reappointed every sitting judge in the state. Since all judges serve eight-year terms, Mr. O'Neill's bench will linger long into the 1990's.
He was also credited -- after a series of scandals early in his administration -- with seeking out professionals for some appointments that in past administrations might have been awarded on the basis of loyalty. The Commissioner of Correction, for example, Larry R. Meachum, was hired after a nationwide search in 1987 to run the state's expanding prison system.
There is also simple longevity: The Democrats have controlled the governor's office for 36 of the last 40 years, including the 16 years since the election of Mrs. Grasso. By the time Mr. O'Neill leaves office, he will be the longest serving governor since Jonathan Trumbull 2d, who left office in 1809. The passing of Mr. O'Neill's generation of politicians is the end of a group of Democrats who rose to power in the 1950's and 1960's.
 
'A Great Deal of Uncertainty'
 For those caught between administrations and eras, there has been some help. Mr. O'Neill's chief of staff, David J. McQuade, has coordinated transfers into other branches of government for secretaries and clerks on the Governor's staff. The Department of Administrative Services conducted a series of "career transition" seminars aimed at improving appointees' job-search skills. But not everyone is eager to look like a job hunter.
"There's great uncertainty now as to who is going to go and who is going to stay, and some people are reluctant to declare that they may be in the job market," said J. Robert Tank, vice president of Lee Hecht Harrison Inc., a job placement firm that coordinated the seminars. "They haven't availed themselves of this help."
Even for those trying to transfer to the Civil Service, the confidence level is not high.
William K. Seymour, an executive assistant in the Department of Administrative Services, turned in his competitive examination to become a civil service press spokesman -- technically, a senior information-services officer -- on Nov. 9 and is still awaiting word. He said he had no guarantee that a decision would be made on the examination before the Department's Commissioner, Stephen J. Negri, leaves office.
 
Still Is Eager to Serve
 Another former appointee trying to make the transition, Matthew J. Broder, said his Civil Service examination would not even be submitted until this Friday. Mr. Broder, a former public affairs officer in the governor's office, transferred this spring to the Department of Economic Development as director of the international division on a temporary basis. Because of personnel department timetables, however, a Weicker appointee will undoubtedly make the final judgment on whether he gets to keep the job, Mr. Broder said.
As for Mr. O'Neill, a 60-year-old former tavern owner who sold the family bar several years ago, the Governor said he would be eager to serve in some appointed volunteer or advisory position, "if called upon" by Mr. Weicker, but that his years of elective office were behind him. Hobbies will mostly have to be developed. "I used to fish a little," Mr. O'Neill said.
Howard G. Rifkin, a soft-spoken lawyer who has worked for Mr. O'Neill since the first days of the administration, said he would probably land on his feet. But he said that two of the three job possibilities before him involve a cut in pay from the $81,000 he receives as legal counsel to the Governor, and none of them is a sure bet. He also recently turned 40.
"I get to have a mid-life crisis in a depressed economy," he said.

HEADLINE: Fed Survey Says Slump Has Spread

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Business activity "appears to have declined recently" in much of the country, according to a Federal Reserve survey released today. That is a marked erosion from mid-October, when most of the central bank's 12 districts were still reporting an expansion, albeit a slow one.
The new findings, based heavily on anecdotal information collected through Thanksgiving, were consistent with a wide array of statistics published in recent weeks that many regard as conclusively demonstrating the onset of a recession. Reports on industrial output, construction, employment and sales of cars and homes have all brought negative news. 
 At the same time, today's report, known as the beige book, did include spotty signs of strength, particularly for exports and agriculture. It was also reassuring in its finding that the sharp increases in oil prices since August were having only a minimal impact on inflation.
"None of the districts report significant wage pressures," said the survey, written this time by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. "Several districts report expectations of discounting by retailers this Chistmas season in the face of weak demand."
Subdued inflation, many analysts maintain, could enable the Fed's Open Market Committee to decide at its Dec. 17-18 meeting that it can afford to take further steps to ease monetary policy in an effort to counter the downturn. Some, in fact, say the Fed, which eased credit on Tuesday by cutting some bank-reserve requirements, could move again even sooner than midmonth, if the job figures to be released on Friday are sufficiently worrisome.
The expectation is that the unemployment rate, now standing at 5.7 percent, will approach 6 percent in the report for November.
"Business conditions are somewhat mixed in different parts of the country but on balance display a weaker pattern," today's survey said in summary. "In many of the Federal Reserve districts, economic activity appears to have declined recently, while it has remained sluggish or grown slowly in the rest."
 
Sales Are Sluggish
 Retail sales, it added, have fallen below year-earlier levels, after adjusting for inflation, in nearly all districts, and manufacturing conditions "have weakened in most."
Sales of durable goods, particularly automobiles, have been hard hit, though the Dallas district reported that auto sales were "rebounding" after several weak months and that department store sales were rising "mildly."
Even within individual districts the findings were not uniformly negative. In Philadelphia, for example, industrial activity continued to decline in November and the general outlook among manufacturers was "dim" but expectations about the severity of the downturn "appeared to be diminishing a bit," the Fed reported. Some companies, in fact, indicated that business was improving last month "in contrast to early fall when there were virtually no manufacturers experiencing improvement."
 
 Mixed Report on New York
 Conditions in the New York district were described as "soft to mixed" with merchants "rather pessimistic" about holiday sales. But a pickup in office leasing in Manhattan brought down the primary vacancy rate.
Most respondents in the Cleveland district, where manufacturing has been relatively strong, said their region was not currently in recession, and one supplier to the heavy-duty truck industry said conditions have improved in recent months.
Exports, aided by the weak dollar, were particularly robust in the Richmond district, with timber from West Virginia a standout.
Business activity in the San Francisco district was described as sluggish, with the Pacific Northwest posting relatively strong retail trade.

HEADLINE: U.S. Acts to Assure Safety of Alaska Pipeline

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Concerned about continuing discoveries of corrosion problems along the Alaska pipeline, the United States Department of Transportation has formed an umbrella group of state and Federal regulators to review and coordinate pipeline safety efforts and "avoid potential disaster," a department statement said Tuesday.
The department realized such a step was needed after the disastrous Exxon Valdez oil spill in March 1989, said Russell A. Rockwell, a Transportaion Department spokesman. The timing of the announcement was not related to recent allegations of shoddy inspections of the pipeline or the discovery last month of a leaky seal that was to keep moisture off the pipeline surface, Mr. Rockwell said. But, he added, "The project will focus on corrosion that has been found on the Trans-Alaska system."
 
Focus to Be Corrosion
 In a telephone interview today, he said, "It will look at other things as well, but the primary focus is the pipeline corrosion." 
 The Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, operator of the pipeline that carries a quarter of the oil produced in the United States, has come under criticism over the past several years for not taking steps earlier to slow the spread of external rust and internal corrosion that has been building since the pipeline's completion in 1977. Plans to increase pressure in the line to bring more oil to the port of Valdez to be shipped to refineries have been put on hold because of fears that the line was too damaged to handle the load.
Last year, Alyeska, owned by seven producers of North Slope oil, embarked on a five-year $800 million program to repair rusted sections and intensify its inspections.
 
 Repair Plan With Problems
 But that program itself has been troubled.
The latest problem was the surprise discovery of moisture inside a steel sleeve covering a section of line that was repaired this summer. The discovery came after nine sections of the pipeline were unearthed to investigate allegations that a contractor testing for rust had used poorly trained workers.
The moisture in the repair sleeve at Atigun Pass is a new safety concern for the agencies monitoring pipeline operations, said David Vickery, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Land Management.
The water could exacerbate corrosion problems, Mr. Vickery said, and is one reason why officials are not allowing greater pipeline pressures to meet the increased demand for oil.
The joint Federal-state panel was formed to "avoid potential disaster" that could occur if the rust-weakened pipeline burst, according the statement prepared by Travis P. Dungan, head of the Transportation Department's Research and Special Programs Administration.
In addition to rust and corrosion, the group will examine how well the pipeline operators are protecting the environment, and whether plans are adequate in the event of a spill.
Mr. Rockwell said the review panel would have an indefinite life and be charged with coordinating the Federal and state agencies with oversight over the pipeline, though it will not investigate the Federal and state regulators' performance. "We think we've done a more than adequate job," Mr. Rockewell said.
 
 Increase in Pressure Sought
 To make up for the reduction in oil supplies as a result of the Middle East crisis, Alyeska is seeking permission from state and Federal regulators to increase pipeline pressure so that the daily output could maintained at 2.1 million barrels daily without the use of expensive compounds that must be put in the oil to reduce friction. Alyeska is presently pumping that amount but says it is not economical because of the cost of the friction-reducing compounds.
"We would not be inclined to give our approval to that request, certainly not till we have a couple weeks to go over the data," Mr. Vickery said.
 
 Eight Miles of New Pipe
 Marnie Isaacs, a spokeswoman for Alyeska, said engineers did not believe the moisture problem was serious because the water was not free-flowing. In any event, she said the suspect repair sleeve, along with 41 others, would be replaced next year when eight and a half miles of new pipe is laid in the Atigun Pass area in the most extensive reconstruction of the line since its opening.
At 4,740 feet, Atigun Pass in the Brooks Range is the highest point of the line and the location of the pipe's highest internal pressure, the work of Pump Station 4 as it boosts heated crude over the top. It is also one of the most severely corroded section of the pipeline, though officials say there is no immediate danger of the pipeline bursting.
When short sections of the pipeline are repaired, the steel sleeves covering the weakened pipe are usually welded shut at both ends. However, the eight-foot and longer structural sleeves used at Atigun Pass were not sealed with welds because engineers feared the rigidity of the longer lengths could cause the pipeline to buckle. A sealing compound was used instead to block water.
But the seal in one of the sleeves was broken, perhaps by a rock, and officials wonder how many more buried sleeves might be wet, Ms. Isaacs said.
The moisture inside the sleeve was accidently discovered when officials reinspected 19 sections of the pipeline that had been tested for rust last summer by Thorpe Technical Services of Anchorage.
The investigation was prompted by allegations of a former Thorpe employee, Edward Thompson, that his co-workers were not properly trained in the equipment and methods to discover rust spots and cracks. Mr. Thompson also said that on-the-job drug and alcohol use was common among his fellow workers.
Dale Thorpe, the president of the company, denied the allegations and has threatened to sue Mr. Thompson.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
Excerpts From Remarks by Webster and Baker on Embargo's Drain on Iraq

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks by William H. Webster, Director of Central Intelligence, before the House Armed Services Committee today, and from Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d's appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today, as recorded by The New York Times:
 
WEBSTER STATEMENT
 Despite mounting disruptions and hardships resulting from sanctions, Saddam apparently believes that he can outlast international resolve to maintain sanctions. We see no indication that Saddam is concerned at this point that domestic discontent is growing to levels that may threaten his regime or that problems resulting from the sanctions are causing him to rethink his policy on Kuwait. The Iraqi people have experienced considerable deprivation in the past. Given the brutal nature of the Iraqi security services, the population is not likely to oppose Saddam openly. Our judgment has been, and continues to be, that there is no assurance or guarantee that economic hardships will compel Saddam to change his policies or lead to internal unrest that would threaten his regime. . . . 
 The blockade and embargo have worked more effectively than Saddam probably expected. More than 90 percent of imports and 97 percent of exports have been shut off. Although there is smuggling across Iraq's borders, it is extremely small relative to Iraq's precrisis trade. Iraqi efforts to break sanctions have thus far been largely unsuccessful. . . .
Industry appears to be the hardest-hit sector so far. Many firms are finding it difficult to cope with the departure of foreign workers and with the cutoff of imported industrial inputs -- which comprised nearly 60 percent of Iraq's total imports prior to the invasion. These shortages have either shut down or severely curtailed production by a variety of industries, including many light industrial and assembly plants as well as the country's only tire-manufacturing plant.
Despite these shutdowns, the most vital industries -- including electric power generation and refining -- do not yet appear threatened. We believe they will be able to function for some time because domestic consumption has been reduced, because Iraqi and Kuwaiti facilities have been cannibalized and because some stockpiles and surpluses already existed.
The cutoff of Iraq's oil exports and the success of sanctions also have choked off Baghdad's financial resources. This too has been more effective and more complete than Saddam probably expected. In fact, we believe that a lack of foreign exchange will, in time, be Iraq's greatest economic difficulty. The embargo has deprived Baghdad of roughly $1.5 billion of foreign-exchange earnings monthly. . . .
 
Iraqi Food and Economy
 We believe Baghdad's actions to forestall shortages of food stocks, including rationing, encouraging smuggling and promoting agricultural production are adequate for the next several months. The full harvest of fruits and vegetables is injecting new supplies into the market, and will provide a psychological as well as tangible respite from mounting pressures. The Iraqi population in general has access to sufficient staple foods. Other food stocks still not rationed also remain available. However, the variety is diminishing and prices are sharply inflated. For example, sugar purchased on the open market at the official exchange rate went from $32 per 50 kilogram bag in August, to $580 per bag last month.
But these hardships are easier for Iraqis to endure than the combination of economic distress, high casualty rates and repeated missile and air attacks that Iraqis lived with during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. During this war, incidentally, there was not a single significant public disturbance, even though casualties hit 2.3 percent of the total Iraqi population -- about the same as the percentage of U.S. casualties during the Civil War.
Looking ahead, the economic picture changes somewhat. We expect Baghdad's foreign-exchange reserves to become extremely tight, leaving it little cash left with which to entice potential sanctions-busters. At current rates of depletion, we estimate Iraq will have nearly depleted its available foreign-exchange reserves by next spring. Able to obtain even fewer key imports, Iraq's economic problems will begin to multiply as Baghdad is forced to gradually shut down growing numbers of facilities in order to keep critical activities functioning as long as possible. Economic conditions will be noticeably worse and Baghdad will find allocating scarce resources a significantly more difficult task.
Probably only energy-related and some military industries will still be functioning by next spring. This will almost certainly be the case by next summer. . . .
 
Effects on Military
 By next spring Iraqis will have made major changes in their diets. . . . But we expect that Baghdad will be able to maintain grain consumption, mainly wheat, barley, and rice, at about two-thirds of last year's level until the next harvest in May.
Although sanctions are hurting Iraq's civilian economy, they are affecting the Iraqi military only at the margins. Iraq's fairly static defensive posture will reduce wear and tear on the military equipment and as a result, extend the life of its inventory of spare parts and maintenance items. Under noncombat conditions, Iraq ground and air forces can probably maintain near-current levels of readiness for as long as nine months.
We expect the Iraqi Air Force to feel the effects of sanctions more quickly and to a greater degree than the Iraqi ground forces because of its greater reliance on high technology and foreign equipment and technicians. Major repairs to sophisticated aircraft like the F-1 will be achieved with significant difficulty, if at all, because of the exodus of foreign technicians. Iraqi technicians, however, should be able to maintain current levels of aircraft sorties for three to six months.
The Iraqi ground forces are more immune to sanctions. Before the invasion, Baghdad maintained large inventories of basic military supplies, such as ammunition, and supplies probably remain adequate.
 
BAKER QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 SENATOR JOSEPH R. BIDEN Jr.: The Administration appears -- not appears, in my view has -- shifted to a new policy based on the premises -- the premise that sanctions will not work and that an early resort to offensive action may be necessary.
In essence, Mr. Secretary, I'd like to hear you explain why you've abandoned what you told this committee just three months ago. You said that the sanctions policy is, quote, the only peaceful path to meeting the objective set by the President. You continued by stating, quote, What we ask most of the American people is to stand firm, be patient and remain united, end of quote.
My question today is, Mr. Secretary, can you provide this committee with a compelling case that the international coalition will not hold? . . .
BAKER: I don't think that there are -- there are reservations with respect to some of the forces of nations that have symbolic presences in the gulf -- ships and that sort of thing. But for the most part, those that are on the ground, Senator Biden, are quite prepared if the -- if the option of force is resorted to, to move to the same degree and extent that the United States is -- the majority of them.
One of the most important questions that will arise in this whole -- in all of these hearings -- Armed Services and Foreign Relations -- as indicated by the statement the committee made when they called the hearings. And the question was: What is -- essentially, what is the workability of economic sanctions? . . . Clearly, everyone I know would prefer to see sanctions work. There is no one that I know that wants to see a resort to the force option. As I've said before, though, and as I said in the statement, I've said it a number of times in the past and I reiterated it today in the formal statement, nobody can every tell you that sanctions alone will force Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.
And, Senator, I have to tell you I am personally very pessimistic that they will. This pessimism, I would also share with you, is shared by our recent intelligence estimates.
The four months of experience we have is not particularly encouraging. I've already said we know he's willing to starve his army. We've made the point in the past that Iraq has the capability of improving its agricultural production significantly. And you made the very valid point just now, Senator, that yes, indeed, there are some exemptions in the UN resolutions that permit the importation of food for humanitarian purposes. So I grant you that that is a consideration as well.
It's just our view that he is not going to retreat just because we've cut off his oil exports or just because we have cut off his financial exchange. His whole history as a dictator makes it clear that he is not uncomfortable in imposing extraordinary sacrifices on the people of Iraq.
Q. Would you answer the question? Who in the coalition will not hold? . . .
A. I'm not going to predict weakness on the part of our coalition partners in an open session, Senator.
 
Withdrawal and Defeat
SENATOR PAUL S. SARBANES: I do not agree with your statement on page seven that this is not a new strategy, but rather a continuation and reinforcement of the strategy we have been pursuing. I think two days after the election, the Administrationundertook a new strategy. And I asked you, how long after you had an offensive force in the area, perceived to be capable of mounting an offensive attack, could you go without using it. . . . Would you not agree that if this huge force assembled in Saudi Arabia were to go home a few months later without having achieved the objective of forcing Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, that it would have suffered defeat?
There was a story in the paper yesterday that Saddam Hussein was closed off and he never got conflicting advice. And it's been suggested, in fact, that if you go out to see him, that's one of the things that will be accomplished. But I'm increasingly concerned that perhaps something of the same sort is taking place within our own Administration.
A. Let me say, Senator, that right out my windowat the State Department I look every day at Arlington National Cemetery, and I understand very, very well what's at stake here, and I think the President of the United States understands very, very well. And that's why we have gone about it in a way that I think the term persevere would apply to. We have not been precipitous. We have not been reckless. Indeed, we have solicited. In terms of consultation, there's been more consultation on this issue I think than ever before on anything that I'm aware of. As far as the Congress is concerned, the President has met seven times; I have been up here 11; the Secretary of Defense has been up here 12. This is a very serious matter.
 
Reasoning and Waiting
SENATOR JOHN KERRY: . . . I think that we're missing a point of what is
dividing the country and what is so much at issue here. You talked today about endless sanctions, and Secretary Cheney keeps using the concept that we can't allow sanctions to go on forever. And you've talked about misinterpreting our resolve. And it seems to me that -- I haven't heard anybody talking about endless sanctions. You put it this morning in the context of, Let me express my pessimism, versus your optimism. I don't think it's a question of pessimism versus optimism in the application of sanctions. I think it's a question of how reasonable people make a judgment.
What I fear is that while you talk about the cost of waiting, as Secretary McNamara yesterday talked about the cost of not waiting, and that the cost of one week of war may be far, far greater than the cost of several more months of exhausting the possibilities so that Americans will come together united and say, We did everything and now we have no other choice.
 A. I have alluded to the intelligence assessments that we have, I have mentioned the fact - if I haven't, I want to - that we follow these sanctions very closely, interagency and with other governments. We follow them through the intelligence community, we follow them through our presence of other countries in Baghdad . . . But if you delay too long, the costs of dealing with the problem could be much greater later.
 
An Oil Field's Role
 SENATOR FRANK H. MURKOWSKI: If there is any other way out, if Saddam Hussein clearly considers alternatives, then, of course, the question of what has been thrown out from time to time as, perhaps, an alternative consideration . . . It continues to come up in considering, you know, the alternative of warfare.
 A. Senator, I don't want silence to go - to be interpreted as assent here, so I have to respond to that by saying we have to be - we have to be very careful --
 MURKOWSKI: I understand that.
 BAKER: When we're dealing with as important an issue and principle as we are here that we do not - do not lend credence to the suggestion that somehow an aggressor can be rewarded --
MURKOWSKI: I understand.
 BAKER: For his aggression.
 MURKOWSKI: But by the same --
 BAKER: We're talking about a new world order that would operate on a different principle, entirely.
 MURKOWSKI: We're also talking about an alternative of warfare that could be very devastating and we both share in that concern --
 BAKER: Yes, sir.

HEADLINE: Court Extends 'Family' Rule To Rent-Stabilized Units

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
A landmark ruling that protects the remaining member of an unmarried couple from being evicted from a rent-controlled apartment if one partner dies or moves was extended by a New York State appeals court on Tuesday to cover all of the one million rent-stabilized apartments in the state.
"It's a huge victory for over one million rent-regulated tenants across the state," said Alan Hamerman, a spokesman for the State Commissioner of Housing and Community Renewal, Angelo J. Aponte. 
 The rules will insure, for the first time, Mr. Hamerman continued, that elderly people, gay couples and others sharing apartments "receive the full blanket of protection as set forth in the rent laws."
 
'A More Realistic' View
 The unanimous ruling by four judges in the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court -- First Department, which covers Manhattan and the Bronx, overturned an injunction issued by a court in Albany in November 1989. The lower court had barred the state housing agency from putting into effect new regulations extending what is known as the Braschi decision from rent-controlled to rent-stabilized apartments. The injunction had been sought by the Rent Stabilization Association, an organization representing landlords.
In the Braschi case -- brought by the surviving member of a gay couple in Manhattan -- the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, said in July 1989: "We conclude that the term family," as used in laws governing the state's estimated 160,000 rent-controlled apartments, "should not be rigidly restricted to those people who have formalized their relationship by obtaining, for instance, a marriage certificate or an adoption order."
"In the context of eviction," the ruling added, "a more realistic, and certainly equally valid, view of a family includes two adult lifetime partners whose relationship is long term and characterized by an emotional and financial commitment and interdependence." Gay-rights advocates have hailed that decision as a step toward legalization of their relationships.
 
An Appeal Is Planned
 In its ruling on Tuesday, the Appellate Division said, "Since the new regulations incorporate the Braschi definition of 'family' into the existing scheme, they do not conflict with Real Property Law."
It also said, "By responding to the continuing shortage of low- and middle-income housing units available, the rise in instances of individuals 'doubling up' and tenants being forced into a homeless situation due to unaffordable rents, the regulations clearly comport with the broad mandate provided the Division of Housing and Community Renewal by the Legislature to 'protect tenants and the public interest.' "
William Rubenstein, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's lesbian and gay-rights project, which was a party to the case, said: "These state regulations are really the first we know of in the country in which a statewide authority has defined family in a such broad, meaningful and realistic manner, including the recognition of lesbian and gay families. The fact that these regulations have withstood judicial scrutiny is an important milestone."
The president of the Rent Stabilization Association, John Gilbert, said he was "disappointed but not surprised" by the ruling.
"We will appeal," Mr. Gilbert said.
But the state's highest court does not necessarily have to hear an appeal. Mr. Gilbert, however, said he thought it would. "The Court of Appeals has always held sacred the fact that a lease is a contract," he said. "In Braschi, it was a rent-controlled situation, and there was no lease. But this is a rent-stabilized situation, and you've got a lease between two people."

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
The Collapse Of a Coalition

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
The bipartisan coalition in support of President Bush's policy in the Persian Gulf, which developed cracks last week with the defection of an influential Democratic Senator, Sam Nunn of Georgia, fell apart today on Capitol Hill, live on television in full view of the nation and the world.
Prominent Democrats of today, led by the senior members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, joined prominent Democrats of the past, including a noted hawk and a noted dove, in attacking the Bush Administration for what they termed an indecent rush toward war against Iraq and in asserting that woefully inadequate thought had been given to the consequences of such a war. 
 All said they spoke out of concern for the national interest, insisting that policy, not politics, was the motivation. But senior Administration officials, betraying for the first time something of a bunker mentality, suggested that the criticism had grown out of partisanship; one ranking policy maker said the day's events had showed that the Democrats "have decided this is the issue that will break Bush's Presidency."
If Mr. Bush is engaged in a game of what John Foster Dulles used to call "brinkmanship," hoping that by making war seem inevitable he will force President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to pull back and make it unnecessary, the Democrats' tough new stance may hinder him greatly by making his threats less credible.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d came close to saying as much when he called on the Democrats on the committee to help persuade the Iraqi leader that "the alternative to peaceful compliance is to be forced to comply." Given an opening by a friendly Republican question, he commented rather wistfully that he wished he could persaude Congress to back the Administration as fully as the United Nations had done.
 
More Support Abroad
 Mr. Bush clearly faces a Herculean repair job if he is to arrive at Jan. 15 with anything approaching a national consensus behind him. That is the day after which the United Nations Security Council has authorized member nations to use force if Iraqi troops remain in Kuwait.
For the first time in recent history, an American Administration has more comprehensive support abroad for a major foreign-policy position than it has at home. And for the first time in recent history, public and political opinion in the United States is split on the eve of a possible war -- not halfway through it, as was the case in Vietnam, or toward its end, as in Korea.
The day's proceedings before the Foreign Relations Committee, a piece of political theater full of the urgency lent by high political stakes, marked a turning point of considerable importance. Democratic doubts and suspicions, suppressed or ignored for months, suddenly coalesced.
In the process, Mr. Baker, who has grown accustomed in his many years in Washington to being treated as something of an icon, was roughed up pretty badly. Again and again, Democrats accused him of ignoring expert opinions on sanctions and other subjects, of failing to justify the Administration's impatience and of failing to get American allies to commit enough troops or money to the common cause.
Many in the packed conference room recalled the hearings during the Vietnam War, held by this same committee under the chairmanship of Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas, that did much to fuel the antiwar movement. George McGovern, the Democratic nominee who tried and failed to ride that movement into the White House in 1972, was one of those who testified today; so was Zbigniew Brzezinski, a prominent participant in the last American military adventure in the gulf, the futile attempt to rescue American hostages from Iran.
 
Undesirable Side Effects
 Mr. Brzezinski echoed other critics, including former cabinet members and retired senior military officers, in arguing that economic sanctions had not been given a fair chance to work. But he also introduced a new note to the debate, suggesting that all sorts of undesirable and unanticipated side effects might arise from a war, including Iranian dominance in the gulf, Syrian leadership of the Arab world, overthrow of Arab governments friendly to the United States, military involvement of the United States in the region for decades and temptation for Israel to use its military force more freely.
In response to Senators' questions, he urged Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker to emulate Dwight D. Eisenhower in his measured response to Beijing in the Quemoy and Matsu crisis and John F. Kennedy in his measured response to Moscow in the Cuban missile crisis. In a direct reproach to the President's language, Mr. Brzezinski added, "To speak of Saddam Hussein as a Hitler is to trivialize Hitler and to elevate Saddam."
Offstage, other lines of potential attack were becoming visible as Democrats tried to exploit weaknesses in the Administration's position.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, suggested that a surtax might be needed to pay for a war in the gulf or even for the protracted deployment of hundreds of thousands of American troops in Saudi Arabia. Such a surtax would surely be highly unwelcome to the Administration.
"We really haven't focused on the cost of the Persian Gulf," the Illinois Democrat told reporters at a breakfast meeting. "People are not really aware of it. When that surfaces, there is going to have to be some response from Congress and the President."
On Tuesday, in another sign of the growing partisan polarization in the House, Democrats there overwhelmingly adopted a nonbinding resolution that said Mr. Bush should order no attack without the approval of Congress. It was passed by a vote of 177 to 37 in a closed-door caucus.
The Democrats' tactical position is made easier by the contradictions in statements about the gulf crisis made by top Administration officials.
On Oct. 16 in London, for example, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said, "The sanctions and the embargo are beginning to have an impact" and predicted that over the next few months the measures would erode Mr. Hussein's political base as well as the Iraqi economy and military capacity.
On Capitol Hill on Monday, however, Mr. Cheney said it was unlikely the sanctions would ever work, either by restricting food supplies enough or by crippling the Iraqi military.
Now the Administration must decide how to fight back -- either directly, perhaps by suggesting that the Democrats' conduct is vaguely unpatriotic, or indirectly, perhaps by urging Jewish groups and others with an interest in an aggressive United States policy to bring pressure on key Democratic critics like Senators Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware and Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland.
More likely, the President will leave the infighting to surrogates, like Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina.
Mr. Bush himself may well try to appeal over the heads of Congress to the American people, who appear, at least from the evidence of opinion polls, to have grave doubts of their own, and whom he has never found it as easy to sway as Ronald Reagan did.

HEADLINE: Cash Offer By A.T.&T. After Rebuff

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company announced a $90-a-share, $6 billion hostile cash tender offer for the NCR Corporation yesterday after NCR's board rejected A.T.& T.'s all-stock bid for the same amount.
NCR said that it would be prepared to negotiate if A.T.& T. offered $125 a share, or $8.5 billion. But an A.T.& T. spokesman, Walter Murphy, said, "We view that price as outrageous and totally unjustified."
Analysts said that while it was unlikely that NCR would sell for so much, the company was, in effect, placing itself up for sale by setting a price.
 
 'A Bargaining Point'
 "I would characterize $125 a share as simply a bargaining point," said Jack Grubman, analyst with Paine Webber Inc. "The notion of remaining independent has gone by the wayside," he said. 
 Mr. Grubman and other analysts said that they expected A.T.& T. eventually to acquire NCR at a somewhat higher price than $90 a share.
The hostile bid was made after a 50-minute meeting between NCR's chairman, Charles E. Exley Jr., and A.T.& T.'s chairman, Robert E. Allen. The meeting, which was requested by Mr. Exley, took place in the offices of NCR's law firm, Weil, Gotshal & Manges.
A.T.& T. moved quickly to make its cash bid after the stock offer was rejected. It lined up as advisers Morgan Stanley & Company, the Wall Street investment house; Martin Lipton of the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, who made his name in takeover defenses, and Sidley & Austin, the Chicago-based law firm. The company is expected to challenge NCR's shareholder rights plan and to begin a proxy fight to replace members of the board.
 
 Resignation Threatened
 Mr. Exley of NCR has threatened to quit if A.T.& T. acquires the company.
Yesterday morning, in a conference call with analysts, Robert M. Kavner, a top executive of A.T.& T., said the company was determined to press its bid despite Mr. Exley's pledge to resign. Analysts said that Mr. Kavner hoped that Mr. Exley would remain with the company, but Mr. Kavner said that while A.T.& T. needed the senior engineering staff of NCR, it could afford to lose some executives.
In a letter to Mr. Allen rejecting A.T.& T.'s stock offer, Mr. Exley wrote, "We will not jeopardize the imprtant values we are creating at NCR and sacrifice a successful American computer company in order to bail out A.T.& T.'s failed strategy." He also called the takeover attempt "a desperate attempt to salvage A.T.& T.'s disastrous foray into the computer business." A.T.& T. has had consistent losses with its computer business since entering the field in 1984.
Despite such language, analysts viewed NCR's response as an attempt to get A.T.& T. to raise its bid. Mr. Grubman of Paine Webber said that A.T.& T. could pay up to $110 a share for NCR, with the deal still making economic sense.
In announcing the tender offer, Mr. Allen questioned NCR's ability to go it alone. "We are entering an era in which the survival of stand-alone computer companies will be sorely challenged, particarly from abroad," he said.
In a separate letter to Mr. Exley, the A.T.& T. chairman wrote: "All we have is a difference of opinion on price. We should let your shareholders decide."
The tender offer will expire at midnight, Jan. 4, 1991, unless it is extended. A.T.& T. is not expected to have trouble obtaining financing.
A.T.& T. was the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, with more than 5 million shares changing hands. The stock closed down 25 cents, at $30.125 a share. More than 2.4 million NCR shares were traded, and it closed up $3.125 a share, to $86.625.
 
 Bruising Fight Ahead
 With yesterday's announcement, A.T.& T. and NCR began to brace for what promises to be a bruising takeover fight similar to those of the 1980's.
Several Wall Street investment banking firms were said to be trying to join the battle as advisers. For example, Goldman, Sachs & Company, was said by Wall Street executives to be preparing a presentation for the NCR board.
"If there is an investment bank that is not trying to get hired by someone here, they're asleep," One investment banker said.
Investment bankers believe that the two companies will have to hire additional firms because of the size and complexity of the potential deal. Few large deals during the 1980's were run by a single firm, and Dillon, Read & Company, the mid-sized firm that is advising the NCR directors, is not known as a defensive powerhouse in the takeover business.
At the same time, A.T.& T. was said to be in contact with a number of other companies to block any attempt by NCR to find a "white knight" that would acquire the company in a friendly transaction.
"They are attempting to chill other bidders," one person involved in the situation said. "Very few people are willing to take on A.T.& T, particularly a non-U.S. company."
 
 Array of Defenses
 Even if no other bidders come into the process, however, A.T.& T. would have to overcome an array of NCR anti-takeover defenses.
Yesterday, the NCR board authorized several steps that Wall Street executives said were intended to give it more negotiating power.
First, the company lowered the threshold at which parts of its poison pill would come into play. That is a provision designed to fend off unwanted suitors. Now, if a hostile suitor acquired 15 percent of the company, elements of the poison pill would become effective, compared with the prior level of 20 percent.
In addition, NCR opted out of an anti-takeover protection provided to the company under Maryland state law, where it is incorporated.
While the protection at first appears to benefit the company, it includes a provision that would have allowed the shareholders to remove the board of directors if 80 percent of the shareholders approved of a takeover bid. By opting out of the protection, NCR also prevented its shareholders from voting its board out under the 80 percent rule.

HEADLINE: Nynex Units Allow Hookup

 BODY:
The New York Telephone Company and the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company announced this week that they would allow private urban telephone systems to connect their equipment directly to the local phone network.
Metropolitan Fiber Systems Inc., a privately held company based in Chicago, announced yesterday that it had reached a connection agreement with New York Telephone. Metropolitan Fiber said last week that it had completed construction of an urban fiber-optic system in lower Manhattan. 
 Urban fiber-optic systems provide big companies with low-cost, high-capacity telephone cables to nearby businesses and to the nearest switching centers of long-distance carriers. The new systems compete with local phone companies, which have traditionally offered this service.
By allowing the fiber-optic system vendors to plug their equipment directly into local phone company switching equipment, New York Telephone and New England Telephone will allow these vendors to offer local phone calls more cheaply and efficiently.
The move by the two subsidiaries of the Nynex Corporation "ends a long, disputatious history of several years" of clashes with the fiber-optic system companies, said Eli M. Noam, a Columbia University economist.

HEADLINE: Mixed Results for Test of Oil Reserve Sales

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The last deliveries of oil sold from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve were made on Sunday, according to the Energy Department.
The relatively small sale went fairly smoothly, but it did uncover some problems that might hamper bigger efforts to tap the reserve. The financial picture was mixed; the Government may have turned a profit, but it depends on the accounting method used. 
 President Bush announced the sale on Sept. 26 in an unsuccessful effort to scare speculators and drive down the price of oil. The sale involved 4.125 million barrels, delivered over several weeks. The White House described the sale as a test, and it was a modest exercise for a reserve system that is supposed to be able to deliver as much as 3.5 million barrels a day in a full-scale emergency.
Establishing the buyers' credit was one source of potential delays. Government officials said the Energy Department required bidders to submit letters of credit from their banks, to assure that the buyers could pay for the oil. But without a standard form, each letter had to be analyzed carefully by Government lawyers.
Another possible problem involved the Federal law that requires the use of American-flag ships when oil is shipped from the reserve by tanker. Oil companies try to avoid American ships, because they are more expensive and sometimes are not available. Of the 26 deliveries in the test, 21 were made by pipeline and 5 by barge, but none by tanker. In a large sale, tankers would be needed.
There also appeared to be something of a mismatch between what was offered for sale and what the oil companies wanted to buy. The Government accepted bids on all 2.2 million barrels of low-sulfur oil that were offered. But with high-sulfur oil, only 1.925 million of the 2.8 million barrels offered were sold because some bids were judged to be less than 90 percent of fair market value.
The average sale price was $31.80 a barrel. Whether that was good for the taxpayers depends on which of the 585 million barrels were sold.
The last oil bought, just before the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, cost about $16 a barrel.
The first barrels bought, in the late 1970's, were even cheaper, about $14.45 each. But the Government has paid 12 years of interest on the money it borrowed to buy that oil. Assuming an average interest rate of 9 percent, the price of those barrels rises above $40. With maintenance expenses, the total would be about $46 a barrel.
The cost could be even higher if the oil is assumed to be barrels bought for more than $36 in the early 1980's.
John W. Bartholomew, director of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, does not any use any of those accounting systems; the law that established the reserve, he noted, states that the money from sales is to be used to buy replacement crude. On a replacement-cost basis, the sale was probably profitable, since analysts expect oil to drop to the low $20's, if not lower, when the gulf crisis ends. Mr. Bartholomew added that the reserve was not regarded as a vehicle for making money through speculation.

HEADLINE: Energy Strategists Review U.S. Reliance on Oil Imports

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Administration officials, racing to submit the elements of a long-awaited national energy strategy to the President this month, are giving renewed attention to the nation's high dependence on imported oil, officials in the Energy Department and in industry say.
With no change in current trends, projections show the United States would import 80 percent of its oil by 2030, up from the 50 percent level that was reached during some months of this year. As the nation approached 50 percent dependence in 1977, President Jimmy Carter pledged that imports would never climb that high again. 
 Oil now accounts for 40 percent of the nation's total energy use and that is expected to decline by only four percentage points, to 36 percent, during the next four decades.
 
New Sense of Urgency
 Energy Department officials have long been concerned about oil dependence, but for others involved in the review of national energy strategy that was begun in July 1989 the oil-import issue has taken on extra urgency in light of the Persian Gulf crisis.
"There are people who have looked at this in the Administration and called it to our attention," said W. Henson Moore, the Deputy Energy Secretary. "That's the factor that slaps you across the face."
He declined, however, to say what, if any, options might be added to the list of 60 to 65 now being prepared for presentation to President Bush at a meeting with his economic advisers, probably on Dec. 18.
The President, who was once in the oil business, is to select various options and offer these, presumably in January, as his Administration's energy program.
Since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, analysts working on the project have added at least one new set of projections based on big gyrations in oil prices, but they have decided not to accelerate the timetable for completion of the study.
Energy Department officials most closely involved with the project have cast their net widely for ideas, conducting nearly a score of public hearings around the country and processing thousands of pages of comments.
Early drafts of the option list have aroused heavy criticism from various quarters, particularly environmentalists and those favoring alternative forms of energy like solar power. But objections have also come from the nuclear power industry, the coal industry and the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association representing investor-owned utilities.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Fall $3.37 a Barrel As Gulf War Worries Fade

BYLINE: By Keith BRADSHER

 BODY:
Crude oil prices fell more than $3 a barrel yesterday in futures trading, while wholesale gasoline prices fell below 70 cents a gallon for the first time since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
The sharp decline in oil prices came after reports that Iraq was willing to discuss a negotiated withdrawal from Kuwait. 
 The move in oil helped push prices on the stock market sharply higher yesterday in the heaviest trading since mid-October. [Page D8.]
Crude for January delivery dropped $3.37, or 11 percent, to $27.29 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The January gasoline contract fell 7.08 cents, to 68.84 cents a gallon. Heating oil for October delivery dipped 5.76 cents, to 81.14 cents a gallon.
Traders attributed the heavy selling to increased optimism about the chances of a peaceful settlement in the Persian Gulf. The State Department said yesterday that the United States and Iraq had agreed to talks, although no date had been set. "There is the perception that this crisis will be resolved by means other than military," said Nauman Barakat, a senior energy trader at Merrill Lynch.
A week ago, there were twice as many traders expecting a war as were expecting a peaceful solution, Mr. Barakat said, adding that now the ratio has been reversed.
"The war premium is out," said John H. Kingston, the managing editor of Platt's Oilgram Price Report, a daily newsletter.
The slump in energy prices is likely to continue because the market has broken through several important price levels watched by traders and because some traders are becoming desperate to sell on any sign of strength in the market, said Michael Wilner, the president of Hilltop Trading Company in New York.
After the close of trading in New York, the spot, or cash, price for crude in informal deals fell a further 15 to 30 cents a barrel in light trading, traders and analysts said. Only a small fraction of the oil consumed each year in the United States is traded on the Merc, but the prices that result from trading there tend to determine spot prices nationwide.
 
Some Earlier Worries

Wholesale gasoline and heating oil prices both rose above $1 a gallon in September, when traders worried that war in the Persian Gulf was imminent and that a significant portion of the world's oil production capacity might be destroyed.
But the warm autumn weather, the end of the summer driving season and expanded refining prompted by the high prices have resulted in large stockpiles and reduced demand for refined products, particularly gasoline. The American Petroleum Institute said late Tuesday that refineries operated at 88 percent of capacity last week, up from 83 percent the week before.
"We haven't seen that type of increase in a long time," said Thomas P. Blakeslee, an analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., a consulting firm in Hoboken, N.J.
Oil companies and speculators have accumulated huge supplies of gasoline in Texas and are vulnerable to a stiff annual tax that most Texas municipalities assess on refined product inventories on Dec. 31. Storage sites elsewhere are in short supply.
"A lot of these companies are looking at chartering barges, taking it out in international waters, and bringing it back afterwards," Mr. Kingston said.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
HEAD OF C.I.A. SEES IRAQIS WEAKENING IN 3 TO 9 MONTHS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
The Director of Central Intelligence told Congress today that Iraq's military could maintain its current combat readiness for no more than nine months if economic sanctions continued to hold, and that the ability of the Iraqi Air Force to fly regular missions could decline within three months.
In testimony to the House Armed Services Committee, the C.I.A. director, William H. Webster, predicted that mounting shortages caused by the sanctions were likely to shut down all but Iraq's energy-related and military industries by spring, and "almost certainly" by next summer. 
 Mr. Webster hewed to the Bush Administration line that sanctions would not cause Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, but his cautiously phrased remarks nonetheless forecast some deterioration in the Iraqi military in less than a year.
 
Nine-Month Effect Seen
 "Under noncombat conditions, Iraq ground and air forces can probably maintain near-current levels of readiness for as long as nine months," he said. "We expect the Iraqi Air Force to feel the effects of sanctions more quickly and to a greater degree than the Iraqi ground forces because of its greater reliance on high technology and foreign equipment and technicians."
Mr. Webster testified as Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, appearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, reiterated the Administration position that there is no certainty that sanctions will produce an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. [Excerpts from the two sessions, page A16.]
Testifying before the House panel, Mr. Webster said, "There is no assurance or guarantee that economic hardships will compel Saddam to change his policies or lead to internal unrest that would threaten his regime."
 
A Different View
 But he appeared to part company with the Administration on the questions of whether and when the sanctions might erode Iraq's military forces -- and by extension, whether waiting longer for the embargo to work might weaken the Iraqi military to the point where it would pose less of a threat to American forces in a war.
On Monday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told the Senate Armed Services Committee that a prolonged embargo might only give Iraq's military time to harden its defensive positions in Kuwait and southern Iraq.
Mr. Baker, who drew a barrage of criticism from Democratic members of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the United States would strike "suddenly, massively and decisively" if it chooses to use military force.
At times the Democrats argued with Mr. Baker, and at times Democrats and Republicans openly jousted with each other, ignoring the Secretary of State sitting in the witness chair. The Democrats almost unanimously lined up in favor of giving sanctions more time to bring pressure on Iraq and weaken its army, while the Republicans almost unanimously supported Mr. Baker's argument that only a credible threat of imminent war could convince President Saddam Hussein to peacefully withdraw from Kuwait.
Mr. Baker said his proposed trip to Baghdad this month or in early January was not an opening for negotiations.
 The State Department reported today that Iraq had formally accepted President Bush's offer to hold talks in Washington this month with the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, and to send Mr. Baker to Baghdad. Iraq had indicated its acceptance over the weekend. The department said the dates and other details were under discussion with Iraq.
At American urging, the United Nations Security Council last week gave Iraq until Jan. 15 to leave Kuwait or face the prospect of being forced out militarily. Mr. Hussein dismissed the threat and promised to exact extensive casualties from American troops if war breaks out.
Mr. Webster neither agreed nor differed with the Administration's arguments for military force. But his remarks, the Administration's most detailed public assessment of the embargo to date, nevertheless depicted an Iraq whose industry and military are inexorably withering as foreign exchange, food stocks and key manufacturing supplies dry up.
He said that the trade embargo continued to deprive Iraq of more than 90 percent of the goods and services it formerly imported from abroad, and that exports, including oil, had been virtually shut off.
 
Reserves Sufficient Now
 Warehoused goods and other reserves are forestalling serious hardship now, but Mr. Webster said sanctions should begin to significantly hobble Iraq's economy within a few months in these ways:
*Unable to earn money through exports, Iraq should deplete its foreign reserves by the spring, "leaving it little cash left with which to entice potential sanctions-busters" who smuggle goods over rural borders, Mr. Webster said.
*Economic problems will noticeably worsen by spring as Baghdad shifts more and more of its dwindling resources to the military and struggles to keep basic services, such as electrical power, functioning regularly.
*Grain reserves should sustain consumption at about two-thirds of the pre-embargo level until the next harvest in May. But despite Government incentives to increase food production, "Iraq does not have the capability to become self-sufficient in food production by next year," Mr. Webster said.
*Poultry will be "unavailable" by spring, and such staples as sugar and cooking oils will be scarce. Vegetable production also may suffer because the embargo has cut off Iraq's supplies of seed from the United States, France and the Netherlands, he said.
 
Effect on Iraqi Military
 In the military, four months of economic sanctions so far have had an effect only "at the margins," Mr. Webster said, in part because Iraq's defensive stance in Kuwait requires little training or moving of equipment that leads to wear and tear. If that continues, he said, "Iraqi ground and air forces can probably maintain near-current levels of readiness for as long as nine months."
Ground forces have large supplies of ammunition and are receiving larger food rations than the civilian population, he said. A continuing stalemate would allow Mr. Hussein to rest his troops and conserve stocks of critical items such as lubricants. Even so, he said, parts shortages should begin to cripple the infantry's armor and its fleet of military trucks by late summer.
Mr. Webster said the Iraqi Air Force might begin to feel the embargo's pinch sooner, perhaps by March. The shortage of foreign technicians and parts for Iraq's fleet of French- and Soviet-made jets will probably force the air force to reduce its present rate of daily flights, for such purposes as training and reconnaissance, in three to six months.
He said that "major repairs to sophisticated aircraft like the F-1," one of the Mirage line of fighters built by the French manufacturer Dassault, "will be achieved with significant difficulty, if at all, because of the exodus of foreign technicians."
In Senate testimony on Monday, Defense Secretary Cheney questioned the usefulness of the embargo, saying the United States does not have "an indefinite period of time to wait for sanctions to produce the desired result" in Iraq.
Mr. Webster appeared to directly counter Mr. Cheney's statement that the Iraqis could double food production and basically feed themselves on short notice. The C.I.A. director's remarks also contradicted Mr. Cheney's contention that a long delay in beginning military action against Iraq might help Mr. Hussein's military, giving it time to deploy more troops and prepare more fortifications.
Mr. Webster cautioned that there was scant evidence so far that the economic sanctions had seriously disturbed either Iraq's civilian population or Mr. Hussein's resolve.
"We see no indication that Saddam is concerned, at this point, that domestic discontent is growing to levels that may threaten his regime or that problems resulting from the sanctions are causing him to rethink his policy on Kuwait," he said. He said Iraq suffered worse deprivation, in addition to great loss of life, during the eight-year war with Iran.
"While we can look ahead several months and predict the gradual deterioration of the Iraqi economy, it is more difficult to assess how or when these conditions will cause Saddam to modify his behavior," Mr. Webster said. "Saddam almost certainly assumes that he is coping effectively with the sanctions. He appears confident in the ability of his security services to contain potential discontent, and we do not believe he is troubled by the hardships."
In a closed-door session after his public testimony, Mr. Webster was said to have told committee members that economic punishment alone was unlikely to drive Mr. Hussein from Kuwait before the international coalition now arrayed against Iraq began to fragment.
Congressional officials said Mr. Webster told the committee in private that Iraq "can continue to exist as a nation for a protracted time," even in the face of a worldwide trade embargo, and that the decline in its armed forces would be slow to take hold.
The sharpest exchange of the day for Mr. Baker came when Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, said, his voice rising in anger:
"You and the President have said that this trip to Baghdad is going the last mile. I beg to disagree with you. The last best chance for a peaceful solution, the going the last mile, is to sustain the sanctions policy for a period of time sufficiently long to give it a chance to work. There's no expert who has testified, or holds the view, that it could work within four months -- none."
"Now, I cannot say to a family that loses a son or daughter in a conflict that may well take place in the next 60 to 90 days, that we exhausted every possibility for a peaceful resolution before this happened, because the sanctions option has not been exhausted," the Senator added.
Mr. Baker, clearly containing his own anger, responded: "Let me say, Senator, that right out my window at the State Department I look every day at Arlington National Cemetery, and I understand very, very well what's at stake here, and I think the President of the United States understands very, very well."
"We have not been precipitous," Mr. Baker said. "We have not been reckless."
 
Baker Cites His Reasons
 The Secretary of State began his hearing testimony by laying out why he thought that sanctions alone would not produce an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. He cited reasons ranging from Iraq's ability to grow its own food to the character of the Iraqi Government, which he said is insensitive to pain inflicted on its people.
"We have to face some hard facts," Mr. Baker said. "If sanctions are to succeed, they must do more than hurt Iraq economically. They must hurt Saddam so much that he changes his behavior and withdraws from Kuwait."
After four months of a total embargo on Iraq, he said, "all available evidence suggests" that sanctions "have had little if any effect on his inclination to withdraw."
If the Senators really want a peaceful solution, the Secretary said, clearly addressing himself to the Democrats on the committee, then they have to help the Administration convince the Iraqi leader that "the alternative to peaceful compliance is to be forced to comply."

HEADLINE: Science Academy Urges More Computer Security

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Warning that computers in the United States are not secure, the National Academy of Sciences yesterday urged the nation to revamp computer security procedures, institute new emergency response teams and create a special non-Government organization to take charge of computer security planning.
The report's authors noted the increasing dependence on computers to control almost every aspect of America's business and Government activity as well as critical systems like airline traffic control and vital hospital equipment. They said the nation had been fortunate not to have suffered a catastrophic failure. 
 The report, "Computers At Risk: Safe Computing In the Information Age," was prepared by 16 university and Government computer security specialists at the request of the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Projects Agency. The authors of the report, prepared by the academy's National Research Council, included David D. Clark, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; M. Douglas McIlroy, a computer scientist at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company's Bell Laboratories; Peter G. Neumann, a computer security researcher at SRI International, and Willis H. Ware, a computer privacy researcher at the Rand Corporation.
 
'Luck Will Soon Run Out'
 "As far as we can tell, there has been no successful systematic attempt to subvert any of our critical computing systems," the report said. "Unfortunately, there is reason to believe that our luck will soon run out. Thus far, we have relied on the absence of malicious people who are both capable and motivated. We can no longer do so. We must instead attempt to build computer systems that are secure and trustworthy."
The panel began work in the fall of 1988 after a nationwide computer was jammed by a Cornell University graduate student who released a rogue program that had been written as a prank. Because of several flaws in the program, it went out of control and stalled thousands of computers connected to a network of business, Government and military computers known as the Internet.
"While we haven't had the equivalent of a Chernobyl-like disaster for computers, do we want to wait for something like that to happen?" asked Marjory S. Blumenthal, the academy's staff director for the study. "There are enough signs of potential vulnerability that we should act now."
The report cited threats to individual privacy, the danger of increased trust placed in computers used in safety-critical applications like medical instruments and air traffic control systems, corporate espionage and the increasing vulnerability of international computer networks to political attacks.
 
 Dual Responsibility
 At present, responsibility for developing computer security systems and standards is split between the National Security Agency, an intelligence gathering and military computer security organization, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which has responsibility for nonclassified computer security. Ms. Blumenthal said, however, that the institute has not had sufficient funding to develop secure computer designs.
"The current system isn't working, and people know it," said Marc Rotenberg, Washington director for the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, a national public interest organization.
The academy panel proposed that a private, not-for-profit organization -- to be called the Information Security Foundation -- be set up with private financing to develop security standards and to research security technologies.
The proposed group would be supported by computer emergency response teams, known as CERT's. The Defense Advanced Project Agency set up such an organization after the Internet incident. Based at the Software Engineering Institute in Pittsburgh, the unit is made up of a small group of specialists. It has a 24-hour hot line and can respond quickly to attacks on computer security.
 
 Security Equipment
 The National Security Agency has refused to permit the export of advanced computer equipment that protects the security of voice and data communications, but the report called for a change in that policy.
"If the United States does not allow vendors of commercial systems to export security products with relatively effective security features," the report said, "large multinational firms, as well as foreign cusomters will simply purchase equivalent systems from foreign manufacturers." Several European governments are now promoting competing security plans, the report noted.

HEADLINE: Slump May Even Hit Toys 'R' Us

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The history of the toy business can be divided into two epochs: before Toys "R" Us and after Toys "R" Us.
With huge stores brimming with brand-name toys at low prices, all under the stern gaze of computer scanners that control inventory, Toys "R" Us is the world's largest toy retailer. By revolutionizing the often haphazard business of selling playthings, it forced competitors to duplicate its approach or lose customers. Most lost customers. 
 But this edgy Christmas sales season may slow the pace of even Toys "R" Us. Nervous about a possible war in the Persian Gulf and a likely recession at home, Americans may not spend much more than the $16.8 billion they did on toys and video games last Christmas, many analysts say. When the annual inflation rate, now running at more than 6.3 percent is taken into account, there might be a real decline in sales after the dust settles.
Just how bleak this Christmas might be was underscored Tuesday when Child World Inc., the nation's No. 2 toy chain, said it would seek to avoid bankruptcy by stopping payment of its old bills until Jan. 15. The company cited poor sales throughout its 182 stores, which are concentrated in the economically troubled Northeast. Child World also reported a third-quarter loss of $14.4 million compared with a loss of $4.1 million a year earlier.
Hoping to raise cash by drawing more customers, Child World said it would lower prices on many of its toys starting Saturday. That raised speculation by industry analysts that the move might start a price war that could hurt Toys "R" Us.
Michael Goldstein, vice chairman and chief financial officer of Toys "R" Us, would say only that "we are sorry to see any competitor in difficulty." He noted, however, that yesterday the company began what he said was a previously scheduled $100 million clearance sale on older toys and board games, with price cuts of up to 75 percent from manufacturers' suggested retail prices.
Toys "R" Us stock fell 62.5 cents, to $22.875, in active trading yesterday after negative comments from analysts about prospects for the toy industry in general after the Child World announcement.
While Toys "R" Us helped turn toy selling into a year-round business, it still gets half its sales and three-quarters of its profit during the Hanukkah and Christmas season.
Beyond the competitive pressures, the driving question for toy stores like Toys "R" Us this year is whether Nintendo, the leading video game maker and by far the toy industry's best seller, will continue to excite children. Nintendo and rival video games commanded 20 percent of all toy sales last year and nearly the same proportion at Toys "R" Us.
If Toys "R" Us is the Gulliver of toy sellers, then Nintendo is the Godzilla of toys, having crushed the competition and gobbled up more than its share of sales in recent years.
 
Go-Go, My Walking Pup
 In fact, the latest survey of toy stores by Toy & Hobby World magazine, a trade publication, shows that five of the top ten sellers continue to be Nintendo games and equipment. Nintendo's $99 game consoles are the nation's best-selling plaything.
But if Nintendo falters -- and some analysts say they see early signs of just that -- toy retailers worry that there are no blockbusters waiting to emerge. Sharply higher toy prices could also hinder sales growth, although toy makers have been careful to also offer moderately priced toys to better capture any unspent Nintendo dollars.
Still, with many of the hottest toys costing $45 or more, "just getting customers into stores this season, let alone getting them to buy, is going to be tough," said Sean McGowan, a toy industry analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison & Company, in New York.
A hot seller so far is Hasbro's Go-Go, My Walking Pup, which costs about $40.
One of the best-selling new toys intended for girls is Mattel's Magic Nursery doll, which, at about $25, is less expensive than many other popular toys this year. The infant doll's novelty is that when the gown it comes wrapped in is put into water it disappears, leaving behind a waterproof birth certificate that says whether it's a girl or a boy. If the document says the doll has a twin, the purchaser can get a second doll free.
Board games like Shark Attack, made by Milton Bradley, at about $13, are also expected to do well.
 
Confidence About Market Share
 Because video games have been so dominant in recent years, analysts say, toy makers have slowed creation of new toys for boys 8 to 12 years old, the prime ages in thrall to Nintendo. As a result, even though Nintendo products are pervasive, most stores carry a slight majority of toys designed to appeal to girls,
Still, Toys "R" Us, with sales of $4.8 billion in the year ended Jan. 28, 1990, seems undaunted, confident that no matter what happens it will gain in market share. "If people are going to buy toys at low prices where they know they can get what they want, where are they going to buy them?" asks Charles Lazarus, the founder and chairman of Toys "R" Us, his hands pointing skyward. He does not pause for an answer.
Like a wary campaign contributor bankrolling both Democrats and Republicans, Toys "R" Us has invested heavily in both video games and traditional toys.
Toys "R" Us, with headquarters in a modest business park in Paramus, N.J., already has a 22 percent market share. Child World has about 5 percent and the Lionel Corporation, which operates mostly under the Lionel Kiddie City name, is No. 3 with 2.6 percent, according to Daniel Barry, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody.
 
Toys Are for Adults Too
 The success of Toys "R" Us is based on easy-to-reach stores with wide selection and deep inventory at low prices.
Toys "R" Us has also unleashed a torrent of advertising, aimed as much at adults as children. "You think The Sharper Image is the only toy store for adults?" asks Mr. Lazarus, an intense, owlish man.
Although Toys "R" Us will not say how much it spends on marketing, it is spending at least $15 million on a network television campaign. It bought 12 full-page ads in USA Today, which has high newsstand sales in airports, for the day before Thanksgiving, the busiest flying day of the year.
Mr. Goldstein, the chief financial officer, said, "We want to make sure that you can't live a normal life and not see our ads."
But third-quarter trends were troubling for Toys "R" Us, by far the most profitable toy retailer, as well as for the industry as a whole. Sales at Toys "R" Us stores open for at least a year inched up 1.6 percent in the August-to-October period, compared with a gain of more than 10 percent in the May-through-July period.
 
Starting With Furniture
 The company as a whole, including its usually thriving children's wear division, Kids "R" Us, had flat earnings of $28.7 million in the third quarter, and sales rose 11.5 percent, to $1.05 billion.
Toys "R" Us was started by Mr. Lazarus, who converted his father's bicycle repair shop in Washington into a children's furniture shop in 1948. He soon realized that parents bought toys much more often than they bought furniture, so he gradually converted several stores into toy supermarkets.
Now, most of his 451 Toys "R" Us stores in the United States (there are 98 foreign stores) are just off a main highway, near populated centers and a shopping mall. This avoids expensive mall rents but pulls in the same customer traffic. Toys "R" Us owns virtually all of its stores, thus controlling occupancy costs.
Because it stocks such huge quantities, the company has enormous buying power with manufacturers. Toys "R" Us stores can sell toys sometimes for a third less than the suggested retail price. The stores stock toys at levels double or triple those of competitors to reduce the chance that a parent will suffer the ultimate humiliation -- having to tell a whining 8-year-old that the store is out of G.I. Joe dressed in desert camouflage.
The stores also try to offer most of the items associated with, say, Barbie or Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles and nearly all 300 of Nintendo's video games. Toy manufacturers benefit because they can sell not only their hottest toys but also entire lines of doo-dads that carry fat profit margins.
 
'Short on Dr. Mario'
 Moreover, Toys "R" Us stocks what are certifiably the hottest toys, as shown by computerized cash registers that track shoppers' buying trends. The registers tie stores as far away as Honolulu directly to Mr. Lazarus, the chairman, who has computer terminals in his office, his Manhattan apartment and his Long Island summer home. The computers are also used to report unusual events that may disrupt sales, like power failures, snowstorms and road construction.
Mr. Lazarus is especially watchful about shortages of hot toys. Peter Main, a top marketing officer with Nintendo of America, recalled an urgent phone call from Mr. Lazarus. "It looks like we're going to be short on Dr. Mario," a video game, he said that Mr. Lazarus told him before demanding, "What are you going to do about it?"
Other general merchandise discounters and department stores find it hard to mobilize for the D-Day invasion of Christmas every year. They must quintuple floor space devoted to toys, figure out from scratch what the hottest toys are and then stock just enough so they will be picked clean by Christmas Eve. This year, in particular, many are not stocking as many toys as in the past, wary of being left with unsold inventory.
That plays into the hands of Toys "R" Us executives in their quest for ever-increasing market share.
 "The last two weeks before Christmas, we'll be the only place with inventory," Mr. Lazarus said. "Everyone else is going to run out."

HEADLINE: Trade Talks Seem on the Verge of Collapse

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Thursday, Dec. 6

 BODY:
World trade talks appeared to be just hours from collapse early this morning as negotiations reached a crisis over the European Community's continuing failure to agree to make larger cuts in agricultural subsidies.
After a late-night negotiating session that began Wednesday ended in acrimony and accusations, numerous ministers said the talks would fall apart at noon today, a deadline set by the conference chairman, unless the community adopted a more flexible position on farm protection. 
 "If nothing new comes up between now and the next 12 hours, it's over," said Brazil's chief negotiator, Rubens Ricupero.
The negotiations have been hurtling toward this critical moment since the final week of a four-year round of talks began on Monday. The United States and other farm-exporting nations have been pushing the European Community to agree to more substantial cuts in farm subsidies.
The trade and agriculture ministers of the 12 community nations met late Wednesday evening, and many negotiators among the 100 nations represented at this week's trade talks had high hopes that the community would finally make a more liberal offer.
But ministers at the meeting said the community, eager to protect its 10 million farmers, remained intransigent. "The community continued to stonewall," said John C. Crosbie, Canada's Trade Minister. "The ball is, as it has been from the very start, in the European Community's court."
Some officials said the talks might be suspended for several weeks to give the Europeans time to come up with new proposals, a prospect American officials oppose because they are under a Congressional deadline to submit a trade pact by March 1.
Nonetheless, Arthur Dunkel, Director General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based organization sponsoring the talks, said he was "hopeful" that there would be a breakthrough by noon today.
The talks aim to spur economic growth by setting new, more liberal rules for the $4 billion a year in world trade. The rules would for the first time bring agriculture, financial services, textiles and patents under international trade rules.
The European Community's trade and agriculture ministers are scheduled to meet this morning, and many officials hope that they will give their negotiators more flexibility.
 
A Hint of Change

The Europeans have proposed reducing farm subsidies by 30 percent over 10 years, but have refused to make specific proposals on cutting import barriers or export subsidies. The United States, Canada, Argentina, Australia and other farm-exporting nations have proposed slashing farm subsidies by 75 percent over 10 years and export subsidies by 90 percent.
Farm subsidies often take the form of government payments to supplement the income of farmers whose crops sell for a lower price than one the government determines as fair. There are also export subsidies, money that governments provide to help lower the price of farm goods being sold abroad. Government programs to protect farmers cost the industrial nations $250 billion a year in higher taxes and inflated food prices.
Early Wednesday afternoon the European Community hinted that it would abandon its inflexible position on reducing farm subsidies. According to several negotiators, it outlined several new, but vague proposals to reduce farm protection.
 
'Dead in the Water'

Many negotiators said the community's proposals, which some people called trial balloons, might be too little and too late to give the talks the momentum they need. Besides, after the European Community's trade and agriculture ministers met Wednesday night, community officials came out talking tough, saying they would not give in to American pressures to change their position.
"There is no reason for us to bend the knee in front of the United States." said Otto Schlecht, Germany's state secretary for economics.
"For all practical purposes the Uruguay Round is dead in the water at this time," said Neal Blewett, Australia's trade minister. "There is very little chance of revival."
Since the final week of talks began, the two sides have stubbornly played a high-stakes game over who would make the first concession.
Ministers here say the latitude of community negotiators is restricted because they have to refer back repeatedly to the trade and agriculture mnisters of the 12 community nations.
Even as the Europeans hinted at a more flexible position on farm trade, they sought, according to American and other officials, to pick off Washington's allies by offering them individual concessions.
 
Taking the Offensive

Senior negotiators said the European Community had suggested that it would not raise tariffs on soybeans as part of a plan in which it said it would increase import barriers in some areas even as it reduced them in others. American negotiators said this move was intended to soften the opposition of Brazil and Canada to the community's position.
In recent weeks, the community has been isolated and on the defensive as the United States and other farm-exporting nations said its intransigence on liberalizing farm trade was frustrating the talks.
Tonight, however, community officials went aggressively on the offensive and asserted that Washington was isolated and the main culprit.
"The real difficulty is getting the Americans to negotiate," said John Cooney, a community spokesman.
But Victoria Clarke, a spokesman for Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said this was "disingenuous." She said Washington had been negotiating on numerous issues, including textiles, intellectual property and financial services.
Rufus Yerxa, the deputy United States trade representative, said, "We do not believe that substantial progress is possible at this time given the impasse in agriculture."

HEADLINE: Productivity Is Revised Downward

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Labor productivity, a key measure of economic vitality, was revised sharply downward for the third quarter today, adding to mounting evidence that the economy is in retreat.
The Labor Department said non-farm productivity rose only two-tenths of 1 percent in the quarter instead of its previously reported increase of 1.6 percent. Productivity, defined as output per hour of work, rose three-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter. 
 The department said the downward revision showed output as unchanged, while the previous report had put the gain in output at 1.5 percent.
The department also said that the number of hours put in by workers fell two-tenths of 1 percent, the first drop in this category since 1986.
Economists said the revision, which had not been expected to be this sharp, was in line with the belief that the economy was slowing and had probably drifted into recession.
"This is exactly the kind of picture you would expect to see from an economy that was going into recession," said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at Georgia State University.
The economists said the pattern showed output slowing in the three months as demand slackened, but industry continued to retain workers while waiting to see if the downturn was temporary.
They say that evidence for the current quarter suggests that the waiting period has ended and industry has begun paring its work force in the face of a continued slowdown.
The figures were released against a backdrop of higher oil prices from the gulf crisis that also are weighing heavily on the economy and are thought by some to have already pushed it into a recession.
The Commerce Department said that manufacturing productivity rose 5.1 percent, led by an increase of 7.4 percent in the durable goods sector. Nondurable goods productivity was up 1.6 percent.
Overall productivity including farming rose four-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Advanced TV Makes Debut in Japan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Finally, after all the debate over whether high-definition television will be a revolutionary technology for consumers and national economies, the vaunted sets went on sale this week in Japan.
They cost $34,000 apiece and the special-format broadcasts for HDTV are shown for only an hour a day. But for the three big electronics companies that have begun selling the world's first high-definition sets -- Sony, Matsushita and Hitachi -- the high cost and limited programming are no cause for distress at the outset. They are marketing HDTV now to show the dimensions of Japan's technological lead over the United States and Europe in this field and to whip up public demand for television sets that have the clarity and wide-screen look of a movie-theater screen.
 
Luring Crowds
 The giant-screen HDTV's are already being installed in hotel lobbies, post offices and town halls all over Japan, where crowds can gather to watch; there is even one in the waiting area down the hall from Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's office. 
 These days the screens are being filled with a sparing selection of big sporting matches and colorful events that showcase the technology, like the enthronement ceremonies last month of Emperor Akihito, broadcast in what Japan calls "Hi-Vision." Next year, Japan's giant state-run broadcaster, NHK, plans to increase its HDTV broadcasts from one hour, to eight hours a day.
"It is much like the first transistor radio, or the first Walkman, or the first home VCR's," said Hisafumi Yamada, a manager in Sony's high-definition business development division. "You have to do something at the first stage, to get people accustomed to the idea. We think the demand is out there."
Experimenting on the sales shelves is nothing new here, especially in high technology, where Japanese consumers often test the first models. Five years from now, manufacturers say, they expect that more than a million sets will have been sold in Japan. By that time, the price is expected to drop to about $7,500.
But for Japan's electronics industry, the first consumer HDTV's are not only a chance to test public reaction to a technology that has already cost upward of $1 billion. It is also a chance to test corporate strategies.
It is no accident that the first sets are reaching the market just as the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company begins to digest its $6.13 billion purchase last month of MCA, the parent of Universal Studios. Along with Columbia Pictures, purchased last year by Sony, Universal is expected to quickly become a testing ground for new video "software" -- the industry's jargon for movies and other forms of entertainment -- that will exploit HDTV's features.
Sony has already set up HDTV production equipment on Columbia's lots, in an effort to convince directors that the images they can record on videotape are as rich and warm as those they get on film -- and far easier to edit.
"I do not necessarily agree with what they did, in buying up American studios," Keiji Shima, the chairman of NHK and one of the biggest advocates of Japan's Hi-Vision system, said the other day in a talk with foreign correspondents based in Japan. But the acquisitions, he said, should speed the solution of a major problem in the Japanese industry: Its video hardware has outpaced the development of programming that would give viewers a reason to replace their existing television sets.
 
A Move Toward Computers
 While consumers usually associate HDTV with television viewing, Matsushita and Sony are looking to the day when the technology will be a critical component of computers. There already are plans to mix high-definition images into what the electronics industry calls "multimedia," the mix of data, graphics, moving pictures and sound. "We are just beginning to think about personal computers for the future," said Hiroyuki Mizuno, the head of research and development at Matsushita. "But I think audio-visual will have to have a big part of the personal computer operation." High-definition television, he said, "could certainly be expected to be part of that."
Atop all this is the issue of components, mostly Japanese-made. High-definition television sets are loaded with memory chips and processors in which Japan excels. The result is that even American manufacturers will be relying on Japan to produce most of the vital parts -- unless Europe and Japan set up local content regulations that require that some specified portion of an item be made in the country where the item is being sold.
But the commercial advent of HDTV in Japan may also be the first chance to test the critical question still facing the technology: How big an improvement is it anyway?
The initial reviews of prototype HDTV systems were gushing: High definition, many of the industry's experts said, would be as large a leap forward as the arrival of color television three decades ago. The Japanese system uses more than twice the number of video lines that current American sets have. The result is much better picture resolution. Combined with the wide-angle view -- HDTV's have the rectangular proportions of a movie screen rather than the boxy proportions of a television set -- the big screens have remarkable clarity and, at times, the sense that the image is almost three-dimensional.
 
A Slow Start
 This week's start has not exactly bowled the industry over. Sony says it has 100 orders, but most were collected previously. Matsushita says it is prepared to manufacture up to 50 sets a month at the beginning.
The two companies are pursuing significantly different strategies. Matsushita is selling its models mainly to hotels and people in the professions. "There are not exactly consumer prices," a Matsushita official said.
Sony, meanwhile, turned out a separate "HDTV ready" monitor but without the "decoder" one needs to turn the scrambled signal into a television image. Until the circuitry is miniaturized and the price of the decoder comes down, Sony says it expects many of its buyers to use the big television -- it has a 36-inch diagonal screen -- for conventional shows, using the existing broadcast format. The television is even equipped to tune into several different conventional stations at once, placing each of them in different corners of the screen for monitoring.
But Sony knows that a few people -- the company calls them "vidiots" for their love of the latest -- will insist on high definition now. No matter that they have little to watch until at least next year, when NHK launches another satellite that will broadcast roughly eight hours a day of HDTV images. Whether watching it all will be worth it is, for the Japanese, the $34,000 question.

HEADLINE: California Might Void Ernst License

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
The State of California's licensing board is seeking to revoke Ernst & Young's license to practice accounting because one of its two predecessor firms had audited the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.
Ernst & Young was formed last year by the merger of Ernst & Whinney and Arthur Young. Lincoln Savings and Loan, a subsidiary of the American Continental Corporation, had been an audit client of Arthur Young in 1986 and 1987. 
 Young resigned the account in late 1988, about seven months before Lincoln went into receivership. The collapse of Lincoln resulted in huge losses for the Government, which had to mount a costly bailout to protect depositors, and for American Continental's investors, whose securities turned out to be worthless. Roughly $200 million of American Continental debentures were sold to California residents after the issuance of the 1987 financial statements.
 
Lack of Warning Cited
 California's Board of Accountancy charged Arthur Young with being "grossly negligent" for approving financial statements that failed to give investors or regulators any warning of American Continental's true financial condition.
In particular, it contends that the accounting treatment of eight real estate transactions, booked by Lincoln in 1987, violated generally accepted accounting principles and inflated American Continental's pretax earnings by $62 million.
The Nov. 16 action, first reported in The Los Angeles Times yesterday, is highly unusual for a state licensing board, and it could result in severe penalties for Ernst & Young, ranging from probation to a revocation of its license, at a time when the firm is already under financial pressure because of a soft economy, an expensive merger and several costly lawsuits related to the savings and loan crisis.
 
 A Previous Case
 "This is really in a class by itself," said Michael R. Granen, California's Deputy Attorney General, who is the lead attorney representing the board in the action. He said he could recall only one instance in which California canceled a license of a major accounting firm before, and it was not onerous since the firm, KMG Main Hurdman, was merging at the time into Peat Marwick and thus no longer needed its old license to practice.
The Ernst & Young action is not expected to be reviewed by an administrative law judge for at least six months.
An Ernst & Young spokesman said the firm would "vigorously defend" itself in the action and expected to prevail.
But Mr. Granen disagreed.
"We have conducted our own investigation, including a review of the work papers of Arthur Young and we believe that based on the information they had, they never should have been booked," he said.

HEADLINE: Dow Soars by 30.70 on Gulf Peace Hopes

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Another steep decline in crude oil prices plus renewed investor sentiment that the Persian Gulf crisis may soon end peaceably helped pushed stocks sharply higher yesterday. Trading was the heaviest since mid-October.
Leading the market rally, the New York Stock Exchange financial index jumped nearly 3.5 percent, as a broad list of financial stocks advanced sharply after the Fed eliminated rules requiring banks to keep 3 percent of certain kinds of commercial deposits in reserve. 
 With the price of oil plunging $3.37 a barrel, to $27.29, the Dow transportation index moved nearly 2.5 percent higher and airline and other transportation stocks gained strong ground.
Moving sharply higher for most of the session, the Dow Jones industrial average ended the day at 2,610.40, up 30.70 points.
 
Trading Activity Up Sharply
 Trading activity soared to 205.8 million shares, up sharply from 185.8 million on Tuesday. It was the highest volume since Oct. 19, when the total jumped to 221.5 million shares.
Showing that the rally spread through the broad market, 1,087 stocks were higher, with 28 rising to new highs, while 485 were lower, with 36 hitting new lows.
The Nasdaq composite index -- which is heavily oriented toward small high-tech stocks -- rose nearly 2 percent. Sun Microsystems, for examle, rose 2, to 22 3/4 in heavy trading.
On the Big Board, Digital Equipment rose 2, to 58, and Hewlett-Packard rose 2, to 33 3/8. NCR, which is under takeover attack from A.T.&T., jumped 3 1/8, to 86 5/8. A.T.&T., yesterday's most-active Big Board stock, fell 1/4, to 30 1/8, on 5.1 million shares.
"The price of oil has gone down quite a bit," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, "because Iraq accepted President Bush's offer for talks on a peaceful solution. Now there's some expectation that the probability of peace has gone up."
 
 Commodities Price Drop
 He said the market also rose sharply because the price of commodities, as reflected in the Commodity Research Bureau index, fell close to 1 percent. "That means the economy's probably getting deeper into recession," he said, "and the Fed is more likely to ease monetary policy, pushing interest rates down."
Still further evidence that the nation is now in a recession, he said, is expected tommorrow in new employment data. Economists expect employment to be down about 100,000 jobs, he said, forecasting that the Fed could lower interest rates one-quarter point by mid-December and another quarter-point toward the end of the year.
Eight of the Big Board's 10-most-active stocks were financial, all of which showed strong gains. Fannie Mae advanced 2 5/8, to 34 1/4, on 4.9 million shares, Citicorp 1 3/8, to 15 3/4, on 4.85 million and First Interstate of California 3 1/2, to 25 3/4, with 3.2 million shares changing hands.
Also on the active list, BankAmerica climbed 1 5/8, to 26 1/8; American Express 1 3/4, to 22 3/4; Chemical Bank 1, to 13 1/2; H. F. Amanson, the savings and loan company, 5/8, to 14 1/8 and the First Bank System of Minneapolis 1, to 14 3/4.
Toys "R" Us, which fell 7/8 Tuesday after two analysts cut their earnings estimates, fell another 5/8, to 22 7/8, in heavy trading after two more analysts issued negative comments. Pfizer fell 1 3/4, to 78 7/8, after Paul A. Brooke, drug analyst for Morgan, Stanley, said its Shiley heart valve could present new problems. Other drug stocks were strong.

HEADLINE: Archdiocese Plans Big Cuts In School Aid

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York has announced plans to cut subsidies to its parochial elementary schools by nearly half, a move that could reduce revenues of schools in poorer areas by 25 percent or more.
Diocesan officials have told the pastors and principals to submit proposals for economizing or raising new funds by Dec. 15. Some schools are holding meetings of parents or elected parish councils to discuss solutions. 
 The New York archdiocese, which covers Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island, Westchester and six other New York counties, has 243 parish elementary schools with an enrollment of 80,000 pupils. It also sponsors 29 diocesan or parish high schools with 16,000 students and a number of other educational programs.
 
'Money Is Tight'
 Two-thirds of the elementary schools receive subsidies, which supplement tuition revenues and parish funds. Their subsidies are scheduled to drop to $6 million from $11 million next year. Reductions are also expected for the high schools and other educational programs but have not yet been announced.
Msgr. Henry J. Mansell, Chancellor of the archdiocese, has attributed the financial problems in part to costly parish maintenance that was deferred for many years, increasing salaries of teachers and the movement of wealthier Catholics from the city to the suburbs.
"Yes, money is tight and we need to raise more of it," Joseph Zwilling, an archdiocesan spokesman, said. He stressed that the archdiocese was trying to plan ahead rather than suffer "panic," and that no school closings were planned at present.
In a Nov. 9 letter to the pastors and principals, Msgr. Hugh F. McManus, Vicar of Education for the New York archdiocese, said parochial school educators must craft a leaner school network, still capable of serving as many youngsters as it does now but in a more cost-effective way."
In poorer parishes, subsidies may provide more than half the school budget, although the bulk of support for most schools comes from tuition and parish Sunday collections.
Recently the elementary schools were grouped into clusters of two to six neighboring institutions to help bring about educational and financing efficiencies, diocesan officials said. They said the subsidy reductions would vary from cluster to cluster but school officials in several Bronx parishes reported being notified of 50 percent cuts, amounting to a quarter to one-third of their schools' budgets.
 
Little Growth From Tuition Seen
 Several school and parish officials, who said they preferred to remain anonymous while their clusters were still consulting with the archdiocese about the reductions, expressed similar doubts about finding ways of cutting costs by consolidating programs or reducing services.
They also said that schools could not expect much more revenue from tuition. One Bronx pastor said that parochial schools in his area, where half the families have incomes under $10,000, charged $750 to $1,000 tuition per student to parish members, with a sliding scale for families with more than one child enrolled.
One educator, who is not part of the archdiocese, said there is little left to cut in schools in poor areas. "Part of my fear is that the schools most in need will be taking the cuts," said Brother Brian Carty, headmaster of De La Salle Academy, an independent high school operated by the Christian Brothers religious order in Manhattan.
"There's no fat in these schools," he said. "They wring every last bit out of every dollar they get."

HEADLINE: Two Soviet Cultural Paths Cross in Washington

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Nikolai N. Gubenko, the actor and film director who became the Soviet Minister of Culture just under a year ago, and Dmitri S. Likhachev, a venerated scholar of the Russian past, made separate pilgrimages to America last month, their agendas providing eloquent evidence of the complementary roles played by two of the most dominant figures in Soviet culture today.
Mr. Gubenko, 49 years old, whose visit was sponsored by the United States Information Agency, recently ended a week of talks with the heads of Washington's cultural institutions to try to cement the connections that could bring life to his plans for a Soviet-American cultural center in Moscow, a joint-venture hotel that could bring much-needed hard currency to the arts in the Soviet Union and a broader series of cultural exchanges. 
 While Mr. Gubenko was looking for ways to pay for new creativity, Mr. Likhachev was looking for ways to renew his country's connection with its cultural past.
The 84-year-old Mr. Likhachev, whose visit was sponsored by Columbia University's Harriman Institute and the Library of Congress, was here primarily to lecture on Russian history and to do research in the Library of Congress on old Russian works that are unobtainable in the Soviet Union.
 
Linking 2 Traditions
 He also reached out to Russian emigres and the Russian Orthodox Church in Exile, trying to forge links between the traditions preserved by Russians abroad and the revival of religious and secular Russian traditions in art, music, education and scholarship now under way from Leningrad to Siberia.
"In a way, Gubenko is the minister for culture, the advocate, and Likhachev is the minister of culture, the keeper of the flame," said Jane A. Taubman, a professor of Russian at Amherst College who specializes in contemporary Soviet culture.
But both men, the elderly scholar who grew up steeped in the traditions of the St. Petersburg intelligentsia, and the wartime orphan who grew up surrounded by squalor, poverty and Communist zeal, share a vision of culture as a binding tie that could help prevent the economic and political atomization of the Soviet Union.
They also represent President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's continuing if fraying links to the intelligentsia. The support of Mr. Gubenko and Mr. Likhachev, a member of the Congress of People's deputies, lends a scholarly resonance to Mr. Gorbachev's views at a time when other leading intellectuals, from the historian Yuri N. Afanasyev to the head of the film makers' union, Elem G. Klimov, to the poet Oles Adamovich, have become outspoken critics of his policies.
 
The Many Russias
 It was not as advocates for Mr. Gorbachev but as advocates for cultural renewal that they visited the United States -- Mr. Gubenko to study the financial underpinnings of cultural enterprises like the Kennedy Center, the Smithsonian Institution and the arts and humanities endowments, and Mr. Likhachev to argue forcefully that the rich legacy of Russian culture deserves material support from abroad so that the paint on icons doesn't flake away for lack of humidity and the ravaged churches do not molder in disuse when there are new possibilities for restoration and reuse.
"Likhachev gave a brilliant talk about how many Russias there have always been," said James Billington, the Librarian of Congress, who is a noted scholar of Russian cultural history. "He talked eloquently about the Russia of the far north, the Russia of the eastern Baltic, the section of Novgorod that was inhabited largely by Finnish people, the Russia of Odessa, which was essentially a Jewish culture.
"He was making the point that the recovery of memory and of the Russian tradition is not a recovery of a narrow chauvinism but of a sense of the richness and complexity of the Russians' own past."
Mr. Gubenko said in an interview: "Certainly no one thinks that culture should be put above everyday needs. But there is a desire to have things of the spirit as well. Cultural processes in our country could stabilize our society when it is beginning to crack apart."
Mr. Likhachev sees evidence that the Russian tradition of scholarship and the links to Europe forged by Western-looking Russians since the time of Peter the Great at the beginning of the 18th century are being renewed, particularly in the changing Soviet schools. The amount of work going into the educational and cultural revivals, he said, puts the lie to Westerners who would dismiss Russians as lazy or greedy or interested only in themelves.
 
Changes in the Schools
 "You now have middle schools that have been changed into European gymnasiums, where they study Latin, ancient Greek and the classical tradition," Mr. Likhachev said in an interview. "You have young teen-agers, people in the 8th or 9th form, being taken out to learn the history of their neighborhood in Leningrad, building by building. These are miraculous children."
He contrasted this revival with what he called the chauvinism of adherents of the anti-Semitic Russian nationalist group Pamyat, saying that their understanding of Russian history was superficial, born not of a love of their own culture but of a hatred of others. "A year ago," he said, "I would have been happy to wear a lapel pin with the red, white and blue Russian flag. Now that the three-colored flag has become associated with them, I am reluctant to wear it."
The tug-of-war in Mr. Likhachev's world is between the westward-looking advocates of a Russian culture integrated with its neighbors and the Slavophiles' efforts to distance themselves from non-Russian cultures. In Mr. Gubenko's world, there is a different sort of dynamic. After three years of cultural offerings, particularly films and drama, focused on the Communist legacies of betrayal and destruction -- reviving the long-suppressed memories of a past that was long denied -- Mr. Gubenko wants to find some positive focus for the creativity unleashed by Mr. Gorbachev's policies.
One solution, he said, is more exchanges with the West, with a particular emphasis not on the big-name cultural attractions of the past but on smaller regional theater, music and dance ensembles, which can give a sense of "the moral regeneration of Russian culture in the provinces."
Both men say the countryside is the wellspring of Russian culture.
For Mr. Likhachev, the revival of Russian culture is centered as much in small centers like Yaroslavl as in Moscow or his own city, Leningrad. "It irritates me when people from Moscow get on steamboats and go off to tell small-town audiences, 'Restore your churches,' when the people doing the lecturing don't have any idea of what's going on, and the churches are already being restored by local organizations," he said.
Mr. Gubenko agrees. "The moral basis of our culture is in the provinces," he said.
What is needed to stimulate cultural development, both men said, is cash and cross-fertilization with other cultures. Mr. Likhachev said he would like to maintain contacts with the people who preserved Russian culture in exile.
He would also like to see the novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn return to the Soviet Union from the United States because of his legendary stature as the man who told the truth about Stalinism and prison camps and because his presence would stimulate debate over his prescription for a separatist Russian state.
Mr. Solzhenitsyn has said he will not return until all his works are freely available in the Soviet Union. But Mr. Likhachev, perhaps thinking of his own life as a cultural icon, suggested another reason for hesitation. "I understand why he doesn't want to come," he said. "He wouldn't be able to work. Everyone would want him. He'd be pulled apart."

Giants Need Remedy For Streaking Vikings

BYLINE: By GERALD ESKENAZI, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Dec. 5

 BODY:
Losses? Did someone around here lose two straight en route to a perfect season? Does anyone have to play the Minnesota Vikings, the hottest team in the league?
Coach Bill Parcells barely conceded today that his Giants' losses meant anything in the grander scheme of things. After all, it's how you finish, he said. 
 Perhaps. But this is what he told his players today, their first day back after the 7-3 loss Monday night to the San Francisco 49ers:
"I told the bumps-and-bruises guys, 'I don't need you three weeks from now. I need you now.' "
 
'Must-Win Situation'
 His team needs a victory. In fact, Carl Banks called it a "must-win situation."
That is why Parcells is not suffering his injured players gladly, and that includes the left tackle Jumbo Elliott, who has an injured left leg and hasn't played in two months. Meanwhile, another starter on the offensive line, Eric Moore, turned his left ankle in the 49ers' loss.
Parcells admitted he might have to pick up an unemployed free agent lineman for use against the the streaking Vikings, who come into Giants Stadium next Sunday. They have won five straight games after a 1-6 start.
But the Vikings have not won outdoors this season, and since 1988 they are 1-11 when they play outside the Metrodome.
A victory (or a Philadelphia and Washington loss) guarantees the Giants the National Conference East division title. The Giants won their first 10 games. Then came the Eagles and 49ers. Last year, the Giants also faced those two teams, in reverse order, and lost. Their record was 9-4. Now it's 10-2. The Giants won their next game last year, defeating the Super Bowl-bound Denver Broncos.
 
Banks Back
 "That situation was similar to this one," contended Banks, the outside linebacker who returned last Monday from wrist surgery and got into 10 plays.
"It was a must-win situation," he said. "We have a little more of a comfort zone, but we have to address it like a must-win situation. The picture isn't as pretty as it was at 10-0."
Will these two losses affect the Giants' ability to focus on the Vikings?
"I don't think that will be a problem," said Parcells, addressing the divisional and conference races. "There's a lot of things unsettled right now. Things will change a lot. A loss, or two or three, in the middle of the season, really, will not be how you're judged. You're judged not by the middle of the season but by the end."
Parcells also disclosed that his place-kicker, Matt Bahr, injured his back in the first half against the 49ers. Parcells insisted that did not influence his decision to go for the touchdown on fourth-and-goal from the 9 late in the game. A field goal would have brought the Giants within a point, but they would have needed another field goal from Bahr to win. The fourth-down pass play failed.
 
Bahr Practices
 Bahr's backache did not keep him out of today's practice. He kicked off, although none were booming shots. Raul Allegre, who began the season until suffering a groin injury, has been healthy for several weeks.
There has been no letup for the Giants these last few weeks. The Vikings are followed by the Buffalo Bills, currently leading the American Conference East.
"I'd rather have a bunch of hard games down the stretch rather than easy teams," Lawrence Taylor said bravely. "So you know how you can play in the playoffs."
And when practice was over, Fred Hoaglin, the offensive line coach, said of his injured players, "Moore's not as bad and Jumbo looked a little better."
They had to be. Parcells needs them now.
 
Bavaro Suspension Unlikely
 Although the league has not come to a decision on Mark Bavaro, it appears unlikely the tight end will be suspended. He was ejected from the Eagles game for making contact with an official, but films do not indicate that the official fell as a result of Bavaro's actions. . . . Jerry Burns, the Vikings' coach, was asked about his team's record away from the Metrodome. "We win on the road," he said. "We won in Seattle and Detroit." Both were in domed stadiums. . . . Erik Howard (calf), the nose tackle, and Lee Rouson (groin), the backup running back, are also nursing injuries that Parcells predicts will not sideline them.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Trusting Our Allies

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"Will they be with us?" asked Senator Joseph Biden about our Persian Gulf allies, at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing yesterday.
He was irritated at the we'll-hold your-coat attitude of the Soviet Union and others, but incensed at the "echoes of 25 years ago" in the position taken by Senator Jesse Helms.
That official media heavy had said he considered open hearings a mistake, said he would submit written questions in private -- "one of them which is extremely sensitive" -- and then (wrongheadedly) stalked off to fiddle with Senate ethics. 
 What was that byplay all about? What impelled Mr. Helms to hint at the security riskiness of hearings, and Mr. Biden to accuse Mr. Helms of McCarthyism?
If my suspicion is correct, both of these quite different Senators were coming at the same subject in characteristically divergent ways: they were concerned about the trustworthiness of the nations coalesced with us against Saddam Hussein.
Senator Helms may (or may not) have been alluding to a belief being bruited about for the past 10 days by a minority of world spookery that Saudi Arabia, in understandable panic just after the invasion of Kuwait, tried to obtain nuclear warheads for its missiles from China.
I hesitated to write about this speculation because I cannot confirm it, and did not want to discredit the solid information from other sources printed in this space (since publicly confirmed) about the Iraqi attempt to acquire an atomic device soon and weaponry within a few years.
But the concern is half out of the bag; let's examine the possibility as an exercise in intelligence evaluation.
This we know: Three years ago, China secretly sold CSS-2 "East Wind" missiles, with a range of 2,200 miles, to Saudi Arabia. The delivery was made via Islamabad, Pakistan, to three bases in the "Empty Quarter," between Riyadh and Jidda. About 500 Chinese technicians accompanied the missiles, suggesting that the missiles cannot be fired without Beijing's O.K.
We learned of this deal a year later. In China, the same type of missile carries nuclear warheads; why do the Saudis need a missile of that range, accuracy and huge cost if the payload is only a conventional bomb?
Comes the invasion of Kuwait. The Saudi King looks catastrophe to his kingdom in the face. He reverses policy by welcoming a huge force of Americans, and also (the spook minority thinks) asks the Chinese, with whom he has just established diplomatic and economic relations, for the rest of the order -- nuclear tips on the missiles in place.
The only evidence that the worriers point to is this: In the month after the August invasion of Kuwait, 500 more Chinese technicians arrived at the three missile bases, where 12 of the 36 missiles are operational. And a second link has been added to encrypted communication from the desert bases, to which the U.S. is denied access.
No big deal, says the majority; an expanded bureaucracy could be calling home more often. Overriding consideration: A proud China would hardly jeopardize its world standing for a bundle of Saudi money, or double-cross us in secret a second time.
I'm inclined to discount the story and go with the majority because the Israelis, with the most at risk, grumble about the missiles but do not sound an alarm about supposed attempts to buy nuclear warheads.
Although the request is unverifiable and the shipment highly unlikely, the expressed concern of a portion of the once-fooled intelligence community is a fact. With some vividness, it illustrates the degree of distrust that permeates relations among "the allies."
That distrust is well placed. The alliance is a bedfellowship of temporarily parallel interests.
To Senator Biden's pertinent question, "Who will be with us?" Secretary Baker replied: "There might or might not be soft spots."
We trust the British; we three-quarters trust the Turks, whom Iraqis fear most; we half-trust the French, who want to cut a deal, and the Egyptians and Saudis, who would serve in Kuwait but not Iraq; we quarter-trust the Chinese and Soviets; and we wholly distrust the terrorist Syrians, who would turn on us in a flash. Outside the fragile coalition, we trust the Israelis, who can be counted on in the crunch.
Who will be with us? Let's hope the vote-avoiding Congress does not turn out to be the softest spot of all.

HEADLINE: A Tradition Of Assisting The Neediest

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
For some of those who give to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, the annual gift is a family tradition, like an heirloom, passed down from generation to generation. But unlike grandmother's tea set or souvenir from the World's Fair, it does not slowly become a valuable antique -- and many givers willingly reach a little deeper each year to counter the ravages of inflation along with those of poverty.
Attached to Albert J. Elias's check for $500 was a note that read, "Pleased I can continue the support of the Neediest Cases my mother began over 60 years ago." Harry Harlem, a Bronx pawnbroker, sent $50, a practice that his mother began more than 50 years ago. And Dr. Virginia Miles of Englewood, N.J., has sent in a contribution for 65 consecutive years. 
 Dr. Miles recently wrote: "When I was 9 in 1925, my allowance was 20 cents a week. My parents suggested I share with the '100 Neediest.' I sent 10 cents glued to a sheet of paper -- half my income!" Since then, Dr. Miles has continued to give to the Neediest Cases, including $150 this year.
 
A 'Reflex Action'
 In a telephone interview yesterday, Dr. Miles, a marketing consultant with a doctorate in psychology, said that contributing to the Neediest Cases has become a "reflex action."
"It makes me feel a little less ashamed of how terrible things have become," she said. "Here we are, one of the richest countries in the world, and we have people lying in the streets."
The fund was established in 1912 by the publisher of The New York Times, Adolph S. Ochs, to help the sick and poor in New York.
This year, $1,296,407.55 has been raised so far, and the proceeds will be distributed among seven charities, to be used for direct assistance for the needy. The New York Times pays for the campaign's overhead.
Mrs. Lenore G. Whitehorn of Scarsdale, N.Y., sent in her 50th consecutive contribution last week. She has been giving to the Neediest Cases Fund since her grandmother died in 1940.
"I remember years and years ago how my grandmother, Ida Elbe, would always send something in to the Neediest Cases," Mrs. Whitehorn said yesterday in a telephone interview. "I adored her, and I thought that this was the most fitting memorial I could give."
"It gives me a good feeling when there's so much going on that's rotten," Mrs. Whitehorn added.

HEADLINE: New York City Will Lose in Federal Road Plan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "U.S. Plans a Shift on Road Spending" (front-page, Nov. 23), you fail to point out that the Federal Government's new proposal for highway spending would put New York City's highways and bridges at risk of being orphaned.
You state that more roads would be covered by the new Federal policy. However, the number of city roads eligible for the majority of Federal funding could drop to 16 percent of the number now covered. When that is included with the new formula for funding, which is based heavily on gas consumption and mileage, New York City stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars each year.
Without the necessary Federal funding, our roads will deteriorate, fail to receive important safety modifications, engender further congestion and, overall, depress the economy of our region and that of the entire country.
New Yorkers are not afraid to contribute to infrastructure rebuilding. The Federal Government should recognize its shared responsibility in an infrastructure that feeds the national economy. New York wants a partnership with the Federal Government. The Bush Administration is looking for a divorce.
You also point out the Federal Government's untimely and misguided policy on taxation of alternative fuels. With alternative fuels in their infancy, the Federal Government should be providing incentives for their use, rather than discouraging them by suggesting taxes.
