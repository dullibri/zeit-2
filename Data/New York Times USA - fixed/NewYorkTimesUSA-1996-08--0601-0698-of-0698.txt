HEADLINE: A Spate of Red Tides Menacing Coastal Seas

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
LIKE something out of a horror movie, the cell from hell attacks its victims in gruesome ways, frequently changing its body form with lightning speed. The unicellular animal, called Pfiesteria piscida, has at least 24 guises it can assume in the course of its lifetime. It can also masquerade as a plant or lie dormant for years in the absence of suitable prey.
Armed with a voracious appetite and vast reproductive powers, the microscopic animal moves through coastal waters to kill fish and shellfish by the millions and to poison anglers and others, producing pain, narcosis, disorientation, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, memory loss, immune failure and personality changes. Its toxins are so deadly that people who merely inhale its vapors can be badly hurt. 
 "This thing has us scared to death," said Rick Dove, the expert who has been appointed to keep track of the Neuse River in North Carolina, part of a coastal estuary where the organism periodically goes on killing sprees. "This river is our lifeblood. If it goes belly up, everything goes belly up."
Anything but a rare organism, Pfiesteria has scores of toxic cousins that appear to be multiplying around the globe, mainly as algae but sometimes as zooplankton and, most conspicuously, as red and brown tides.
Some ecologists believe there is a serious global epidemic of these marine microorganisms. They fear that their toxic tides may upset the natural balance of the oceans and are urging action to reduce the runoff of sewage and other nutritive substances that seem to promote the poisonous blooms.
Other experts are more cautious, conceding that the number of reported incidents is up but withholding judgment on whether this is anything more than an upturn in a natural cycle, with more observers filing reports on the scourge.
A growing fear, intriguing but unconfirmed, is that nutrient runoff from human development, the heavy use of fertilizers and livestock farms is feeding the growth of the marauding swarms. If this is true, it bodes ill, given the global spread of the phosphorous and nitrogen from human sewage, animal waste and fertilizers that is increasingly polluting freshwater streams flowing into coastal estuaries.
"There's a correlation between increased nutrients in coastal waters and increased frequency of phytoplankton blooms," said Dr. Jane Lubchenco, a prominent ecologist at Oregon State University who studies the workings of the intertidal zone. "But that's not causation. It smells like it, but the evidence is skimpy."
Studies of the deadly blooms are accelerating, if only because the tiny killers have been found to harbor poisons one thousand times as toxic than cyanide, strong enough to kill humans.
"People in Washington are beginning to realize that you can't attack this with Band-Aids," said Dr. Donald M. Anderson, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod, who is an expert on red tides. "Every single coastal state has this problem in one form or another."
"Everybody agrees that the impact and number of reported events are increasing," Dr. Anderson added. "At the very least, in many areas of the world we are adding nutrients in the form of pollution into coastal waters, and that seems to be producing more harmful blooms."
Red tides are nothing new. The Bible says the Egyptians were plagued by a blood-red tide that fouled the Nile and killed fish. Homer's Iliad reports similar woes, and the Red Sea is probably named after the noxious blooms.
The suspicion is that natural cycles of bloom and bust are expanding into a global menace. For scientific sleuths, the challenge is to find clues that allow natural causes and cycles to be distinguished from ones that are altogether unnatural.
"The question is whether human effects are prompting an increase in the frequency, virulence or the types of organisms," said Dr. Peter Franks, a red-tide expert at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif.
Red tides, he noted, are only occasionally red, also appearing as orange, brown and even green. And they never occur literally as tides, which are the rises and falls of the sea.
The preferred terms for the phenomena are harmful algal blooms (which kill things), noxious algal blooms (which smell bad) and exceptional algal blooms (which are visually striking but do no direct harm). Unfortunately, even nontoxic blooms can kill marine animals by depleting oxygen in the water.
Moreover, the danger is entirely invisible at times. "The organisms are often in such low densities that there's nothing to see," said Dr. Franks of Scripps. "Almost every year, we have red tides that are barely visible."
A main constituent of red tides is algae, an ancient group of primitive plants dating to the first terrestrial life. The microscopic killers in most cases are algae that occur in the form of dinoflagellates, tiny unicellular organisms that usually photosynthesize and contain chlorophyll but that also have the animal-like trait of bearing twin tails, which whirl the organism forward.
Some dinoflagellates move vertically in response to light, living near surface waters during the day and diving toward the bottom to feed in nutrient-rich waters at night.
A bloom develops when the dinoflagellates photosynthesize and multiply rapidly, thriving on dissolved nutrients and sunlight. The toxins from their bodies in many cases appear to be defensive shields against zooplankton and other aquatic grazers, making the killers unappetizing.
Harm to humans often occurs when clams, mussels, oysters or scallops eat the dinoflagellates and accumulate toxins. Typically, the shellfish themselves are affected only slightly, but a single clam can sometimes pack enough poison to kill a human.
In the past decade, the number of known dinoflagellate species that are toxic has risen globally, to 55 from 22. Outbreaks once found only around the coastal areas of Europe and the United States now occur around the globe, including near Asia and South America.
Unfortunately, scientists are discovering that dinoflagellates can attack humans not only indirectly, via shellfish, but directly. No example is more gruesome than that of Pfiesteria piscida.
The baffling case began in the late 1980's, when scientists in North Carolina puzzled over large fish kills in which the victims were often covered with open, bleeding sores. A battery of tests ruled out fungi, bacteria, heavy metals and pesticides as the culprit. Finally, after much research, a bizarre dinoflagellate was uncovered by scientists at North Carolina State University at Raleigh and was studied in detail by Dr. JoAnn M. Burkholder, an aquatic ecologist there.
Pfiesteria piscida turned out to be not just a new species in a new genus but a whole new family of life. It kills in fresh water or sea water, but it is deadliest in polluted brackish waters where the salinity is a little less than half that of the sea.
Researchers have found that unlike most toxic algae, the dinoflagellates dispense their poisons directly into the environment, to paralyze their prey, rather than harboring them internally.
After Dr. Burkholder's co-workers got stomach cramps and other symptoms, she moved her research in April 1993 into a special room at the university meant to keep toxins isolated. But the facility leaked. Dr. Burkholder and her assistant, Dr. Howard B. Glasgow Jr., suffered a rash of illnesses, including nausea, vomiting, headaches, burning eyes, memory lapses, breathing difficulty, mood swings, impaired speech and skin lesions on their hands and forearms. During the last exposure, Dr. Glasgow was nearly overcome and ending up fleeing the facility on his hands and knees.
The lab was closed for more than a year, until July 1995, for sealing and strengthening. It was reopened only after close inspection by biological warfare experts from the Defense Department.
"Now it's a biohazard Level 3 facility," Dr. Burkholder said in an interview. "That's above rabies and on a par with AIDS. We're erring on the side of caution. We want to make sure nobody gets hurt."
Dr. Burkholder has discovered that the microscopic animal has an arsenal of disguises and life styles that make it extremely difficult to track through its watery environment. Of its 24 known life stages, 19 have been connected to particular survival strategies, but 5 remain mysterious.
"It can transform from an amoeba to a toxic zoospore in two minutes," she said. "Nobody believed that until we had people come in and watch it. Nobody had seen that before in dinoflagellates."
The animal can lay hidden on the bottom of an estuary for years in its cyst stage, awaiting an as-yet-unidentified chemical signal that says fish are nearby and prompts the dinoflagellate to come alive.
"The zoospores make toxins that are shed into the water, basically drugging the fish and making them lethargic," Dr. Burkholder said. "The toxins can rip a hole through the skin of the fish, causing bleeding sores, although some fish die so quickly that no sores develop."
In laboratory tests, Dr. Burkholder has shown that the dinoflagellate's growth and reproduction are stimulated by phosphate enrichment that is typical of the levels found in the Neuse and Pamlico Rivers in North Carolina, which have been stricken repeatedly by large fish kills and are part of the nation's second largest estuary, sheltered by the Outer Banks. Such enrichment seems to work indirectly, causing the multiplication of algae, which the dinoflagellates feed on in addition to fish.
The killer also appears to be stimulated directly by human and animal sewage, which it uses for its metabolism. Politically and economically, this is a touchy subject because North Carolina has grown in recent years to become one of the nation's top hog producers and swine excrement is implicated in the fish kills.
"I was threatened twice last summer" by anonymous telephone callers, Dr. Burkholder said. "It was, if I knew what was good for me, I would drop the research -- only more bluntly than that."
But she is continuing her research. "This is the only dinoflagellate known to have a life cycle this complex," she added. "Now that we know what to look for, I think we'll find lots of others."
Such detective work is increasingly common. After months of urgent research, scientists at the University of Miami concluded in July that a red-tide toxin caused by a different dinoflagellate was responsible for a record number of manatee deaths in Florida this year.
The finding was hailed as a major step toward understanding the threats facing the manatee, a 10-foot endangered mammal famous for its gentleness. Of the 304 manatee deaths so far this year, 158 have been linked to red-tide toxins, with the rest stemming from such ordinary causes as infant mortality and old age.
If the red scourge is indeed spreading and caused by nutrients from human development, experts say, then it is easy to envision a number of possible controls, like decreasing the runoffs and nutrients going into rivers. In the United States, such work has been a high priority for years, though environmentalists tend to fault the pace of remedial work by the Federal Government as too slow.
"Mitigation can run the gambit from better prediction, to pollution control, to improving strategies employed in agriculture," said Dr. Anderson, of Woods Hole. "If fish farmers know a red tide is coming, they can move cages."
Mr. Dove, the river keeper for the Neuse River in North Carolina, as well as a lawyer and former Marine Corps colonel, said that all the signs in his area pointed to the problem's origin lying in the rapid growth of agribusiness and factory farms and that the logical solutions centered on them as well.
"This river's been out of whack since 1991," he said. "Around that same time, we got big in the hog industry. We don't know if that's the only problem. But we know that they're producing more fecal waste than all the people in the state of New York."
"This is one of the most beautiful rivers in the country," he added, speaking of the Neuse. "Now it's a great embarrassment. It should never have been allowed to get to this point. Pfiesteria has been around since the beginning of time. But it's sure out of control now."

GRAPHIC: Diagrams: "Cell's Many Guises"
A one-cell animal, Pfiesteria piscida, is the cause of dangerous red tides, which may be linked to farm waste. The organism has 24 different stages, including flagellated cells that feed on bits of fish, bristly cysts and several ameobic forms.
 
"Toxic Predator"
The toxins produced by Pfiesteria piscida (shown below in cyst stage) are powerful enough to tear bleeding sores in fish, like the menhaden above, and to sicken humans. The organism has caused a number of fish kills in the Neuse and Pamlico Rivers in North Carolina. The region has seen a recent increase in hog farming, and waste from these farms may support the growth of the organism. (pg. C1)

HEADLINE: Pushing Lemons Over State Lines;
Consumer Advocates Seek Uniform Faulty-Car Laws

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
Daniel Garcia, Karen Melvin and Wade Wilson did not know each other, but each adopted the same unusual driving practice -- grabbing a towel along with the car keys on rainy days.
Ms. Melvin, of Minneapolis, and Mr. Wilson, of Champaign, Ill., each unsuspectingly bought a leaky Dodge Caravan that the Chrysler Corporation had repurchased from Mr. Garcia in Virginia after he successfully sued for a refund under the state's lemon law in 1992. 
 "To say it doesn't have a problem and pay top dollar, that's a rip," said Ms. Melvin, who also sued Chrysler, settling when the company bought the mini-van for $15,000 in 1994.
Another angry driver is Keith M. Hanover of Boyes Hot Springs, Calif. He learned the 1991 Jeep Wrangler he bought used was officially a lemon only when he was subpoenaed to testify at a recent hearing by California's Department of Motor Vehicles. That agency is scheduled to hold another hearing in Sacramento today on its threat of a 60-day ban on sales of new cars by Chrysler, which it has accused of lemon-law violations. While other companies have been fined for such violations, none have ever faced a sales ban.
"This is a scam," Mr. Hanover said. "Between the dealer, the auction and Chrysler, everyone says it's someone else's fault."
Chrysler denies wrongdoing. But complaints about lemons -- problem cars and trucks bought back by manufacturers -- are hardly limited to a single car maker. Consumer advocates say state laws controlling the resale of such vehicles are variable in strength and widely flouted -- objections that for the first time are drawing attention in Washington, where the Federal Trade Commission is deciding whether to impose a national lemon resale standard.
Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, or CARS -- a group based in Sacramento, which with the National Association of Attorneys General had petitioned the F.T.C. to take up the issue -- estimates that auto makers repurchase 50,000 cars and trucks as lemons each year, or one-third of 1 percent of the 15 million sold annually.
The big problem, consumer groups say, is interstate transit of faulty vehicles. They accuse auto makers of exploiting "lemon loopholes" to move vehicles through states like Idaho, Kansas, Massachusetts, Montana, Illinois and Minnesota that have relatively weak lemon statutes.
Manufacturers flatly reject the charge.
"We don't engage in lemon laundering," said Lewis H. Goldfarb, Chrysler's general counsel. He called the Garcia-Melvin-Wilson experience with the Dodge Caravan a "horrible" exception.
"Dealers not passing on disclosures are few and far between," added Kendall J. Tough, manager of regional compliance for the General Motors Corporation.
Still, law enforcement officials say each link in the wholesale used-car chain -- manufacturer, auto auction and dealer -- can easily shirk liability for meeting requirements for lemon disclosure because enforcement ends at state lines.
Since California and Connecticut led the way in 1982, all states have adopted lemon laws. Generally, buyers are allowed to return new vehicles during the warranty period if a defect has not been corrected after four attempts or if the vehicle is out of service for 30 days for any combination of defects. But there are big differences among the states about how much information must be disclosed to subsequent buyers of such vehicles.
Among the proposals before the F.T.C. is that auto makers be required to re-register the titles of all repurchased vehicles with notations like "Warranty Return." That would include vehicles determined to be lemons by a court or arbitrator, as well as vehicles repurchased voluntarily by an auto maker after a consumer complains -- "good will" buybacks, as they are known. The information would be included in a national vehicle title data base accessible to consumers.
The F.T.C. plans a public forum on the proposals Oct. 3, with a staff recommendation on action to follow.
Auto makers support a uniform law but object to subjecting good will buybacks to the lemon-law stigma.
"We're trying to satisfy customers," said Mr. Tough of G.M. "That doesn't mean the vehicle is toxic waste." G.M. successfully lobbied in Indiana to change the phrasing on titles from "Defective Vehicle Buyback" to "Manufacturer's Buyback."
Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut's Attorney General, argues that the F.T.C. should not exempt goodwill buybacks from a national resale disclosure law. His state found that three times as many vehicles were repurchased voluntarily -- outside the lemon-law program -- as following a formal complaint.
Similarly, an analysis of 1995 lemons in Washington State by Peter L. Maier, a Seattle lawyer, found that vehicles bought back prior to arbitration had at least as many serious defects as those acquired afterward.
"We have enormous wealth tied up in vehicles and they are routinely traded with little information," Mr. Maier said, adding that auto makers, auction houses and dealers shared "an economic incentive to not be too careful."
High demand for late-model used vehicles means lemons can easily be resold. If the vehicles can be repaired, auto makers say, they are typically auctioned off to their own dealers. Officials in Connecticut, Florida and Washington say there is little evidence that lemons with safety hazards are being resold. But in California's suit against Chrysler, regulators say the vast majority of vehicles had safety problems. Nationally, Chrysler, with 12 percent of the market, said in its F.T.C. filing that it had repurchased 5,100 of its vehicles last year, while G.M., with 31 percent of the market, said in its F.T.C. filing that it had repurchased 46,000 vehicles.
In its suit, California accused Chrysler of having resold 119 lemons without adequate disclosure. Keith A. Levy, an administrative law judge, found violations in 116 cases. The hearing that is scheduled for today in Sacramento is to determine if the proposed 60-day ban on new car sales would have "unintended economic impact on consumers, local governments and dealers," according to papers filed by the Department of Motor Vehicles.
Mr. Goldfarb of Chrysler, who is fighting the suspension, said the violations were the unintentional result of confusion following a 1989 revision in the state's lemon law.
Mr. Hanover, the Wrangler owner who was subpoenaed to testify in the case, said he had signed a disclosure notice that stated that a brake drum had been replaced on the vehicle. But the notice, he said, did not mention clutch failure, which his Jeep experienced, or that the previous owner had to replace the clutch slave cylinder three times in 9,000 miles.
"I was so angry," he said. "The only person really hurt is the consumer."
CARS contends that unsuspecting consumers are routinely duped, paying full retail prices for lemons whose repair records are played down or concealed.
In the case of the Dodge Caravan declared a lemon in Virginia, Ms. Melvin later bought the mini-van from a Chrysler dealer in Minnesota. Its sticker read "buyback," which the salesman told her referred to a minor water leak that had been repaired. She found otherwise when water spilled into her lap after a rain.
After Chrysler bought the van back from Ms. Melvin, it went to a rebuilder in Minnesota. Mr. Wilson bought it from him. Their saga was featured on ABC's "Prime Time Live" program on Feb. 28. Still, it is far from unique.
"The patchwork of state laws creates an incentive for dealers to move cars to exploit the lack of disclosure in other states," Mr. Blumenthal of Connecticut said in a recent interview. The state reported to the F.T.C. that 75 percent of the 200 vehicles repurchased in Connecticut in the last two years were resold out of state.
Auto makers deny intentionally moving cars to states with less strict laws. "It's a lie," said Mr. Tough of G.M. Used-car auctions typically draw dealers from several states, he said.
G.M. intends by early next year to start a follow-up program with customers who buy repurchased vehicles, a first in the industry. By polling customers directly, G.M. will not only make sure they know a vehicle's history, but will also find out if dealers are following the auto maker's disclosure policies.
Connecticut, California, Utah and Maryland have the nation's most comprehensive lemon laws, broadly defining lemons to include those repurchased by auto makers voluntarily. Fifteen states require auto makers to report buybacks to regulators, but only four states require reports of resales.
Sixteen states require the titles of lemons be "branded" with notations that vary from Utah's "Nonconforming Vehicle" to Vermont's "Defect Substantially Impairs Use, Value or Safety." Six states require window or door frame buyback stickers.
But enforcing requirements is another matter. Florida discovered last year that auto makers had made required reports on only 12 percent of 3,412 vehicles that were repurchased in the state between 1992 and 1994.
"An inference can be drawn that if the department did not receive the form, consumers likewise were uninformed that vehicles they purchased were resold 'lemons,' " Robert Butterworth, the state's Attorney General, said in a filing with the F.T.C.
As a result, Florida began investigating repurchases by 20 auto makers, the most comprehensive attempt so far to delve into industry practices. California and New York have investigated individual auto makers for lemon-law violations, winning settlements since 1988 against Chrysler, G.M., Mercedes- Benz, Mitsubishi and Mazda.
"We could eliminate the problem with a $1 tax on new cars to set up a data bank," said Philip Nowicki, the former director of Florida's lemon-law arbitration program. "But any tax is politically incorrect."
Consumer advocates argue that lemon laws can have broad benefits for car owners. In Washington State, for example, just 580 vehicles have been declared lemons since the state's arbitration program began in 1988. But since the law can go into effect if a car is in for repairs for a certain number of days, some auto makers are rushing parts to Washington buyers, said Paul Corning, the assistant attorney general who runs the state's lemon arbitration program.

Chart: "In Some States, It's Buyer Beware"
 While all states have lemon laws, they are far from uniform in what they require dealers and manufactures to do with returned vehicles. Twelve states do not require that a prospective car buyer be told that a car was previously returned as a lemon, and only a handful carry over car titles branded with "lemon" status from other states. As a result, it is quite easy for lemons to shed their lemon label when they are resold. Chart lists some of the laws that states have enacted. (pg. D1)

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Eases Against the Yen On Talk of Rate Rise in Japan

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar declined against the yen yesterday after a top Japanese finance official said the nation's recovery was gaining, reviving talk of higher Japanese interest rates.
Currency traders also bought yen ahead of tomorrow's release of an important quarterly business survey in Japan, known as the Tankan. Any sign of an improved business climate in the Tankan survey could further strengthen the yen. 
 "There seemed to be a bit of selling of dollars for yen and selling of marks for yen," said Dennis Pettit, vice president for foreign exchange at the New York branch of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan. "We've got the Tankan report out Wednesday, and people are adjusting their positions ahead of that."
The yen's strength against the mark and other leading European currencies helped leave the dollar little changed in other foreign-exchange dealings.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 107.65 yen, down from 108 yen on Friday. The dollar also traded at 1.4787 German marks, up from 1.4783. The British pound rose to $1.5570 from $1.5560. Currency markets in London were closed for a bank holiday.
Traders began buying yen after Tadashi Ogawa, a Vice Minister of Finance, said at a news conference in Tokyo that "there's no doubt the economy is moving toward self-sustaining recovery" and that the uncertainty that prevailed over the last three to four years is gone.
Mr. Ogawa's remarks suggested that the Japanese central bank might start nudging up interest rates, which have remained at postwar lows for nearly a year, in an effort to stir the country out of its economic sluggishness. "If things are going to show a little rosier picture for the Japanese economy," said Stephen Flanagan of Credit Agricole in New York, "this reignites the possibility of higher rates."
The dollar's steadiness against the German mark came after the mark rallied on Friday on speculation that the Bundesbank was not likely to further reduce interest rates in the foreseeable future.
The German central bank made an unexpectedly large cut in the 14-day securities repurchase rate on Thursday, from 3.30 percent to 3 percent, to stimulate Germany's economy.

HEADLINE: U.A.W. Said to Prefer Talks With G.M. and Ford First, Chrysler Later

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 26

 BODY:
The United Automobile Workers union is leaning toward negotiating a new national labor contract first at the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, and leaving the Chrysler Corporation for later, people close to the union said today.
While Stephen P. Yokich, the U.A.W.'s president, could change his mind, the current consensus at the union is that negotiations should proceed simultaneously with Ford and G.M., people familiar with the union's decision-making said. The three-year labor contracts between the U.A.W. and each of the Big Three auto makers expire at midnight on Sept. 14. 
 Although Mr. Yokich and Richard Shoemaker, the U.A.W.'s vice president for G.M. issues, are delegates to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, both men stayed here today to hammer out strategy, people close to the union said. Another delegate, Ernest Lofton, the U.A.W.'s vice president for Ford issues, abruptly flew back here from Chicago this afternoon to join them.
But a fourth delegate, Jack Laskowski, the vice president and head of Chrysler issues, remained in Chicago, a sign that Chrysler is unlikely to be included in the U.A.W.'s first round of negotiations.
Chrysler had expressed strong interest last spring in going first, and many industry analysts expected it to do so. The U.A.W. has traditionally confronted the most prosperous company first, on the theory that it would be the most willing to settle to prevent a strike disrupting its production. In the United States auto industry, Chrysler has the highest profit margins for each of its vehicles.
But the U.A.W.'s leaders began having second thoughts this summer, worrying that if Chrysler made generous concessions, G.M. might refuse to sign the same deal. The most pressing issues for the U.A.W. are at G.M., which is trying to buy more parts from outside suppliers and which accounts for half the U.A.W.'s employment in the industry.
Mr. Yokich said last Thursday that it was important for the domestic auto makers to pay like wages and benefits, although he pointedly did not say that the rest of each auto maker's labor contract had to have identical language.
All three auto makers have said they would have liked to go first so as to negotiate contracts that suit their needs. But the talks this summer have gone slowly, with all the auto makers taking a hard line.
The developing consensus at the U.A.W. in favor of including Ford in the first round of negotiations reflects Mr. Yokich's close friendship with top Ford executives and Ford's tradition of coming up with innovative solutions to complex labor problems, people close to the union said. U.A.W. and Ford officials said on June 10, at the opening of labor talks, that the next national labor contract might last for longer than the traditional three years.
If the U.A.W. pursues talks with G.M. and Ford simultaneously, it would be unusual, but it would have precedents. The union negotiated with G.M. and Chrysler in 1990, and with G.M. and Ford in 1970.
In both cases, the U.A.W. ended up narrowing its focus to G.M. in the final days before its national contracts expired. The 1990 negotiations ended peacefully, while the talks in 1970 produced a two-month-long national strike at G.M. that contributed to a nationwide recession that year. G.M. is the nation's biggest company in terms of sales and employees.
If the U.A.W. chooses G.M. and Ford, it will put the Canadian Auto Workers, a separate union, in a difficult position. Basil E. Hargrove, the Canadian union's president, who is known as Buzz, said in an interview earlier this summer that he would start negotiations with a different company than the one the U.A.W. was negotiating with. If both unions negotiated with the same auto maker at the same time, the smaller Canadian union might be ignored.
If the U.A.W. chooses Ford and G.M., that would appear to leave Mr. Hargrove with only Chrysler, with which the Canadian union has few quarrels. Chrysler is the only auto maker not to have backed tough new labor laws being drafted by Ontario's provincial government.
In a telephone interview this afternoon, Mr. Hargrove refused to discuss the U.A.W.'s decision-making. But he acknowledged a reluctance to confront Chrysler first.
"There is some hesitancy on my part because of the relationship with Chrysler, because they have been very good on the issues here," Mr. Hargrove said.
He added that he planned to choose his negotiating target on Wednesday morning in any case. "The companies are waiting now for us to identify a target," Mr. Hargrove said. "People have really staked out their ground as far as the issues."

HEADLINE: Talks on Saving Redwoods May Be Near Decisive Point

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Negotiations to save the country's largest privately owned stand of virgin redwoods have reached a "crunch," a senior Clinton Administration official said today, as representatives of the corporate investor who controls the forest softly repeated his threat to begin logging there in three weeks.
The official, Deputy Interior Secretary John Garamendi, said it would be the financier, Charles E. Hurwitz, and his timber company that would be the targets of public anger if they made good on a threat to start removing dead and dying trees from the Headwaters Grove, a 3,000-acre forest near the northwestern tip of California. 
 But Mr. Hurwitz appeared confident that he had pushed the Government up against a wall in talks to exchange the redwoods for other Government-owned properties.
Referring to a Federal court ruling earlier this year that would allow his Pacific Lumber Company to begin salvage-logging operations on Sept. 16, a company spokeswoman, Mary Bullwinkel, said, "We have legal permission to go in and salvage in the Headwaters forest area, and we're still planning to do so at this time."
Mr. Garamendi seemed to be responding to the political calendar as much as the court-imposed deadline in making his first extensive public report in weeks on the progress of his lengthy negotiations with representatives of Pacific Lumber and its parent company, Maxxam Inc. of Houston.
Mr. Garamendi spoke from the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in a hastily arranged telephone news conference, and he was most intent on dismissing the suggestion of the Green Party's Presidential candidate, Ralph Nader, that rather than public lands, the Clinton Administration should exchange some portion of Mr. Hurwitz's potential liabilities in a $1.6 billion savings and loan bailout in return for his rights to the forest.
In separate cases involving a Texas savings and loan, United Savings Association of Texas; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision are seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages from Maxxam. Mr. Garamendi said it would be "illegal, inappropriate and wrong" for the Administration to forgive those damages until the two agencies finished sorting out Mr. Hurwitz's responsibilities in the case.
"We looked at it and said, 'Is this something we can do?' " Mr. Garamendi said of what some have advocated as a debt-for-nature swap. "As we got into it, it became very clear that we could not."
Mr. Hurwitz has denied owing the Federal Government anything from the bailout, and a spokesman for Maxxam, Bob Irelan, said again this afternoon that while the corporation was "flexible" about the sort of compensation that it might take for Headwaters, its possible liabilities in the savings and loan failure were not on the table.
"Our contention is that there is no debt to swap," Mr. Irelan said, arguing that the savings and loan failed "because of the precipitous decline of the Texas economy."
In a letter to President Clinton on July 23, Mr. Nader called it "unconscionable" that the Administration would rush to trade public properties for the redwoods before the Government had fully pursued its case against Mr. Hurwitz for United Savings. An advertisement in last Thursday's issue of The New York Times that Mr. Nader signed asserts that "Mr. Clinton intends to bail out Charles Hurwitz for a second time" while getting back only a small portion of the endangered forest.
Mr. Nader is one of many environmentalists who have weighed in on the issue, calling for a trade of trees for savings and loan liabilities but raising the specter that the financier might take the Government for a ride. But Mr. Nader is the only such advocate running for the Presidency, and some political analysts believe he could significantly cut into the vote for Mr. Clinton in California, even with a weak campaign.
Mr. Garamendi said the Administration was negotiating to gain control over the 3,000-acre Headwaters Grove and a buffer zone of an additional 1,500 or 1,700 acres, and that a series of public lands and properties were being considered as compensation to Pacific Lumber. He said other Government-owned or privately owned forest might be exchanged for the Headwaters, but added that the Government was taking care "not to simply move the problem from one forest to another."
Mr. Garamendi said the September deadline was "not a drop-dead date" but was quickening the pace of negotiations. "We've come down to a crunch," he said. But he argued: "The pressure is on Mr. Hurwitz and not on us. He is the one who is going to incur the wrath of anyone who knows anything about Headwaters if he goes in and logs."
Even if a deal was struck by next month, Mr. Garamendi said, it would probably amount to only the outline of a settlement. A final appraisal of the forest's value -- which has been estimated at $200 million to $700 million -- has yet to be commissioned, and many details would remain to be worked out, he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Wary of Punishing China For Missile Help to Pakistan

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
While the Clinton Administration has not formally declared that China is secretly helping Pakistan build a factory to produce medium-range missiles, in violation of its promises to Washington, senior officials are already trying to figure out what to do about it.
The factory is the latest of several weapons control disputes to arise with China in recent years and American law could require the imposition of economic sanctions. But senior officials have no appetite for another confrontation with China, especially in an election year in which Sino-American relations have already been a big headache. 
 "This has been in the category of too hot to touch unless it jumps up to bite you," one senior official said. "Decision-makers have a way of saying, 'This isn't ready for a decision yet,' and that has clearly frustrated some people in intelligence," he said, who say they believe that the evidence is there and want to press for a response.
Officials say the factory, being built by the Pakistanis with Chinese help near Islamabad, the capital, will produce a version of the Chinese M-11 medium range missile, capable of carrying nuclear warheads up to 200 miles. But they are still debating whether the factory is indeed designed to produce complete missiles, or only parts, and how deep the Chinese role has been. Pakistan denies that it is constructing a medium-range missile factory.
Another issue, which has been publicly debated for months, is the reported shipment by China to Pakistan of M-11 missiles themselves, between 1990 and 1994. The Clinton Administration officially says it does not know for sure that the missiles were delivered and are in crates at Pakistan's Sargodha Air Force Base, near Lahore.
But a recent National Intelligence Estimate, the agreed judgment of the Government's intelligence services, concludes that the missiles are probably there in crates and could be launched within 48 hours, a senior Administration official said. The estimate says there is not enough evidence to decide if those missiles are fitted with nuclear warheads, as the Pakistanis would clearly like to be able to do in time, the official said.
Both China and Pakistan deny that a transfer of missiles has occurred.
American officials are eager to manage relations with China carefully in a year that has already seen sharp confrontations over trade policy, the spread of nuclear weapons, Taiwan and its elections, human rights and the Chinese piracy of copyrighted videotapes, software and compact disks. In a coordinated effort, the State Department, Treasury Department and White House have recently tried to keep relations with China on a less strident, more even level, with a series of high-level meetings planned that are expected to lead to a summit meeting after the American election.
So American officials are likely to want to settle any dispute over missiles through negotiation if possible, rather than imposing sanctions as the law would require. American officials also recognize that China regards India as a regional rival. If China helps Pakistan secure medium-range missiles they would balance missiles that India, a larger and more advanced country, has already developed for itself. Both Pakistan and India are unacknowledged nuclear powers, but India has tested the Prithvi missile, which for now is believed to be designed for a conventional warhead.
Both the provision by China of M-11's to Pakistan and help to Pakistan to make more of them stem from contracts dating from the late 1980's, senior officials say. But both violate a 1990 American law intended to discourage the spread of missiles and missile technology. The technology transfer involved in the factory also violates the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international agreement that China has promised Washington to honor even though it is not a signatory.
The regime does not absolutely ban in every case the exports of medium-range missiles like the M-11, but China promised Washington in October 1994, when it settled another case for which sanctions had been imposed. The regime does prohibit the transfer of production assistance for such missiles.
If the United States Government formally declares that China has in fact shipped M-11's to Pakistan or is helping Pakistan construct a factory to build them, under the 1990 law the United States must deny export licenses for military and dual-use items to the entities involved from both Pakistan and China, and also deny them American contracts.
Under an amendment to the law, in the case of a "non-market" or Communist country like China, they are also subject to a denial of export licenses to the whole state sector involved, in this case, the broad spectrum of aerospace and electronics industries. While such a sanction would not cover toasters, it would damage China's satellite-launching industry, for example, and other endeavors that require American products not easily bought from other countries in the way that China recently chose to buy European-made Airbus civilian aircraft rather than American Boeings.
"It is possible to put off a decision for a while," a senior official said, "but not to avoid them. It's a legal matter."

Treasury Securities Drop in Price

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities gave ground yesterday, with the market weighted down by coming supply and uncertainty over whether the economy will slow enough to avoid a surge in inflation.
Even though thin volume exaggerated price movement, the negative undertones could not be ignored, as managers juggled portfolios ahead of more government debt sales this week and some crucial employment data next week. 
 The 30-year bond fell 17/32, to a price of 96 30/32 to yield 7.00 percent, up from 6.95 percent on Friday.
Although technical analysts suggest the market may be oversold, investors' persistent doubt over whether the economy will slow enough kept most from buying securities. And while a corrective bounce could be in the cards, there is still a likelihood that the lows could be tested again, some analysts say.
A primary concern is that fresh data will show the economy is not slowing sufficiently to keep inflation at bay, and, consequently, the Fed will raise interest rates to put the brakes on the economy.
The tone of the market improved slightly with the morning release of July existing-home sales, which fell five-tenths of 1 percent, to 4.14 million units on an annualized basis. Economists expected sales of 4.10 million units, down from 4.18 million units in June. Three out of the four regions showed declines in sales, with only the Midwest gaining. However, traders looking to get out of long positions took advantage of early price improvement before sending the market lower.
Philip Braverman, senior vice president and chief economist at the DKB Securities (USA) Corporation, said that despite the market's fears, "in reality, the economy and inflation remain on a slowing trend."
"But whatever has bothered the Fed bothers the market," he said, and talk of some central bank selling pushed the market still lower.
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, agreed there were some signs of an economic slowdown, but added that they were inconclusive. Economic fundamentals including employment, income and confidence remain healthy. "The economic picture is mixed and good news on inflation continues," he said. However, he believes that in coming months, after the election, inflation will worsen and give the Fed reason to tighten.
Dealers said yesterday that they needed to cheapen prices to drum up demand for the Treasury auctions this week. Yesterday's regular weekly sale of three- and six-month bills was not well received, given the fears of a Fed tightening. The average bill rate at auction was 5.07 percent for a three-month issue, up a basis point -- one-hundredth of a percentage point -- from last week, and 5.16 percent, up three basis points, for a six-month one.
Today the Treasury will auction $18.75 billion of new two-year notes and tomorrow, $12.5 billion of five-year notes. In when-issued trading yesterday, dealers were offering the two-year note at a price to yield 6.18 percent, and the five-year at a price to yield 6.56 percent. Over the last four days yields have risen about 19 basis points, as dealers try to make the issues more attractive to investors.
The two-year auction is expected to be a rough one, with a yield of between 6.20 percent and 6.25 percent needed to get decent demand.
Due out this morning is the Conference Board's report on consumer confidence. The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo.

Deal to Create 4th-Largest Temporary Service Agency
Accustaff, a fast-growing provider of temporary workers, agreed to acquire Career Horizons, a smaller competitor, in a $1 billion stock swap.
The transaction would create the fourth- largest temporary service provider in the country, with more than 750 offices in 43 states and estimated 1996 revenue of more than $1.3 billion. [Page D3.]
 
Bombardier Rolls Out Business Jet
Bombardier introduced a new long-range business jet called the Global Express that can circle the world in a day. The jet is the latest entry in the competitive $2- billion-a-year executive aircraft market, but at $35 million apiece it is not clear if Bombardier will be able to find the 100 buyers it needs to break even. The plane will compete with a new jet from Gulfstream Aerospace on such routes as New York-Tokyo and San Francisco-Moscow. [D3.]
 
Silver King to Buy Home Shopping
Silver King Communications plans to buy Home Shopping Network in a stock swap valued at $1.27 billion. The deal is the second attempt by Tele-Communications Inc., a major stockholder in both, to join the two and still comply with Federal ownership limits. TCI owns 40 percent of Home Shopping and 19 percent of Silver King, and Barry Diller is chairman of both companies. [D2.]
 
MCI and Nextwave in Wireless Deal
MCI Communications reached an agreement with Nextwave Telecom to offer the next generation of wireless telecommunications services in most of the nation's big cities. [D3.]
 
Existing-Home Sales Slow Slightly
Sales of existing homes slowed last month on the heels of a record-setting spring, the National Association of Realtors said. Sales in July dropped five-tenths of 1 percent, to a 4.14 million annual rate, the group reported. [D6.]
 
With Investors Nervous, Yields Rise
Prices of Treasury securities fell, sending the yield on the 30-year bond back up to the psychologically important 7 percent level from 6.95 percent on Friday. The market was weighted down by coming supply and worry the economy will not slow enough to avoid a surge in inflation. However, technical analysts suggested that the market might be oversold. [D13.]
 
The Dow industrials fell 28.85 points, to 5,693.89, as stocks slid in sympathy with bonds. J. P. Morgan and Sears, Roebuck led the Dow downward. The Nasdaq composite index lost 3.83 points, closing at 1,139.22. [D6.]
 
Another Missed Opportunity
Sometimes it just doesn't pay to hedge. On Friday afternoon, an institutional investor, evidently concerned that an investment in MFS Communications was not moving, decided to pick up a little income by selling call options on the stock. The risk was the investor would miss out on any rise in the stock. That was exactly what happened when MFS said it had agreed to be acquired by Worldcom. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [D6.]
 
Dispute Over Investigation Costs
A dispute has erupted over who will pay the costs of the investigation into the crash of T.W.A. Flight 800. With expenses approaching $10 million, questions have been raised over whether T.W.A., its insurer and other private parties will help pay the bills. [B1.]
 
Possible Sale for Olympic Financial
Olympic Financial said that its chief executive had resigned and that it was reviewing a possible sale of the company. [D6.]
 
A Magazine Publisher Does It Again
Hachette Filipacchi, a magazine publisher known for creating nontraditional advertisements -- which critics complain often stretch the boundaries of what is acceptable in pitching products -- has done it again. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D2.]

Stopping The Music

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
The Democratic and Republican Presidential candidates, and their party platform-writers, all have touched on international terrorism. They come right out and say they are against it.
But, not to be picky, that's not good enough. During the political season, just to denounce terrorism and say how tough we will be someday becomes embarrassing as a display of Presidential quality. And tomorrow, and every day after, it will be an even more meaningless response, more ineffective and vapid. 
 President Clinton and Bob Dole know why: Terrorists have learned to diversify. They diversify their sources of money and arms, and their techniques of operation and organization. They become harder to track down, more efficient in their labors. So far, the candidates and their platforms have not divulged this to the public.
In their platform the Democrats throw too much into one blender -- drugs, crime and domestic terrorism mixed in with international terrorism. What comes out is impossible to deal with in one lump -- and untrue to reality.
The Republicans are less bland. But they throw in a warning about not allowing anything to interfere with their right to bear arms!
Drug abuse, crime and domestic terrorism are committed by Americans and are American responsibilities to deal with at home. So, we assume, is the interpretation of the Second Amendment.
International terrorism is something else entirely -- a foreign act of war against the U.S. that has to be handled as an act of war.
Neither party has the courage to identify consistently the specific international terrorism directed at the U.S. It is not terrorism of the Irish Republican Army or the Peruvian Shining Path. It is terrorism by militant Islamists who consider the West, Judaism until it is destroyed and then all other religions as enemies standing in the way of Islamic religious rule and so marked by God for death. To say this is not to attack Islam but its perverters. This truth, however, will mean little unless more Muslims speak it.
Instead of contracting, this terrorism is diversifying. Now it taps not only into government sponsors but Mideast fortunes and sophisticated fund-raising abroad. These terrorists have learned how to choose among the different forms of support and shape the operation at hand to suit them. The terrorists did what the West failed to do -- plan for tomorrow, stay flexible.
About this, the leaders of the West have remained silent or mumble-mouthed. But some intelligence specialists and a small number of American investigative journalists have not.
Steven Emerson, a brave independent journalist based in Washington, has exposed the money-raising of Hamas and other terrorist groups in the U.S. and Washington's failure to take effective action under existing law. Jeff Gerth and Judith Miller of The New York Times have added luster to their reputations and the newspaper's with a detailed report on Aug. 14 about the emergence of a sophisticated network of terrorists financed by wealthy businessmen in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.
We are dancing to a suicidal rhythm. Terrorists attack, the West investigates; they attack, we investigate; attack, investigate. Waltz us around again as the years go by, dance us in the skies over Lockerbie, to the World Trade Center, to the American barracks in Saudi Arabia, to the Jewish center in Buenos Aires, perhaps to Long Island, maybe someplace else, dance with tears in our eyes. Or is that just spit from friendly countries we have asked not to invest in Iran?
What to do? Why, stop the music and then:
Enforce laws about freezing terrorists' treasuries and fund-raising in America. Give Libya four days to turn over the men who are supposed to have downed Pan Am 103. Maybe they will tell us who else was involved. Publicly inform Syria and the Sudan that terrorist camps not closed at once will become our targets. Publicly inform countries sheltering the terrorists' big money men that their safe houses are now very unsafe. Privately tell our allies how we can retaliate economically and diplomatically if they insist on building up Iran.
Americans have been murdered; more will be. The dancing is obscene. It is the job of a President to say so, and of a man who wants to be.

HEADLINE: Lewis J. Perl, 55, Economic Analyst

 BODY:
Lewis J. Perl, an analyst for the regulated sector of the economy and a senior vice president of National Economic Research Associates of White Plains, died on Saturday while vacationing in Bethany Beach, Del. He was 55 and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.
The cause was a heart attack, his family said. 
 Dr. Perl was in charge of the New York City office of NERA, a company dealing in economic consulting and investigative services. He joined the company in 1972 and specialized in industries like telephone companies and investor-owned utilities.
He graduated from the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University in 1963. He received a master's degree in 1968 and a Ph.D. in economics in 1970 from the University of California at Berkeley and taught economics at Cornell until 1972.
His analyses provided the basis for reports to NERA clients and for testimony before regulatory agencies. He assessed matters like the economic efficiency of pricing policies, and advised on privatization and the value of the assets to be privatized.
He often dealt with environmental economics, helping to determine the social costs and benefits of legislation like the Clean Air Act or the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. He testified on such matters before Congressional committees, regulatory agencies and in court. He also prepared wage studies.
Dr. Perl is survived by his wife, Terry, and two daughters, Lina and Joanna, all of Scarsdale, and a sister, Joan Guryan of South Orange, N.J.

HEADLINE: Platform Politics

 BODY:
Bob Dole said in San Diego that he had not read the Republican platform and did not feel obliged to follow it. Bill Clinton may or may not have read the platform that will be formally voted on by the Democratic Convention today. But he will have no trouble running on it. It was clearly written to fit Mr. Clinton and the campaign planned by his main strategist, Dick Morris.
Whereas the Republican document reflected the harsher strictures of the party's right wing, and was very much at odds with the moderate image Mr. Dole sought to project, the Democratic platform is relentlessly centrist, tailored to suit the purposes of a President who means to campaign on a promise of a less intrusive but still vigorous and compassionate government. The Democrats have made every effort to achieve at least the illusion of unity coming into the convention. They have tried to smother potential controversy with inclusive language and postpone disputes over policy with promises that they will be dealt with later. 
 But on one issue, welfare reform, the promises cannot offset the disappointment among many Democrats -- rank-and-filers as well as senior party members like Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Mario Cuomo and the party's own chairman, Christopher Dodd -- at Mr. Clinton's decision to sign the Republican welfare reform bill. Mr. Clinton promises to rectify the bill's cruelties, and so does the platform. But many Democrats believe he has betrayed decades of party principle in order to satisfy Mr. Morris's strategy of appropriating the G.O.P.'s most potent issues. Indeed, that strategy anticipates that Mr. Clinton will gain votes from being criticized by liberals within his own party.
The platform writers did a much more honest job in confronting the abortion issue. Mr. Dole failed completely in his efforts to get language satisfactory to pro-choice Republicans included in the G.O.P. platform, settling for some weasely words in the appendix. The Democratic platform begins with a strong reaffirmation of the party's belief in Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, but for the first time includes language that respects "the individual conscience of each American on this difficult issue." The noise generated by the Christian right tends to obscure the fact that there are pro-lifers in the Democratic ranks. Unlike the pro-choice Republicans, they can at least find an acknowledgment of their beliefs in their platform.
There is of course no mention of a 15 percent tax cut, the centerpiece of the Dole-Kemp economic strategy. Tax cuts instead are to be aimed at working families and small businesses. The Democrats' platform devotes more space to the need to balance the budget than the G.O.P.'s does. But it skirts the thorny issue of finding savings in entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare and gives no real idea of how Mr. Clinton intends to carry out his promise to balance the budget by 2002.
The widest gap between the two platforms involves the Government's role in the lives of ordinary citizens. The G.O.P. platform was hostile to nearly any form of gun control. The Democrats celebrate the Brady bill on handguns and the ban on deadly assault weapons -- and promise more. The Republicans pledge to defund and privatize favorite right-wing targets like the National Endowment for the Arts and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The Democrats support both.
On environmental questions, the Republicans take a minimalist view of Federal stewardship of the nation's national resources. Responsibilities for protecting wetlands and wilderness areas would be transferred to state and local governments and to the owners of private property. The Democratic platform acknowledges the public's impatience with some environmental regulation and promises reforms. But over all it offers a far stouter defense of the legislative and regulatory structure that has done so much to clean up America's water and air and preserve its public places.
What the writers of the Democratic platform wanted was "a moderate, achievable common-sense agenda that will improve people's daily lives and not increase the size of government." The details do not seem any more radical than this general statement of purpose. This document is harmonious choir music designed to serenade Mr. Clinton's quest for a second term. The main discordant note is the transparent effort to paper over his blatantly political decision on welfare.

HEADLINE: China Raises Nuclear Stakes on the Subcontinent

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 27

 BODY:
The new evidence that China may be aiding a missile factory in Pakistan reflects Beijing's determination to thwart India's domination in the region by promoting a nuclear balance of power, as well as its defiance of American efforts to limit Chinese influence in Asia.
If American intelligence agencies prove Chinese involvement in the manufacture of medium-range missiles outside Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, it will indicate that Beijing is stepping up its transfer of advanced military technology to Pakistan despite numerous public pledges to limit the spread of weapons of mass destruction. 
 It may also touch off a new round of economic sanctions against China, something the Clinton Administration has been seeking to avoid since the last sanctions relating to Chinese missile component sales to Pakistan were lifted in late 1994.
Under American law, sanctions are mandatory if the President determines that China has violated the Missile Technology Control Regime, an accord the Chinese never signed although in 1991 they agreed to abide by its limits.
The regime forbids the transfer of technology that would enable a third country to build a ground-to-ground missile capable of carrying 1,100 pound warheads for a distance of 185 miles. The missiles in question are the Chinese M-11, capable of carrying a nuclear warhead just over 185 miles.
The discovery of a new Pakistan missile factory and apparently a Chinese connection to it comes at a time of great uncertainty in Asia about Beijing's intentions as an emerging power and about America's role in Asia.
Though both India and Pakistan are coy about their intentions, there are many signs that they are stepping up their nuclear arms race. Earlier this month in New Dehli, Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda announced that India would press ahead with its program to develop the medium range Prithvi ballistic missile and the inter-continental range Agni missile, both of which could be fitted with nuclear warheads.
Earlier this month, India effectively scuttled a global treaty to ban testing of nuclear weapons, leaving little doubt about its own intentions. India exploded a nuclear device in 1974 and, like Pakistan, is believed to have further developed a nuclear weapons capability in secret. China is believed to have assisted Pakistan by providing the design of a Chinese warhead from China's fourth nuclear test in 1967. Indian officials also say China has conducted at least one test of a Pakistani warhead at the Lop Nor test range in western China.
The Chinese think the Indians already have a nuclear weapon that can be delivered by a missile system, an Asian diplomat here said today. If the Indians are racing ahead in certain technologies, then Pakistan reaches out to its big brother for help, he added, referring to China.
Though the Chinese may justify their assistance by saying they are interested in maintaining parity between India and Pakistan, it is unavoidable that they will also fuel an arms race, the diplomat added.
A prime reason why a nuclear arms race continues, diplomats say, is that leaders in Islamabad and New Dehli live in a state of uncertainty about what the other side has in its nuclear basement. As a result, neither side is willing to stop building missiles and tinkering with warhead designs as a hedge against surprises and as a deterrent against attack.
"Who is going to guarantee our security if we ourselves do not?" asked an Indian diplomat based here. Indian security experts say they have a long term fear, too, of being bullied by China, with its nuclear arsenal.
China's willingess to risk a new confrontation with the United States over assistance to Pakistan appears to be based on a strong determination by China's military leaders to create a strategic balance on China's western flank, one that keeps India in check even as Beijing and New Dehli pursue greater cooperation in the region and step up trade and commerce across their borders.
China's assertiveness also reflects a stronger influence by the Chinese Army during the political transition now underway after nearly two decades of dominance by Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader. In the new era of rule by a younger generation of civilian technocrats, the stalwarts of the Chinese military are gaining ground.
A new study by the Rand Corporation for Defense Secretary William J. Perry strongly suggests that President Jiang Zemin may not be able to control a more assertive Chinese military, especially when civilian leaders are unable to reach a consensus on foreign policy and national security issues.
The absence of a single dominant leader with the authority of Deng Xiaoping suggests that the military's challenges to critical elements of China's foreign policy will probably increase, said Michael D. Swaine, a senior analyst at Rand.
China's relationship with Pakistan has long been the province of the Chinese military, a number of experts say.
"I don't think most people realize that China and Pakistan are strategic allies," said Eden Y. Woon, a former Pentagon specialist on China now living in Seattle. They are as close as the United States is to Britain, he said, and while China is trying hard to improve its relations with India, it always remembers that it once went to war with India.
But there are other important factors, Mr. Woon added.
One is a strong nationalistic current in the military that opposes the effort by the United States and the other signatories to the Missile Technology Control Regime to limit China's sale of weapons and technology. The 10-year-old agreement was signed by 30 countries but not China, though under American pressure China said in 1991 that it would abide by it.
Some Chinese leaders see the missile regime as an effort by the Americans to tell them what to do, Mr. Woon said, and they bristle at this, especially at a time when the United States has increased its sales of advanced weapons to Taiwan, including F-16 fighters.
These sales, Beijing asserts, represent a proliferation of American weapons into Chinese territory that are destabilizing Beijing's efforts to negotiate reunification between mainland China and Taiwan.
Chinese leaders must also take into account the financial interests of defense industries that earn hard currency from military equipment sales to Pakistan's armed forces.
Someone in the defense industry is making money from these sales, said Mr. Woon, and that is another source of revenue to the Chinese Government.

HEADLINE: Cuba Sentences Fugitive Businessman Vesco to 13 Years for Fraud

BYLINE: JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
A court in Cuba convicted Robert L. Vesco, the fugitive American businessman, of economic crimes today and sentenced him to 13 years in jail.
Officials in Washington said they had no reason to believe that the conviction would lead to Mr. Vesco's extradition to face longstanding, unrelated charges in this country. 
 Mr. Vesco, 60, fled the United States 25 years ago to avoid numerous racketeering charges and has spent the last 14 years living in splendid exile under the patronage of the Cuban President, Fidel Castro. There, he plied a new trade, American officials say, dealing with the region's well-heeled dictators and emerging criminal elite.
In recent years Mr. Vesco ran afoul of the Cuban authorities, who arrested him last year and finally put him on trial this month. His conviction and sentencing today were reported by the Cuban news agency, Prensa Latina, monitored by the Associated Press in Mexico City.
The Cuban Government had accused Mr. Vesco of a complex scheme to cheat Cuba's Health Ministry and other investors while seeking to market an unproven drug against cancer and arthritis. The prosecutor in the case had sought a 20-year sentence.
Mr. Vesco may appeal his conviction to a higher Cuban court. His wife, Lidia Alfonso Llauger, was convicted of lesser charges and sentenced to nine years, the news agency said.
In his trial, Mr. Vesco had denied any guilt, asking why he would defraud a country that had harbored him for so many years.
Among the charges pending against Mr. Vesco in the United States are an indictment from a Federal grand jury in New York for siphoning more than $200 million from a Geneva-based mutual fund, and a 1973 Federal indictment in Washington for an illegal $200,000 contribution to the re-election campaign of President Richard M. Nixon.
In addition, a Federal grand jury in Jacksonville, Fla., indicted Mr. Vesco in 1989 for conspiring to smuggle narcotics with Carlos Lehder Rivas, the leader of a Colombian drug ring. A separate 1984 indictment charged him with cocaine trafficking.
When Mr. Vesco was arrested in Cuba last year, Havana seemed to hint that he might be handed over to American authorities, but those hopes quickly faded. A Clinton Administration official, who insisted on not being identified, said there was no sign that the Castro Government, which has not extradited anyone to the United States, would do so now.
"We were under no illusion about obtaining him," the official said. He added, "This is not going to have any effect on the relationship more broadly," speaking of American relations with Cuba, "or on the cases pending against him."
As is routine in cases involving the trial of American citizens abroad, the State Department had sought access to Mr. Vesco while he was detained. But the Cuban Government said he was not interested in meeting with American authorities.
At the time of his arrest, the Cuban authorities said Mr. Vesco was suspected of "being a provocateur and an agent of foreign special services." But, for reasons that have never been clear, he was instead charged with "fraud and illicit economic activity."
The case also involved the nephews of President Nixon and of Mr. Castro. Mr. Nixon's nephew, Donald Nixon Jr., a longtime associate of Mr. Vesco, was taken into custody along with Mr. Vesco but was later released. Mr. Castro's nephew, Antonio Fraga Castro, runs a state-owned drug research company that Mr. Vesco was said to have defrauded.

 This book of statistical tables and commentary by five faculty members at Cornell University takes a pessimistic view of the United States even though some other analysts, looking at the same picture, have found room for optimism. In the view of Urie Bronfenbrenner and his collaborators, poverty is increasing; productivity is not rising as quickly as it used to; the rapid increase in the number of old people will bankrupt both the Medicare Trust Fund (in about 2001) and the Social Security Trust Fund (in about 2030). In addition, even if more people are being educated, their educations are yielding poor results compared with those in most other industrialized countries.
Finally, the authors say that something less tangible is "terribly wrong" because our allegiance to "values commonly judged as 'good' seems in decline, including honesty, a sense of personal responsibility, respect for others anchored in a sense of the dignity and worth of every individual." 
 Do the compilers of "The State of Americans," who include an economist, a psychologist and specialists in human development, exaggerate? Other people, like former Commerce Secretary Peter G. Peterson, have recently sounded similar warnings, especially about the prospect that the nation will go bankrupt unless everyone saves more and the Government cuts benefits to the middle class. Moreover, the 150 tables in the book seem reliable and are soberly explained. Here and there, some good news glimmers in the dark corners: the achievement gap between blacks and whites is declining; life expectancy is soaring; the percentage of blacks in poverty has declined markedly over the last few decades.
But overall, this selective statistical description of Americans at the end of the century takes a position on the far side of gloomy, and thereby also takes a position in a continuing debate. A few months ago, Robert J. Samuelson, a writer for Newsweek and The Washington Post, published "The Good Life and Its Discontents," in which he argued that in most important ways -- from the help given to the poor, to the decline of overt discrimination, to the nation's average standard of living -- the United States is a much better place than it was half a century ago.
The arguments presented by Mr. Bronfenbrenner and his colleagues are in fact not entirely incompatible with the visions of Mr. Samuelson. "The State of Americans" makes little effort to put matters into long-term perspective. It provides a contemporary statistical snapshot of certain key areas of American life, including crime, violence in the schools and young people's loss of confidence in the future. When you come right down to it, "The State of Americans" is a portrait of American poverty that uses statistical tables in an attempt to quantify it, elucidate its causes and come up with guidelines for coping with it.
The authors write dry, bureaucratic prose and use fancy words to express simple ideas, as in: "developmentally favorable conditions combine to accelerate processes of psychological growth, whereas impoverished or disruptive environments quicken the course of developmental disarray." This means that children who have what children need do better than children who are poor or mistreated.
Still, the tables are fascinating, generally clear and logically ordered by theme. Many of the tables show what everybody already knows, but others are surprising. The American murder rate, for example, is the highest in the world. That we knew. Less well known is this: Even if you exclude the murders committed with guns in the United States and include them for other countries, our murder rate comes out higher. In other words, our stabbing, choking and strangling rate alone puts us in first place in the murder sweepstakes.
The book's most important subject is births to teen-age mothers. Once again, not surprisingly, we are in first place among the world's major trading nations. This would be true even using only the rates of teen-age births among whites, though the rates of such births are higher among blacks.
The most alarming tables in the book are those that show the link between deep poverty and single parenthood in this country and that show just how tremendous an advantage two-parent households have over single-parent ones. Sixty-six percent of single-mother families with one child under 6 are in poverty in the United States, compared with 9 percent of families in which the parents are married and living together. The respective figures are 88 percent and 16 percent for families with two children under 6. The children of both male and female single parents are more likely to drop out of school, to have low test scores, to be pessimistic and to become single parents themselves.
In fact, as the authors of this book frequently say, things are more complicated than that, since the key ingredient is not single parenthood itself but the single parent's situation. Education, it turns out, is the most important variable. The children of well-educated single mothers do just as well as the children of couples. Education in this sense is also more important than race. White single-parent families are proportionately far more likely to be in poverty than black two-parent families.
With the debate over poverty, welfare and the role of government about to pick up in the Presidential election campaign, this book provides some facts and figures about where Americans are and where we seem to be headed.

Help Wanted?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
If President Clinton is re-elected, his biggest cabinet decision may be whether to retain Warren Christopher as Secretary of State, and if not, with whom to replace him. The chatter inside the Administration is that Mr. Clinton will neither ask Mr. Christopher to go nor beg him to stay, but will leave the decision to him. While White House insiders say Mr. Christopher seems inclined to leave -- he'll soon break Secretary of State James Baker's record for frequent-flier miles -- he's made no final decision, and no one will rule out Christopher succeeding Christopher.
Whom might Mr. Clinton choose to replace Mr. Christopher? Ideally, that should depend on what the President hopes to accomplish in foreign policy in a second term, but he hasn't made that clear at all. Until then, here's the roster from which Mr. Clinton will likely make his choice: 
 Anthony Lake, the national security adviser. Strengths: After four years as national security adviser he probably knows Mr. Clinton's instincts on foreign policy better than anyone. He seems to have learned from all the Administration's early ditherings in foreign policy, and he showed a lot of grit in sticking with heavily criticized Clinton policies on Haiti, North Korea, Bosnia, Mexico and Russia that have, in the end, at least defused these problems. Weaknesses: With his absent-minded-professor demeanor, he does not project authority very well. Often seems more interested in his pet boutique projects, like Northern Ireland, than in what matters, like Russia and China. Aloof, quirky and obsessively secretive, he doesn't bond easily with colleagues, subordinates or allies.
Richard Holbrooke, the former Bosnia negotiator. Strengths: Smart. Creative. Energetic. Understands American power and how to wield it. Proved in Bosnia that he can turn lemons into lemonade. Weaknesses: Maniacal self-promoter, addicted to appearing on CNN. Not the kind of person who would ever fall on a grenade for his boss. Overly calculating -- makes Machiavelli look like a simple, straightforward kinda guy. High-maintenance.
Senator Sam Nunn. Strengths: Has written with real insight about all the big issues -- Russia, China and NATO. Has had the courage to go against the rest of Congress and declare NATO expansion one of the dumbest ideas of the post-cold-war era. Commands genuine respect in the foreign policy community. Was way ahead of his time in developing the Nunn-Lugar program to help Russia dismantle its nuclear arsenal. Weakness: Would challenge Mr. Clinton more than Mr. Christopher ever did. Not clear Bill & Sam could get along for four years.
Madeleine Albright, the U.N. representative. Strengths: Did a very strong job articulating U.S. interests at the U.N. An iron lady unafraid to use force. Has dealt with the same breadth of issues as the Secretary of State. Weaknesses: While she is passionate on human rights, and always ready to confront dictators from Karadzic to Castro, it's much easier to do that from the U.N. podium than from the President's elbow in the Oval Office, where the trade-offs are much harder and more complex. Not clear she has the right stuff for that.
Thomas Pickering, the U.S. Ambassador to Russia. Strengths: Has an excellent grasp of the world, having served as U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria, El Salvador, Jordan, Israel, the U.N., India and Russia. Projects authority well. Strong personality. Very tough. Would lift sagging morale at the State Department to finally have one of their own as a boss. Weaknesses: Unclear whether he has a global vision that could guide a second-term Clinton Administration.
Former Senator George Mitchell. Strengths: Disciplined, judicious, experienced problem-solver. He still carries a big punch with, and a lot of i.o.u.'s from, colleagues in Congress. Weaknesses: A bit of a loner. He has no known world view. Complicated past relations with Mr. Clinton; possible year 2000 rival of Al Gore.
Senator Richard Lugar. Strengths: Can speak thoughtfully about everything from Russian nukes to Latin American debt. A Republican, he would bring a bipartisan flavor to a second Clinton term at a time when foreign policy has become rancorously partisan. Anyone who based his campaign for President in 1996 on foreign policy deserves consideration as Secretary of State. Weakness: Though he shares Mr. Christopher's Midwestern decency, he is only slightly more charismatic or intimidating. He's sort of Warren Christopher adjusted for inflation.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Doubts on Europe Money Plan Set Off a Rally in the Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar lost ground against the German mark yesterday as traders sought a safe haven in the face of heightened anxiety about the timetable for Europe's conversion to a single currency.
The dollar finished slightly higher against the Japanese yen after being lower most of the day as traders awaited today's release of the Tankan, the Bank of Japan's quarterly report on business conditions. 
 In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.4783 marks, down from 1.4787 on Monday. The dollar was at 107.68 yen, up from 107.65. The British pound was worth $1.5545, down from $1.5570.
Europe's single currency, the Euro, is to be introduced in January 1999, but officials of several European governments have wondered publicly in recent days if the timetable can be met.
Some countries must cut budget deficits to meet economic guidelines before the Euro's introduction and doubts have arisen as to whether enough can meet the criteria.
Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, said Monday that Germany might not meet the requirements unless economic growth turned stronger.
Since Germany's economy is still considered the healthiest in Europe, any uncertainty about the monetary union prompts traders to buy marks.
Earlier in the day, the dollar traded lower against the mark and the yen after a surprisingly upbeat report on consumer confidence in the United States sent inflation fears into the bond market, causing bond prices to drop. However, the dollar recovered somewhat with bonds later in the day.
A perception that the Tankan report will show strong economic growth has buoyed the yen in recent days.
"There have been some surprisingly good earnings reports and people are beginning to revive their expectations for Japan," said Christopher Low, senior economist at HSBC Markets in New York.
Late in the day, the dollar recovered somewhat against the yen in what Lizbeth Goldberg, assistant vice president at Hypo Bank, described as a "drift, more than anything else," without any fundamental influences.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday, were: 5.0590 French francs, up from 5.0495; 1.1933 Swiss francs, up from 1.1932; 1,512.90 Italian lire, up from 1,510.50; and 1.3680 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3707.

HEADLINE: Consumer Economic Confidence Is Up, Reaching a Six-Year High

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Consumers' faith in the economy surged in August for a second consecutive month, reaching a new six-year high and raising doubts that the economy is headed for a slowdown.
Economists, who had been expecting a decline in the economic barometer, said news of the unexpected optimism yesterday could give the Federal Reserve Board more reason to raise interest rates by the end of the year. 
 "It's not going to be the straw that broke the camel's back, but it's another piece of anecdotal evidence that maybe the economy isn't slowing as much as the markets and the Fed may have hoped for," said Kevin Flanagan, a money market economist with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
The Conference Board, the private business research group based in New York, said its Consumer Confidence Index rose 2.4 points, to 109.4 this month. Most economists had expected a decline to about 105 in the survey's index.
The increase was especially surprising coming after a sharp 7-point gain in July, indicating consumer sentiment may be "on an upward trend after remaining stagnant for more than a year," said Lynn Franco, associate director of the board's Consumer Research Center.
The statistics reinforced recent reports of strength in the job market, retail sales and housing. Economists said the rosy consumer outlook, if confirmed by further signs of vigor, could derail a predicted slowdown in 1996's second half, and at the same time raise warning signs of inflation.
That, in turn, could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as early as its next policy-making meeting, on Sept. 24.
The central bankers said at their early July meeting, when they left rates unchanged, that they expected robust second-quarter economic growth to "slow appreciably over the second half of the year." The minutes of the meeting were released last Friday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Demands Vesco's Return From Cuba, but It Is Unlikely

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27

 BODY:
A day after a Cuban court convicted Robert L. Vesco, the fugitive American financier, of economic crimes, the Clinton Administration demanded again today that he be returned to face trial at home, though officials acknowledged that the chances seemed remote at best.
"As long as Vesco remains in Cuba, and the Cuban Government refuses to return him to the U.S., there's not much that can be done," a State Department spokesman, John R. Dinger, said today. 
 Mr. Vesco fled the United States a quarter-century ago to avoid a series of indictments on charges of fraud and racketeering. He spent 13 or 14 years living in exile under the patronage of President Fidel Castro until his arrest last year on charges of "being a provocateur and an agent of foreign special services," although he was eventually convicted for fraud and "illicit economic activity."
Mr. Vesco, now 60, was convicted in a Cuban court on Monday and sentenced to 13 years in prison, while his wife, Lidia Alfonso Llauger, was convicted of lesser charges and sentenced to 9 years.
The Cuban Government accused Mr. Vesco of a complex scheme to cheat Cuba's Health Ministry and investors including a company run by Mr. Castro's nephew, by trying to market an unproven drug to fight cancer and arthritis.
In his trial, Mr. Vesco denied any guilt, saying he would not defraud a country that had harbored him for so many years, even as he was being indicted on new, unrelated charges in the United States.
Although declining to comment specifically on Mr. Vesco's trial, the State Department sharply criticized Cuba's criminal justice system, saying it did not meet "international standards of fair, public trials."
That is not to say that officials expressed much sympathy for Mr. Vesco's plight, although the State Department did seek access to him while he was in custody, as is routine when Americans are tried abroad. "We remain interested in Vesco's return to face prosecution here," Mr. Dinger said.
The United States has an extradition treaty with Cuba that dates to 1904, but it has not been invoked since the Castro takeover in 1959. Although the Cuban Government hinted that it might hand over Mr. Vesco shortly after his arrest, it has since ignored repeated requests to do so.
All along, officials in Washington speculated that Cuba would never turn over someone reputed to have information linking Cuban officials to criminal activities, like drug smuggling. Moreover, relations between the United States and Cuba have deteriorated in the last year -- with the shooting down of two civilian planes carrying members of the group Brothers to the Rescue and the passage of a law aimed at curbing foreign investment in Cuba -- making a good-will gesture even less likely.
In the United States, Mr. Vesco faces six Federal indictments in New York and Florida dating back to 1973, when he was accused of skimming more than $200 million from a mutual fund based in Geneva and of making an illegal $200,000 contribution to the re-election campaign of President Nixon. He also faced civil charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
After he fled the United States and finally settled in Cuba, he was also charged in 1984 with cocaine trafficking and again in 1989 for conspiring to smuggle drugs with Carlos Lehder Rivas, the leader of a drug cartel in Colombia.
While Mr. Vesco may appeal his conviction to a higher court in Cuba, the long sentence appeared to all but rule out the possibility of a return to the United States. But John K. Russell, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said, "We always have hope."

History's Fellow Travelers Cling to Mao's Road

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
There was a time, nearly 50 years ago, when revolutionary fervor in China attracted left-leaning Americans, with its mantras of self-reliance and manual labor, and its promise of achieving a socialist dream.
Joan Hinton, for one, gave up a promising career as a nuclear physicist in 1948 to come and work on a farm, enduring severe hardship in the name of a political ideal. Most Chinese who labored beside her believed in the same dreams, although they abandoned them when other options -- fresh vegetables, telephones and television -- eventually came along. 
 Ms. Hinton, however, is still here, working at a dairy on the outskirts of Beijing. She toils on, a practicing believer in proletarian values, even though almost everything she has worked for in China has been washed away by an onslaught of change, much of it economic.
"I always say you need three things to survive in China," said Ms. Hinton, relaxing in jeans and army-issue green sneakers. "A sense of humor, a sense of history and a sense of struggle. If we didn't know how to struggle, we'd still be up in the trees."
Ms. Hinton is one of a handful of veteran leftists from the United States and Europe who remained in China through years of political turmoil, and are disillusioned by the transformation that has both brought the nation's economy to life and allowed an array of social ills to flourish.
Once oddities only because they stood out physically, these "foreign experts," as the Chinese Goverment still classifies them, even though some have become Chinese citizens, attract attention for the way they cling to political beliefs that most Chinese abandoned years ago.
Sidney Shapiro, 80, a lawyer from Brooklyn who came to China in 1947, and Ruth Weiss, 87, an Austrian who moved here in 1951, say they still believe that socialism will somehow prevail, even though, in China, it seems further out of reach each day.
Among the dozen or so long-staying "foreign experts," however, none are as hard-core in their devotion to Maoist ideals as Ms. Hinton, 74, and her husband, Sid Engst, 76. And yet their admiration for the militant leftism that erupted in the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960's and early 70's, and their disdain for the changes that followed, do not seem to have dampened their enthusiasm for living here.
With her husband, and with the three children who came along the way, Ms. Hinton lived in rural Shaanxi Province for 18 years -- first turning old scrap metal into cooking utensils, then raising cattle and then ducks -- before moving to the Beijing area, living on a commune and, after it was disbanded, settling in at the dairy. The grown children no longer live in China.
Ms. Hinton speaks nostalgically of "the 30 years" -- 1949 to 1979 -- a period that many Chinese see as essentially wrong-headed in its efforts to mold human nature to be something it is not.
"It was like that journalist who went to Russia and said 'I've seen the future and it works,' " said Ms. Hinton, referring to Lincoln Steffens's trip in the 1920's. "That's how I see the 30 years. It worked. There was very little stealing, there was great community spirit, there was a common goal. That's all been thrown away now, except for the memory."
Ms. Hinton, whose mother founded the Putney School in Vermont, began her professional career in the 1940's as a nuclear physicist at Los Alamos to help produce the first atomic bomb in 1945. She became disillusioned as the cold war began, and quit physics.
After coming to China in 1948 to join Mr. Engst in an area "liberated" by Communist soldiers, she was accused by McCarthy-era Americans of being a spy who spilled nuclear secrets to China.
Ms. Hinton giggles girlishly as she shows a visitor a laminated copy of a magazine article about her, "The Spy Who Got Away," with a drawing that depicts her as a Lauren Bacall look-alike in a trenchcoat, scribbling in a notebook as she observes a nuclear test in the desert.
"I never looked that good," said Ms. Hinton, her blond hair now silver. Nor, she said, did she ever use her physics expertise in China.
If they cling to political views that sound antiquated in today's China, Ms. Hinton and Mr. Engst are acute critics of problems in Chinese society.
"It's a mess," said Mr. Engst. "Nobody listens to the central government anymore. They keep putting out laws, and nobody listens. You can pass all the laws you want, it makes no difference."
Mr. Shapiro, a translator whose Brooklyn accent is still healthy after 49 years in China, similarly mourns the rise of crime and corruption, and the loss of the communal spirit he once knew in Beijing. Yet he blames something deeper than current policy.
"The great flaw of Chinese society has been recognized: It is not Socialism or Communism, but Confucianism," said Mr. Shapiro, who became a Chinese citizen in 1963. "That means blind worship of authority, which has been used very much to the advantage and to the disadvantage of the Communist Party over the years."
Ms. Weiss, a retired translator, seems perplexed by what she sees out her window at the Friendship Hotel, where she lives alone in an apartment cluttered with Chinese knickknacks.
"In the 1950's, there was a real feeling of cohesion among people," she said. "Now, everything you have to pay, no one takes responsibility for anything. For me, Mao Zedong was always a father figure. I thought he was really interested in the welfare of the people. Obviously, he wasn't."
Ms. Hinton, however, is still a believer in Mao.
"Mao started the Cultural Revolution to cure the disparity between the few and the many," said Ms. Hinton. "How could that be wrong?"
She dismisses the current view, that Mao's misguided policies led to the deaths of more than 30 million people in the famine of 1960-62, as revisionist history.
"We were in the countryside then, and there was malnutrition, not starvation," said Ms. Hinton. "Without socialism, we would have starved. We banded together, sharing grain coupons."
Mr. Engst chimed in: "The Cultural Revolution achieved a lot. It identified the main problem, which is the dark side of the party. It just didn't succeed in eradicating it."
The "dark side" of the party means those led by Deng Xiaoping, who championed the transformation of the last 17 years.
In fact, Mr. Engst had a condition for being interviewed: "You have to promise not to describe us as pro-Deng Xiaoping or pro-reform."

AIRLINE passengers have been pleasantly surprised that their trips to the airport have been more or less routine, even in the aftermath of the crash last month of Trans World Airlines Flight 800. Despite heightened security procedures, there have been few long lines or delays.
More passengers are being questioned more often, and passengers who fly frequently report that carry-on luggage is inspected far more systemically than in the past. Laptop computers, cellular phones and other carry-on electronic items are virtually certain to be inspected. 
 But lines to pass through security checkpoints have been infrequent, except for the busiest seasonal flights, for which the delays have little to do with tightened security.
"Passengers understand and agree with the need to come to the airport prepared, including having a photo ID," said Victoria E. Pannell, the spokeswoman for the Airlines Council International. "At most airports, we're only talking about 10-to- 15-minute delays at most." Members of the council operate about 850 airports worldwide, from such giants as the three New York-area airports to Yuma International Airport in Yuma, Ariz.
Los Angeles International Airport and Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, the nation's busiest, have reported a relatively smooth flow of passengers. "We haven't had any significant delays," said Megan Hughes, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Department of Aviation. "If we see lines starting to form at some terminals we've opened more checkpoints to accommodate passengers."
Airport spokesmen reiterate that the "new" security procedures are not new at all, merely a tightening of procedures decreed last year after the Oklahoma City bombing and the conviction of terrorists in the World Trade Center bombing. Until recently at many airports, laptops were given only perfunctory examinations and corporate ID cards alone were readily accepted as proof of identity. While security is still far from airtight, as some enterprising reporters have demonstrated, frequent travelers say that security checks are no longer perfunctory.
Despite the lack of delays, airport officials are still asking that passengers arrive two hours before domestic flight times and three hours before international departures. They cite the willingness of most passengers to do so as a major factor in keeping security lines to a minimum.
 
Panama Project
Eager to attract tourists, Panama has signed an agreement with a United States-South Korean consortium to build what it says will be the biggest single tourist investment in Central America and the Caribbean -- a $300 million resort complex at Fort Amador, the 207-acre United States Army base. The base, built to help protect the Panama Canal, is being phased out by the end of the year.
The consortium, United Enterprise Trust Group, with headquarters in Seoul, has agreed to build a 500-room luxury hotel on an island in Fort Amador connected by a causeway to the mainland. It will also build a monorail system, a shopping center and 300 time-share apartments. Meanwhile the Interoceanic Region Authority of Panama, which is responsible for administering United States properties reverting to Panama under terms of the Panama Canal treaty, will spend an additional $50 million on infrastructure, hoping to attract investors to build a cruise ship port at the mouth of the canal.
But there is no need to make reservations just yet. Construction on the various projects is not scheduled to begin until early next year.
 
Reservations Update
On the subject of reservations, with airlines and hotels enjoying some of their most profitable months in years, spokesmen for both industries warn that travelers who wait until the last minute to make bookings risk missing out on preferred flights or a favorite hotel room. Travel agents also say this is the first time in years they have felt compelled to warn clients to book as far in advance as possible.
And flights that are available on short notice often require high fares. When Gordon Lambourne, a spokesman for Marriott International, had to change his flight from Washington to San Diego recently, the only nonstop available was a flight that required rerouting and at a much higher fare. As a result he flew Southwest Airlines from Baltimore-Washington International Airport, stopping at Nashville and changing planes in Phoenix, and on the return flight from San Diego he stopped at Las Vegas, Nev., and changed planes in Nashville.
While fall is rarely as busy as summer, industry officials say flights and hotel rooms will be in greater demand than perhaps any fall this decade. They say this is not just because of the growing popularity of traditional foliage tours, college homecomings, parents' weekends, baseball playoffs and the like, but above all because of an improving economy. Mr. Lambourne said that Marriott's fall bookings in many major cities were "already at an all-time high."

HEADLINE: Appeals Panel Lifts a Bar to Lloyd's Plan

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, Aug. 27

 BODY:
A Federal appeals court here cleared away a major legal obstacle today to the financial recovery plan for Lloyd's of London, the venerable insurance organization that has been crippled by billions in losses.
Lloyd's officials said they would begin to put the plan into effect and hoped to receive the approval of the British Government within a few days. 
 The plan -- which would split off Lloyd's losses into a new company -- had been put in jeopardy by a lower court's ruling last Friday that would have extended for two months the deadline for acceptance by American investors. Lloyd's argued that it needed a commitment on the plan by noon tomorrow to avoid financial collapse.
The recovery plan would force the company's "names" -- the individuals who pledge their assets to back Lloyd's policies -- to pay as much as $150,000 to capitalize a new company that would take on all of Lloyd's liabilities.
Today, the appeals court dismissed a suit by the American investors, ruling that they had agreed when they signed up with Lloyd's to sue only in the British courts.
"We've now got all the legal obstacles out of the way," said Peter Lane, managing director of Lloyd's in North America, moments after Judge Paul V. Niemeyer read the decision in the modern stucco-and-dark wood-trimmed courtroom.
Mr. Lane said that Lloyd's intended to stick with its deadline Wednesday, but that because of "honest confusion" that may have arisen among American investors over the weekend, the insurance organization would continue to accept their support for the recovery plan for another day or so.
He said the 18-member managing body of Lloyd's would determine on Thursday if the plan had sufficient backing from investors to go ahead. Next, he said, the rescue package would be presented for the approval of British Government officials, which is considered likely.
The plan would create a company called Equitas with funds of $18 billion. The new company would be responsible for current and anticipated claims. To participate, Lloyd's 34,000 names around the world are being asked to pay up to $150,000 and to relinquish any claims on future profits at Lloyd's or Equitas.
When losses began mounting in the late 1980's and early 1990's, reaching a peak of $12 billion in 1992, thousands of investors sued. Investors joining the recovery plan must now abandon these suits.
Lloyd's officials in London said that by late today 82 percent of its 34,000 names, including 53 percent of the Americans, had accepted the plan. But Mr. Lane said it was not immediately clear whether that level of acceptance would yield the payments needed by Lloyd's and whether enough of the legal challenges would be disposed of so that the establishment of Equitas could proceed. One reason for the uncertainty, other Lloyd's officials said, was that the size of the payments required of individual investors varied and a tally was not expected until Wednesday or Thursday.
While the recovery plan may proceed, it is not clear whether Lloyd's will face further legal challenges in the United States.
In the courtroom today, A. Stephens Clay, the lead lawyer representing 93 American investors in the suit, told reporters, "I'm sure this is not the end of the case by any means."
But he said he would need to read the full opinion of the appellate judges before determining his next move. That opinion is not likely to be written for at least a day or so, a court official indicated.
Mr. Clay had argued that the investments made by his clients as well as the creation of Equitas involved transactions subject to the standards of United States securities laws -- that is, much more disclosure of financial details than Lloyd's had been willing to provide.
Even today, Lloyd's was unyielding on the financial data.
At one point, referring to the financial information sought by the names, Judge Diana Gribbon Motz told a Lloyd's lawyer, Harvey L. Pitt: "What you're saying is, 'We don't want to give it to them.' "
No, Mr. Pitt said: "It would not be meaningful to them."
To which, the third judge, M. Blane Michael, interjected: "That's not what they say."
But for the judges, the crucial point was not the matter of disclosure, but the fact that all of Lloyd's investors, in the United States and worldwide, had signed contracts agreeing to settle any disputes with Lloyd's in the British courts.
In its order today, the court said its decision rested on the belief that the contract conceding British jurisdiction should be enforced. Several Federal district courts had reached the same conclusion earlier. So it surprised Lloyd's when District Judge Robert Payne had ruled against them on that point, as well as on the issue of disclosure, last Friday.
When the decision was announced, a colleague hugged Mr. Pitt, and Mr. Lane said, as he headed out of the room, "Clearly it's the right decision."
Across the courtroom, Mr. Clay and his colleagues had fallen silent. They had been ready for a setback, such as a lifting of Judge Payne's injunction that extended the deadline for acceptance. But they had hoped that Judge Payne's order for Lloyd's to produce more financial details and to debate the issues at a trial in November would stand. Instead, the appeals court dismissed Mr. Clay's entire case.
The judges conducted a feisty review of the case, giving each side about an hour to speak and peppering the lawyers with questions. Mr. Pitt had gone first and when he sat down, it seemed to many in the courtroom that the judges were anything but favorably disposed toward him. But then Mr. Clay took the podium, and the judges went after him.

HEADLINE: Municipal Elections in Bosnia Postponed, Raising Doubts About Troop Pullout

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Aug. 27

 BODY:
The Western official in charge of the September elections in Bosnia today postponed the vote for municipal officers around the country, citing "widespread abuse of rules and regulations."
Monitors have recently documented a pattern of abuses, especially by Bosnian Serb officials, in which refugees were directed to register for voting in strategically important towns, in an effort to consolidate the Serbs' control of Bosnian towns that were once ethnically mixed. 
 Even as he put off the elections for local leaders, the official, Robert Frowick, said the the vote should proceed on Sept. 14 for a three-member shared national presidency, a national legislature and separate Muslim-Croat and Bosnian Serb regional legislatures because the detected abuses would have less serious effects in those races.
Still, the delay raised fears in Western capitals and among NATO commanders, who are supposed to begin pulling out part of the 53,000-member peacekeeping force by the end of the year.
Concerns about the timetable for the troop withdrawal are especially acute in Washington, where President Clinton faces his own election in November and has pledged that American soldiers will be largely out of Bosnia by year's end.
At a news conference early this afternoon Mr. Frowick, a retired American diplomat who is the representative of the Organization for Security and Economic Cooperation in Europe, said that in view of the harsh winter conditions that visit Bosnia by December, it would be unrealistic to reschedule the local elections before next spring.
But later in the afternoon -- after he had telephone consultations with Washington -- Mr. Frowick said in an interview that it was likely that the municipal elections could go ahead before the departure of the peacekeeping force at the end of December.
In the interview, he insisted that the problems that led to the postponement of the local vote could be rectified in the coming weeks.
Senior NATO officers, calling the municipal vote the most volatile, say they need to be at full strength when it takes place. Many Muslims who were displaced during the war, for example, have said they want to return to their former homes, now in Serb hands, to vote. Such moves are likely to lead to clashes.
"The Dayton agreement," Mr. Frowick said, referring to the Bosnian peace accord negotiated last year in Dayton, Ohio, "said that these municipal and cantonal elections should take place if feasible, but then it did not say what to do if we decide they are not feasible. There is a gap here that needs to be filled."
In Washington, Assistant Secretary of State John C. Kornblum expressed support for the decision, saying that the evidence of manipulation of voting lists was too egregious to ignore.
In addition to Bosnian Serb efforts to pack the voting rolls in some towns, Western monitors have reported other problems with the election preparations including confusing registration lists, intimidation of opposition candidates and a refusal by state-run television stations and newspapers to give all candidates a voice.
Bosnian Serbs, who denounced today's decision, said they would hold their own municipal elections. Mr. Frowick and Mr. Kornblum both said that any such vote would be considered invalid. Officials of the Muslim-Croat Federation, who had complained loudly about the Serb tactics, welcomed the move to delay the municipal voting.
Mr. Frowick said the countries involved in the peace effort in Bosnia would hold meetings in early September to determine how to handle the postponement.
"We are trying to do too much in too short a time frame," Mr. Frowick said. "The principle objective behind all this is to see if there is a way if we can strengthen the integrity of the whole process."
Speaking of the irregularities that he felt would hinder a fair vote, Mr. Frowick said, "They're across the board; they're too pervasive; and that's what drove this decision."
It was unclear why many of these problems should affect the local and not the national vote. Mr. Frowick, insisting that tensions were greater in local contests, said the electoral guidelines have "been seriously distorted at the municipal level."
"The real problems, the searing problems of the country, are centered on the municipalities," he said.
American and European officials agree that the vote will not be completely free and fair, given the continued presence of hard-line nationalists running the three ethnic enclaves in Bosnia. But they argue that they will still help rebuild a unified country. Critics say they will only give legitimacy to Bosnia's ethnic partition.
Under terms of the Dayton agreement, Bosnia is divided into two substates: the Muslim-Croat Federation, which controls 51 percent of Bosnia, and the Bosnian Serb republic, which controls 49 percent.
Jeffrey Fisher, a senior European official, said the numerous logistical problems in the municipal election also made it impossible to proceed with the vote as scheduled.
"Fifty-five municipalities have been split by the ethnic boundary line," he said, presenting unresolved practical difficulties such as where to locate the polling places. In addition, he cited such problems as discrepancies in the number of candidates, a failure of some parties to field candidates and voter confusion about the process.
In Washington, Mr. Kornblum said the postponement of the local elections would not be a decisive factor in any decision on whether a second NATO force will replace the current one after December, and whether the American troops should play a part in any such force. He said such a decision will not be made for many weeks and only after consultation with NATO allies.
Mr. Kornblum also said the Pentagon has issued no orders to the 16,000 American troops in Bosnia to prepare them to stay past December. About 5,000 Army troops in Germany have begun preparing to head to Bosnia to provide extra security for the planned withdrawal of American soldiers at the end of the year.
The issue is to be discussed at a meeting of NATO Defense Ministers in Norway in September. Defense Secretary William J. Perry has said that if NATO decides a continued peacekeeping mission is necessary he expects American troops will be part of it.
The Bosnian Serbs have, in a move that has seen the Muslims threaten to boycott the elections, taken advantage of the current rules that allow voters to register where they lived in 1991, where they reside now or where they plan to live.
Because of their differing goals, it had been expected that many Bosnian Serb refugees from areas now controlled by the Government would choose to live and vote inside Serb-controlled territory.
Diplomats note, for example, that there were 80,000 Serbs in Sarajevo before the war, but less than 40 have actually registered to vote in their old city, now controlled by the Muslim-led Bosnian Government.
But recent evidence indicates that Serb leaders have gone beyond that, packing the voter rolls in towns with particular strategic importance like Brcko or Srebrenica, with thousands of registrants who have no intention of living in those towns.

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS;
Excerpts From Platform Adopted at Democratic Convention

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the platform adopted last night at the Democratic National Convention.
INTRODUCTION 
 In 1996, America will choose the President who will lead us from the millennium which saw the birth of our nation, and into a future that has all the potential to be even greater than our magnificent past. Today's Democratic Party is ready for that future. Our vision is simple. We want an America that gives all Americans the chance to live out their dreams and achieve their God-given potential. We want an America that is still the world's strongest force for peace and freedom. And we want an America that is coming together around our enduring values, instead of drifting apart. . . .
 OPPORTUNITY
 For 220 years, America has been defined by a single ideal: Opportunity for all who take the responsibility to seize it. President Andrew Jackson put it best: We believe in equal opportunity for all, and special privileges for none. The mission of the Democratic Party in 1996 is to insure that the great American Dream of opportunity for all is within reach for all and that it travels with us, whole and intact, as we walk together into tomorrow.
 Economic Growth
 . . . In the next four years we have to make the new economy work for all Americans: balancing the budget, creating more jobs, making sure all families can count on good health care and a secure retirement, and, most of all, expanding educational opportunities. . . .
 President Clinton has put forward a plan to balance the budget by 2002 while living up to our commitments to our elderly and our children and maintaining strong economic growth. The Republican Congress' own economists admit the President's plan will balance the budget by 2002. It cuts hundreds of wasteful and outdated programs, but it preserves Medicare and Medicaid, it protects education and the environment, and it defends working families. The President's plan reflects America's values. The Republican plan does not. . . .
 We insist that any tax cuts are completely paid for, because we are determined to balance the budget.
 We want to strengthen middle-class families by providing a $500 tax cut for children. We want to cut taxes to help families pay for education after high school and to guarantee the first two years of college. We want people to be able to use their I.R.A.'s to buy a first home, deal with a medical emergency, or provide for education. We want to cut taxes for small businesses that invest in the future and set up pensions for their workers. And we want to cut taxes for people who are self-employed and self-insured so their health care is more affordable. . . .
 We believe that if we want the American economy to continue strong growth, we must continue to expand trade, and not retreat from the world. America's markets are open to the world, so America has a right to demand that the world's markets are open to our products. . . .
 Education
 . . . Every child should be able to read by the end of the third grade. Students should be required to demonstrate competency and achievement for promotion or graduation. Teachers in this country are among the most talented professionals we have. They should be required to meet high standards for professional performance and be rewarded for the good jobs they do. . . .
Schools should be held accountable for results. We should redesign or overhaul schools that fail. We should expand public school choice, but we should not take American tax dollars from public schools and give them to private schools. . . .
 . . . We should expand work-study so one million students a year can work their way through college by the year 2000. We should allow people to use money from their I.R.A. to help pay for college. We should give a $1,000 honor scholarship for the top 5 percent of graduates in every high school. And we must make 14 years of education the standard for every American. The Democratic Party wants to create a $10,000 tax deduction for families to help pay for education after high school. And we want to create a $1,500 tax cut for Americans, modeled after Georgia's successful Hope scholarships, to guarantee the first year of tuition at a typical community college, and the second year if individuals earn it by maintaining a B average. . . .
 Economic Security
 
 . . . We need to find new ways to help working families find economic security: better training to help workers learn skills to get new and better jobs; the security of good health care and safe pensions so they can take care of themselves and their families. This is a challenge that American workers and managers are ready to face, and the Democratic Party will continue to tackle.
 . . . In the next four years, we must take further steps to insure that Americans have access to quality, affordable health care. We should start by making sure that people get help paying premiums so they do not lose health care while they're looking for a new job. We support expanded coverage of home care, hospice, adult day-care, and community-based services, so the elderly and people with disabilities of all ages can live in their own communities and as independently as possible. . . .
 RESPONSIBILITY
 Today's Democratic Party knows that the era of big government is over. Big bureaucracies and Washington solutions are not the real answers to today's challenges. We need a smaller government, and we must have a larger national spirit. Government's job should be to give people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives.
 Fighting Crime
 . . . Nothing is more effective in the fight against crime than police officers on the beat, engaged in community policing. The Crime Bill is putting 100,000 new police officers on the street. We deplore cynical Republican attempts to undermine our promise to America to put 100,000 new police officers on the street. We pledge to stand up for our communities and stand with our police officers by opposing any attempt to repeal or weaken this effort. But we know that community policing only works when the community works with the police. We echo the President's challenge to Americans: If 50 citizens joined each of America's 20,000 neighborhood watch groups, we would have a citizen force of one million strong. . . .
 We must do everything we can to stand behind our police officers, and the first thing we should do is pass a ban on cop-killer bullets. Any bullet that can rip through a bulletproof vest should be against the law. . . .
 
 Immigration
 . . . As we work to stop illegal immigration, we call on all Americans to avoid the temptation to use this issue to divide people from each other. We deplore those who use the need to stop illegal immigration as a pretext for discrimination. . . .
Democrats want to protect American jobs by increasing criminal and civil sanctions against employers who hire illegal workers, but Republicans continue to favor inflammatory rhetoric over real action. We will continue to enforce labor standards to protect workers in vulnerable industries. We continue to firmly oppose welfare benefits for illegal immigrants. We believe family members who sponsor immigrants into this country should take financial responsibility for them, and be held legally responsible for supporting them.
 Welfare Reform
 . . . Republicans wanted to eliminate the guarantee of health care for the poor, the elderly and the disabled. They were wrong, and we stopped them. Republicans wanted to destroy the food stamp and school lunch programs that provide basic nutrition to millions of working families and poor children. They were wrong, and we stopped them. Republicans wanted to gut child abuse prevention and foster care. They were wrong, and we stopped them. Republicans wanted to cut off young, unwed mothers -- because they actually thought their children would be better off living in an orphanage. They were dead wrong, and we stopped them. The bill Republicans in Congress passed last year was values-backward; it was soft on work and tough on children, and we applaud the President for stopping it.
 We know the new bill passed by Congress is far from perfect -- parts of it should be fixed because they go too far and have nothing to do with welfare reform. . . . Choice
 The Democratic Party stands behind the right of every woman to choose, consistent with Roe v. Wade, and regardless of ability to pay. President Clinton took executive action to make sure that the right to make such decisions is protected for all Americans. Over the last four years, we have taken action to end the gag rule and insure safety at family planning and women's health clinics. We believe it is a fundamental constitutional liberty that individual Americans -- not government -- can best take responsibility for making the most difficult and intensely personal decisions regarding reproduction. . . .
 We support contraceptive research, family planning, comprehensive family life education and policies that support healthy childbearing. . . .
 Reinventing Government
 . . . For years, Republicans talked about making government smaller while letting it grow -- Democrats are doing it. For years, Republicans talked about cutting the deficit while letting it climb -- Democrats are doing it. For years, Republicans talked about shifting power back to states and communities -- Democrats are doing it. For years, Republicans talked about making government more businesslike and efficient -- Democrats are doing it. . . .
 Political Reform
 . . . The President and the Democratic Party support the bipartisan McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. It will limit campaign spending, curb the influence of PAC's and lobbyists and end the soft-money system. Perhaps most important of all, this bill provides free TV time for candidates. . . .
 SECURITY, FREEDOM,
 AND PEACE

 . . . Four years ago, there was good reason to worry that the world was dividing into separate, isolated, regional trading blocks. Today, thanks to Clinton Administration efforts to find new markets for American products and strengthen our existing ties, America's relations with our trading parties around the world are stronger than ever. . . .
 
 Strengthening Our Security
 . . . Today's Democratic Party is committed to strengthening our military and adapting it to new challenges; reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction; and meeting new challenges to our security such as terrorism, international crime and drug trafficking.
 . . . The Democratic Party is committed to a strong and balanced National Missile Defense (N.M.D.) program. The Administration is spending $3 billion a year on six different systems to protect our troops in the field and our allies from short and medium range missiles. To prepare for the possibility of a long-range missile attack on American soil by a rogue state, the Clinton Administration is committed to developing by the year 2000 a defensive system that could be deployed by 2003, well before the threat becomes real. The Democratic Party opposes the Republican N.M.D. plan -- spending up to $60 billion on a revival of the "Star Wars" program that would force us to choose a costly system today that could be obsolete tomorrow. . . .
 COMMUNITY
 . . . Putting Families First
. . . After 12 years of all family-values talk and no family-values action by the Republicans, President Clinton took office determined to put families first. We support the fundamental themes of the Families First Agenda -- promoting paycheck, health care, retirement, and personal security; creating greater educational and economic opportunity, and requiring greater responsibility from individuals, businesses and government. We believe parents should be able to take unpaid leave from work and choose flex time so they can do their job as parents: to do things like go to parent-teacher conferences or take a child to the doctor. . . .
 America is the leading exporter of intellectual property built on a strong foundation of artistic freedom. We are proud to have stopped the Republican attack on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting; we want our children to watch "Sesame Street," not "Power Rangers." And we echo the President's call to the entertainment industry: Work harder to develop and promote movies, music and TV shows that are suitable -- and educational -- for children. . . .
 Protecting Our Environment
 Today's Democratic Party wants all Americans to be able to enjoy America's magnificent natural heritage, and we want our people to know that the air they breathe is pure, the water they drink is clean, and the land they live on is safe from hazard. . . .
 Environmental protection should include more education on compliance for small and medium-sized business, more strategies to increase compliance for all businesses, and tough enforcement -- including criminal prosecution -- for those who put human health and the environment at risk.
 The American Community
 . . . Today's Democratic Party knows we must renew our efforts to stamp out discrimination and hatred of every kind, wherever and whenever we see it. . . .
We believe everyone in America should learn English so they can fully share in our daily life, but we strongly oppose divisive efforts like English-only legislation, designed to erect barriers between us and force people away from the culture and heritage of which they are rightly proud. We must remember we do not have an American to waste.
We continue to lead the fight to end discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, age, ethnicity, disability, and sexual orientation. The Democratic Party has always supported the Equal Rights Amendment, and we are committed to ensuring full equality for women and to vigorously enforce the Americans with Disabilities Act. We support continued efforts, like the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, to end discrimination against gay men and lesbians. . . .
 We know there is still more we can do to einsure equal opportunity for all Americans, so all people willing to work hard can build a strong future. President Clinton is leading the way to reform affirmative action so that it works, it is improved, and promotes opportunity, but does not accidentally hold others back in the process. Senator Dole has promised to end affirmative action. He's wrong, and the President is right. When it comes to affirmative action, we should mend it, not end it.

HEADLINE: Ex-Candidate to Stay True to Party

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: DENVER, Aug. 27

 BODY:
Professor Lamm spent his summer vacation running for President. Back on campus as practically a national household name, the failed Reform Party candidate vowed today to keep battling to break the two-party monopoly on American politics.
"There is a reform movement building in the U.S. that is far bigger than Ross Perot," the professor, Richard D. Lamm, said at the University of Denver, where he directs a public policy center. "I don't think that the role of the Reform Party is to sting like a bee and die." 
 On Wednesday, Mr. Lamm, a former three-term Governor of Colorado, is to announce in Chicago, where the Democrats are holding their convention, whether he will endorse Mr. Perot's Presidential candidacy.
While refusing to tip his hand today, Mr. Lamm said he planned to campaign this fall for Reform Party candidates across the nation. He said he would not endorse either President Clinton or Bob Dole, the Republican nominee.
At his office, Mr. Lamm said supporters had urged him to stay active with an eye to a repeat Presidential bid in the year 2000.
Showing little rancor after his six-week campaign against Mr. Perot, Mr. Lamm was relaxed today, dressed in a blue blazer and white slacks -- as if he was about to go yachting -- and let slip that he planned to go hiking in the Rockies this weekend.
Many of his supporters, however, are openly bitter over Mr. Perot's Aug. 17 victory in the Reform Party primary.
Mr. Perot "is a man who must be kept far, far away from the White House," Mr. Lamm's former spokesman, Eric Anderson, wrote this week in The Denver Post. "Perot and his employees have maintained that there was nothing wrong with the election, with the same sort of illogical insistence as tobacco executives who maintain that nicotine is not addictive."
As the Lamm-for-President office here closed today, Mr. Anderson ran through a list of complaints against Mr. Perot.
Reform Party officials first refused to give Lamm campaigners computer lists of the names and addresses of party members. After relenting on the list, the party officials wanted the right to pre-approve any Lamm mailings.
After Lamm workers had printed up signs for the party's convention, party officials ruled that they were too large. Before the primary vote, party officials mailed thousands of postcards reminding the party faithful to vote. The cards carried Mr. Perot's name and photograph but neither Mr. Lamm's name nor his photograph.
When the primary results were tabulated, 64,078 votes were declared invalid, more than the 49,302 that were declared valid. In the end, Mr. Perot won the nomination with the votes of only 2.8 percent of an officially estimated party membership of 1.13 million people.
In response to the complaints, Sharon Holman, a Perot spokeswoman, said today that Mr. Lamm "had a level playing field."
Bitterness over the nomination process has run so deep that two leaders in the party's largest state organization, that of California, are no longer in the party.
One of them, Mark Sturdevant, resigned on Monday as vice chairman of the Reform Party California. "I believe in the reform movement," Mr. Sturdevant said, "but I don't believe in the party revolving around one person."
The other, Ted Muga, was ousted last week as chairman of one of the party's largest county groups, in San Diego, after a vote by the group's board, which is controlled by Mr. Perot's supporters.
The board's resolution regarding Mr. Muga read, "He has the gall to call our founder, hero and favored, 'drafted' candidate, Perot, a 'dictator.' "
In response, Mr. Muga said in an interview: "The Dallas purge has started. I was the first one."
But, nationwide, no other major Lamm supporters are known to have left the party. A national caucus of party officials is scheduled for Sept. 28 in Schaumburg, Ill.
Mr. Lamm, a lifelong Democrat until this summer, said today that the major parties' conventions convinced him all the more of the necessity of a third party.
"We have Christopher Reeve calling for billions of dollars for more medical research, while 40 million Americans don't have health insurance," he said, referring to the speech by the paralyzed actor on Monday at the Democratic National Convention. "Every year, 600,000 American women give birth without pre-natal care. The Democrats have no concept of setting priorities, of making choices.
"Dole's 15 percent tax cut, and the Democrats' demagoging on health care, are the poster boys of the irresponsibilties in American politics. We cannot do politically what we need to do economically."
To get these issues before the American voters, Mr. Lamm said he hoped that Mr. Perot would be invited to join television debates with Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole.
"I would endorse Ross Perot as the teach-in professor of America," Mr. Lamm said, adding that he and Mr. Perot had not spoken since the primary night.

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS: THE DEMOCRAT;
Clinton Makes Stops in Midwest for Politics and Calls for Literacy Project

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WYANDOTTE, Mich., Aug. 27

 BODY:
President Clinton barnstormed Ohio and Michigan today, mixing traditional Democratic politicking at a Jeep factory with the announcement of a new Government proposal to fight illiteracy. But the strains inside his coalition also became evident when an Ohio Congresswoman sharply criticized the Nafta trade pact before a crowd gathered to hear the President.
Mr. Clinton's literacy proposal is part of a series of child-focused initiatives that he hopes will appeal to suburban parents. 
 But an otherwise harmonious day of campaigning was interrupted when Representative Marcy Kaptur denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Clinton pushed through Congress in 1993 over the protests of many Democrats, while she was warming up a crowd of workers at the Chrysler Jeep Factory in Toledo, Ohio.
The contrasting images from the third day of the President's train trip to the Democratic National Convention showed the distinctive mix of positions he has used this year to create an image as a values-oriented Democrat as well as the opposition of many more traditional Democrats to some of his policies.
At the Jeep factory, Ms. Kaptur -- who has been a vigorous campaigner for Mr. Clinton's re-election, despite her opposition to Nafta -- charged that while Mr. Clinton's trade policies were increasing car exports, they were allowing jobs in other fields to slip overseas. "Those immigrant workers of the Lower East Side, they have a right to work, just like our people here. Those 14,000 tomato workers in Florida that lost their jobs because of Nafta -- it's a crime! It's a crime!"
The President had expected some criticism from Ms. Kaptur over Nafta, said Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary. "It's a demonstration of the strength of the President's position," Mr. McCurry said, "that Democrats are willing to set aside some of their disagreements to rally to his candidacy."
The President's aides say the initiatives being put forward this week will add up to $8.45 billion in new programs or tax cuts through 2002. He will finish unveiling them in a convention address that will include a $3.4 billion program of tax incentives and grants to help provide jobs for people being forced off welfare benefits. Mr. Clinton plans to propose on Wednesday an environmental program costing about $2 billion.
To explain how the Federal budget would be balanced, White House officials today announced measures to offset the costs of the proposals, including a $5.3 billion tax increase on export sales by multinational corporations, $541 million in new fees on corporate jets and $500 million to be raised by auctioning part of the communications spectrum.
In Toledo, Mr. Clinton told cheering auto workers, "For the first time since the 1970's, America -- America -- is the No. 1 producer and seller of automobiles again in the entire world."
He gave only the most oblique nod to Ms. Kaptur's criticism, saying: "We want to lift countries up to our level. We don't want to see people dragged down to the lowest level in the global economy. We want it to lead to growth everywhere."
The workers greeted Mr. Clinton with cheers and applause. "When he took over, we were working on a week, off a week for 12 years," said Floyd King, a 58-year-old test driver. "Since President Clinton, we're been working to capacity because people are back at work and people could afford new cars."
Riding the rails into Michigan, another battleground state, Mr. Clinton switched themes at a rally outside a public library and talked about education, a topic aimed at the middle-class suburban parents who his strategists believe will be crucial to the outcome of the election.
"I have come here to this wonderful community to ask all of you to join me, without regard to your political party or your views on other issues, in a simple, straightforward, critical national goal," Mr. Clinton said. "All America's children should be able to read on their own by the third grade."
Playing to the crowd, Mr. Clinton listened, and even read along, as two towheaded children, Justin Whitney, 7, and Elizabeth Schweye, 9, read him "The Little Engine That Could."
He wants to spend $2.75 billion over five years in an effort to make all third graders literate. Of that, $1.45 billion would finance reading specialists for after-school tutoring, $1 billion would be used to assign 11,000 young people in the Americorps national service program to tutoring, and $300,000 would be used to help parents with poor reading skills learn to teach their children.
Tony Blankley, a spokesman for Speaker Newt Gingrich, scoffed at the President's education proposals, saying on the "Fox Morning News": "Bill Clinton is defending the status quo on education. He is beholden to the teachers' unions."

HEADLINE: Dole Tries To Focus On Economy

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: SANTA BARBARA, Calif., Aug. 27

 BODY:
Bob Dole took a break from sunbathing today to showcase his plan that he says is needed to perk up the economy -- even as new monthly figures showed that consumer confidence had reached a six-year high.
The Republican Presidential nominee, more deeply tanned than usual, fairly glowed as he met with his economic advisers and later held a round-table discussion with local business owners at a food distribution plant here to promote his plan to cut taxes and balance the budget at the same time. 
 Today's event came as the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index reported rising this month to its highest level since March 1990 -- an important economic indicator that clouds Mr. Dole's contention that the economy under President Clinton has flagged and needs Republican supply-side prodding to reinvigorate it.
Mr. Dole played down the report, saying consumer confidence "is just not there." At another point he told reporters: "You didn't look at the right facts. The economy's in the tank."
But if Mr. Dole doubted consumer confidence, he radiated his own, even in the face of mounting skepticism about him and his economic plan being played out on national television at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.
At his economic round-table discussion, where his Vice-Presidential running mate, Jack Kemp, joined him, he seemed far more polished and engaged than he has at such outings earlier in his 18-month campaign.
"When you hear President Clinton say we can't do it, it's going to blow a hole in his deficit, in his budget -- it's already blown a hole in his lead, and I think that's his problem," said Mr. Dole, referring to Mr. Clinton's drop in public opinion polls since Mr. Dole announced his economic plan earlier this month.
John Taylor, an economist from Stanford University, said Mr. Dole's economic advisers expected the economic growth rate to slow next year to just 1.9 percent, down from this year's average of 2.4 percent. Mr. Dole has promised to raise it to 3.5 percent, and he asserted today that his plan would "free up the American dream, free up the American entrepreneur" to increase growth and productivity.
The candidate's confidence was also on display as he waded into crowds and signed autographs during a stroll down the main street of this coastal resort in search of Mexican food.
At one point, he passed a man talking on a pay phone with his wife, who was home in Santa Cruz.
"This is my wife, Amy," said the man, Ted Pearson, as he extended the receiver to the passing candidate. "Say 'Hi' to Amy."
Grabbing the phone, the 73-year-old candidate chirped, "Hey, Amy, how you doing?" Mr. Dole asked if she had registered to vote and betrayed no disappointment when she said she was a Democrat.
Later, Amy Pearson told The Santa Barbara News-Press that she had wanted to grill Mr. Dole about health care, but that she had missed her chance.
"I totally caved," Mrs. Pearson said. "I wished him luck. I meant it, but don't win."
But Mr. Dole, like a heedless teen-ager, brandished his greatest display of self-assurance when it came to soaking up the sun.
His favorite pursuit, at work or play, is getting tan, and he has devoted himself mightily to this task in the first two days of his four-day vacation here -- so much so that a passing dermatologist scolded him for not protecting himself better from the ravages of the rays.
Dr. Pamela Rand, the dermatologist, and her husband were guests at the Biltmore Hotel where Mr. Dole and his wife, Elizabeth, are staying. As the Rands posed for photographs with Mr. Dole, Dr. Rand asked him if he was wearing sun screen.
Mr. Dole said, "Yes, No. 4."
The doctor told him, "That's not good enough."
As the Doles made their way later to Joe's Cafe for dinner, along with Ken Khachigian, a top campaign adviser, and Donald Rumsfeld, Mr. Dole's top policy adviser, another bystander asked Mr. Dole about the amount of sun he was getting.
"I got about three hours this morning," he boasted. Pointing to his reddened nose, he added, "Look at this!"
Perhaps chastened by Dr. Rand's scolding, he admitted, "A dermatologist came by and said, 'You shouldn't be out there.' "
But the candidate, famous for ignoring the advice of his campaign advisers, gave no indication that he was any more prone to following the advice of the doctor. Before a rally tonight, he spent a few hours lounging in the sun.

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS: Man in the News;
'Four (12?) More Years': Albert Arnold Gore Jr.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 27

 BODY:
"This two-headed monster of Dole-Gingrich," Vice President Al Gore declared on Sunday, a sparkle in his eyes, a sinister tone in his voice, his entire body in motion, "has launched an all-out assault on decades of progress on behalf of working men and women."
Mr. Gore had struck a chord. His friendly audience of labor delegates to the Democratic National Convention rose, and hissed and booed the Republican demons. 
 The Vice President stood on the podium with the kind of broad, natural grin that comes easily to most other politicians. Then the crowd began to chant, "Four more years!"
People who have watched Mr. Gore throughout his career had never seen him so animated. It was a good beginning to a crucial week for him. For four more years is not enough for Mr. Gore. He dreams of 8 or 12 more.
But to fulfill his dream of being elected President in the year 2000, the 48-year-old Mr. Gore may have to dispel the rap against him that his style is too flat and wooden to generate enthusiasm among voters.
The convention here is a big chance to do that. He has appearances scheduled across the city all week and two addresses to the convention itself, one on Wednesday night, just before President Clinton's name is placed in nomination, and again on Thursday night, when he himself accepts the nomination for another term as Vice President.
History is on his side. Except for Spiro T. Agnew, who resigned in disgrace, and Dan Quayle, whose political career may not yet be over, everyone else elected Vice President since 1952 has later won his party's nomination to be President.
Plenty of obstacles beyond his personality lie in Mr. Gore's path to the Presidential nomination four years from now.
First, of course, he and Mr. Clinton must win re-election in November. Then he must avoid being blamed for problems over which he will have little control that are sure to arise in the economy and elsewhere during the next four years.
"These are times," said Prof. Charles O. Jones, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin, "when politicians are taking things away from voters -- cutting Medicare, balancing the budget -- rather than giving to them, and it's very difficult to remain popular."
But Mr. Gore does have an important advantage. More than any other Vice President, he has been deeply involved in White House decision-making. That would help him remain in public view during a second term and could help him protect his flanks politically.
"Al Gore clearly has taken the Vice Presidency to a new level," said Prof. Michael Nelson, a political scientist at Rhodes College in Memphis, who has made a specialty of studying the Vice Presidency. "It is clear to me that no other Vice President in history has enjoyed the same level of responsibility and good personal relations with the President."
With an office in the White House -- he calls it the Square Office -- less than 20 paces down the hall from the Oval Office, Mr. Gore has the freedom to pop in to see the President at will. Staff members say he does so many times a day. They say that he operates essentially as a very senior adviser and that in four years hardly a policy decision has been made in which he did not have a voice.
In addition, the President has delegated entire areas of responsibility to him, including environmental protection, telecommunications policy, the space program and trimming the size of the Government. The program Mr. Gore calls Reinventing Government had reduced Federal employment by 240,000 positions by the first of this year, according to the White House, making the number of civilian Federal employees the smallest since the Kennedy Administration.
Just last week Mr. Clinton gave the Vice President credit for stimulating Administration interest that led to the new policy cracking down on smoking by children, a subject that has long concerned Mr. Gore, whose only sibling -- his sister, Nancy, 10 years older -- was a heavy smoker who died of lung cancer in 1984.
Mr. Gore has also become deeply involved in managing policy with Russia. He set up what he calls a commission with the Russian Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, that brings together Cabinet secretaries of both countries to work on bilateral issues like trade and arms control.
Mr. Gore, who has traveled abroad more than 30 times since becoming Vice President, has also taken responsibility for relations with Egypt and South Africa.
Every task has been undertaken with an effort not to overshadow the President.
"Once Clinton realized that Gore was in no way going to be a rival," Professor Nelson said, "he was free to take full advantage of Gore's talents."
Mr. Gore's advice to the President has not always been accepted. For example, he urged the President to stand fast to the promise to allow homosexuals to serve openly in the military, and was said by White House assistants to favor more aggressive action in Bosnia than the President was willing to take.
Mr. Gore was also embarrassed in early 1994 when he championed the nomination of Bobby Ray Inman to be Secretary of Defense. Having agreed to take the post, Mr. Inman withdrew in the face of criticism, largely over his prior role as a member of the outside board of a corrupt arms company.
But Mr. Gore has never taken issue with the President publicly. In fact, he has been so loyal to Mr. Clinton that he has not publicly mentioned his own Presidential ambition since the day he was tapped in 1992 to run for Vice President on the Clinton ticket. This is noteworthy for a man who first announced his candidacy for President before he was 40 years old and whose friends say he is certainly no less ambitious than he was then, in 1988.
In an interview last week, Mr. Gore brushed off a question about running for President. "I define my purpose in this job very simply, to help Bill Clinton be the best President he's capable of being," he said.
"I don't see this as primarily a preparatory job," the Vice President continued. "I'm not focused on making the race myself in the future."
But he has never made any secret of wanting to be President, his questioner protested.
"No," Mr. Gore responded, "but I haven't said it since I've had this job. I don't want to be misleading, but I have not proactively said that to anyone."
That is true. But the thought of his being President has been in his mind and that of his family since he was a child. "We raised him for it," his father, Al Sr., a Democratic Representative and Senator from Tennessee for more than 30 years, said in an interview four years ago, on the day his son was picked to run for Vice President.
His father was in Congress when Albert Arnold Gore Jr. was born in Washington on March 31, 1948. As a child, Al Jr. lived in his parents' suite in a hotel on Embassy Row, attended private schools and had his head patted by many of the most prominent politicians in the country. He spent his summers on the family farm in Carthage, Tenn., about 40 miles east of Nashville, working the fields with the hired hands.
The Vice President's parents -- his mother, Pauline, is a lawyer -- are now well into their 80's and live on the farm in Carthage.
As a student at Harvard, Mr. Gore opposed the Vietnam War. But after graduation he enlisted in the Army and spent a year in a noncombat job in Vietnam. Friends say the main reason he enlisted was to spare his father, who was in what would prove to be a losing race for re-election to the Senate in 1970, the political burden of having a draft-dodging son.
Just before he left for Vietnam, he married Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson, known as Tipper. They now have four children: Karenna, 23; Kristin, 19; Sarah, 17, and Albert 3d, 13. The family is Baptist.
After leaving the Army, Mr. Gore returned to Tennessee. He worked for a time in Nashville as a reporter and editorial writer for The Tennessean, and went to Vanderbilt Law School.
When he was 28, the seat in the Congressional district that included Carthage came open, and he ran and won. Eight years later, in 1984, he was elected to the Senate. He was re-elected in 1990.
In 1988, only 39 years old and in his first term in the Senate, Mr. Gore entered the Democratic primaries for President.
His flat speaking style and tendency to keep his distance from the public cost him. He lost badly in the New York primary despite the support of Edward I. Koch, who was then Mayor, and withdrew from the race.
Mr. Gore's friends say he is anything but dull in private. A White House official says that when Mr. Clinton is in an especially bad mood, Mr. Gore can often bring him out of his funk by teasing him.
But on stage the Vice President rarely seems comfortable. Too often his smile seems forced, his word emphasis misplaced. He has even taken to making fun of himself in his speeches.
"How can you tell Al Gore from a roomful of Secret Service agents?" he asked his audience at the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Louisville, Ky., last week. "He's the stiff one."
Asked why he had decided to call attention to what has often been his Achilles' heel, Mr. Gore responded: "I can't do anything about it. I might as well make the best of it."

Profit Motive Clouds Effort To Buy Up A-Bomb Material
The American Government-owned corporation that is charged with acquiring much of Russia's military stockpile of uranium for resale as civilian nuclear reactor fuel turned down repeated Russian offers this year to sell material sufficient to build 400 bombs comparable to the one that destroyed Hiroshima.
The incident raises the question of whether the corporation, the United States Enrichment Corporation, put its profits ahead of national security. The purchase agreement was a centerpiece of the urgent American effort to keep the ingredients of powerful weapons in the former Soviet Union out of the hands of terrorists or rogue nations.

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS;
Excerpts From Remarks by Cuomo, Jackson, Bayh and the First Lady

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks yesterday at the Democratic National Convention by the Rev. Jesse Jackson; Gov. Evan Bayh of Indiana, the keynote speaker; former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, and and Hillary Rodham Clinton: 
 MR. JACKSON
Thirty-three years ago tonight, a young preacher about the same age as my son was putting the final touches on one of the great prophetic messages of our age. Aug. 28, 1963, Dr. King projected a vision of peace and equality that could heal our nation in a troubled world.
The Republicans in San Diego put forward the image, the vision of a big tent. On the cover was General Powell and Jack Kemp. But clearly you cannot judge a book by its cover. For inside, the book was written by Newt Gingrich and Ralph Reed and Pat Buchanan. All the rights that made General Powell possible are now under assault for the next generation, and all that Kemp believed in until last week is now under assault.
What is our challenge tonight? Just look around this place. This publicly financed United Center is a new Chicago mountaintop. To the south, Comiskey Park, another mountaintop. To the west, Cooke County jail.
Two ball parks, a jail.
That jail, mostly youthful inmates 80 percent drug-positive, 90 percent high school dropouts, 92 percent functionally illiterate, 75 percent recidivist rate. They go back sicker and slicker.
Between these mountains of the ball parks and the jails was once Campbell's Soup and Sears and Zenith and Sunbeam and stockyards. There were jobs, and there was industry; now there's a canyon of welfare and despair.
This canyon exists in virtually every city in America. One-tenth of all American children will go to bed in poverty tonight. Half of all America's African-American children grow up amidst broken sidewalks, broken hearts, broken cities and broken dreams.
The No. 1 growth industry in urban America: jail. Half of all public housing built to last 10 years. Jails. The top wealthiest 1 percent wealthiest Americans own as much as the bottom 95 percent, the great inequality since the 1920's. As corporations downsize jobs, outsource contracts, scab on workers' rights, a class crisis emerges as a race problem. But the strawberry pickers in California, the chicken workers in North Carolina deserve a hearing. We must seek a new moral center.
My brothers and my sisters, we have been here before. Hear this tonight: We've been here before. The last time we gathered in Chicago high winds ripped apart our big tent. We could not bridge that gap between strongly held opinions. We lost to Nixon by the margin of our despair.
In 1968, the tension within our party was over warfare. In 1996, it's welfare.
Last week, over the objections of many Democratic party leaders and the opposition of millions of Americans, Franklin Roosevelt's six-decade guarantee of support for women and children was abandoned. On this issue, many of us differed with the President. Patricia Ireland and I even picketed the White House. We're all for welfare reform, but we want jobs, and day care and health care as the alternatives.
The good news is this: When Pataki and Wilson disagreed in San Diego, they were sent to Siberia, and Gingrich had to do a volleyball and Trent Lott had to sing a song. We have the right to express ourselves, and that's diversity, and that's the Democratic Party.
My brothers and my sisters, diversity is the measure of the party's strength, how we handle adversity the measure of our character. We must find the bridge to keep our tent intact. We must make the commitment to right the wrongs in the bill. We need a Democratic Congress. Now that we have ended welfare as we know it, let's fight for jobs and day care and health education as we ought to know it.
Kid us if you will, the fight was never about welfare; it was always about jobs and opportunity. . . .
For us Democrats, when we change the course, the real issue is not "three strikes and you're out." If the crime is vicious enough, maybe one strike is enough. But what about the vision of "four balls and you're on"? Prenatal care and Head Start, ball one; an adequately funded public education, ball two; a marketable skill, ball three; and a job, ball four. Put America on. Lift our youth up, not lock them up.
What shall we do? Between these two ball parks and this jail, what shall we do in this canyon between the ball parks and the jail, we shall reclaim our children. Certainly, these stakes are very high in 1996. We have the burden and the obligation to win for yet unborn generations. What shall we do economically?
We have $6 trillion in private and public pension funds. Why can't we take 5 percent of that money, $300 billion, government secured -- use that money to reinvest in our infrastructure and put America back to work. We did it for Poland. We made for Poland 40-year loans at three quarters of 1 percent, first payment due in 10 years. If we can rebuild Poland and Europe and Japan, we can build Chicago and Atlanta and Memphis and Nashville. We can rebuild America.
Don't stop there. My friends, as I rise to support our President, let me make this case. Our Presidents must make strong positions on defense and offense.
President Clinton has been our first line of defense against the Newt Gingrich contract; America's right-wing assault on elderly, our students and our civil rights. We must maintain with integrity the first lines of defense as they attack the integrity of the First Lady. It's beneath the dignity of American citizens. We have that obligation. It's a moral obligation. It's a moral obligation.
My brothers and my sisters, when the President stands for the end of assault weapons, raises minimum wage, earned income taxes, stands with the mourning congregations of burned churches, stands for affirmative action and voting rights and social justice and general equality, he deserves four more years.
 
MR. BAYH
Tonight, I stand between my father and my sons. The dreams our parents had for us are the dreams Susan and I share for our boys. The times are vastly different now; the challenges we face are new. But the values that must guide us are the same.
They are the values that President Clinton has worked to restore to meet the challenges of our time: Opportunity for all Americans; responsibility from all Americans, and a sense of community among all Americans.
And he's meeting our economic challenges. Since President Clinton took office, over 10 million new jobs have been created -- four times the number during the previous four years; over a million new jobs in construction and manufacturing alone. And for the first time since the 1970's America leads the world in making cars -- ahead of Japan.
And President Clinton's protecting our traditional value of making hard work pay. He fought for an increase in the minimum wage -- and 10 million Americans got a pay raise. He cut taxes for 15 million families who get up every morning and work hard all day long -- only to get a paycheck on Friday that still leaves them in poverty. But now, anyone who works 40 hours a week in America will not live in poverty.
But we must go beyond these historic gains because our progress has yet to touch all Americans. In quiet corners across our country, families still struggle to pay the mortgage, save for college, make ends meet. To you, our neighbors, I say the president's agenda for the future reaches these quiet corners. His agenda balances the budget to keep interest rates down and the economy strong.
It protects against wholesale cuts for the elderly, the sick, the young, the environment and the fight against crime and drugs. And it provides for tax cuts -- not an election-year gimmick, but targeted tax cuts aimed at families trying to care for and educate our children, a $500 credit for every child, $1,500 to help pay for the first two years of college, a $10,000 deduction for education and training after high school.
We create real opportunity with these tax cuts -- and, what's more -- we can pay for them. Now that's something our opponents just can't say. They know their plan is too expensive -- it will explode the deficit, raise interest rates, slow the economy and still require deeper cuts in the things we for which we care.
Our President is committed to balancing the budget and giving families the tools they need to build their own lives. And that's what governing is all about. Getting priorities straight -- and holding to them. And that's just what we did in Indiana. First we balanced the budget, and then we passed the largest tax cut in history with more funding for schools every year. . . .
In this election, no issue more clearly defines the differences between the two major parties and our nominees than education. On that issue alone, President Clinton and Democrats who share his vision deserve the support of the American people.
And we're meeting the challenge of changing welfare while still protecting our values. President Clinton understands that welfare was intended to be temporary, make work possible. And across America he's made that happen.
 
MR. CUOMO
Some of the President's choices have been more controversial than others. The welfare reform bill has been one of the most difficult. Many of us,-- and I among them, believe that the risk to children was too great to justify the action of signing that bill, no matter what its political benefits.
I know because I've spoken with him and with the Vice President, and with Hillary, I know that they all understood and understand the risk. But the President is confident that he can advert this risk by further legislation before children are actually harmed.
We should all hope and pray -- we should all hope and pray that the President is right. But we should do something more than hope and pray. We cannot rely on the Republicans to cooperate with President Clinton to save our children. We need to give the President the strength of a Democratic Congress.
We need to help the President make this law better, as he has assured us that he will.
And we need to do a lot more even beyond welfare. When we talk of welfare, of course we all want people on welfare to work. So do most of them want to work. But there must be jobs, not in Thailand, not in China, not in Mexico, but here in Chicago and rural Mississippi and in East L.A.! And not jobs that can barely be called jobs; jobs that give real hope, jobs that give a man, give a woman the dignity of knowing that they can work their way up in this society. Real jobs.
Of course we want only the government we need, but we continue to insist, as Democrats, on all the government we need. And that includes government that will help more Americans find real health insurance, to make sure our day care options get better, not worse.
Of course we want and demand a balanced budget. No one in the modern history of this country, no president has done more to move toward a balanced budget than has President Bill Clinton.
But Democrats also know that it is a shameful thing that in some of our public schools the highest form of technology available is a metal detector. We know that our students must have access to the information superhighway, but we also know, because we're honest with ourselves, that the information superhighway is a toll road.
It has to be paid for, and the government can help with that, too. Frankly, it's one of the best things that government can do for us -- help us to educate ourselves.
As a matter of fact, ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters, we have at this moment a great opportunity. President Clinton, with the help of a Democratic Congress, can do for education what President John Kennedy did for space.
We are the richest the freest, the most powerful nation in world history -- the richest, the most powerful in world history. Is there any reason why we should not be the best educated and the most highly-skilled people in this fiercely competitive world. We are not, but we can be, and President Clinton can lead us there.
 
MRS. CLINTON
 You know, we are gathered here together to have a really good time. I am overwhelmed and very grateful to all of you. You know after this reception, I think you all are ready for the rest of this convention, which has already been so positive and good.
I know, and you know, that Chicago is my kind of town. And Chicago is my kind of village.
 I have so many friends here, people who have been important to me all my life, and it seems like every single one of them has given me advice on this speech. One friend suggested that I appear here tonight with Binti, the child-saving gorilla from the Brookfield Zoo.
You know, as this friend explained, Binti is a typical Chicagoan, tough on the outside but with a heart of gold underneath.
Another friend advised me that I should cut my hair and color it orange and then change my name to Hillary Rodman Clinton.
But after considering these and countless other suggestions, I decided to do tonight what I've been doing for more than 25 years; I want to talk about what matters most in our lives and in our nation -- children and families.
I wish we could be sitting around a kitchen table, just us, talking about our hopes and fears, about our children's futures. For Bill and me, family has been the center of our lives. But we also know that our family, like your family, is part of a larger community that can help or hurt our best efforts to raise our child.
Right now, in our biggest cities and our smallest towns, there are boys and girls being tucked gently into bed, and there are boys and girls who have no one to call Mom or Dad, and no place to call home.
Right now, there are mothers and fathers just finishing a long day's work. And there are mothers and fathers just going to work, some to their second or third jobs of the day.
Right now, there are parents worrying, "What if the baby sitter is sick tomorrow?" Or, "How can we pay for college this fall?" And right now there are parents despairing about gang members and drug pushers on the corners in their neighborhoods.
Right now, there are parents questioning a popular culture that glamorizes sex and violence, smoking and drinking, and teaches children that the logos on their clothes are more valued than the generosity in their hearts.
But also right now there are dedicated teachers preparing their lessons for the new school year. There are volunteers tutoring and coaching children. There are doctors and nurses caring for sick children, police officers working to help kids stay out of trouble and off drugs.
Of course, parents, first and foremost, are responsible for their children.
But we are all responsible for insuring that children are raised in a nation that doesn't just talk about family values, but acts in ways that values families.
Just think, as Christopher Reeve so eloquently reminded us last night, we are all part of one family, the American family. And each one of us has value. Each child who comes into this world should feel special, every boy and every girl.
Our daughter, Chelsea, will graduate from college in 2001, at the dawn of the next century. Though that's not so far away, it is hard for any of us to know what the world will look like then, much less when Chelsea is my age, in the year 2028. But one thing we know for sure is that change is certain -- progress is not.
Progress depends on the choices we make today for tomorrow, and on whether we meet our challenges and protect our values. We can start by doing more to support parents and the job they have to do. Issues affecting children and families are some of the hardest we face, as parents, as citizens, as a nation.
In October, Bill and I will celebrate our 21st wedding anniversary. And Bill was with me when Chelsea was born, in the delivery room, in my hospital room, and when we brought our baby daughter home. Not only did I have lots of help, I was able to stay in the hospital as long as my doctor thought I needed to be there.
But today, too many new mothers are asked to get up and get out after 24 hours, and that is just not enough time for many new mothers and babies. That's why the President is right to support a bill that would prohibit the practice of forcing mothers and babies to leave the hospital in less than 48 hours.
That's also why more hospitals ought to install 24-hour hot lines to answer questions once new mothers and fathers get home. That's why home nurses can make such a difference to parents who may not have grandparents or aunts and uncles around to help. We have to do whatever it takes to help parents meet their responsibilities at home and at work. The very first piece of legislation that my husband signed into law had been vetoed twice, the Family and Medical Leave Law.
That law allows parents time off for the birth or adoption of a child or for family emergencies without fear of losing their jobs. Already it has helped 12 million families, and it hasn't hurt the economy one bit.
You know, Bill and I are fortunate that our jobs have allowed us to take breaks from work not only when Chelsea was born, but to attend her school events and take her to the doctor. But millions of other parents can't get time off. That's why my husband wants to expand the Family and Medical Leave Law so that parents can take time off for children's doctors appointments and parent-teacher conferences at school.
We all know that raising kids is a full-time job and since most parents work, they are, we are stretched thin. Just think about what many parents are responsible for on any given day. Packing lunches, dropping the kids off at school, going to work, checking to make sure that the kids get home from school safely, shopping for groceries, making dinner, doing the laundry, helping with homework, paying the bills, and I didn't even mention taking the dog to the vet.
That's why my husband wants to pass a flex-time law that will give parents the option to take overtime pay either in extra income or in extra time off depending upon whichever is best for your family.
Our family has been lucky to have been blessed with a child with good health. Chelsea has spent only one night in the hospital after she had her tonsils out, but Bill and I couldn't sleep at all that night.
But our experience was nothing like the emotional strain on parents when their children are seriously ill. They often worry about where they will get the money to pay the medical bills. That is why my husband has always felt that all American families should have affordable health insurance.
Just last week the President signed a bill, sponsored by Senators Kennedy and Kassebaum, a Democrat and a Republican, that will enable 25 million Americans to keep their health insurance, even when they switch jobs or lose a job or have a family member who's been sick.
This bill contains some of the key provisions from the President's proposal for health care reform. It was an important step, achieved only after both parties agreed to build, not block, progress on making health care available to all Americans.
Now the country must take the next step of helping unemployed Americans and their children keep health insurance for six months after losing their jobs.
If you lose your job, it's bad enough, but your daughter shouldn't have to lose her doctor, too. And our nation still must find a way to offer affordable health care coverage to the working poor and the 10 million children who lack health insurance today.
The President also hasn't forgotten that there are thousands of children languishing in foster care who can't be returned home. That's why he signed legislation last week that provides for a $5,000 tax credit for parents who adopt a child. It also, it also abolishes the barriers to cross-racial adoptions. Never again will a racial barrier stand in the way of a family's love.
My husband also understands that parents are their child's first teachers. Not only do we need to read to our children and talk to them in ways that encourage learning; we must support our teachers and our schools in deeds as well as words.
The President announced today an important initiative called America Reads. This initiative is aimed at making sure all children can read well by the third grade. It will require volunteers, but I know there are thousands and thousands of Americans who will volunteer to help every child read well.
For Bill and me, there has been no experience more challenging, more rewarding, and more humbling than raising our daughter.
And we have learned that to raise a happy, healthy and hopeful child, it takes a family, it takes teachers, it takes clergy, it takes business people, it takes community leaders, it takes those who protect our health and safety, it takes all of us.
Yes, it takes a village.
And it takes a President.
It takes a President who believes not only in the potential of his own child, but of all children -- who believes not only in the strength of his own family, but of the American family, who believes not only in the promise of each of us as individuals, but in our promise together as a nation.
It takes a President who not only holds these beliefs but acts on them.
It takes Bill Clinton.
Sometimes, late at night, when I see Chelsea doing her homework, or watching TV, or talking to a friend on the phone, I think to myself, her life and the lives of millions of boys and girls will be better because of what all of us are doing together. They will face fewer obstacles and more possibilities. That is something we should all be proud of, and that is what this election is all about.

HEADLINE: U.S. OPEN 1996;
Next Year, a Closer Look Will Be Costly at Open

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
The already extravagant cost of experiencing the United States Open tennis championships will get an expensive jolt next year when the tournament moves to a new 20,000-seat stadium being built within a lob of the old one.
Destined to bear the brunt of tennis inflation are those with the closest seats, the denizens of the 265 courtside boxes. Within that group are 67 choice front-row courtside box positions, 62 of which are operational. 
 The United States Tennis Association sent out letters on Aug. 14 to all of the individuals and corporations that own the courtside boxes, informing them of increases ranging from 50 to 100 percent.
Some of those that own the 265 courtside boxes, including one bought by the advertising department of The New York Times, get them with their sponsorship fees.
But other boxholders said the U.S.T.A. is imposing even heftier increases that total two and a half times the current 1996 rate -- raising the most costly premium seating to nearly $50,000 for the two-week event.
"I'm going from $17,000 to $35,000," said Robert Malaga of Cleveland, a former U.S.T.A. executive director, who will be moved from the front row to a second-row box. "I guess I'm going to find out if it's worth it. I gave it a lot of thought before I renewed. It's a shame it has to be like this."
Recalling the days of $1,500 courtside boxes when the tournament was in Forest Hills, Malaga added, "Everybody I know who has a box has re-upped for next year."
Among other owners of the courtside boxes are the comedian Alan King; the real estate developer Lewis Rudin; Joseph Cullman, the former Philip Morris executive, who brought in Virginia Slims as the women's tour's longtime sponsor; John Mack Carter, the head of Hearst Magazines, and the art dealer Allan Stone.
"They have us over a barrel because they have thousands of people on the waiting list," said one boxholder who requested anonymity.
Said another, who also asked for anonymity: "The subject is greed. I'm flabbergasted."
But not every boxholder is upset. "The price went up, so it must be prestigious," said Jerry Spiegel, a real estate developer, who said the cost of his box rose 100 percent. "We love it. The people we entertain love it. We get good reaction from it. I'm in real estate, so how much ocean-front property is there?"
Spiegel said he refused an offer to lease a new luxury suite. "I like being with the people," he said. "If I'm going to be in a sky box, I can stay home."
The 90 new 20-ticket luxury suites are at a more rarefied level, $85,000 to $100,000 each for the tournament only, and are already sold out. The current stadium has no suites.
Luxury suites at Giants Stadium for Jets and Giants football cost $106,000 each; $295,000 in Ericsson Stadium, the new home of the Carolina Panthers football team in Charlotte, N.C., and $300,000 at Madison Square Garden for Knicks basketball and Rangers hockey.
The U.S.T.A. admits that the $234 million being spent to build the new stadium, scale down the current stadium and renovate the rest of the Flushing Meadows tennis center required the price jumps.
"We feel it's entirely justified by the tournament being a first-class event," said Suzanne Maguire, the U.S.T.A.'s director of transition. "The market requires us to price the stadium in a way that reflects the pricing of other premium sports events."
The original $150 million price tag for the stadium project has increased since it was first proposed, and is now nearly as steep as the $255 million ball park being built privately by the San Francisco Giants.
Maguire said that the U.S.T.A. declined to sell personal seat licenses, a popular form of stadium financing, in which fans pay several hundred or several thousand dollars for the rights to purchase season tickets.
But seat licenses are generally considered most effective where a team is new to a city, rather than in raising money to keep a team in the same market. They have been used mainly in the National Football League, in Charlotte; Baltimore (for the Ravens); St. Louis (for the Rams); Oakland, Calif. (for the Raiders); and Nashville, where the Houston Oilers will move.
Maguire said the price increases were justified by the U.S.T.A.'s rising costs and from its market research. "Look at basketball and what they're getting for front-row seats -- about $1,000," she said.
And, Maguire said hopefully, there is a built-in, envy-driven demand for the courtside boxes. "Everybody in the loge seats wants a courtside box," she said.
Maguire said she has spoken to about 20 boxholders, some of whom will move from front- to second-row boxes, and those who will have lesser views in the new stadium because of a new configuration.
"They've been very understanding," she said.
Boxholders will get parking and passes to two V.I.P. clubs for their escalated fees. The box seats will be wider, with greater leg room. The wealthiest spectators at the new stadium will get the largest price hikes. But fans elsewhere will see already expensive seats get more costly.
Front-row loge seats, which cost $100 a session in the existing stadium, will require about 11 percent more in the new park. Remaining loge seats will increase by about 7 percent, from $75 in the current facility.
Reserved seats throughout the rest of the stadium will increase by 6 percent from the current prices of $32 to $39 per session's ticket.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Matsushita, Freed of MCA, Reports a Profit

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 27

 BODY:
The Matsushita Electric Industrial Company rebounded to profit in the latest quarter, as a weaker Japanese yen and better sales helped the company overturn last year's losses from an ill-advised foray into the Hollywood movie business.
Net profit in the three-month period ending on June 30 was 18.5 billion yen -- roughly $170 million -- on sales of 1.72 trillion yen. Earnings for each share came to 8.29 yen, or 7.6 cents, in contrast to a loss of 72.16 yen a share a year earlier. 
 "This wasn't just a one-time benefit from the yen," said Reinier Dobbelmann of SBC Warburg Japan Ltd. "The company saw solid growth domestically as well as abroad."
Matsushita, the world's largest maker of consumer electronics, much of it under the Panasonic brand, reported a net loss of 151.3 billion yen in the similar period last year, after a one-time charge from its sale in April 1995 of 80 percent of the movie producer MCA.
Excluding the MCA charge, Matsushita's net profit in the quarter was 44 percent above the figure a year earlier. The company paid $6.1 billion for control of MCA and its Universal film studios in 1990. Matsushita had expected MCA's movie and music videotapes to complement its videocassette recorder and home stereo system businesses.
After five years of Matsushita's conservative approach to business clashing with the freewheeling, high-spending ethos at MCA, Matsushita called it quits and sold 80 percent of its stake to the Seagram Company.
Matsushita received the same amount of money in dollar terms for the stake that it originally paid, but the dollar had declined in value by 32 percent in the five years, sharply reducing the value of the holding.
Matsushita said its latest performance was helped by a rise in sales at home and abroad. Domestic sales rose 8 percent for the quarter, to 900.8 billion yen, pushed up by demand for high-definition television sets and mobile telecommunications equipment.
Steady economic growth in American and other Asian markets offset sluggishness in Europe, pushing Matsushita's foreign sales up 18 percent, to 818.8 billion yen.
The recent weakness in the yen helped profit because it made Matsushita's products cheaper outside Japan and increased the income in yen from foreign sales when that income was converted from other currencies. The company gained about 17.5 billion yen in pretax profit from the weaker yen. That, and about 57 billion yen saved from cost reduction, helped offset 60 billion yen in lost profit from the falling prices of home appliances, the company reported.
Matsushita said it saw no need to change its earnings forecasts for the fiscal year, which ends in March 1997. It projects a net profit of 115 billion yen on sales of 7.2 trillion yen.

HEADLINE: Clintons and Carters Don't Mix

BYLINE: By Douglas Brinkley; Douglas Brinkley, director of the Eisenhower Center and professor of history at the University of New Orleans, is writing a book on Jimmy Carter.

 BODY:
The Republicans devoted a good chunk of their convention's prime TV time in San Diego to saluting former Presidents Ford, Reagan and Bush. In Chicago, by contrast, the Democrats have gone out of their way to avoid even acknowledging the existence of their party's only living former President.
It may look odd, but the absence of Jimmy Carter from the Democratic National Convention vividly illustrates just how little love is lost between him and President Clinton. That has been clear since 1992, when candidate Clinton was consumed by fear of being labeled "another Jimmy Carter," a rap the Republicans had pinned on Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis with devastating results. "Jimmy Carter and I are as different as daylight and dark," Mr. Clinton insisted in an interview in 1992. It is a posture he has diligently maintained ever since. 
 Four years ago, it was with mild trepidation that the Democrats eventually asked Mr. Carter to address their New York convention. Even though he had become popular for his freelance diplomatic and election-monitoring missions and for his humanitarian house-building work, the party bosses' only concern seemed to be to get him on and off the stage as quickly as possible before TV viewers had a chance to flash back to the Iran hostage debacle, double-digit inflation and gasoline lines.
That was when the Clinton team still reluctantly tolerated Mr. Carter. Four years later -- after successfully intervening on behalf of the Administration in North Korea and Haiti in 1994 -- he appears to be have been deemed persona non grata at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Not that this is anything new: although Mr. Carter was asked to the White House in a show of support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Clinton still has yet to invite his Democratic predecessor to a state dinner or even to an informal function.
The bad blood between them can be traced to 1980, when then-President Carter ordered 19,000 Cuban refugees, many of them common criminals whom Fidel Castro had let out of jail, to be housed at Fort Chaffee in Arkansas. It was an unpopular decision, and it cost Governor Clinton, who was up for re-election, dearly. In May, the Cubans rioted against squalid conditions; some 300 of them escaped, and Mr. Clinton had to call in the National Guard. By August the White House had decided to send even more Cuban refugees to Fort Chaffee. The Governor lost the election.
During the Reagan-Bush years, Mr. Carter didn't pay Democratic politics much notice. Still, he strongly supported Mr. Mondale in 1984 and Mr. Dukakis in 1988 once they were nominated. As a rule, Mr. Carter had refused to support any national Democratic candidate until after the Georgia primary.
Although Mr. Carter never technically endorsed anyone in the 1992 primaries, he gave several clear signs that he thought either Mr. Clinton or Paul Tsongas would make a good President. Mr. Clinton, he believed, had been a fine governor, and Mr. Tsongas had endeared himself when he visited Plains and called it "one of the 'mecca stops' along the way to the White House." At one point, with Mr. Tsongas beaming at his side, Mr. Carter said, "People are looking for somebody who is honest and tells the truth" -- causing some pundits to infer that Mr. Clinton did not fit the bill for the former President.
But Mr. Carter, who has long admired Al and Tipper Gore, agreed to play the good soldier and actively supported Mr. Clinton in 1992. He even had the clout to push Warren Christopher, his former diplomatic trouble-shooter and lawyer for the Carter Center in Atlanta, as Secretary of State in the new Administration. But it is obvious that Mr. Christopher got the message from the White House that he was being retained by only one Presidential client: Bill Clinton. As Inauguration Day approached, Mr. Carter found his calls to Mr. Christopher ignored or returned by underlings.
The situation declined further. At the inaugural gala, Mr. Clinton took the occasion to thank all the celebrities present, from Barbra Streisand to Kenny G., while ignoring Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter. The gesture was disrespectful not only toward the Carters, but toward the Presidency itself.
The relationship took yet another turn for the worse in April 1995, when Mr. Carter and Mr. Clinton both found themselves in Warm Springs, Ga., to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Franklin Roosevelt's death. Although Mr. Carter, who had just returned from brokering a cease-fire in the Sudan, was receiving the F.D.R. Four Freedoms medal, Mr. Clinton did not congratulate him, ask about his African endeavor or even mention his name.
Later, a group of distinguished Democrats worried about Mr. Clinton's posture toward Mr. Carter broached the sensitive matter at a White House luncheon. Mr. Clinton, who had been talking animatedly, suddenly fell mute, according to someone who attended the meeting. When the President was finally persuaded to praise Mr. Carter for his diplomatic work at a Harry Truman tribute dinner in Washington some months later, many found his remarks disingenuous.
Even more so than her husband, Rosalynn Carter has suffered from the shabby treatment from the Clinton Administration and the Democratic National Committee. Hillary Clinton, for instance, has telephoned Rosalynn only once in four years and has never paid her a courtesy call despite numerous visits to Atlanta. More recently, the D.N.C. sent the Carters a box of fund-raising note cards featuring pictures of Democratic Presidents -- with the notable exception of Jimmy Carter. Mrs. Carter later wrote Dan Fowler, the operational head of the Democratic National Committee, a blistering note in which she asked the committee to remove her name from its membership rolls.
When the time came for the Democrats to plan their Chicago convention, Jimmy Carter was asked to participate in drafting the platform, but he declined. Then, weeks went by before President Clinton phoned Mr. Carter in mid-July to ask if he planned to attend the convention. If it was the D.N.C.'s hope that Mr. Carter would refuse to attend if he was issued a half-hearted invitation and no meaningful role to play, the strategy worked: while the Democratic delegates danced the macarena, he would go fly-fishing in Montana with Ted Turner and Jane Fonda.
The party chairman, Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, was asked on the eve of the convention why Mr. Carter would not be in Chicago. "What I was told by people coming over here this morning is that a request was made, but the timing of it was I don't know," Mr. Dodd allowed. What he meant to say was that the United Center, which has room enough for the Chicago Bulls to host the Seattle SuperSonics, isn't big enough for both of America's Democratic Presidents.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains on Yen as Chance Of a Japanese Rate Rise Dims

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar surged against the yen yesterday after unexpected weakness in a Bank of Japan survey dashed expectations of higher Japanese interest rates.
The Bank of Japan's quarterly survey, known as the tankan, showed an index for major manufacturers fell to -7 in August from -3 in the previous report in May. The index reflects the percentage of companies that said their business climate was improving minus the percentage that reported worsening conditions. 
The report allayed concern that signs of stronger growth would prompt Japan's central bank to raise lending rates from record lows, a move that would help the value of the yen by making deposits in the currency more attractive.
"When people saw the contents of the report, they realized the B.O.J. isn't moving anywhere soon," said Peter Wadkins, senior currency trader at Standard Chartered Bank. "That obviously helped drive the dollar higher against the yen."
Remarks from Japanese officials yesterday bolstered expectations that the Bank of Japan would not soon raise rates.
Masayuki Matsushima, director of the central bank's research and statistics department, said the tankan confirmed that Japan's economic recovery remained slow.
The dollar rose to 108.38 yen in Asian trading and by late in the day in New York stood at 108.42 yen, up from 107.68 yen on Tuesday. The dollar fell to 1.4765 German marks from 1.4783 marks. The British pound rose to $1.5591, from $1.5545.
The mark rose, continuing to benefit from concern about the timetable for European monetary union.
In recent weeks, several European officials have suggested that an extension may be needed to let more European countries meet the participation requirements, which include limits on the size of budget deficits and government debt.
Finance Minister Erik Aasbrink of Sweden wrote in the Dagens Nyheter newspaper yesterday that Sweden could join the single currency at a later date even if it decided next year against entering on the 1999 start date. Traders viewed his comments as a hint Sweden would not join the monetary union at its start.
"That's just another indication there are going to be some problems in bringing E.M.U. to fruition," Mr. Wadkins of Standard Chartered said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Economic Recovery Seen as Weak in Japan

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 28

 BODY:
The Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business sentiment signaled that the nation's economic recovery had been weaker than expected, indicating that the central bank was not likely to raise interest rates soon.
The August survey of 10,000 companies, known as the tankan and released today, showed that major manufacturers had less confidence in the economy than they had three months earlier. Economists said that the finding would quash speculation that the central bank might raise interest rates, which are now at record low levels, to keep inflation from accelerating. 
 "There are many reasons why the Bank of Japan can't hike rates at this time, and I think this release is the nail in the coffin of any speculation of a rate hike for the next six months," said Andrew Shipley, an economist at Schroders Securities Japan Ltd.
Indeed, Finance Minister Wataru Kubo said he expected the central bank to keep interest rates low. Speaking at a news conference, Mr. Kubo said that the bank's governor, Yasuo Matsushita, "has continuously said the bank wants to conduct policies aimed at insuring the recovery." He added, "I believe that stance has remained unchanged."
In Japan, the Finance Ministry strongly influences the central bank's monetary policy, in contrast to the United States, where the central bank, the Federal Reserve, is rigidly independent.
The belief that monetary policy would remain unchanged lifted the dollar against the yen; higher interest rates generally raise a currency's value because they increase the returns available from interest-bearing investments denominated in that currency.
At the end of trading in Tokyo today, the dollar stood at 108.38 yen, up from 107.68 yen in late New York trading Tuesday. By late afternoon in New York today, the dollar rose further, to 108.42 yen.
On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices rose following the tankan's release, but the market reversed course as concern grew about the slow pace of the economic recovery. The Nikkei average of 225 issues closed with a loss of 200.46 points, or about 1 percent, at 20,709.81.
The tankan's most closely watched component, the diffusion index of major manufacturers, stood at -7, weaker than the reading of -3 in the previous survey, which was taken in May. The index reflects the percentage of companies that said their business climate was improving minus the percentage that reported worsening conditions.
In the May survey, manufacturers had predicted that the August diffusion index would stand at zero.
Factors behind the negative response in the latest survey included a drop of 4.3 percent in industrial production during June, rising inventories and a decline in machine orders that reflected a slump in the semiconductor market and weakness in markets for other exports.
Still, the Bank of Japan and some economists said the recovery was on track. "This report confirms that the recovery is slow but continuing," said Masayuki Matsushima, director of the bank's research and statistics department.
Ron Bevacqua, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, said: "The worst is over. The pace of growth may have slowed, but the other tankan data says the recovery is continuing to broaden."
Positive signs included rising confidence among companies outside the manufacturing sector and among small companies, as well as upward revisions in capital investment plans, he said.
The central bank noted that the latest tankan did not reflect the recent weakening of the yen, which is likely to aid exports. It added that business at food and retail companies was hurt by the recent widespread outbreak of food poisoning in western Japan.

HEADLINE: City Hires Consultants To Seek Stadium Funds

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
Months after speculation that the New York Yankees would soon abandon their South Bronx home circulated and eventually subsided, the stadium debate resurfaced again yesterday when city officials announced that they had hired a financial consultant to help the city devise ways to pay for new or renovated stadiums for both the Yankees and the New York Mets.
The city will spend $750,000 over two years for the expertise of Public Financial Management, a Philadelphia-based firm that has cobbled multi-million-dollar stadium deals across the country and is working on a plan to find private financing for a new stadium for the San Francisco Giants. The firm will advise Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani on financing as the city enters into negotiations for stadiums with both baseball teams later this year. 
 But even as the city moves ahead, officials are still waiting for George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the principal owner of the New York Yankees, to announce whether he will move the team from the 73-year-old city-owned stadium.
Mr. Steinbrenner has repeatedly complained that the stadium's site in the South Bronx and traffic problems have depressed attendance at home games, even though the team is leading the American League's Eastern Division.
With his stadium lease set to expire in 2002, Mr. Steinbrenner had promised to declare his intentions at the beginning of the current baseball season, but that date passed without any decision. Instead, he has studiously avoided the public debate that was sparked last spring when another consulting firm recommended that the city and state build a new stadium for the Yankees in Manhattan, above the railyards beside the Hudson River in the West 30's.
City officials said yesterday that they expect team officials to focus again on stadium issues after the baseball season ends.
For months, the Mayor has pressed the case for a new stadium, despite the projected price tag of as much as $1.06 billion. He has said that he hopes to strike a deal that would require little taxpayer financing and that would use stadium revenues to pay off city- and state-issued bonds. A new stadium could bring revenues from ticket sales, luxury boxes and advertising, but negotiations over who would get to keep those revenues could become contentious, as Mr. Steinbrenner clearly hopes to use those same earnings to boost his own income from the team.
"We felt that it was important for us to be as knowledgeable as possible on all the options available to the city," said Fran Reiter, Deputy Mayor for Economic Development and Planning, adding that the consultants "will be sitting next to us as events unfold."
Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for Mr. Steinbrenner, said that the team owner was traveling yesterday and could not be reached for comment. Other team officials did not return telephone calls.
Mets officials, too, did not respond to requests for an update on stadium plans. But they have said that they expect to complete a detailed study of a new stadium before the end of the year. Mets officials have said that they want to build a ball park with natural grass and a retractable dome in a parking lot next to Shea Stadium in Flushing, Queens.

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS: THE SPEECH;
Clinton to Sum Up the Past and Look Ahead

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 28

 BODY:
Days away from the acceptance speech that will propel him into the general election campaign, President Clinton gazed out from his train-car on Monday and pronounced his address near ready.
"It says what I want to say," he said. "Now I have to say it in the best way to say it -- and make sure it's not too long." 
 And so after a month of drafts sent back and forth between Mr. Clinton and a team of speech writers, the scramble to add the last oratorical flourishes was taking place on a rolling campaign train, while the writers competed for the President's attention with the crowds that kept drawing him out to the back platform of his Pullman car like a moth to light.
Four years ago, when Mr. Clinton last stood before a Democratic National Convention, his challenge was to introduce himself to the nation after a divisive party primary campaign. Now he is perhaps more well known than any predecessor, because of his own confessional impulses and the books his Presidency has already spawned.
That means he faces a challenge different from the one Bob Dole confronted in his own acceptance speech in San Diego earlier this month.
"What he needs to do is try to tie together his proposals into a coherent whole," said Mark Mellman, a Democratic strategist. "But most important, he has to reinforce the perception that he understands the problems that working Americans face, that he has done things to help solve those problems and has proposals for the future to help solve those problems."
Hoping to draw a pointed contrast to the sometimes elegiac tones of Mr. Dole's speech, Mr. Clinton, his aides say, plans to look forward and describe a second-term agenda in a speech intended to convey the gravitas of a State of the Union Message salted with legislative proposals and executive actions.
Aides to the President said he would also speak about the unfinished agenda in health care coverage and an urban policy to increase jobs for the welfare recipients who will now face strict benefit limits under legislation he signed last week.
Speeches have long been Mr. Clinton's great strength and occasionally his near undoing. He can spontaneously soar to oratorical glory on the campaign trail, mesmerizing crowds without a text. In the summer of 1995, he began to rebuild his Presidency with a series of addresses that staked out positions in the Republican arena of social values.
But at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, when he introduced the nominee, Michael S. Dukakis, Mr. Clinton spoke for more than an hour, leaving the delegates groaning and nearly ending his own ambitions. In his 1995 State of the Union Message, after the Republicans won control of Congress, he spoke for 54 minutes, although the length did not seem to cost him many television viewers, according to the Nielsen ratings.
To prevent such occasions, Mr. Clinton and his advisers now begin preparing a major address perhaps a month in advance, and make sure that he has enough unscheduled time to think and write and to practice.
An array of advisers have consulted with the President on this speech, chief among them Dick Morris, the President's political strategist, and the White House communications director, Don Baer, a former reporter for U.S. News & World Report.
For the last four days Mr. Baer and a full speech-writing team has been working on the train, including Michael Waldman and Jonathan Prince, as well as Mark Penn, Mr. Clinton's campaign pollster. Bruce Reed, a domestic policy adviser who has been with Mr. Clinton since his 1992 campaign, has also been on the train as the guru of the new policy proposals that will be featured.
The speech-writing group has been ensconced in a second antique rail car behind Mr. Clinton's. And for instant rewrites with the President, team members have been allotted space for a computer -- in the bathroom of his train car, on a vanity, between a shower and a toilet. They also have a second, roomier work space in a staff car several train cars back.
By midweek the writers were tightening up the policy sections of the speech while Mr. Clinton was working on the preamble and the conclusion, aides said, sometimes, with his glasses on, practicing his delivery in his train car.
"He has been done with it once or twice," said Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, "then he resurrects it and works on it some more."
The President's schedulers have set aside a large block of time on Thursday for Mr. Clinton, notorious for his last-minute tinkering, to practice before teleprompters and finally sign off on the address.
Mr. McCurry added, "It will be his heart and soul by the time he stands up there tomorrow night, which means he won't be finished until tomorrow night."
Some advisers worried about whether Mr. Clinton's voice would hold out after a four-day train ride with as many as five full rally speeches a day. But unperturbed, the President was still hanging out the back of his train car today between speeches calling out to the onlookers who waved from corn fields or who waited trackside in hard hats and factory uniforms to see him go by.
"Hello, folks!" he shouted, "Good morning! How are you?"

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Disappointing Auction Sends Bonds Lower

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The Treasury's one-day market rally was cut short yesterday, as traders gave the Government's sale of five-year notes a disappointing reception.
The 30-year bond slipped 4/32, to a price of 97 5/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 6.98 percent, from 6.97 percent on Tuesday. 
 Patrick R. Dimick, a Treasury market analyst at CS First Boston, attributed much of the day's selloff to dealer preparation for the 1 P.M. auction, rather than to the auction's results, which, he noted, were not far from expectations.
"I did not see selling on those results," Mr. Dimick said, "which suggests that it was a fairly neat auction. The bid-to-cover ratio was noticeably lower than historical norms, but I think the yield of 6.568 percent at which the Fed awarded securities was more important than the bid-to-cover ratio." Dealers were expecting 6.551 percent, according to a poll by Bloomberg Business News.
The bid-to-cover ratio, or the ratio of bids to the number of securities sold, was 2.13 to 1, less than the 2.46- to-1 average of the last 10 auctions.
"I think dealers made out all right on this auction," Mr. Dimick said. "I don't think a mass liquidation is expected since there was decent retail interest."
What disappointed dealers and traders was that while near expectations the results were not better.
The inability of overnight buying to follow through set a negative tone to the session, suggesting that prices were going to remain stuck in recent ranges. Dealers and traders did some selling heading into the auction, which is considered the harder of the two note auctions this week.
Market participants are beginning to focus on economic data scheduled for release this week and next. Today's weekly report on first-time jobless claims looms as important information for the market because the number of claims have been running low since mid-July; tomorrow's Chicago purchasing-managers report will set the expectation for next week's National Association of Purchasing Management survey.
"There is data in the first week of September which could push us into a new trading range," Mr. Dimick of CS First Boston said, adding that one factor for the market today and tomorrow is money managers who need to extend the duration of their portfolios to match bond-market indexes near the end of the month.
In futures trading, continued liquidations added to the market's malaise. Thin trading conditions exaggerated price movement as the holiday weekend approached, and few traders took positions ahead of next week's employment report.
Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst for Thomson Research of Boston, said that given the long-term background of the market, the bias is toward another one-point drop in price in the coming months. "Any rallies we see over the next couple of days," Ms. Mesch said, "should be viewed as good selling opportunities. And a good spot to initiate a sell position would be toward a price of 109 16/32 to 109 24/32." She added, "Any surprises we see are likely to be on the downside."
In futures trading, which affects trading of current issues in the cash market, the September bond contract closed down 11/32 off its opening to 108 25/32.
After yesterday's auction, the market will get a long respite from new supply. Only bills are on the calendar until late September, when the next supply of two-year and five-year notes will be sold. Tomorrow the Treasury will be auctioning $30 billion of 14-day cash management bills, but that is not expected to be a problem for the market to absorb. The size of the weekly bill auctions has been cut to $24 billion and is likely to stay at that amount through the quarter.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new five-year notes:

Another accepted truth under fire: electric cars = cleaner air.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
ELECTRIC cars may be expensive today and barely capable of making the round trip to Grandma's house without a recharge. But just wait. Soon enough, they will be far more practical and start making a serious dent in the smog in Los Angeles, New York and half a dozen other cities that are light-years from compliance with Federal clean air standards.
That's the politically correct view. Which is why, despite California's decision to delay a regulation requiring substantial numbers of electric cars in the next few years, the state remains committed -- at least for now -- to force-feeding hundreds of thousands of battery-operated vehicles to auto buyers early in the next century. But is the reasoning correct? 
 Lester Lave, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University, is convinced that the case for electric cars is deeply flawed. Along with three engineers -- A. G. Russell of Georgia Tech and Chris Hendrickson and Francis McMichael at Carnegie-Mellon -- he has just published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology an assessment of what 500,000 electric cars would probably mean to the air quality in Los Angeles and New York. It turns the standard argument for mandating zero-emissions vehicles on its head.
"The new car is no longer much of the smog problem," Mr. Lave concluded, "and therefore can't be much of the solution."
More depressing yet, Mr. Lave and his colleagues argue that electric cars are themselves environmentally suspect. For the foreseeable future they will store electricity in lead-acid batteries that will have to be manufactured from newly smelted ore or recycled from worn-out batteries -- and in the process release dangerous lead into the air, water and land. While there is considerable disagreement about how much of this lead would end up in children and other living things, it hardly seems a chance worth taking.
When cars burn gasoline they emit nitrous oxide and chemicals called volatile organic compounds. Mix them together in the presence of sunlight and you get ozone, which is the active ingredient in smog that irritates lungs and bronchia.
Electric motors emit no pollutants, which is why environmentalists (and entrepreneurs who want to sell electric vehicles) have long nurtured visions of sparkling-clear air after motorists switch from internal combustion engines. But Mr. Lave and his group offer a sobering reality check using the same computer simulation employed by the California Air Resources Board.
Substitute 500,000 electric cars for the same number of new gasoline- powered ones in Los Angeles -- a plausible number for the year 2010 -- and what happens? Not much. Peak levels of ozone are reduced, but only from 200 parts per billion to 199. The current safe level is estimated to be 120 parts per billion, and new research suggests that the target should be lowered to around 70 parts per billion to meet the law's requirement to eliminate all health risk.
New York City would fare no better. The effect of half a million electric cars would be virtually undetectable, leaving peak projected ozone levels at 190 parts per billion.
What's going on here? "We've known for quite some time that zero-emissions cars wouldn't make much difference if they substituted for very clean ones," Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said.
And new cars are very clean: the gasoline-powered cars mandated for California remove 95 to 98 percent of the pollutants detrimental to health. Note, too, that most plants in California generating electricity for the electric cars burn natural gas, emitting pollutants that offset part of the already modest gains made at the tailpipe.
Indeed, thanks to cleaner engines, cars are no longer central to realistic strategies for dealing with smog. Extrapolating from California's own projections, Mr. Lave estimates that an all-electric car fleet would lower peak ozone in Los Angeles by just 10 percent from what it would be given the types of gasoline-powered cars projected to be on the road in 2010. By almost any standard, that makes the General Motors $35,000 two-passenger electric runabout a dubious social investment. "One big lesson here," argues Rob Stavins, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, "is that it doesn't pay to worry about the 'good' tail of the pollution distribution" when the "bad" tail -- much dirtier vehicles from earlier decades still on the road -- remains a factor.
More sobering still, all this illustrates how attacking one pollution problem can worsen another. The Environmental Protection Agency views the elimination of lead additives from gasoline as a great victory, with estimated benefits of roughly $100 billion annually in reduced health costs and lower rates of disease. That could be at risk unless the lead and battery industries can devise ways to contain virtually all the emissions from manufacturing and recycling the heavy metal.
But Mr. Lave wonders why anyone, other than the wannabe Bill Gateses of the battery world, would willingly take the chance with toxic lead. "The fact is," he said, "we'd not get any benefit from electric cars."

HEADLINE: In One Town, Delaying Bosnia Vote Is Bitter News

BYLINE: By MIKE O'CONNOR 

DATELINE: CAPLJINA, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Aug. 28

 BODY:
In the seething, if nearly clandestine, world of the political opposition in this Croatian town, the news that municipal elections throughout Bosnia will be postponed for months was crushing.
"Elections are the only way we can hope to change things legally," said a man in his thirties, whose years as a soldier in the army of the Bosnian Croats showed as much in his face as in the scars on his arms. 
 "Otherwise we will have to use some other way," he added. Then he paused. The word "violence" was left unsaid, but it hung in the air.
This town is still run by the people who took control during the war, as is the case in many Bosnian towns. Here the mayor, who was in office when the fighting began, became part of a power circle that included a few local military commanders and leaders of the dominant Croatian political party, according to townspeople. When the mayor's term expired, he just stayed on, accompanied by others who had come to power without being voted into office.
Muslims and ethnic Serbs who used to live here say these are the people behind the purge that sent hundreds of non-Croats to a concentration camp, then expelled them.
Townspeople and United Nations officials say that for the most part the same circle that fostered ethnic hatred remains in charge. Until there are elections, there is no legal course for removing the leaders of Capljina, or towns with similar histories.
But the international organization overseeing the elections postponed local voting at least until December because of widespread irregularities in registration. State and national elections remain set for Sept. 14.
"When you vote in the United States, it's about important social issues," said a shop owner. "Voting here means trying to get criminals out of city hall." Her store, like almost every other store here, is in a building owned by the town government. Her livelihood depends on that government's willingness to rent to her.
The town, and neighboring villages, which were made up predominantly of ethnic Croats, also housed some 4,000 Serbs and 8,000 Muslims before the war. Now, only a few hundred non-Croats remain.
Croatian refugees from other parts of Bosnia have taken the homes of the expelled people. Many feel grateful that the authorities have helped them, even those who don't like the way the town is run.
There is a group of people whose opposition to the ruling party is guaranteed: the expelled Bosnian Muslims. They are allowed to come back to vote here. But, until there are elections, any power they have to change their world is suspended.
Under the current balance of power, the term "political opposition" makes leaders of the ruling Bosnian Croat party smile. They deride the idea that the tiny group of opposition parties is a threat, and they will not respond to allegations that they took part in ethnic cleansing.
"This is the time of nationalist parties," Mijo Brajkovic, a leader of the ruling party, said today. "People will vote for us because we are strong and will protect them from the other ethnic groups."
But there are many Bosnian Croat men in this town who followed the leaders of the ruling party through nearly four years of war and who are now bitter at what it brought them.
"We fought when they told us to," said one veteran. "Then we expelled the Muslims and the Serbs when they told us to, even though many were our friends. And when they said it was to make our own government we believed that, but now it turns out it was to make a government where they can sit on a throne and steal."
No one who criticized the town government would let his or her name be used. "There are too many hand grenades flying into people's windows," said a woman.
Tales of intimidation are common, but the victims are reluctant to report incidents for fear of retaliation.
Many people said they feel the threat of violence from those in power, but the opposition is unlikely to respond with violence. That would go against recent history in the Balkans, where people have followed nationalist leaders into war, but almost never turned on leaders of their own ethnic group.
The small group at the top not only cleared out other ethnic groups, but it also controls every important aspect of the local economy, and is squeezing more tightly.
"In Capljina, everything that is bought or sold is controlled indirectly by the same few people," said a United Nations official. "I mean everything, every banana, every screw. The truck driver, the merchant, the barber, all of them depend on the good will of the government."
The businesses and farms left by expelled Serbs and Muslims are now town property. The factories, which were owned by the Government of Bosnia until Croats here rebelled, are also under its control. While few of the businesses and farms are working, they would be worth a great deal if they were sold to private investors, as is being contemplated.
"We are like chickens in their backyard," said a restaurant owner. "They have their hands around our necks and are about to strangle us."

Muslim Parties Urge Boycott
 SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Aug. 28 (Reuters) -- The prospects for elections grew cloudier today when three Muslim political parties urged refugees living abroad not to cast ballots until voter registration irregularities are resolved.
About 640,000 Bosnian refugees are registered to vote in 55 countries around the world on Sept. 14.
The call for the boycott was led by the ruling Muslim nationalist Party of Democratic Action, headed by President Alija Izetbegovic. It was joined by the party headed by Bosnia's popular wartime Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, and by a third party headed by a former Bosnian Army commander, Sefer Halilovic.
The parties said the decision on Tuesday to postpone municipal elections sidestepped a larger problem of fraud in voter registration that would affect elections for cantonal assemblies, separate Muslim-Croat and Serb parliaments, a House of Representatives and a collective Presidency. But those elections are still scheduled to be held on Sept. 14.

HEADLINE: The People of Kwangju Recall 1980 Massacre

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: KWANGJU, South Korea, Aug. 28

 BODY:
When paratroopers stormed City Hall here 16 years ago, committing a massacre that has haunted this country ever since, Kim Young Chul was deep inside the building, clutching his gun.
Mr. Kim, who was one of the planners of the pro-democracy demonstrations, never got a chance to use his weapon. Instead, he was shot seven times and suffered head wounds. But he is still alive -- in a mental institution -- apparently still suffering from the trauma of the experience. 
 He was in the institution when he heard the news this week that former President Chun Doo Hwan had been sentenced to death for staging a coup in 1979 and brutally suppressing the Kwangju uprising in May 1980. History suddenly turned on its head: Mr. Chun was for years revered as a national hero and the protesters here were portrayed as Communist rioters. Now the protesters have become martyrs for democracy and Mr. Chun is a convict sentenced to be hanged.
"We should let him go after about a year, for he has already suffered," said Mr. Kim, 48, who has come to dislike all killing. "There should be forgiveness and reconciliation."
Few people in this southern farming region are as magnanimous as Mr. Kim. His wife, who delivered milk, sold vegetables and tired herself out at scores of jobs to raise their three children and pay her husband's medical bills, is deeply embittered. She wants the sentence carried out, and she and others are dismayed that the prison sentence for Mr. Chun's successor, Roh Tae Woo, was 22 1/2 years and not longer.
For people in Kwangju who have fought for 16 years to tell their version of the massacre and to see those responsible be punished, this is a moment to remember. The massacre was a pivotal event in modern Korean history, nurturing radicalism and anti-Americanism among a generation of youth.
An opinion poll at Seoul National University once asked students to name the greatest tragedy in Korean history since 1945. The professor who planned the poll assumed that the students would answer the Korean War, but they overwhelmingly cited the Kwangju massacre.
At Mangwol Dong Cemetery, where many of the victims are buried, visitors come from all over the country to pay tribute to those whose lives helped bring about greater democracy in this country.
"My heart has been grieving so much and so long for these people," said Cho Han Young, a 40-year-old pastor who drove more than six hours to visit the grave of a childhood friend here on a hot summer day. "I regret I was not there with them. I feel guilty for being alive now."
They also come to gain a greater understanding of the event that has been at the center of South Korean politics for the last 16 years. For years after the massacre, those who ordered it served in the top leadership, like Mr. Chun and his aides, while those who had protested for democracy were denounced as Communists or rioters.
Park Soon Lae, 63, a mother whose son was killed by paratroopers as he rode in a minivan with his fellow students, helped start one of the first organizations to fight the Government on behalf of bereaved parents. But for years, every time Mr. Chun paid a visit to this city, more than a dozen police officers would be stationed outside her house to prevent her from staging protests.
"I clapped when I heard it," Miss Park said of Mr. Chun's sentence. "I said: This is one day I feel I am really alive."
But like other people here, Miss Park says that the punishment does not ease the pain and that talk of a pardon is disconcerting.
"I expect the sentence to be implemented," she said, as she pulled some weeds from around her son's flowered grave. "If not, I will fight to the end, until all my strength expires."
In the spring of 1980, protesters in Kwangju broke into armories and stole weapons, which briefly allowed them to gain control of the city. After 10 days of protests, the army invaded with tanks and machine guns.
The Government says that the death toll was 193, but it eventually agreed to compensate the family members of 288 victims of the massacre. Beyond that figure, 23 soldiers were also killed, most apparently by other troops, although some were killed by protesters.
Many relatives have dedicated their lives to fighting for their sons and brothers, daughters and sisters who died in the Kwangju massacre. Hong Soon Baek, a 37-year-old businessman, for instance, gave up his business after a car accident nearly killed him. During his recovery, he had a change in outlook and left his business to become the custodian of the Mangwol Cemetery where his brother, who was killed in the massacre, is buried.
A broader legacy of the Kwangju massacre has been an even more ferocious regionalism in South Korea, and it is still unclear if the conviction of Mr. Chun will ease that. The province that includes Kwangju is economically backward and its people and those from the rest of the country rarely have nice things to say about each other.
So while there is some relief and healing as a result of the sentencing of Mr. Chun, there is also deep skepticism about whether a rapprochment with the rest of the country is really at hand.
"The people of Kwangju have to make more effort to breed more politicians," said Y. H. Chung, 22, a kindergarten teacher who dislikes all the demonstrating around her. "When we have a President from our region, then we will benefit economically."

HEADLINE: Panel Members in Dissension On Hartford School Problems

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 28

 BODY:
Seven weeks after the State Supreme Court ruled that the concentration of poor minority students in Hartford's public schools violated the State Constitution, a state panel began seeking solutions to the problem today.
Panel members were quick to acknowledge the magnitude of the challenge. 
 "We will have to reach a genius level to do in four months what so many have not been able to do in 40 years," said Ben Andrews, president of the Connecticut N.A.A.C.P., who is a panel member.
In fact, the 22-member committee could not agree today on what its focus should be: improving urban education, desegregating the schools or addressing the economic problems that underlie both the racial isolation and the poor quality of many urban schools.
The panel's first meeting also hinted at the divisions that are likely to develop as Republicans and Democrats and urban and suburban residents try to draft recommendations for the Legislature by Jan. 22, the deadline set by the Governor.
For example, State Representative Edna I. Garcia, a Democrat of Bridgeport, said she hoped the panel would address the violations of the State Constitution cited in the Supreme Court decision. But State Senator John A. Kissel, a Republican from Enfield, said the group should take into account the lower court ruling, which the Supreme Court overturned, and the minority Supreme Court opinion, which said there was no constitutional violation.
In its July 9 decision, the court ruled 4 to 3 that the high concentration of black and Latino students in Hartford's schools violated the State Constitution's guarantee of "a substantially equal educational opportunity," and ordered the Governor and the General Assembly to remedy the problem. The Hartford schools are about 95 percent minority.
One possible solution would be integrating the Hartford schools with their suburban neighbors.
Yet the court offered no remedies, and so Gov. John G. Rowland set up the panel to make proposals. Mr. Rowland called on the committee members today to be fair, thoughtful, open to public opinions and creative.
"We need to make sure every child in the state of Connecticut has equal opportunity and equal access," Mr. Rowland said, adding, "We will all be judged by the final outcome."
Afterward, Elizabeth Horton-Sheff, a plaintiff in the desegregation lawsuit, known as Sheff v. O'Neill, said she was upset by the lack of agreement that racial segregation was the most important issue.
"That's playing around with the decision, and it's an affront to the court," Ms. Horton-Sheff said.
Joseph S. Grabarz Jr., executive director of the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union, which helped represent the plaintiffs, said that any solution that did not address segregation would not work. "For the panel not to consider racial isolation as the key to any remedy I think would be fooling themselves," he said.
Theodore S. Sergi, the State Education Commissioner, who is the panel's chairman, said it must adhere to the court decision and the charge of the Governor: to address racial isolation, improve education and involve parents. "I find it hard to separate the three," he said.
The panel is to meet 11 times, and hold two sets of public hearings, one set at the beginning and another when it has some rough recommendations. The first hearings are Sept. 17, 18 and 19 in at least 11 sites.
State Senator Kevin B. Sullivan of West Hartford, a panel member, cautioned that it must produce workable solutions. "This could be a really important step in coming to terms with insufficient equal opportunity and education results for the great bulk of our urban children," he said, "or it's going to be six months of tinkering and thinking we've done something."

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Helps Lift Blue Chips; Dow Up 1.11, to 5,712.38

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks ended with a small gain in quiet trading yesterday, lifted by a rise in shares of I.B.M.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 1.11 points at 5,712.38. 
 Advancing issues narrowly led decliners by 11 to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange. Broader market indexes were mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.59 points, to 664.81. The Nasdaq composite index rose 4.86 points, to 1,153.88. Volume was light, with 296.4 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Dow had gained more than 10 points in the morning exclusively on the strength of I.B.M., which ended 3 1/4 points higher at 115.
Salomon Brothers raised its rating on I.B.M. stock, noting that the quarter ending June 30 saw its "best revenue acceleration in the past five quarters," and that the outlook for the second half of 1996 and for 1997 "is very positive."
But stock prices eased in early afternoon as bond prices slipped, pushing up interest rates.
The 30-year Treasury bond, a benchmark for long-term borrowing costs, dipped in price, with its yield nudging closer to 7 percent. The nervousness in the bond market spilled over into stocks.
"Our audience is so limited that any move is going to be exacerbated," said Bill Allyn, director of listed equity trading at Jefferies & Company in Short Hills, N.J.
Mr. Allyn also cited persistent worries, which began last week, that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates soon. "The Fed, as you know, has been making some rumblings that it is not as serene as we once thought it was," he said.
Higher rates, which raise corporate borrowing costs, reduce business investment, curb consumer spending and cut into corporate profits.
Losses in some Dow components nearly overwhelmed the big gain in I.B.M. shares. The interest-rate-sensitive banking giant J. P. Morgan fell 3/4, to 89 1/8.
Caterpillar lost 7/8, to 70 1/8. The large construction- and farming-equipment maker said it had reached a bargaining impasse with union workers and would put into effect new working conditions, which had previously been rejected by the United Automobile Workers. The U.A.W. denied there was an impasse.
The Dow component Philip Morris ended 1/2 lower at 91 3/8. The stock rose Monday and Tuesday after an Indianapolis jury ruled late last week in favor of the tobacco industry in a smoking liability case. Yesterday, the company said that it would raise its dividend by 20 percent.
Shares of another Dow component, Boeing, rose 7/8, to 92 1/8. The company said on Tuesday that it would increase production of its 777 airliner by 40 percent,
Pepsico led the most-active list on the New York Stock Exchange for the second consecutive session, falling 1, to 30. The soft drink bottler continues to face setbacks in its battle with Coca-Cola for market share, particularly in South America.
H & R Block fell 2, to 28 7/8. The company postponed a shareholder vote on completing the spinoff of the Compuserve Corporation, citing Compuserve's recent poor performance and uncertainty in the on-line industry. Block sold 20 percent of its interest in Compuserve in April in an initial public offering, and shareholders were scheduled to vote Sept. 11 on selling Block's remaining 80 percent interest.
First Mississippi rose 3 1/8, to 27 1/8, after Mississippi Chemical, which gained 1 3/8, to 22 5/8, agreed to acquire First Mississippi's fertilizer operations in a deal valued at $297 million.
 Garden Botanika slumped 4 3/4, to 8 1/2. It reported a loss for the latest quarter and said that its August sales were disappointing.

HEADLINE: Group Seeks Reparations As Detainees

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 28

 BODY:
They were pulled from schoolhouses in Colombia and Bolivia and from offices and stores around Lima, Peru. Warships carried them to the United States, and trains left them at desolate camps near places like Missoula, Mont., and Crystal City, Tex. Some of them remained there, under guard and behind fences, for years.
Although more than 2,000 of these Latin Americans of Japanese descent were deported to the United States in World War II, and forcibly interned on the orders of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, they have been little more than a footnote in this nation's history. 
 When the Federal Government began issuing apologies and reparations checks to Japanese-Americans held in the camps, most of those who came from Latin America were left out. Today, they began a campaign for redress. In a class-action suit filed in Federal District Court in Los Angeles, hundreds of people uprooted from at least a dozen Latin American countries asked the United States Government for the same consideration it has given to Japanese-Americans under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988.
"Why are we left out?" asked Arthur Shibayama, 66, a retired gas station owner from San Jose, Calif., who was deported from Peru as a boy, held for years in a Texas camp, and was then denied United States citizenship for years even though he had served in Europe as a soldier for the United States.
"We suffered at least as much as the Japanese-Americans, maybe more," said Mr. Shibayama, who finally became a citizen in 1970. "I want the United States Government to take responsibility for the suffering that my family and my friends went through."
In addition to the formal apology and the reparations payments of $20,000 available to the Japanese-Americans interned in the camps, the plaintiffs asked for punitive damages but did not specify any amount.
A spokesman for the Justice Department, Myron Marlin, said the Government would have no comment on the details of the lawsuit. But Mr. Marlin said that in denying benefits to most of the internees who were brought from Latin America, the Clinton Administration was simply applying a law over which it had had no influence.
Little explanation was given for why the Latin Americans were mostly excluded as amends began to be made in 1990. But officials have argued that those brought to the camps from abroad were effectively illegal immigrants and therefore not entitled to the same rights as the roughly 100,000 Japanese-American internees.
Mr. Marlin noted that any Japanese Latin American who was granted citizenship by 1952 was given it retroactively to the time they arrived in this country. About 150 people have qualified for reparations, but more than 300 applications have been denied.
One of the lawyers who filed the suit today, Robin S. Toma, described the Government's position as a perverse catch-22.
"The Government was not telling these people that they could apply for citizenship," said Mr. Toma, the son of Japanese-American internees. "They were telling them that they were being deported."
Of the 2,264 people of Japanese ancestry who were deported from Latin America from 1942 to 1944 and detained until as late as 1952, Mr. Toma said, nearly all of those who met the Congressional test became citizens in 1952 with the help of by a civil-rights lawyer in California.
According to the 1982 Congressional report by a special commission that studied the Government's wartime internment policies in the preparation for the 1988 law, the Japanese Latin Americans were among about 3,000 people from a dozen Latin American nations. They were brought to camps in the United States when their own Governments were unable to comply with Washington's pressure for their internment at home. The remainder were of German and Italian descent.
The arrest and transfer of Latin Americans to United States camps began, the report noted, as "a controlled, closely monitored deportation program to detain potentially dangerous diplomatic and consular officials." But the exercise quickly deteriorated into one in which prominent ethnic Japanese -- teachers, small-businessmen and wealthy farmers, especially -- were rounded up and shipped off with no regard to their national loyalties.
Pressed by the Roosevelt Administration, Brazil, which had the largest Japanese population in Latin America, interned thousands of Japanese. In all, about 8,500 Latin American immigrants and their descendants from the Axis countries were held in 16 Latin American nations. None have paid reparations to the people they held, lawyers for the plaintiffs said. About 200 Latin Americans held in the United States were eventually allowed to go home.
The more than 25,000 Japanese in Peru became special targets. Although many of the country's Japanese immigrants had gone there as low-paid farm laborers at the turn of the century, they were the victims of cultural prejudices like those directed at Peru's Indians, the country's largest ethnic group. The success of ethnic Japanese in business during an era of general economic difficulties deepened the resentment against them.
Libia Yamamoto, the sales manager for a charter bus company in San Francisco, recalled how the local constable in her hometown, Chiclayo, on Peru's northern coast, arrived one night in January 1943, apologizing sympathetically to her father, the well-known owner of a store on the local sugar plantation. Then the constable took her father away.
Nearly eight months later, the family was reunited in Crystal City, where Mrs. Yamamoto's parents were told that they and others would be deported to Japan in exchange for American civilians being held there.
"There was nothing," she recalled of the heavily guarded camp. "It was almost barren."
When her father became ill and was hospitalized, the family avoided joining the more than 800 Japanese Latin Americans who were sent to Japan in December 1945. Over the years, Mrs. Yamamoto said, she entered American-citizenship classes and picked up application forms, only to have her efforts founder on one question: had she ever been deported from any country?
"I always got to that point," she said, "and I didn't have the right answer."

HEADLINE: Target Chain, Citing Costs, to Stop Selling Cigarettes

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
The Target chain, the nation's third-largest discount retailer, said yesterday that it would stop selling cigarettes because it was costing too much to keep them out of the hands of minors.
The decision by Target, which has 714 stores in 37 states, is the first time such a large retail chain has dropped the selling of tobacco. 
 While the move is expected to have very little impact on the availability of cigarettes, it comes at a time when retailers have been concerned about the growing burden of regulations intended to curb teen-age smoking. Federal regulations adopted early this year put more pressure on states to enforce laws barring the sale of tobacco products to children under the age of 18. And new regulations issued last week by the Food and Drug Administration will place limits on how cigarettes can be displayed and sold starting next year.
Target, a subsidiary of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, said cigarettes accounted for less than half of 1 percent of its $15.8 billion in sales last year. Tobacco had produced little or no profit in recent years after theft and expenses related to efforts to stop sales to minors were taken into account, Target said.
"It costs lots of money to retrofit stores to put cigarettes behind counters and to service tobacco customers," said Carolyn Brookter, a Target spokeswoman. "It's just too labor intensive."
But the two largest discount chains, Wal-Mart Stores and Kmart, said yesterday that they would continue to sell cigarettes. The Walgreen Company, the nation's largest drugstore chain, also said that it would continue to sell cigarettes.
"Target has simply removed itself from the middle of a controversy in which it really had no stake," said Leo J. Shapiro, a leading retail industry consultant based in Chicago.
Still, he said, "They've done first what a number of other chains are likely to do later."
Drugstore chains are the most likely to follow suit, although not because they are disappointed with the profits from selling tobacco, according to retailing experts.
"Several major chains are considering it in connection with adding medical services in order to position themselves as health care providers," said Eric Sorenson, managing director of the Center for Retail Management at the Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Business.
Tobacco industry analysts, however, were skeptical that Target's decision on tobacco would soon be followed by major rivals.
"There may be some investors who view Target's announcement as another negative for tobacco stocks but it is no reflection on the industry's ability to distribute cigarettes," said Martin Feldman, who follows the tobacco industry for Smith Barney in New York.
Chains like Target represent a small fraction of tobacco sales, analysts noted. Retail outlets like convenience stores are often far more dependent on tobacco sales and will have little choice but to absorb the added cost of complying with new regulations.
"About 42 percent of our customers are smokers, which is way above the national average," said Teri Richmond, spokeswoman for the National Association of Convenience Stores, which represents businesses owning 70,000 retail outlets.
Target executives stressed yesterday that the decision to stop selling cigarettes was an economic one. They said that the company stopped selling tobacco in 50 stores two years ago in a test that helped it conclude that it would not suffer financially by quitting completely.
It quietly began the move to end all sales early this month and did not acknowledge the new policy until it received an inquiry on Tuesday from The St. Paul Pioneer Press. It expects to have all cigarettes off its shelves by the end of September.
Whatever the motive, the move by Target is likely to enhance its image as a family-oriented enterprise. The chain removed Playboy magazine from its shelves in the 1970's and is among the most prominent retailers to have stopped selling toy guns. Its corporate parent, which is based in Minneapolis, has been praised for setting aside 5 percent of its profits annually for charity.
While Target was not known for promoting tobacco with discounts or other promotions, cigarettes had been hurting its image in its home state of Minnesota. Target stores were singled out as among the easiest places for teen-agers to buy or steal cigarettes in Minneapolis by undercover buying operations in 1992. Some Target stores had been fined or had licenses to sell tobacco temporarily suspended in Minnesota towns with tobacco control ordinances.
In Target stores that sold cigarettes, the packs were often at the end of aisle displays where shoppers had access. In many cases, clerks who were trained to be quick at checkout counters were often reluctant to take the time to check a customer's identification.
Target's move was hailed by anti-tobacco groups. "Big stores like Target aren't capable of selling cigarettes in a way that they don't fall into the hands of children," said Jeanne Weigum, head of the Association for Nonsmokers-Minnesota.
But tobacco industry representatives said Target was simply handing a high-volume business to its major competitors.
"I guess they are not very good marketers," said Walker Merryman, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute in Washington.

Dayton Hudson Sets Sale
MINNEAPOLIS, Aug. 28 (By Bloomberg Business News) -- The Dayton Hudson Corporation said today that it had it agreed to sell its four Marshall Field's stores in Texas to concentrate on its Field's stores in the Midwest.
Saks Holding Inc. will buy three of the stores and Federated Department Stores Inc. will purchase the other, which will be operated by Federated's Macy's West division. The four stores have total annual revenue of about $120 million.
Dayton Hudson said the sale was expected to result in a "slight gain" in the fourth quarter. Financial details were not disclosed.

THE CONVENTION
 
Dodd Nominates Clinton
Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut made the nominating speech at the Democratic National Convention, saying that he would not question the reputation of Bob Dole, the Republican candidate, but rather his "flawed ideas," and stating that "President Clinton has put our economic house in order." [Page A1.]
 
Many delegates, particularly New York City's, say they have been inundated with angry calls about the new welfare law. [B9.]
 
NEW YORK
 
Class Spills Outside Classroom
New York City's public schools are so crowded that thousands of the 1.06 million schoolchildren will report to class next week at such unlikely places as a converted World War II torpedo factory in Brooklyn, a renovated department store in Queens, the Town Hall theater in midtown Manhattan and dozens of temporary aluminum trailers scattered in schoolyards across the city. [A1.]
 
Crazy, No. Facing Trial, Yes.
Vincent Gigante, considered the most powerful Mafia boss in America but perhaps best known for walking through his neighborhood in a bathrobe and pajamas, was declared mentally competent to stand trial on murder and racketeering charges by a judge who called his odd behavior an "elaborate deception." [B1.]
The Genovese crime family has suffered three severe blows, capped by the ruling on Mr. Gigante. [B6.]
The judge in the case, Eugene H. Nickerson, does not shrink from making tough decisions. [B6.]
 
Giuliani's Second-in-Command
Tightening his inner circle of top aides, Mayor Giuliani promoted his chief of staff, Randy M. Mastro, to the position of Deputy Mayor for Operations, effectively making him the second-in-command at City Hall. Mr. Mastro replaces Peter J. Powers but will not receive Mr. Powers's former title of First Deputy Mayor. [B1.]
 
From Depths, Artifacts of Life
To an archeologist and her students, history is an outhouse in SoHo. The group dug into the foundation of the privy and found items either dropped in accidentally or used to fill in the hole when inside plumbing arrived about 120 years ago. What is emerging from those pieces is a picture of middle-class Irish life. [B1.]
 
When a Race Is All-Out War
A battle between Democrats is under way in Manhattan Surrogate's Court, where Judge Renee R. Roth is seeking another term. To her chagrin, the judge finds herself in a primary fight with Karen S. Burstein, the former Family Court judge. The race has riled tempers, split loyalties and turned into something of a morality play for feminists. Metro Matters by Joyce Purnick. [B1.]
 
Rethinking Stadiums and Funds
Months after speculation that the Yankees would abandon their South Bronx home subsided, the stadium debate resurfaced when city officials announced that they had hired a financial consultant to help the city devise ways to pay for new or renovated stadiums for both the Yankees and the Mets. [B3.]
 
Facing More Accusations
Adelphi's former internal auditor told a state panel reviewing charges of mismanagement at the university that Peter Diamandopoulos, Adelphi's president, promoted an employee to a key managerial post even after the employee was found to be stealing on the job. [B5.]
 
Mass Rabies Alert Issued
Since last week, when a goat being exhibited at a county fair in Owego was killed after it was found to have rabies, health officials have been conducting the largest rabies vaccination effort in New York State history. Officials say that as many as 25,000 people visited the fair; one man reported that his 11-year-old daughter's finger was nipped, and some people may have been exposed to the disease by a friendly lick on a hand that had an innocuous cut. [B6.]
 
REGION
 
Crash Search Moves Eastward
Stymied by a string of dead ends and partial hints, the hunt for the cause of the blast that destroyed T.W.A. Flight 800 shifted several miles east, as Navy divers focused on the easternmost patch of wreckage in the Atlantic Ocean. More than a third of the 180-ton jumbo jet still lies on the sea floor in that area. [B5.]
 
CONNECTICUT
 
Panel on Schools Faces Discord
Seven weeks after the State Supreme Court ruled that the concentration of poor minority students in Hartford's public schools violated the State Constitution, a panel began seeking solutions. The first meeting hinted at divisions likely to develop as Republicans and Democrats and urban and suburban residents try to draft recommendations by the Jan. 22 deadline. [B4.]

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Is Starting to Sell Networking Chips

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: ARMONK, N.Y., Aug. 28

 BODY:
The International Business Machines Corporation has started selling its proprietary networking chips for the growing multibillion-dollar market.
I.B.M., which has been selling other computer chips since 1992, said the new products included chips and technologies that distribute sound, data and video through communications networks. 
 The company previously made the networking chips mostly for its own products. It said it now planned to market the chips aggressively to outside customers.
Specifically, I.B.M. will sell chips intended to support technologies called asynchronous transfer mode, or ATM, and token ring. The devices are largely used in communications systems to send data in small packets.
The networking products represent the largest segment of a communications market that is expected to double to about $60 billion in the next four years, according to an analysis by Dataquest Inc. that was cited by I.B.M.
I.B.M. is already a leading source of chips for the broader computer market. Industry observers estimate its computer chip sales reached $2.3 billion in 1995.

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS: ENDORSEMENTS;
Former Rival Won't Back Perot's Race For President

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 28

 BODY:
Richard D. Lamm, the former Colorado Governor who failed to take the Reform Party's Presidential nomination from Ross Perot, announced today that he would not endorse Mr. Perot or any other Presidential candidate this year.
Mr. Lamm said he hoped to campaign for Reform Party candidates for other offices, but he refused to explain why he would not publicly support Mr. Perot. 
 "I will endorse Ross Perot as prophet, I will endorse Ross Perot as Paul Revere, I will endorse him as prescient; I will not endorse him as President," Mr. Lamm said in a news conference ostensibly called to discuss the need to change the Medicare system.
When asked why he felt that way, Mr. Lamm said, "For the same reasons everybody in this room knows."
He refused to explain further, saying, "I'm going to keep my reasons private."
He did make the point that "no viable American political party is ever going to be sustained by just one person."
Mr. Lamm waged a bitter six-week campaign against Mr. Perot, who founded and financed the Reform Party and who, after being coy about his intentions, jumped into the race for its Presidential nomination one day after Mr. Lamm announced that he would seek it. Mr. Lamm complained repeatedly that Mr. Perot used the party's organizational machinery to rig the results of the balloting this month.
Mr. Lamm, a former Democrat, made the announcement in Chicago to attract reporters covering the Democratic National Convention here. He commended Mr. Perot for speaking forthrightly about the need to save Medicare from financial collapse, but he said that was not reason enough to endorse him.
"Tom Brokaw is a wonderful anchorman, too," Mr. Lamm said, "but I don't want to endorse him for President. In other words, certain people play certain roles."
Mr. Lamm said he had been deeply disappointed by the failure of the Democrats to seriously deal with what he called the imminent financial collapse of Medicare. Defending Medicare in this form is like defending a snowman from melting in your front yard, Mr. Lamm said. He accused the Democrats of consistently refusing to seek long-term solutions to the Medicare problem.
"This is the party that's most disappointed me," he said. "I expected it from the Republicans."

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS;
Gore Speech: 'America Is Strong. Bill Clinton's Leadership Is Paying Off.'

BYLINE: Reuters 

 BODY:
Following are remarks last night at the Democratic National Convention by Vice President Al Gore:
Four years ago, you gave me your nomination to be Vice President. Tonight, I want to say from the bottom of my heart, thank you for the opportunity to serve our country and for the privilege of working beside a President who has done so much to lift the lives of America's families. 
 Tradition holds that this speech be delivered tomorrow night. But President Clinton asked me to speak tonight. And you can probably guess the reason why: my reputation for excitement.
This is some crowd. I've been watching you doing that macarena on television. And if I could have your silence, I would like to demonstrate for you, the Al Gore version of the macarena.
Would you like to see it again?
Four years ago, America faced a set of problems that our leaders had lost the courage to confront. Our nation was not creating jobs. Our jobs were not increasing pay. Our people were running in place. Our nation was falling behind.
Four years later we meet in this great city of Chicago, the place Carl Sandberg called "the city of the Big Shoulders . . . with lifted head so proud to be alive . . . and strong."
Four years later, Democrats are proud. Our hopes are alive. And America is strong.
Bill Clinton's leadership is paying off.
How can you tell?
By what the American people have achieved themselves. Just look at what all of us have created together these last four years.
Ten million new jobs. A deficit cut in half. A smaller, leaner reinvented government working better and costing less. Unemployment and inflation both down. Record exports. Wages on the rise. An economy moving forward. Empowerment zones bringing neighborhoods back to life. Classrooms being connected to the information superhighway.
Communities given the right to know about environmental dangers. Toxic wastes being cleaned up. Rivers and lakes reclaimed and thriving. An America not just better off, but better.
And our strength at home has led to renewed respect abroad. Nuclear missiles no longer targeted at our cities. Democracy replacing tyranny in Haiti. Peace replacing war in Bosnia. Leadership toward reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Middle East.
While our nation has made great progress, we have much more to do. And we are here to declare that the man who can help us fashion this better future is President Bill Clinton.
The President's opponent, Senator Bob Dole, is a good and decent man. We honor his service to America and his personal courage in fighting back from injuries sustained in battle.
Though we disagree with his ideas, only the unknowing would deny him the respect he deserves.
But make no mistake: there is a profound difference in outlook between the President and the man who seeks his office. In his speech from San Diego, Senator Dole offered himself as a bridge to the past.
Tonight Bill Clinton and I offer ourselves as a bridge to the future.
Ralph Waldo Emerson once said "Humanity is divided between the past and the future . . . between memory and hope."
It is easy to understand the nostalgic appeal of the party of memory and the men who lead it. But let there be no doubt. The future lies with the party of hope -- and the man from Hope who leads it.
We Americans write our own history. And the chapters of which we're proudest are the ones where we had the courage to change.
Time and again, Americans have seen the need for change and have taken the initiative to bring that change to life, but always with a struggle. Always there were opponents.
Senator Dole was there. We remember. We remember that he voted against the creation of Medicare, against the creation of Medicaid, against the Clean Air Act, against Head Start, against the Peace Corps in the 60's, and Americorps in the 90's.
He even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon.
If he's the most optimistic man in America, I'd hate to see the pessimists.
That pessimistic view of America is very different from ours.
And we saw, in the budget that Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich tried to slip past the American people last fall. Their budget doubled Medicare premiums while slashing benefits, wiped out nursing home care for seniors, ended the guarantee of medical care to disabled children, rolled back protections for our air and water, increased the cost of college while making students loans harder to get, terminated anti-drug programs for our schools, and raised taxes on the hardest-hit working families.
They passed their reckless plan and then demanded that President Clinton sign it.
They shut the government down, twice, because they thought Bill Clinton would buckle under the pressure, wither in the face of their attacks, cave in to their demands.
But they did not know the true measure of this man.
He never flinched or wavered.
He never stooped to their level. And of course, he never attacked his opponent's wife.
Let me tell you what Bill Clinton did do.
President Clinton took Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senator Bob Dole into the Oval Office. I was there, I remember. And he said, President Clinton said, "As long as I occupy this office, you will never enact this plan because as long as I am President, I won't let you."
That's why they want to replace Bill Clinton. But we won't let them.
They want someone in that Oval Office who will rubber stamp their plan. That's why they want to replace Bill Clinton. But we won't let them.
They want a President who will appoint the next three justices of the Supreme Court so they can control all three branches of Government and take away a woman's right to choose. That's why they want to replace Bill Clinton. But we won't let them.
They want to give health insurance rip-off artists a license to change Medicare, to let this program for our seniors wither on the vine. That's why they want to replace Bill Clinton. But we won't let them.
They want to outlaw all affirmative action and many other measures to reach out to those who want to reach up. That's why they want to replace Bill Clinton. But we won't let them.
They want to cut education and undermine our schools, put down teachers instead of lifting up students. That's why they want to replace Bill Clinton. But we won't let them.
They want to give free reign to lobbyists for the biggest polluters in America to rewrite our environmental laws, allowing more poison in our air and water, and then auction off our natural wonders piece by piece. That's why they want to replace Bill Clinton. But we won't let them.
We will not, we cannot, we must not let them.
And you know what? We can make Bill Clinton's job a lot easier by making Dick Gephardt Speaker of the House and Tom Daschle Senate majority leader.
You can judge a President by the enemies he is willing to make.
You know someone who's been attacked as much as Bill Clinton is doing something right.
American has never changed without a President willing to confront the status quo and take on the forces of greed and indifference. It has changed only when we have had a President with the vision to tackle the real problems that really matter to our families. That's what this President has done, because families don't eat or breath political slogans. They thrive or fail according to how they handle each day's challenges.
When your alarm goes off in the morning, if your family is like mine, everybody starts rushing around getting ready for school and work.
When one of your children reaches for cereal and fruit you shouldn't have to worry about whether the food is safe. That's why just this month President Clinton brought farmers and environmentalists together and signed an historic law to keep dangerous pesticides off our fruits and vegetables.
When you pour a glass of water for each member of the family at the table you shouldn't have to wonder -- should I buy bottled water? We really can't afford it.
That's why President Clinton signed the Safe Drinking Water Act to give families more peace of mind that their water will be pure and safe.
When you notice your child staring at a television set and watching violent and explicit images he or she is not old enough to handle, you shouldn't be forced to choose between throwing the TV out of the house and monitoring every second that child watches. That is why last month the President persuaded the broadcasters to agree to air three hours of quality children's educational programming every single week.
And that's why we're giving parents a new tool, the V-chip, to keep violent and explicit programming out of their homes and away from their children. When our children turn on the TV, let them learn how to read and add and spell and think, not how to kill.
If one of your children has an operation, or some other serious health problem, you shouldn't have to choose between taking care of that child or keeping your job. That is why Bill Clinton fought to pass the Family and Medical Leave Act, so parents can get time off to work to care for a sick child, bond with a newborn, or tend to an aging relative.
When your children do well in school and head toward graduation, they shouldn't have to wonder about whether their family can afford to send them to college. That is why President Clinton expanded scholarships, student loans and Pell Grants.
And that's why he wants to give a tax credit to pay $1,500 per year for tuition to make college more affordable for every single American family.
If the business where you work is changing in ways that cause you to think about getting a different kind of job, you ought to be able to get the training and education you need to learn new skills and plan for the future. That's why President Clinton is proposing a tax credit so if you go to a community college, you can take every single dollar you pay right off your taxes.
If you take responsibility, President Clinton will give you the opportunity to learn.
And if you see an opportunity to move to a better job, you shouldn't feel forced to stay in your old job just because that's the only way you can keep your health insurance.
Even if you have some pre-existing condition, you ought to be able to change jobs and not lose your coverage. That's why President Clinton signed the Kennedy-Kassebaum law.
Americans shouldn't have to feel imprisoned in their homes because of crime. We have a right to streets and neighborhoods that are safe. That's why President Clinton fought for the Brady Bill and the assault weapons ban, and that's why he's putting 100,000 new community police officers on our streets and sidewalks.
These problems are real, and they must be addressed. It's been a long time since we've had a President so in tune with the issues that touch the real lives of America's families. It's been a long time since we've had a President willing to fight the powerful forces that often seem to stand in the way.
Some of the most powerful forces that do the most harm are often hard to see and even harder to understand.
When I was a child, my family was attacked by an invisible force that was then considered harmless. My sister Nancy was older than me. There were only the two of us and I loved her more than life itself.
She started smoking when she was 13 years old.
The connection between smoking and lung cancer had not yet been established, but years later, the cigarettes had taken their toll. It hurt very badly to watch her savaged by that terrible disease.
Her husband, Frank, and all of us who loved her so much tried to get her to stop smoking. Of course, she should have. But she couldn't.
When she was 45, she had a lung removed. A year later, the disease had come back, and she returned to the hospital. We all took turns staying with her.
One day, I was called to come quickly because things had taken a turn for the worse. By then, her pain was nearly unbearable, and as a result, they used very powerful painkillers. Eventually, it got so bad they had to use such heavy doses that she could barely retain consciousness.
We sometimes didn't know if she could hear what we were saying or recognize us.
But when I responded to that call and walked into the hospital room that day, as soon as I turned the corner, someone said, "Al's here."
She looked up and from out of that haze, her eyes focused tensely right at me. She couldn't speak, but I felt clearly I knew she was forming a question.
Do you bring me hope?
All of us have tried to find whatever new treatment or new approach might help. But all I could do was to say back to her, with all the gentleness in my heart, "I love you."
And then I knelt by her bed and held her hand. And in a very short time, her breathing became labored and then she breathed her last breath.
Tomorrow morning, another 13-year-old girl will start smoking. I love her too.
Three thousand young people in America will start smoking tomorrow. One thousand of them will die a death not unlike my sister's. And that is why until I draw my last breath, I will pour my heart and soul into the cause of protecting our children from the dangers of smoking.
And that is also why I was intensely proud last week when President Clinton stood up for American families by standing up to tobacco advertising aimed at getting our children addicted.
He proposed the first-ever comprehensive plan to protect children from smoking, to ban tobacco advertising aimed at our children and to ban it for good.
It took courage for Bill Clinton to take on the tobacco companies. I promise you it is no accident that no President has ever been willing to do it before.
But coming from him, that's no surprise. I've seen him get up day after day and make the toughest decisions, and always by asking what is right for the American people.
As a result, with Bill Clinton's leadership, our nation is moving forward with confidence. Americans don't believe our best days are behind us. We see better days ahead because we have the courage to meet our challenges and protect our values.
And now, once again, in pursuit of the American Dream, we are crossing the bridge to the future.
Thirty-three years ago this very day, one American told us about his dream. Martin Luther King, Jr. stood in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial on that August afternoon and described the America that he saw in his mind's eye.
He called on our nation "to open the doors of opportunity to all of God's children."
How do we build an America worthy of this dream? Is it with brick and mortar? Is it with second-hand smoke and rear-view mirrors? Or do we build it in the nearest well-raised child?
By shepherding, guiding and protecting our children's souls we build a better America. The American spirit lives within that child. The child grows up to believe in it, to add new vision to it. It's not a vision of a distant future, nor of a remote past, but a constant accumulation of our best instincts and our noblest aspirations.
From the spirit of our Founding Fathers to the courage of today's families it is one vision. It is an American vision. It is the vision of the President Bill Clinton.
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS: MAN IN THE NEWS;
The Incumbent as a Riddle: William Jefferson Clinton

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 28

 BODY:
On Thursday night, when he accepts the renomination of a Democratic Party that he has alternately inspired and exasperated, William Jefferson Clinton will be at once the best-known and least-knowable politician in the land.
He is a moderate who cannot suppress his liberal impulses, a liberal who cannot escape his moderating instincts. He confounds his friends, who think he has agreed with them, only to find he has not. He confuses his enemies, who think they can work with him, only to find they cannot. 
 He is a tender man, whose eyes well with tears at the sad tales of strangers, and a heedless man, who in the last four years has left a trail littered with old friends in disgrace or in jail. He is a thoughtful man, with an abiding sense of the sweep of history, and a careless man, with a troubling disregard for the inconvenient details of his own life.
Four years ago, Mr. Clinton's lieutenants called him "Secretariat," in tribute to the thoroughbred daring he exhibited at his best. Some top aides now use another nickname that sums up his less flattering side. He is "The Boy," with unruly appetites that let him drag a meeting past its time, keep a roomful of visitors waiting or tear up a speech at the last minute -- sometimes to brilliant effect, but often at the expense of a clear decision or explanation.
To listen to Mr. Clinton talk for any time at all is to enter a realm of hyperarticulation without apparent limit. He can muster the same enthusiasm for a discussion of post-cold war politics and tax credits for retraining workers as he can for a suddenly shattered golf driver, the college basketball polls or the size of the British Prime Minister's hands. (They are big.)
"Fundamentally, he is a good person who is very altruistic in nature," said Betsey Wright, his longtime chief of staff as Governor of Arkansas who knows him as well as anyone. "Now, on top of that, he complicates it. He has this restless intellectual curiosity. We haven't had many Presidents who read as much as he does. He complicates it. There's an openness I don't think he gets credit for; he gets denigrated for it."
There may be a clue to the contradictions of the man in the ritual he follows at almost every rally and reception he attends: He thanks the band. From the humblest high school ensemble to the resplendent, red-jacketed Marines known as "The President's Own," few players escape his appreciative eye.
He asks about the make of their instruments, as he did a boy in a school gym in New Hampshire this winter. He marvels at their harmony and their heart. And he knows, instinctively, how often they can be overlooked, underestimated and misunderstood.
For Mr. Clinton is, by the social- and class-conventions of the world he grew up in, a band guy -- the in-betweener who did not score the touchdowns but played the horn at halftime, neither jock nor nerd, grind nor goof-off, cool kid nor outcast, but a chameleon, moving ebulliently and effortlessly among worlds.
That quicksilver quality helped him present himself in 1992 as a new kind of Democrat, borrowing ideas and images from everywhere, and it fuels him again as he co-opts Republican issues from crime to welfare in this campaign.
But it is also the quality that makes him a straddler defying easy classification, both within the narrow world of Washington politics and the wider realm of the electorate, with unpredictable effects on his place in each.
 
The Politician
Clear-Cut as a Person But Fuzzy on Policy
Polls show that a majority of the public does not believe Mr. Clinton is telling the full truth about the controversies that continue to embroil him -- from Whitewater to his Administration's gathering of F.B.I. files on Republicans from the Reagan and Bush Administrations -- and that about half of voters do not think he has the honesty and integrity they expect in a President.
But they think he cares about them all the same as 65 percent of Americans said in the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll.
Mr. Clinton never hesitates to exploit that sense. As he put it at the beginning of the train trip that brought him to Chicago tonight, "I want you to know, every day for four years I have gone to that Oval Office and thought about you."
Asked to sum up his boss in a corridor of the convention hall on Monday, his deputy chief of staff and longtime friend, Harold M. Ickes, sighed and shook his head at the implicit complexity of the task.
Then suddenly he whipped out a newspaper clipping, thwacked one underlined paragraph with his forefinger and smiled. In it, Brenda Godsey, a delegate from Kansas, was quoted as saying "it's the first time that I've been voting for President that I felt like I'm voting for a real person."
That Bill Clinton certainly is, and his faults have long been as painfully plain as his strengths. Indeed, when his wife, Hillary, introduced him at his 50th birthday gala at Radio City Music Hall 10 days ago as the best man she had ever known, he was moved to respond, "I'm sure I'm not the best man she has ever known, but I sure have loved her and my wonderful child."
Mr. Clinton ran for President when older, better-known horses in his party thought George Bush looked unbeatable, and he persevered when the experts thought the taint of tales of infidelity and his avoiding the draft had left him dead. In his first two years in office, he scored some victories: a deficit reduction plan, passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, passage of long-sought gun control laws.
But he also stumbled badly, through botched appointments, the flock of old friends from Arkansas and new ones from Hollywood whom he allowed to have indecorous run of the White House, his clumsy and ultimately failed attempt to permit gays to serve openly in the military, the postponement of middle-class tax cuts and the welfare restructuring that he promised, and finally the total collapse of the health-insurance overhaul that he made the centerpiece of his domestic agenda.
When voters in the midterm elections of 1994 delivered a stunning resounding rebuke of him and the party whose form he has periodically tried to reshape instead of being shaped by it, Mr. Clinton retreated into a self-described sinking spell. He called old friends to wonder what had gone wrong, consulted with historians and even spent a weekend at Camp David with a panel of New Age self-improvement gurus.
From all those dark hours came a determination to reposition himself once more as the man in the middle, just as he had after his bruising defeat as Governor of Arkansas after one term, when voters concluded that he was too young, too liberal and too clever by half. With the help of his politically ambiguous strategist and pollster, Dick Morris, he rebounded with a Presidency so retooled as to seem a premature second term, and he now stands as the acknowledged front-runner to win an actual one.
Just what he stands for is less clear. He promises to lead the nation into "a new progressive era," of smaller, more efficient Government, with modest tax breaks for education and families with children. He preaches a mantra of "opportunity, responsibility, community," pre-empting Republican themes like values and violence in the media.
After twice vetoing Republican welfare bills as too harsh, he finally signed one which he still denounces as full of bad elements and which many members of his own party condemn, because he decided it was the best he could get, and he promises to fix it in the next four years.
For months, he has flooded the public stage with small proposals, from curfews for teen-agers to requiring uniforms in public schools, and bigger ones, like a sharp Government crackdown on teen-age smoking. This week, he has begun unleashing a flurry of perhaps three dozen similar executive actions that would help shape a second term.
Al From, the head of the moderate Democratic Leadership Council, the centrist organization Mr. Clinton helped to found, said "the common thread" of his Presidency has been a desire "to lead the country, and in doing so, his party, beyond a set of orthodoxies that have defined them both into a different and new era."
"He has had to live in a world where he has had opposition both from the opposition party and where he tried to do things that many in his own party really don't support," Mr. From added.
Yet sometimes Mr. Clinton's approach of "one from Column A and two from Column B" has seemed anything but deeply thought out.
In his State of the Union Message this year, Mr. Clinton summoned the nation to join him in an "age of possibility," but his advisers acknowledged that sketchy notion as a space holder until they figured out what it really meant. The President's broad agenda remains sketchy.
"My vision does not seek to promote Government but to perfect it, to make it a better servant of our people," Mr. Clinton writes in his just-released book, "Between Hope and History." "It doesn't seek to demean the free marketplace, but to strengthen it and to take account of what it cannot be expected to do. It does not promise a future of perfection, but it does provide a path of progress."
 
The Person
A Child of Duality Who Often Perplexes
Born to a widowed nurse who barely knew his father, a traveling salesman she married after a whirlwind wartime romance, Mr. Clinton grew up in the dual world he has inhabited ever since.
On the one hand, he was the adored eldest son, indulged and forgiven his frailties, given the biggest bedroom in his boyhood home and a recreation room that saw a constant stream of visiting friends. On the other, he was the premature man of the family, forced to cope with the alcoholic, abusive outbursts of the bourbon-drinking Buick dealer his mother married when he was 4.
"The violence and dysfunction in our home made me a loner, which is contrary to the way people view me, because I'm gregarious, happy, all of that," Mr. Clinton told Good Housekeeping magazine last year in an interview about his mother, Virginia Kelley, who died in 1994. "But I had to construct a whole life inside my own mind, my own space."
Part of the life Mr. Clinton created involved the soulful solitude of the tenor saxophone. Another part involved restless public activity and political networking, a index-card file of friends and contacts that was the stuff of legend by the time he became a Rhodes Scholar. And still another part involved a capacity, learned from his mother, to will away, deny and ignore bad news.
Late in her life, his mother acknowledged that she and he had never talked together about the years of abuse she suffered from her second husband, Roger Clinton, the Buick dealer whose name Bill took, though each by then had talked about it separately on national television as part of the 1992 campaign. The President's aides say he brings the same tendency to bear in the White House.
"Think of some of our recent Presidents, and how they would have been consumed by attacks against them like those he's had, and virtually incapacitated by it," said his press secretary, Michael D. McCurry. "He just doesn't pay any attention to it. He knows enough about himself not to. He will not read a damn thing about any of the subjects that would cause him pain."
In the same Good Housekeeping interview, Mr. Clinton suggested that the skills of coping and compartmentalization he learned as a child were a mixed blessing -- one that friends say he came to understand only much later, in counseling sessions when his younger half-brother, Roger, was convicted on cocaine charges in the 1980's after a sting operation he had authorized as Governor.
"When you grow up in a dysfunctional home," Mr. Clinton said, "inadvertently, you send mixed signals. You learn that other people, in the outside world, didn't live in the same context as you. I see this as President. I don't believe in psychobabble. You can overdo all that, but I think I have to be acutely aware that I grew up as a peacemaker, always trying to minimize the disruption."
"People underestimate your resolve because you go out of your way to accommodate them before you drop the hammer," Mr. Clinton added. "And it's a great mistake, really, because most people -- most good, whole people who have survived these kinds of upbringings -- deep down are pretty steely. They may go that extra mile to avoid conflict, but when it happens, they tend to survive pretty well. You try to avoid it, but you also learn to survive."
No less a firsthand authority on troubled childhoods than Speaker Newt Gingrich misjudged Mr. Clinton's collegial intimations in the budget battles between the White House and Congress last year. Mr. Gingrich was furious when what he thought was the President's willingness to work together turned into a barrage of attacks portraying the Republicans as using slash-and-burn tactics and the ones who shut down Government services and would destroy Medicare.
Indeed, Mr. Clinton is dangerous to his opponents (if not to himself), in part because of his amoebic ability to shift from one self and one stance to the next. To friend and foe alike, the President also has an exasperating propensity for the elisions of truth that Mark Twain called "stretchers."
Mr. McCurry himself scoffed publicly, if affectionately, at the President's recent suggestion that he has lost upward of 15 pounds in recent months, warning that there was "an inflation factor" to the claim.
Asked at the end of an interview with The New York Times in July about a dual-faced watch he was wearing, Mr. Clinton replied: "Let me tell you. This is a watch I wear when Hillary's gone," so as to keep track of what time it is wherever the First Lady may be on the road.
But subsequent questioning revealed that Mr. Clinton had only received the watch the week before, at the summit of major industrial nations in France and that his wearing it was hardly a longstanding practice.
Sometimes, the President simply tries to hard to be liked.
"The foremost thing about this man is that he loves people, he genuinely adores people, and wants that love back," Ms. Wright said. "In fact he goes crazy if he can't have it."
Mr. Clinton's aides know that is part of what drives the public crazy about their President, and part of what makes them understand him, in turn. After all, what mortal has not fudged his weight, or flattered himself for his sensitivity?
At the same time, Mr. Clinton is capable of hewing sternly to a goal when the stakes are high enough. The same man who used to appall aides by wolfing down cold, coagulated pasta from an Olive Garden restaurant on the road has, in fact, slimmed down for his last campaign, and willingly keeps a schedule that exhausts aides 20 years younger.
Having just turned 50 -- a ripe age in a family whose men have died young -- Mr. Clinton at last seems a bit more settled, in life and his job. For example, his spokesman, Mr. McCurry says, he no longer struggles for words when describing a foreign policy problem the way he once did. "He doesn't search now for what he's supposed to say, because he now knows what he needs to say," Mr. McCurry said.
Erskine Bowles, a former deputy chief of staff at the White House, said the President's mind never stops whirring.
"When it's just him and me on the golf course or whatever, he talks about early childhood education or a job training program, so people can have the skills they need in a high-wage marketplace," Mr. Bowles said. "He really talks about that, and you know, he's not putting on any show for old Erskine sitting there."
In The Times interview this summer, groping to synthesize the diverse strands of his agenda, from fighting international terrorism to restricting violence on television, Mr. Clinton summed himself up, too.
"I really try to think every day about how all this looks to someone living in a medium-sized town in Ohio or California or Arkansas or anyplace else," he said. "You know, what it's like for them, and how this can connect to their lives. If I have brought anything to the Presidency I think that is special, I think I do have a feel for how all these issues fit together and why."
Or at least, the President added, "I hope that's true, and I believe it's true."

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS;
Excerpts From Dodd's Remarks at Convention

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the speech last night at the Democratic National Convention by Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut nominating President Clinton:
Sixteen years ago, a Governor from Arkansas traveled north to Connecticut. He spoke on my behalf at a convention nominating me to serve in the United States Senate. Tonight, I am honored to return the favor. 
 Delegates and fellow Americans, I place in nomination for the Presidency of the United States a man I have called my President for nearly 4 years -- and my friend for more than 20 -- William Jefferson Clinton.
Four more years.
My friends, America remembers that cold and brilliant January day 44 months ago, when a young governor, raised in the small town of Hope, Ark., brought new hope to a nation hungry for renewal and change. Remember what it was like then. Americans were struggling. Men and women needed jobs. Student test scores were falling. Crime rates were rising. Parents looked in on their sleeping children -- and in the quiet of the night, worried that, no matter how hard they worked, those they most loved might inherit a lesser life in a lesser land.
President Clinton identified with the difficulties confronting America's families. Remember, this is a man who never had the joy of knowing his own father. He was raised by a wonderful mother, in a home that had more than its share of problems. So when this President speaks about tough times facing America's families, he knows what he's talking about.
That is why he offered a bold and brave strategy to put America back on track. He invited men and women of both political parties to work together to make America work again. Because he knew that for Americans to do their best, their leaders must do better and appeal to the best in each of us.
But there were those in Congress who decided to seek advantages instead of common ground. They said interest rates would soar, unemployment would increase, a deeper recession would hit, and so the President's plan for recovery had to be passed without a single one of their votes.
Tonight, let me say it plainly: "Mr. President, you did the right thing. You did the right thing for America."
Today, our economy is stronger and more prosperous than it has been in more than three decades. But as we all know, the effort is not finished. People today work long, hard hours to pay their bills, and they have a chance to move ahead because President Clinton took a stand, while his opponents turned away.
It is for you, the American people, that President Clinton has cut the deficit for four straight years. That hasn't happened in more than a century and a half in America.
It is for you, the people of this country, that the President has brought down interest rates, so more Americans can own a home, start a business, and send a child to college. It is for you, the people of this nation, that President Clinton has cut taxes, so 15 million American families can keep more in their pockets.
And now it is for you, the people, that President Clinton has created more than 10 million new jobs. Ten million. That is his most important contribution to our people, who all deserve an opportunity to succeed. And then, my friends, he did something that no other American President has ever dared to do: He took on the gun lobby, and he won.
He signed Jim and Sarah Brady's bill, and stopped more than 60,000 outlaws from buying handguns. He banned deadly assault weapons, because the guns that deal death should not be as easy to buy as the bread that sustains life.
Now our President is taking on tobacco.
On this he heard another chorus of caution: "Don't oppose this special interest, it's a fight you can't win." Some even tried to claim that cigarettes are no more harmful to a child's health than a glass of milk.
But every day in America, 3,000 children start smoking. One thousand of them will die earlier than they should. That will change now -- because this President had the courage to say no more advertising to the young, no more selling to the young, no more "Joe Camel."
Four days ago, he began a train journey across America -- an America that he has helped to change. It is not a perfect America, but it is a nation on the march again, approaching a new century with new confidence. For the next 70 days, our people will listen to a debate about the direction of our country. But this autumn of campaign does not have to be a season of conflict.
On this August evening, and in this hall, I ask each and every one of you to pledge with me that this campaign will be worthy of the people we seek to lead, and of the land we love. Let us do our part to restore civility to America's political discourse. Let us lead by example. Let us not dishonor our democracy. The American people are fed up with relentless assaults on people's reputations.
This has to stop -- and it must stop now. And I say this to our political opponents: Stop attacking the President's family. . . .
Now, at the 11th hour, Senator Dole proposes a flawed economic plan that will either explode the deficit, or lead to withering cuts in Medicare, education and the environment. President Clinton has put our economic house in order, and he offers a plan to lead us into a new era of growth and jobs, while honoring our abiding commitment to the elderly, the young and the earth we inhabit.
Mr. President, you're doing the right thing. You're doing the right thing for America.
Now friends, a few hours ago, this young President arrived here in Chicago. And in a few hours from now, he will accept the nomination of our party. And then he will depart and begin a new journey into the heart of America.
And for that journey, he has the courage, the vision and the commitment to bring all Americans together to the threshold of a new century.
The choice, my fellow citizens, is yours. We're here tonight, proud to offer you our choice. I proudly place in nomination before this convention and this country the name of America's President: William Jefferson Clinton.

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS: THE OVERVIEW;
Democrats Send Clinton Into Battle for a 2d Term

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 28

 BODY:
The Democratic Party tonight once again nominated Bill Clinton for President of the United States in a triumphant climax to his sometimes stormy four years in office, capping an evening of dire predictions about what might happen if the Republicans retake the White House.
Though Mr. Clinton's nomination was only a formality for a President who faced no opposition in the primaries, the night was a celebration of solidarity behind a President who just a year ago was down in the polls and blamed by many in his own party for the collapse of his health-care proposal and for delivering Congress to the Republicans in the midterm elections. 
 As the party rambled through the ritual roll-call of states, Mr. Clinton went over the top at 10:59 P.M. with the necessary 2,145 delegates after the battleground state of Ohio cast it votes. The hall rocked with cheers as Mr. Clinton's smiling face appeared on the huge screens in the hall, and, from his hotel suite, he threw his fist in the air.
But before the jubilation and the unanimous vote, the Democratic convention took a bluntly and unabashedly partisan turn as Vice President Al Gore led a line-up of speakers who sought to contrast Mr. Clinton with Bob Dole and to remind voters about the party's favorite adversary, Speaker Newt Gingrich.
"Make no mistake," Mr. Gore said in one of the most aggressively partisan speeches all week. "There is a profound difference in outlook between the President and the man who seeks his office. In his speech from San Diego, Senator Dole offered himself as a bridge to the past. Tonight, Bill Clinton and I offer ourselves as a bridge to the future."
In a well-received address that seems certain to raise his profile as he gears up for an expected run for President himself in the year 2000, Mr. Gore's remarks were salted with stern warnings about what might happen if Mr. Dole reaches the White House. He also chastised Mr. Gingrich and the Republicans for the Government's shutdown last year -- and for attacking the First Lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Saying the Republicans underestimated Mr. Clinton, the Vice President said: "They did not know the true measure of this man. He never flinched or wavered. He never stooped to their level. And, of course, he never attacked his opponent's wife." With that, Mrs. Clinton rose to her feet and applauded heartily.
Mr. Gore brought many delegates to tears with a description of his sister's death from lung cancer but his speech and tonight's program in general sounded more like a traditional political convention after two days of deeply personal moments couched in studied nonpartisan statements. That approach had been intended to provide warm and safe family programming while the President chugged toward Chicago by train through West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.
From the last stop in his train trip in Michigan City, Ind., the 50-year-old Mr. Clinton arrived by helicopter, alighting on a baseball field at the Chicago campus of the University of Illinois, ending a passage through the middle of the country choreographed to build interest and news coverage for a convention that has so far borne neither surprises, controversy nor debate.
Mr. Clinton, who will deliver his acceptance speech on Thursday night, told a small but enthusiastic crowd that welcomed him: "The best is yet to come: the best days of America, the best days of the Clinton-Gore Administration, the best days of our efforts together, to lift up our country and move forward."
Despite the display of partisanship inside the United Center, speakers hewed to a well-orchestrated effort to shun what Democrats asserted were the inappropriately personal attacks at the Republican convention two weeks ago. Both Mr. Gore and Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, in his speech nominating the President, went so far as to praise Mr. Dole even as they attacked his policies.
"I begin by thinking of the Republican candidate for President who two weeks ago spoke so movingly of his own past," said Mr. Dodd, the general chairman of the Democratic Party. "So let me say to Senator Robert Dole, on behalf of the thousands here in this United Center: Thank you from a generation of Americans living in freedom because of your sacrifices."
Calling for a restoration of civility in political discourse, Mr. Dodd said: "It is not Bob Dole's reputation that I question. It is his agenda for America. Sometimes a fine person has flawed ideas. This is such a time."
The President's 16-year-old daughter, Chelsea, leapt to her feet when Mr. Dodd implored Republicans to "stop attacking the President's family."
That said, Mr. Dodd plunged into listing Mr. Dole's differences with the President, on issues from education to Medicare to abortion to the economy. On abortion, he accused Mr. Dole of trying "to turn a woman's wrenching personal choice into a constitutional crime."
And the Senator tore into Mr. Dole's signature proposal for an across-the-board, 15-percent tax cut, saying: "Now, at the 11th hour, Senator Dole proposes a flawed economic plan that will either explode the deficit or lead to withering cuts in Medicare, education and the environment. President Clinton has put our economic house in order."
On this festive night, the last differences over welfare, no matter how strongly felt, were swept aside. For the first time since 1964, delegates at a Democratic convention were optimistic, even gleeful, about Election Day -- if not out of personal feelings for Mr. Clinton, then at least because with 10 weeks to go their nominee, a proven and adept campaigner, has a solid lead in the polls.
The circumstances are vastly different from the last time the Democrats renominated their President, Jimmy Carter, in New York in 1980. Mr. Carter clinched the nomination, but only after his rival, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, ended his quest for the nomination after losing a fight over the rules. This year, Mr. Clinton faced no primary challenger, and Mr. Kennedy, who has long abandoned his designs on the White House, will join in the parade of tributes with an address before the President's acceptance speech.
As the headline speaker of the evening, Mr. Gore sought to underscore the differences between Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton in an address that aides said was something of a preview of the President's acceptance speech.
Mr. Gore drew respectful applause when he saluted Mr. Dole for his "personal courage in fighting back from injuries sustained in battle." But moments later he attacked his Republican foe: "We remember that he voted against the creation of Medicare. Against the creation of Medicaid. Against the Clean Air Act. Against Head Start. Against the Peace Corps in the '60's and Americorps in the '90's. He even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon."
The hall was hushed during Mr. Gore's emotional description of the death from lung cancer of his sister, who was a smoker. "Until I draw my last breath," Mr. Gore said he would fight to protect children from the dangers of tobacco -- and lauded Mr. Clinton's call for new restrictions on tobacco.
On a lighter note, Mr. Gore used the prime-time opportunity to burnish his staid, even stiff, public image. "Tradition holds that this speech be delivered tomorrow night," Mr. Gore said. "But President Clinton asked me to speak tonight. And you can probably guess the reason. My reputation for excitement." He stood stone faced before breaking into a smile.
While neither Mr. Gore nor the other speakers explicitly noted that Mr. Dole is 73, an underlying theme was the depiction of the Republican nominee as of a past generation. As Mayor Dennis Archer of Detroit said in his speech seconding Mr. Clinton's nomination: "You know, we heard a lot of talk in San Diego about the past -- about turning back the clock. And nostalgia has its place. But their warm memories won't solve the challenges of a new century and a rapidly changing world. Nor will warmed-over "voodoo" economics that spell bigger deficits, recession and crippling new burdens for local governments -- and more pain for the most vulnerable, our seniors and our children."
In the warm-up to the President's arrival and the Vice President's speech, several prominent Democratic Governors and members of Congress took to the rostrum to make the case for the Clinton Administration's accomplishments and warn that a White House and Congress controlled by Republicans would lead to extremist policies. Many appeals tonight were aimed at, and delivered by, working women, an important Democratic constituency. In fact, Mr. Gore's address was preceded by a presentation from the five Democratic Senators who are women.
"Tonight we come before you not just as Senators," said Senator Barbara Boxer of California, "but as grandmothers and moms, as sisters and daughters, as wives and aunts, as women and Americans concerned about the future of our children and the future of our country. And if all Americans put families first and re-elect this President, we will give our children the opportunity they deserve to live up to their potential."
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut was almost alone in raising the subject of foreign policy, an issue that Democratic Party officials say is not on the top of voters' minds when they go to the polls. "The most awesome power of the American Presidency is the power to wage war," he said. "With it comes a profound responsibility to defend America and preserve peace so that war does not occur."
Earlier in the evening, a parade of Congressional candidates addressed the convention -- each with a short, personal talk about themselves and their candidacies.
For the Democrats, the television pictures were as important as the words, explaining the live shots of the train beamed into the darkened hall all week. But White House officials said they had no plans to try to top the theatrics on this night four years ago, when Mr. Clinton marched joyously from Macy's in New York City to a convention hall filled with cheering Democrats.
Before he reached Chicago, Mr. Clinton, for the third day in row, unveiled a new initiative, this time a package of environmental measures costing $1.9 billion over four years. Most of the money, $1.3 billion, would be requested from Congress to nearly double the pace of cleaning up Superfund sites.
 
IN HIS OWN WORDS
 
BILL CLINTON
Arriving in Chicago last night after a whistle-stop tour:
"It's been a wonderful, wonderful trip.
I took that trip for two reasons. As all of you know, when I accept the nomination of our party tomorrow night and start this campaign, it will be the first American campaign for the 21st century and the last campaign for Bill Clinton.
I wanted to be on that track because I wanted to look into the eyes, into the faces, and into the hearts of people who live in the heartland of America, the people I have worked with and fought for the last four years, and I like what I saw.
And I wanted them to see that our train was not only on the right track to Chicago. We're on the right track to the 21st century and that's what this convention and this campaign is all about."

HEADLINE: Vulture Investors Flocking to Europe;
Real Estate Feeding Frenzy a la U.S.May Be in Store for the Continent

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
The breakfast room at the Grand Hotel Inter-Continental on Rue Scribe in Paris seems an unlikely roost for "vulture" investors.
But on a recent morning there, J. Squire Junger, the partner in charge of Arthur Andersen's real estate portfolio services group, found himself sandwiched at a table between a covey of bankers from Nomura Securities, and a flock headed by Mark Landau from Merrill Lynch & Company. 
 Later, as he entered the offices of Lazard Freres & Company, he ran into a brood led by Keith Breslauer from Lehman Brothers' European real estate group, and on the way out, his friends from Merrill Lynch again.
Having reaped hefty profits from their bailout of the American property business in the early 1990's, vulture investors with an appetite for troubled real estate are now swooping down on Europe, where banks and insurance companies are showing an increased willingness to unload their bad loans and property.
Right now, the carcass these vultures are circling is a portfolio of some $2 billion in bad mortgage loans on office buildings in and around Paris and obscure property-development projects scattered around France. The portfolio, one of the largest collections of distressed real estate ever to come up for grabs, is being auctioned off next month by Lazard Freres on behalf of its client, Credisuez, a subsidiary of Groupe Suez.
If the deal is successful, bankers expect it to kick off the biggest real estate feeding frenzy since 1989, when the United States Government formed the Resolution Trust Corporation to sell off billions of dollars worth of bad property investments made by savings and loans.
Already, Whitehall, the immensely successful real estate fund company managed by Goldman, Sachs & Company, has snapped up two smaller loan portfolios and may have acquired others in private transactions. And all of the other players who made out big buying busted real estate in the United States -- Lehman Brothers, Cargill, the J. E. Robert Companies and Morgan Stanley -- have also shown up.
"You're seeing the birth of a market right now," Mr. Junger said. "They're effectively exporting the bailout business, which has been until now primarily an American phenomenon."
And, at least for the time being, it is still an American phenomenon exported to Europe. European investors have been notably absent, a fact that is interpreted two ways.
The bulls say vulture investing is simply an alien concept to most Europeans, who will enter the fray once an infrastructure is developed to assess distressed property.
Au contraire, say the bears. The Europeans are simply savvier: They figure the downturn in their property market is more structural than economic in nature and -- unlike in the United States -- there is less certainty of a robust recovery.
"They may not be aware of the money that can be made -- or maybe they know something we don't," said Donald Wolf, a principal in J. E. Robert, a privately held real estate company in Alexandria, Va.
Nonetheless, he is confident that investors are on the brink of a gold mine. Last year, J. E. Robert hooked up with a French property management company to form Finestate & Roberts, which aims to help potential investors analyze deals in France and then acts as a manager if a purchase is made.
"We have a conviction that there is an incredible business opportunity over there," Mr. Wolf said.
The deals so far have been limited to France and mainly involve real estate in the Paris metropolitan area. Four years ago, Paris was the first commercial property market on the Continent to run into trouble as demand for office space dropped, rents sank and borrowers started having trouble paying their loans. French banks, unlike some of their counterparts in Spain and Italy, had less of a capital cushion to absorb the losses.
The French Government did move early on to bail out a couple of major institutions, most notably -- and controversially -- the giant Credit Lyonnais, which was all too willing a lender in the late 1980's. But the ability of the Government to ride in on a white horse has been constrained by its own need to reduce its spending and budget deficits in preparation for European monetary union in 1999.
The scope of the troubles in France is difficult to quantify; estimates range from $20 billion to $60 billion. Investors are licking their chops over the prospects of bulk sales by Credit Foncier de France, a real estate and municipal financing company that has a large portfolio of distressed property and loans, and by Consortium de Realisation, the unit set up to handle problem loans of Credit Lyonnais -- although no one is certain they will ever come to market.
"The bottom line is, nobody really knows how big the market is or whether any of these assets will come up for sale," said Mr. Breslauer, executive director at Lehman Brothers. Many banks, he said, "aren't making enough profits to take provisions that would allow them to make significant write-downs." In other words, they cannot afford to absorb the losses from selling their troubled loans.
The first bulk sale of distressed mortgages and property took place last fall, when Barclays Bank France auctioned off about 200 loans with a total book value of 900 million francs, or $180 million, to a group that included Lehman Brothers, Cargill and LaSalle Partners. Shortly thereafter, Credisuez tested the waters with the sale of a package of loans and real property carrying a book value of 745 million francs, or $150 million, which was purchased by a consortium led by Whitehall. Neither purchase price was disclosed.
Those deals were small potatoes by the standards of most vulture investors. But when a Whitehall-led investor group snapped up some 3.2 billion francs, or $630 million, of performing and nonperforming loans from France's largest insurer, Compagnie UAP, in June, their gastric juices started flowing.
"The sellers are finally acknowledging the decline in asset values," said George E. Kountouris, a managing director at Bankers Trust in London who advised the seller in all three of the transactions.
Bankers expect to see similar sales in Spain by early next year and then in Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and Belgium over the next couple of years. Some are even looking to Japan, although admittedly with a great degree of wishfulness.
At first glance, buying distressed real estate in Europe would seem like shooting fish in a barrel. Portfolios are selling at discounts to book value ranging from 50 to 75 percent, and banks and other financial institutions desperately need to clean up their balance sheets.
But the steep discounts reflect huge risks. First and foremost, bankers complain that information most Americans would consider essential for valuing a real estate portfolio either is not available or is available in a form that makes it all but impossible to use. One banker said he was shocked when he received four large boxes filled with a welter of papers about the first Credisuez deal, rather than a computer disk with information presented in a user-friendly format. He pushed them into a corner and used them as a makeshift table for his plants.
John Klopp, a principal at the Victor Capital Group, which advised several American banks on their asset disposals in the early 1990's, said the lack of complete information on properties, their occupancies, their development prospects and their cash flow could cost sellers almost a third of their loans' book value.
"If the French banks and institutions were smart, they would start investing in developing an information infrastructure for buyers," he said.
Also, the recovery of the real estate market in Europe is less certain than it was in the United States, where falling interest rates and improving economic growth combined to create a hothouse environment for real estate. Interest rates in Europe are higher, and economic growth is coming at a snail's pace. France's gross domestic product climbed by a scant nine-tenths of 1 percent in the 12 months that ended in March, while Germany's barely grew at all.
Europe's real estate market is far more troubled than was America's in the late 1980's. "The bulk of the damage has come from the financing of smaller developers and speculators who were building smaller properties," said Jon Zehner, head of real estate investment banking at J. P. Morgan. "So as a rule, what you're looking at in these portfolios are mainly nonperforming mortgage loans with absolutely no cash flow, unlike the U.S. experience."
Additionally, the costs of gaining control of the property tied to a faltering mortgage loan are much higher in Europe. Laws favor the borrower, and transfer taxes can be much higher than expected. And just how an investor realizes a profit is far less clear. Mortgage-backed securities or real estate investment trusts, favorite escape routes for investors who picked up R.T.C. properties, are alien concepts in Europe. The securities effectively turn loans and properties into more liquid bonds and stock that are attractive to pension funds and other institutional investors.
"Because there is no cash flow and because the whole concept of asset securitization is not nearly as well developed in Europe, and particularly in France, there is much greater uncertainty as to exit strategies," said Christophe Tanghe, a vice president in J. P. Morgan's real estate group.
Although next month's Credisuez deal is enormous, most bankers say the only thing that might scotch it is unrealistic price expectations. The bank's first deal attracted relatively few bidders, at least in part because Credisuez wanted what many thought was too rich a price.
Plus, many potential investors still have a bitter taste in their mouths from a deal floated by Argentaria, a large Spanish bank. It pulled the sale of a large property portfolio at the last minute, reportedly because it thought the bids were too low; bidders lost millions of dollars spent on due diligence.
But as big as the risks seem, there is still a steady stream of bidders flowing in and out of the Boulevard Haussman offices of Lazard Freres. No one has forgotten that among the bulk sales of distressed real estate in the United States during the early 1990's, only one deal has lost money for its investors.
"Experience says that no matter how silly it sounds or how opportunistic it appears, they'll probably make a lot of money," said Craig Hatkoff, a principal at Victor Capital. "This is a business where you make a lot of money just for being there."

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
Couldn't Help Giving In to Wanderlust

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI 

 BODY:

ANATOMY OF RESTLESSNESS
Selected Writings 1969-1989
By Bruce Chatwin
205 pages. Viking. $22.95.
 
 Writers of books, Bruce Chatwin observed in one of these posthumously published essays, fall into two categories: "the ones who 'dig in' and the ones who move." Among the members of the first category, he counted "Flaubert and Tolstoy laboring in their libraries; Zola with a suit of armor alongside his desk; Poe in his cottage; Proust in the cork-lined room." Among the movers, he named "Melville, who was 'undone' by his gentlemanly establishment in Massachusetts, or Hemingway, Gogol or Dostoyevsky whose lives, whether from choice or necessity, were a headlong round of hotels and rented rooms -- and, in the case of the last, a Siberian prison." 
 Chatwin, of course, belongs firmly in the movers category. Until his death at the age of 48 in 1989 (he had been ailing, he said in an interview, from a rare bone marrow disease contracted during a trip to western China), Chatwin had been an inveterate traveler, a restless, modern-day nomad whose eloquent accounts of his journeys ("In Patagonia," "The Songlines") have already become classics of travel writing.
His latest book, "Anatomy of Restlessness" -- a collection of essays, stories, articles and reviews spanning a 20-year period -- amplifies his thoughts on traveling and the virtues of the nomadic life. Although the volume is more of a hodgepodge than his last collection of articles ("What Am I Doing Here"), it still affords the reader the pleasures of Chatwin's lapidary style, as well as some glittering snapshots from his own peregrinations.
As he recounts in the lead essay, "I Always Wanted to Go to Patagonia" (a piece that originally appeared in The New York Times Book Review in 1983), Chatwin grew up with wanderlust in his genes. His cousin Charley, who became British consul in Punta Arenas in Chile, was shipwrecked at the entrance to the Strait of Magellan in 1898; his Uncle Geoffrey was an Arabist and desert traveler who received a golden headdress from Emir Feisal, and his Uncle Humphrey came to a "sad end in Africa."
With his father away in the Navy, the young Bruce Chatwin spent his childhood drifting about England with his mother, staying with assorted relatives and friends. As a child, he became attached to a wooden camel his father had bought in a Cairo bazaar; as a student, he became "an addict of atlases." Years later he would quit his job as an art assessor at Sotheby's to hit the road himself: he had developed, he recalled, a horror of things, "to feel that things, however beautiful, can also be malign."
He had also begun to believe that human beings possess a migratory instinct that drives them "to walk long distances through the seasons" -- an instinct inherited from their herdsmen ancestors that "when warped in conditions of settlement" found "outlets in violence, greed, status-seeking or a mania for the new."
These ideas reverberate throughout this volume. In excerpts from a book he once planned to write about nomads, Chatwin muses at length about the economic and psychological roots of wanderlust, the emotional impulse "to abandon civilization and seek a simpler life, a life in harmony with 'nature,' unhampered with possessions, free from the grinding bonds of technology." He argues that "the origins of civilization are not all that respectable." He quotes Montaigne and Whitman on the benefits of travel. And he writes that "all the great teachers -- Buddha, Lao-tse, St. Francis -- had set the perpetual pilgrimage at the heart of their message and told their disciples, literally, to follow The Way."
Sounding a lot like a flower child with a smattering of scholarly training, Chatwin is decidedly not at his best in this sort of theoretical writing. He debates the same points over and over again, makes questionable assertions ("The golden-brown babies of the Kalahari Bushmen hunters never cry and are among the most contented babies in the world") and allows his prose to devolve into odd, gnomic pronouncements ("I do not believe in any of the cyclical theories of decline, fall and rebirth"). The four fictional stories included in this volume are also slight -- at once predictable and contrived.
It is when Chatwin turns his hand to describing places and people that his gift for the telling detail really shines. As in earlier books, he introduces us to a motley group of individuals encountered through his travels and through his reading.
There's Nadezhda Mandelstam, dismissing the thrillers he has brought her and sneering: "Romans policiers! Next time, bring me some real trash!" There's the writer Curzio Malaparte, who was exiled to the island of Lipari for making anti-Fascist remarks, and who later built a stupendous villa that reproduced, "on his own grandiose terms, the conditions of his exile on Lipari." And there's Axel Munthe, a celebrated doctor and antiquarian, who worshiped the Roman Emperor Tiberius and decided he had to own 12 houses on the island of Capri, just as Tiberius had.
Chatwin is able, in a few paragraphs, to demonstrate the formative impact that Edinburgh had on the imagination of Robert Louis Stevenson. And he's similarly able to convey the mythic allure of the African town of Timbuktu, an unlovely and "tired caravan city" that lured European visitors for years as a magical source of gold, a place where white egrets roost in the acacias, the desert wind whips up the green waters of the river and the sky is a "thin hard blue."
In this essay, as in so much of his earlier writings, Chatwin conjures both cities: the real and the mythical, the city that exists in the unforgiving quadrants of geography and the city that exists only in the mind.

HEADLINE: Let Dole Cut Taxes and Exporters Do the Rest

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The naysayers have been having a field day bashing Bob Dole's embrace of so-called supply-side economics. Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., in "Dole's Supply-Side Delusion" (Op-Ed, Aug. 26), gives a cartoonlike description of Mr. Dole's proposed 15 percent tax cut. He hysterically contends that it will depress economic growth; lead to our financial dependence on foreign countries; force indefensible budget cuts that will destroy Federal agencies needed to enforce trade laws and, as a result, cause our exports to plummet to the rapidly growing Pacific Rim.
Such nonsense. 
 Economists like John B. Taylor, Martin Feldstein and George P. Shultz support Mr. Dole's proposals, recognizing that a 15 percent tax cut barely returns taxpayers to where they were before President Clinton's tax increase. They see the need for bold steps to yank our economy out of its sluggish growth.
It is wrong to allege that the Dole proposal will increase our dependence on foreign capital. By allowing Americans to keep more of what they earn, and by cutting inefficient Federal spending, we will substantially reduce the need to borrow from abroad. It is our very low savings rate that forces us to seek foreign financing. If we save more at home, we will not have to borrow abroad.
It is also wrong to claim that Mr. Dole's plan will decimate the agencies that enforce trade laws and will cause exports to plummet.
The problem in government is the overlap of responsibilities that too often destroys efficiency and accountability. For example, the General Accounting Office has warned that the Commerce Department, which has responsibility for enforcing laws prohibiting dumping by foreign companies and the granting of government subsidies to them, shares its missions with at least 71 departments, agencies and offices. Sixty percent of the department's resources go to activities unrelated to its mission. Trimming unnecessary activities from agencies enforcing our trade laws will make them more focused and accountable.
Over the past decade, the private sector has re-engineered itself to be leaner and far more competitive. It is time to carefully examine the public sector. It should be apparent to anyone who has served in government that we can have less redundancy and a better work product at a lower cost.
Mr. Dole's economic proposals will encourage growth, savings and government efficiency. Exporters will have more resources to compete in the global economy.
Remember: It is not Government agencies that make the United States the world's No. 1 exporter. It is the thousands of entrepreneurs -- small, medium and large -- who with 15 percent more of their earnings going to their bottom line can do even better.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Strong Data and Franc Rumors Leave Dollar Mostly Unchanged

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended little changed yesterday, after rising on unexpectedly strong American economic data that heightened expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates to prevent inflation.
A falling stock and bond market in the United States offset any help that the dollar received from the reports on sharply rising home sales and upward revisions of overall economic growth. 
 In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 108.30 Japanese yen, down from 108.42 yen on Wednesday, and at 1.4764 German marks, off a bit from 1.4765 marks. The British pound declined to $1.5575 from $1.5591.
The dollar rose in the morning on the strength of reports that sales of new homes jumped 7.9 percent in July, reaching the highest level in five months, and that the gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the second quarter, the highest in two years.
But the bounce was over by midday.
"The dollar failed in an attempt to rally off the stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data" that had led to fears of rising interest rates, said Margaret Kudarauskas, senior foreign exchange analyst at Technical Data. "This would normally benefit the dollar, but the steep selloff in U.S. asset markets -- most notably, the stock market -- has the dollar in check."
The dollar received some early support on speculation that the French central bank was intervening in the market to help the franc.
In addition, President Jacques Chirac reasserted France's ability to meet strict guidelines for entry into European monetary union.
As a result, the franc gained and the German mark weakened, indirectly bolstering the dollar.
"The French actions probably set the tone," Mike Malpede, senior foreign exchange analyst at the Refco Group Ltd., told the Reuters news agency. "It was an action to limit the mark's gains."

HEADLINE: Iran Helps Iraq Evade Oil Embargo, U.S. Asserts

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29

 BODY:
The United States has accused Iran of helping smuggle refined oil products out of Iraq in violation of the United Nations sanctions by forging shipping manifests and allowing barges and small boats to ply its coastal waters.
American officials leveled the accusations in New York on Wednesday at a meeting of the United Nations committee overseeing the sanctions imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990. The committee asked the United States to put the charges in writing. 
 If Iran is implicated in violating the international embargo against Iraq, it could also face stiff punishment, including sanctions..
John R. Dinger, a State Department spokesman, said today that the United States had "compelling evidence" that Iranians were involved in the smuggling, including members of the Revolutionary Guards, the elite troops closely tied to Iran's Islamic leaders.
Mr. Dinger said that members of the guards provided bogus documents to ship captains, declaring that cargos of Iraqi oil products like gasoline were loaded in Iranian, not Iraqi ports. In exchange, the guards collected large fees.
The vessels, often tugboats pulling barges or other smaller ships, then traveled in Iran's territorial waters along the coast, allowing them to slip past the multinational fleet that patrols the Persian Gulf.
Iran's delegate to the United Nations, Kamal Kharazi, denied that Teheran had circumvented the international sanctions against Iraq, calling the accusations "part of Washington's anti-Iran propaganda," according to Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency. He said that, on the contrary, Iran had tightened its coastal patrols to enforce the sanctions against Iraq.
Iran's relations with Iraq have been troubled, with new confrontations flaring up periodically since the end of the eight-year war between the two countries in the 1980's. Today, Iraq accused Iran of sending troops into northern Iraq, apparently to strike at Iranian Kurdish guerrillas based there.
But in its desperation to raise money Iraq has offered lucrative incentives, officials said, not only for the Revolutionary Guards, but also for ship captains and other smugglers willing to take the risk of loading oil in Iraqi ports. These officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Iranians were making a greater profit on each shipment than the Iraqis.
The charges against Iran are unlikely to affect the recent agreement between Iraq and the United Nations to sell $2 billion worth of oil twice a year to buy food and medicine, officials said.
They acknowledged that they did not have a precise estimate of the amount of oil that may have been smuggled out of Iraq, but they insisted it was considerable. From 1992 to 1994, Iraq tried to ship oil in large tankers, but the international naval force largely choked off that route, leaving open only coastal waters.
"It's hard to interdict any of this stuff," one official said.
The United States has accused Iran of complicity in breaking the embargo on Iraq before. In February, it brought similar charges to the United Nations, but the sanctions committee did not act. Mr. Dinger said that the smuggling aboard smaller boats began in 1995 and increased significantly this year.
The new accusations appeared to be an effort to step up pressure and embarrass Iran into stopping the shipments. "We decided to raise it with the committee now," Mr. Dinger said, "because it shows no signs of abating."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Fall in Price

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities tumbled yesterday on the unexpected strength of the latest economic statistics, which heightened investor fears that inflation would accelerate, forcing the Fed to tighten monetary policy soon.
The 30-year bond dropped 22/32 , to a price of 9615/32 ; the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 7.03 percent, from 6.98 percent on Wednesday. What perhaps bothered the bulls most yesterday were signs that the expected slowdown for the third quarter may not materialize. 
 The Commerce Department revised the second quarter's gross domestic product gain sharply upward, to 4.8 percent from 4.2 percent. Moreover, surprisingly strong housing sales in July, up 7.9 percent, to an annualized rate of 783,000 units, almost certainly shocked market participants who were looking for signs of moderation in the wake of the strong G.D.P. revision.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said that "the economic statistics released today reaffirmed the economy's bouyancy." He added, "Initial claims for unemployment insurance are still relatively low despite recent modest increases in both the weekly numbers and the four-week averages, second-quarter G.D.P. growth proved to be even stronger than initially reported, and new-home sales noticeably exceeded even the highest expectations."
Mr. Fine said that "the downward revision to business inventories increases the chances that third-quarter G.D.P. growth, while more moderate than the April-to-June period, will also exceed the Federal Reserve's trend rate of maximum, noninflationary growth, which implies a continued bias toward tightening on the part of both the Federal Open Market Committee and the bond market."
The open market committee, the Fed panel that sets interest rate policy, last met on Aug. 20 and chose not to raise rates. But its next meeting is set for Sept. 24, and it is possible, though highly unlikely, that the committee could opt to shift rates even before then if other data are strong enough to alarm the central bank.
 According to Maureen Mooney, a market analyst with Gov Px, a bond pricing service, activity was average after deducting the volume of trading in 14-day cash management bills that were auctioned yesterday.
The Government was selling $30 billion of the short-term bills to bridge a brief shortfall in cash flow expected in September. Dealers said the average rate at auction was 5.24 percent and the bid-to-cover ratio, a low 2 to 1, which reflected the weakness in the market generated by fears that the Fed would raise rates soon.
Selling did quicken in the afternoon, but some traders suspect that investors who held long positions took advantage of some index-fund buying by portfolio managers to get out on an uptick after the recent price declines in the market. And because of the thinness in volume, price movements were exaggerated.
Today, the Treasury market will have an abbreviated session and close early. Thus, with a shortened session and long weekend ahead of next week's employment report, few traders yesterday were willing to be buyers.
Mr. Fine said that perhaps the bigger surprise was the jump in July new-home sales, which nearly matches the high for the year that was seen in February.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 14-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: Doris Rosenblum, 71, Borough Historian and Community Advocate

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Doris Rosenblum, an indefatigable combatant in 40 years of struggle over housing, education and development on Manhattan's Upper West Side, died of cancer yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 71.
Ms. Rosenblum served for the last six years as the borough historian of Manhattan, and her positions of civic authority included her job as district manager of Community Board 7 on the Upper West Side from 1983 to 1990. But the impact of the woman who came to embody neighborhood advocacy in New York City extended far beyond that conferred by official titles. 
 Ruth Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, said in an interview yesterday that "she was and always will be remembered as the Mayor of the Upper West Side."
Ms. Rosenblum was so deeply involved in the affairs of her neighborhood -- from the decentralization of authority over the public schools in the 1960's to the development battles of the 1980's -- that many people regarded her as an irreplaceable force.
"She is as much a part of the West Side as the No. 2 train," Ronnie Eldridge, the City Council member, said when Ms. Rosenblum retired from Community Board 7 in 1990.
Born June 30, 1925, on Manhattan's Lower East Side, and raised in the South Bronx, she first engaged the political establishment of the Upper West Side when she moved there in 1959 with her husband, Paul, a printer for The New York Times and a scholar in African history.
Within months of her arrival, she began investigating conditions in her children's public school, joined and was elected president of the neighborhood branch of the United Parents Association and led a campaign for smaller schools under greater neighborhood control. That culminated in 1971 when she was part of the group that founded the first alternative high school on the Upper West Side, the West Side High School.
Ms. Rosenblum's most far-reaching impact may have been in her fight to maintain housing for low-income and middle-income people amid the massive urban renewal projects, including Mitchell-Lama apartments and public housing that were built on the Upper West Side during the 1960's and 1970's.
"She always wanted to make sure that urban renewal was not urban removal," her husband said. Ms. Rosenblum's base of influence included the Strycker's Bay Neighborhood Council, where she served as a board member and president, and later Community Board 7, where she became a member in 1971.
After 12 years as a board member, she was appointed district manager of the board in 1983, making her a central mediator, fact finder and advocate at a time when the Upper West Side was awash in huge development plans. Until 1990, when she resigned, she coordinated neighborhood opposition to several projects, including huge developments planned for the site of the New York Coliseum and Donald Trump's Riverside South property.
Ms. Rosenblum was appointed as the official historian of Manhattan -- a voluntary post -- by Ms. Messinger in 1990.
In addition to her husband, Ms. Rosenblum is survived by her mother, Fannie Koppelman of Manhattan; a daughter, Beth, of Ashland, Mass., and a brother, Frank, of Queens. Her son, Peter, was killed in an auto accident in 1981.

HEADLINE: Stocks Post Biggest Loss In Six Weeks

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Stocks tumbled yesterday in their worst loss in six weeks after a surprisingly strong report on new-home sales renewed concern that in a buoyant economy borrowing costs could rise, cutting industry's profits.
The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 64.73 points, to 5,647.65, tracking bonds lower. Procter & Gamble, General Electric and Walt Disney led the decline. 
 Single-family home sales "is one of the areas people are counting on to see a slowdown, and you're just not seeing it," said Alan Wapnick, a money manager at the Lexington Management Corporation, which oversees $3 billion in assets. The economy "isn't going to be quite as weak as the Fed might want it to be," he said, and that could prompt it to raise interest rates.
Beverage and drug companies paced the slide in the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index for a second day; their earnings do not benefit from pickups in the economy as much as industries like chemicals, steel and home building. The S.& P. 500 fell 7.41, to 657.40, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 8.85, to 1,145.03. The Commerce Department said sales of new homes unexpectedly surged in July to the highest level since February. That came on top of a report that revised second-quarter economic growth to a 4.8 percent annual rate, its strongest showing in two years.
Short-term interest rates, a gauge of the market's expectations about Fed policy changes, jumped. The yield on the two-year Treasury bill rose almost 7 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 6.23 percent. Higher rates hurt stocks by raising borrowing costs and making bonds relatively more attractive as an investment. The yield on the 30-year bond rose 5 basis points, to 7.03 percent.
Particularly hard-hit yesterday were soft drink and pharmaceutical shares that had moved up lately, trading at high price/earnings ratios.
Coca-Cola slid 1/2, to 50 3/4. Its shares trade at 36.4 times estimated earnings for 1996, compared with 18.9 times profits for the average S.& P. 500 stock.
"I have to take a second look when Coke is selling at a higher multiple than Microsoft," said Edward Laux, director of trading at the Chicago Corporation in New York.
Microsoft, which grew at twice the rate of Coke in the last 12 months, trades at 30.8 times earnings for the fiscal year that began in June. It gave up 1 1/2 yesterday, closing at 124 1/8.
Pfizer, which trades at 24.4 times estimated earnings, retreated 7/8, to 72 5/8. Merck & Company sank 7/8, to 66 7/8.
Procter & Gamble dropped 1 7/8, to 89 7/8, General Electric slid 1 7/8, to 84 1/2 and Disney fell 1 3/8, to 57.
Investors made Pepsico Inc. the second-most actively traded stock after Goldman, Sachs & Co. removed the drink, snack and restaurateur from its "recommended list." Two days earlier Merrill Lynch & Company cut the company's earnings forecast for 1996 and 1997. It fell 1 1/8, to 28 7/8, bringing its loss this week to 7.9 percent.
Financial shares declined, with J. P. Morgan & Company falling 3/4, to 88 3/8, and the Chase Manhattan Corporation slipping 1 1/4, to 75 7/8.
Novell Inc., the faltering computer-network builder, dropped 3/8, to 10 5/8, following the resignation of R. J. Frankenberg, the company's chief executive, chairman and president. John Young, a board member and former chief executive at the Hewlett-Packard Company, was named chairman, and Joseph Marengi was named president. Novell said it would begin searching for a chief executive.
Housecall Medical Resources Inc. sank by more than half after the home health-care provider said it would report a loss in the fiscal fourth quarter. Its shares slid 7 3/8, to 7 1/8.
Among companies that rose, Sierra Semiconductor jumped 2 1/8, to 11 3/8, after the company said it would sell its modem chip line, a sign of a shakeout in that industry.
Structural Dynamics gained 2 3/4, to 25 3/8, after the Ford Motor Company said that it would use the company's software around the globe to test its cars on the computer. The order could be worth $200 million over five years.
In perhaps another sign of a bouyant economy, the Starbucks Corporation, the specialty coffee retailer that sells $3 Frappachinos, said same-store sales rose 9 percent in August.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Giuliani, Playing to the Bleacher Seats, Boycotts Tennis Open

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is an ardent fan of the New York Yankees who often uses his bully pulpit to give the kind of workaday analysis on the team's games that might be heard over beers at a dusky corner bar. But lately, the Mayor has voiced little love for another local sporting institution, the United States Open in Queens, portraying its sponsors as haughty and meddlesome.
Yesterday, he even announced that he was boycotting the Open, which has long been one of the city's premier summer attractions. 
 The Mayor insisted that he liked tennis (though perhaps not as much as his beloved baseball), and he said he was basing his criticism on what he contended were flaws in the contract that his predecessor, David N. Dinkins, negotiated with the United States Tennis Association, which runs the Open.
Yet his comments also seemed directed at working-class neighborhoods that have long complained about the traffic and crowds that clog Queens during the tournament, people who may feel that the city cares more about an event that draws an affluent audience than their peace and quiet.
These are people who tended to back Mr. Giuliani in his narrow victory in 1993 and whose support he will need for his re-election campaign next year. They are the stickball vote -- like the Mayor himself, they are probably more comfortable wielding a bat (or a broomstick) than a tennis racket.
On Wednesday night, Mr. Giuliani brought up the United States Open even before he was asked about it during a meeting of the First New York Conservative Democratic Club in Forest Hills, Queens.
As he has repeatedly done this week, he assailed a provision in the contract that requires the city to limit noise at the tournament by insuring that the Federal Aviation Administration shifts airplane flights away from the airspace above the National Tennis Center, which is in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. The provision also requires the city to pay a fine if too many planes broach the airspace.
The Mayor said those rules, negotiated by Mr. Dinkins, usurped the city's authority, endangered air safety and caused more noise over residential neighborhoods. "Airplanes should not be rerouted because tennis players and tennis spectators don't want to be bothered," he said.
The line garnered hearty applause -- even though the Federal Aviation Administration has said the flight patterns during the tournament are not risky.
Arlene Salac, a spokeswoman for the agency, said it had used the alternate routes for 30 years without major problems. She said that during the Open last year, the F.A.A. shifted about 2,800 out of 11,000 flights in and out of La Guardia Airport.
Mr. Giuliani no doubt remembers that his erstwhile rival, Mr. Dinkins, who was not particularly popular in those same neighborhoods, was a fervent tennis aficionado. When he was Mayor, Mr. Dinkins took vacation in August to attend the Open.
Mr. Giuliani, on the other hand, appears eager to cultivate an image of a man who would wear all-white clothing only if it had pinstripes. "I might not be able to afford the new prices," he said at his news conference yesterday when asked about why he was not attending the tournament.
Tournament officials said ticket prices had not increased this year, but they would rise next year, particularly for luxury boxes.
Reached yesterday at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Mr. Dinkins sounded exasperated by Mr. Giuliani's attacks. He defended the contract with the tennis association, saying that the Open would provide the city with more than $100 million in economic activity this year.
Mr. Dinkins also questioned why Mr. Giuliani had been largely silent about the tournament in Mr. Giuliani's first two years in office. Mr. Giuliani did make an issue of the contract during the mayoral campaign in 1993.
"It has to be illogical for him to have this tremendous bias against tennis," Mr. Dinkins said. "We don't find him reacting against baseball, basketball, football or hockey in the same way that he reacts against tennis. He seems not to understand and appreciate its value."
Mr. Giuliani surely realizes that his criticism has little chance of prompting the Open to leave the city because the tennis association signed a 25-year lease in 1993. For their part, tennis association officials did not seem interested in doing battle.
"We have a big tournament to run, the biggest tennis tournament in the world, so we really are not going to respond to the Mayor's comments," said Page D. Crosland, a spokeswoman for the association.
Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that he would not attend the tournament until the tennis association agreed to remove the provision on airspace from its contract with the city.
He and his aides said he had been to the tournament many times, but not since he took office.
And then, as he has so often during his tenure, he ended his news conference with a brief analysis of the Yankees' recent performance -- or in this case, failures.
"I was very upset last night about the Yankees losing the second game in Seattle," he said. "I am starting to get worried, but they have such good starting pitchers, and I think that they will start to kick in."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
I.M.F. May Sell Gold to Cut Debt Load of Poor

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund has indicated for the first time that it may be willing to sell some of its $40 billion supply of gold and use the proceeds as an outright gift to reduce the foreign debts of the poorest developing countries, allowing them to improve economic growth and attract more foreign investment.
This is one of several concessions that the I.M.F. and the World Bank have made to critics, who regard their March debt reduction plan to make concessional loans as still being too onerous for the poor. The new plan was sent in confidential, outline form to member governments this week; it will be discussed by the executive boards of both institutions next month. 
 Officials say it is still unclear whether this debt-reduction initiative -- first called for by the Group of Seven leading industrial nations at a summit meeting in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1995 -- will be approved, as had been hoped, at this year's ministerial meetings of the World Bank and the I.M.F. in Washington at the end of September. It is expected to cost between $5.6 billion and $7.7 billion over six years.
Although the United States favors gold sales to finance debt relief, other Western industrial countries, which control both institutions, remain divided over the wisdom of allowing the I.M.F. to sell any of its gold when it has some $30 billion in outstanding loan commitments to Russia and Mexico. Germany leads the opposition, and is supported by Italy, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden.
In addition, officials say the so-called Paris Club of Western creditor nations is proving slow to heed a call in June by the Group of Seven at a summit meeting in Lyons, France, to raise the level of forgiveness offered qualifying poor countries to 90 percent of their direct debts from 67 percent.
World Bank officials who returned this week from talks with the Paris Club secretariat say the creditors have done little so far to prepare the groundwork for a more generous treatment of debtors, despite the personal commitment of President Jacques Chirac of France.
"This whole debt initiative is in danger of ending up as an empty charade if there is not a rapid agreement on I.M.F. gold sales and more generous Paris Club terms," said Justin Forsyth, Washington director of Oxfam International, a privately financed aid agency lobbying for debt relief for the poorest nations.
The World Bank and the I.M.F. have proposed that about 20 of the poorest countries, whose debts exceed a range of 200 to 250 percent of their annual export earnings, should qualify for relief under the plan, provided they take steps to strengthen their economies. Among these countries are Zaire, Mozambique, Bolivia, Nicaragua and Uganda.
As an illustration of the hardship imposed by high debt burdens, Oxfam International has calculated that Uganda spends $17 per person on debt repayment annually but only $3 on health care. Such heavy obligations crush economic growth and deter foreign companies from investing.
In the latest version of the debt-relief plan, I.M.F. documents say that the agency is ready to use the proceeds of a gold sale to make "loans or grants" to eligible developing countries so they can pay off some of the money they owe it, signifying that the institution is no longer insisting that poor nations repay the help it gives them.
Previously the I.M.F., which all along has taken a more cautious approach to debt relief than the World Bank, wanted to extend low-interest 10-year loans to eligible countries. But critics complained that this would merely add to the developing world's debt burden instead of reducing it.
The World Bank has already put aside $500 million from last year's profit as its first annual contribution to a trust fund it plans to create to relieve eligible countries of debt. Both the World Bank and the I.M.F. insist, in effect, on paying themselves back the money the poor nations owe them, instead of writing it off, because as a matter of principle, they refuse to forgive debts.
To qualify for relief, developing countries would still generally be required to undertake three years of economic liberalization intended to make them more competitive, after which they would be eligible for forgiveness of up to 67 percent of their debts to the Paris Club countries, followed by a further three years of economic liberalization.
After that, the I.M.F. and the World Bank would offer relief and the Paris Club would raise its forgiveness level to 90 percent.
But in answer to critics who complained that six years was too long for these poor nations to wait for help, the revised plan provides for countries like Uganda, which are already making good progress in improving their economies, to move straight into the second stage of the process -- thus becoming eligible for full debt relief by the year 2000.
The new proposal is also more generous toward countries on the borderline of eligibility for debt relief.
And the World Bank and the I.M.F. spell out clearly that developing nations seeking to make their economies more efficient, under their supervision, will also be expected to meet social targets in areas like health care, the reduction of poverty, and education.

HEADLINE: Bulldozers In Camden Make Room for Affordable Homes

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J., Aug. 29

 BODY:
Workers began demolishing an entire block of abandoned, dilapidated brick town houses today as part of the Whitman administration's first major effort to help build affordable housing in this impoverished city on the Delaware River.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman climbed into a front loader to help knock down the first of 35 city-owned buildings on Washington Street that have been empty for more than a decade. Mrs. Whitman said the demolition would not only pave the way for construction of new row houses, but also help rid the neighborhood of drug dealers who had been operating out of the abandoned buildings. 
 "By sending these machines into action, we are clearing the way for a rebirth of this historic city," Mrs. Whitman said. "Where there are crack houses, there will be family homes. Where there are dangerous streets, there will be safe communities."
Governor Whitman, who has been accused of paying too little attention to the state's cities, said she had done more to spur economic development in urban areas than previous governors. She also dismissed criticism by affordable-housing advocates that she has not provided additional state money to create more such housing statewide. The Governor earlier this year rejected a legislative proposal for a $290 million bond act to help finance new and rehabilitated housing. Mrs. Whitman said the state had enough resources to do the job.
State and local officials estimate that there are more than 3,000 vacant houses in Camden, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent and more than half of the city's 87,000 residents receive some form of government assistance. State, city and business leaders have been struggling over different plans to help revitalize the city.
While Mayor Arnold W. Webster has had his differences with the Whitman administration, he praised the project and the administration's plans to help finance the construction of 30 new row houses on the site. "I have to take a positive approach to this," Mr. Webster said. "It is going to be a shot in the arm for us."
Jane M. Kenny, the State Commissioner of Community Affairs, said the town houses, built in 1880, were in such disrepair that it was cheaper to demolish than to renovate them. She said they would be replaced with new three-bedroom row houses that are to be completed next September and then sold to low- and moderate-income families for between $50,000 and $70,000. The state intends to demolish an additional 20 buildings in the coming year in Camden, and replace them with new construction. The total cost of the project is about $6 million. The state has provided financing to help create approximately 90 new housing units in Camden in the last two years, state officials said.
The Rev. Paul J. Breslin, pastor of a nearby Roman Catholic church, St. Anthony of Padua, and a founder of Camden Churches Organized for the People, has been urging the Whitman administration to do something about vacant buildings here. He praised the demolition project, but he said he hoped the state would help renovate vacant houses on blocks where families are now living. "That is what we are looking for and they seem supportive of that," Father Breslin said.
Esther Lopez, 26, who stood on a corner with her five small children watching the demolition begin, said she was glad that the buildings were being taken down. "A lot of drug dealers have been going in and out of there," she said. "They find a lot of dead bodies in there."
But Ms. Lopez added that her calls to city officials to do something about the four vacant houses on her nearby block have gone unanswered. "It is really bad," she said. "There are drug dealers in there and then they sit on the stoop all night. I can't let the kids out to play because they find needles and things."

HEADLINE: Robert Reinhold, Ex-Reporter For The Times, Is Dead at 54

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
Robert Reinhold, an editorial writer at The Los Angeles Times and before that a longtime reporter for The New York Times, died on Wednesday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 54.
The cause was complications of a brain tumor, said Dr. Timothy Cloughsey, a neuro-oncologist at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center. 
 Mr. Reinhold left The New York Times in January 1994 after a 30-year career that included stints as a science writer and bureau assignments in Boston, Washington, Houston and Los Angeles. He covered the world of ideas from Boston and urban affairs and demographics in Washington; he was bureau chief in Houston and Los Angeles.
Along the way he developed a reputation as a fast, meticulous and insightful reporter with a cool, stylish presence, who became a role model for a generation of national correspondents.
Robert Reinhold was born on Dec. 18, 1941, in Brooklyn. He grew up in the Flatbush section near Brooklyn College where his father, Meyer Reinhold, taught classics.
After graduating from Midwood High School in Brooklyn, he won a scholarship to John Hopkins University, where he studied biology, chemistry and physics and became the editor in chief of the campus newspaper. While working on a master's degree in journalism at Columbia University, he was hired as a part-time copy boy at The New York Times in 1964.
He became a science reporter three years later and was one of the paper's most prolific writers from 1967 until 1994.
Mr. Reinhold's first out-of-town assignment set the tone for his career. Sent to the South Pole to cover scientific developments there, he soon tired of the V.I.P. treatment at the United States Navy operations center at McMurdo Station.
Equipped with tent, C-rations, ice ax, gas stove, fuel, two sleeping bags and a foam-rubber mattress, he ventured to a remote area he described as "one of Antarctica's three eerie, other-worldly valleys whose glaciers had melted away millenia ago, leaving jagged rocks and sand in their path." There he joined two puzzled American geologists from Wyoming studying mountain rock formations who never could figure out why a Times reporter wanted to join them in their frigid desolation.
In addition to his science articles, he filed an article on spending Christmas Day eating powdered mashed potatoes in the Antarctic and stopped off at Waikiki Beach on his way back home to New York.
Mr. Reinhold arrived in Texas near the peak of the state's economic boom of the 1970's and 80's and was ahead of virtually all his peers in foreseeing the bust when oil prices collapsed in 1985.
Typical of his reporting was a 4,000-word piece in The Times in September 1986 that was the first to report on the impending financial downfall of former Gov. John B. Connally of Texas, detailing everything down to the $899 queen-size rattan sleeper-sofa and $86 lamps for which Mr. Connally was overdue on payments to the Texana National Bank of Belton.
"Connally is the story of Texas, a state that bet too heavily on itself, believing it could not lose," he wrote.
Similarly, Mr. Reinhold went to California just as the sun-kissed California myth was giving way to a harsher reality of urban unrest and natural disaster. His articles there went from the San Francisco earthquake in 1989 to issues of immigration, water policy and the economic complexities of the state's conversion from the military-based economy of the cold war to one based on peacetime spending.
With characteristic precision, a year after the riots that followed the state acquittal of the police officers who beat Rodney G. King, he surveyed records and buildings for 1,118 structures damaged in the riots and found that 513 had been repaired, with the lowest rate of repairs in the largely black and Hispanic South-Central area.
And while Mr. Reinhold was best known for tough, analytical news reporting, a ferocious work schedule and an uncanny knack for getting to disasters sooner than anyone else, he was also known for his style. Indeed, with his Armani suits and Gucci shoes, his measured subdued style and air of perpetual calm, Mr. Reinhold was a stark contrast to most of his rumpled, harried peers running around with their coffee-stained ties askew.
He often betrayed a softer side of his personality in articles for The Times's Travel section.
Writing of Hilo, Hawaii, where he said, it rains 280 days a year, roughly 130 inches, he blended his usual precision with a wry eye, reporting, "Hilo seems stuck in time, a throwback to Hawaii's plantation days, when the islands were merely a quiet territory of the United States and when the economy was based more on growing sugar cane and pineapple than on catering to Japanese tourists in search of such typical Hawaiian handicrafts as Gucci luggage and Rolex watches."
And reminiscing in 1993 about hitchhiking through Europe as a young man 30 years earlier, he concluded: "Now I stay in comfortable hotels and eat in good restaurants when I travel. But I often long for those days when riding through Sicily under fleecy clouds in the open bed of a cheese truck was a sublime experience and the small pleasures were enough."
In addition to his father, he is survived by a sister, Helen Barrett, of Nashville, and his companion, Michael R. Mueller, of Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: Democrats Bring a Fleeting Sense of Peace to a Neighborhood

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 29

 BODY:
Now that James Jackson has tasted life for a couple of weeks without drive-by shootings and brazen drug dealers on every corner, he never wants the Democratic National Convention to leave town.
Mr. Jackson, a lanky 17-year-old, lives in the Henry Horner Homes, part of the other America just two blocks from where the Democrats are holding their convention on Chicago's West Side. 
 "It's been real peaceful around here," Mr. Jackson said today, the last day of the four-day convention. "All the drug dealers got scared off by all the police. But they'll be back, and all the killing will start up again. Probably by Saturday."
Horner is a place where people do not have much beyond their pride and poverty, where the Boys and Girls Club has to close down sometimes because of gunfire. It is the kind of place that the party of Kennedy and Johnson is supposed to care about. And indeed, the city's Democratic administration has been pouring millions into the neighborhood for new roads, lights and other improvements, and has ambitious plans to redevelop Horner as a model of mixed-income and public housing. Private developers have also been rushing in with their money and dreams.
In the weeks leading up to the convention, the city's interest in the area accelerated. Old buildings were replaced with new playgrounds. Grass was planted, fences painted and hopes raised. Parts of the development went from dust bowl to green valley.
"We haven't had grass around here in 15 years," said Kenneth Butler, director of the Boys and Girls Club and a former Horner resident.
Although Mr. Butler, like many people here, is firmly committed to re-electing President Clinton, he says many are skeptical about whether the Democratic Party really cares about them.
"The joke around here," Mr. Butler said, "is that after the D.N.C. leaves, the city will take back the playground and roll up the grass."
Walking past the new playground, Kevin Johnson, 28 and unemployed, said his trust in Mr. Clinton had been badly shaken after the President signed the welfare overhaul bill. But he will vote for Mr. Clinton anyway because he said the Republicans were more hostile to poor black people like himself and his neighbors.
"It's a catch-22," Mr. Johnson said, shrugging his shoulders. "I'm voting for the lesser of two evils. I guess anyway it goes, we're going to lose."
A few blocks away, sitting in the sunshine with a group of friends, Jacqueline Williams, 44, said she has had voted Democratic her entire adult life but would sit this election out because she had heard too many promises but seen little improvement.
"I don't see any reason to vote," Ms. Williams said, adding that she was looking for work. "I don't see any reason to leave my house. We fought hard to get the vote, but it doesn't matter anymore. Politicians don't care about us."
Poor people on the city's West Side are used to losing their dreams. After Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in April 1968, much of the neighborhood was destroyed in the flames of rage and grief. Stores and apartment buildings were turned into vacant lots that remained vacant for more than two decades.
It was an isolated neighborhood, cut off from the rest of the city, except on the nights the Chicago Bulls or the Black Hawks played their games in the old Chicago Stadium, the Madhouse on Madison.
Now, new town houses, and restaurants are going up and abandoned buildings are being converted into expensive lofts. The stadium has been replaced by the shiny new United Center, the site of the Democratic convention.
"This was skid row for years and now it has really been turned around," said George Lemperis, owner of the Palace Grill, a longtime restaurant a few blocks from the United Center and Horner. The Palace seats 19 customers on stools and this week is featuring a Bill Clinton All You Can Eat Special for $9.99 -- steak, bacon, ham, eggs, sweet rolls, coffee, hash browns, onions, grits, pancakes and French toast.
The convention accelerated some cosmetic improvements to the area, but the neighborhood has been changing for years. In 1993, Bridget and Jim Davis, both 32, moved into a nearby loft. When they moved in, the area was quiet. Now it is hard to park.
Mrs. Davis said she would vote for Mr. Clinton. "He is the lesser of two evils," she said, sounding like her Horner neighbors.
How long the people of Horner will remain in the area is uncertain, many of them say. They say they are worried that they will be priced out just when the neighborhood is making a comeback and the Democrats are two streets away promising a better America for everyone "but us," said Rubin McClellan, 30.
"Before Michael Jordan came along and built that stadium over there, the city never thought about us," Mr. McClellan said, pointing to the United Center. "Now, they want to chase the black man out of here."
Residents have been told they can stay after the mixed-income housing is built, if they want to, which is exactly what Mamie Bone, president of the development's tenants council intends to do.
Mrs. Bone has lived in Horner for nearly 40 years and said she is thankful for all the improvements brought about by the convention.
"The place is clearer than it has been for years," she said. "The streets are swept every day. The police are all around. But I don't think it has made a big difference in the real conditions. People still have plumbing problems. We still need more security."
Misty Lenon, 31, the secretary at the Boys and Girls Club, has lived in the area all her life. The windows in her office have bullet holes. She, too, is happy the convention has come. She has not heard gunfire in weeks.
"I don't think all these improvements will continue after the Democrats leave," Ms. Lenon said. "It took for the convention to come for them to do anything. That hardens you. Just because we will live in the quote unquote ghetto, doesn't mean we shouldn't be treated like American citizens every single day of the year."

HEADLINE: Economy's Pace Gained Speed In 2d Quarter

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29

 BODY:
The Commerce Department reported today that the economy sprinted to an even bigger gain in the spring quarter than it had earlier estimated. The report, along with other data released today, suggested that an expected slowing of activity was eluding policy makers, rekindling financial markets' fears of higher interest rates.
Growth in total output of goods and services for the April-June period was calculated at at an annual rate of 4.8, six-tenths of a percentage point above the estimate published at the beginning of the month and the strongest since the spring of 1994. Moreover, the upward revision showed less production going into inventories and more of it to meet demand. 
 In a second report, the Government said sales of new single-family homes surged 7.8 percent in July, the most robust showing since February. This advance came despite mortgage rates that remain above 8 percent and, like the output figures, also surprised analysts, most of whom had expected a small decline in home sales.
"The economy still has a good deal of momentum," said Brian M. Jones, an economist at Salomon Brothers.
The unexpected strength rattled the bond market. Bond prices tumbled on revived fears that the Federal Reserve would not be able to avoid a decision to tighten monetary policy to prevent a flare-up of inflation. The next scheduled meeting of the Fed's main policy body is Sept. 24; minutes of its July meeting published last Friday showed it had decided to lean in the direction of raising short-term rates.
The slump in prices drove up the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a benchmark for mortgages and other consumer and corporate interest rates -- to 7.03 percent, from 6.98 percent on Wednesday. Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions.
Stocks followed bond prices lowers on fears that higher rates would raise borrowing costs and cut into profits. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 64.73 points, or 1.13 percent, to 5,647.65, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 8.85 points, or nearly eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,145.03.
A third report, covering last week, showed today that first-time claims for unemployment insurance edged up 4,000, to a total of 331,000. This continued a recent pattern of job-market strength but closely matched expectations. Some analysts are predicting that the Labor Department's monthly gleaning of labor-market data, to be published Sept. 6, will show that the nation's unemployment fell in August to 5.2 percent, which would be the lowest in more than six years.
The Clinton Administration, facing a Presidential challenge from Bob Dole, who has centered his campaign on calls for faster economic growth, was quick to hail the surprising, though not unusually large, upward revision in gross domestic product.
Joseph E. Stiglitz, the President's chief economic adviser, declared the G.D.P. report "strengthens our view that the United States economy is achieving the kind of strong economic growth that can raise America's living standards." He added that the downward revision of inventories combined with upward revisions for final sales and business investment in plant and equipment "provide additional signs that the prospects for further strong economic growth in the future are excellent."
By this he was pointing out that when shelves and warehouses are thinly stocked -- and much of the second-quarter increase was concentrated in motor vehicles -- demand is quickly transmitted to new production.
The biggest single factor in the revision was international trade, which was less of a drag because import growth was lower than initially assumed.
But the slowing of imports, as Merrill Lynch analysts noted today, is not a sign of economic strength. Nor is inventory buildup, however moderate. And the second-quarter growth rate also benefited, by about a percentage point, from the way the Government chose to account for last winter's partial shutdown of the Government, for which its workers were paid.
For these and other reasons analysts seemed to be sticking today with forecasts for marked slowing in the third quarter, with Merrill Lynch holding to a 2 to 2 1/2 percent rate of increase. This is in line with assessments, including the Federal Reserve's, that the economy can grow that much without accelerating inflation.
Still, after a string of figures pointing to a cooling off, perhaps partly because the Olympic Games kept many shoppers at home, some of the most recent figures cast doubt on this hope. One was last week's report of very strong orders for long-lived factory goods in July. Another was today's report from the Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development that builders sold single-family homes at an annual rate of 783,000 last month, up from 726,000 in June.
"The housing market is stubbornly strong," said Alan D. Levenson, an economist at UBS Securities in New York. He nevertheless predicted that the economy would throttle down to a 2 percent pace in the current quarter and that the Fed would not need to move rates higher.
The rise in home sales included sizable gains in all four regions of the country other than the Northeast, where activity remained at the best level of the year while showing no further rise.
At month's end, builders had 365,000 unsold houses, 2,000 more than in June but only a 5.8-month supply at the latest selling rate instead of 6.1 months.
Sales have now surpassed 700,000 for seven consecutive months, the first time this has happened in 10 years, said Ed Yardeni, economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell/C. J. Lawrence. Sales for April, May and June, however, were revised downward by a combined 70,000, the report also showed.
The median sales price of new houses sold last month was $143,000, up from $140,000 in June and up from $131,000 in July 1995.
The G.D.P. report disclosed that inflation, as gauged by the price index for gross domestic purchases, ran at a 2.1 percent pace in the spring quarter, one-tenth of a point higher than previously estimated.
Corporate profits, estimated by the department for the first time, slackened during the quarter. Profits from current production advanced 1.3 percent following a 5.4 percent first-quarter increase, while current-production cash flow rose 1.1 percent, compared with a 2.5 percent advance in the winter quarter.

HEADLINE: Sorry, We're All Out Of Great Merchants;
Changes in Retailing Are Shrinking the Pool Of Trend Setters

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
When Sally Frame Kasaks, the chief executive of beleaguered Ann Taylor Stores, resigned last week, what was most surprising was not so much that she was pushed out after more than a year of slow sales. Rather, it was just how few names came up as her possible replacement.
Instead of the dozens of merchants -- those executives charged with choosing the store's goods -- who would have quickly emerged as strong candidates for the job only a few years ago, experts in retailing say that today the most frequent answer to the question, "Who's next?" is "Who knows?" 
 "I have not come up with a single person who could replace Sally," Walter Loeb, a retail consultant, said. "It has to be a person who has the excitement and the leadership and the fire in the belly, and a lot of people fail to meet the test of a great merchant today."
Ms. Kasaks, who just two years ago was considered one of the best merchants in women's mainstream apparel, will be succeeded as chief executive by J. Patrick Spainhour, her former chief operating officer. His background is financial -- not creative -- and his appointment still leaves Ms. Kasaks's chief merchant's spot unfilled.
The reasons for the decline of great merchants, analysts say, are many -- ranging from the blossoming role of computer spreadsheets in decision making to an increase in off-shore apparel purchasing to the decline of the family store. And perhaps most important, they say, is the consolidation of the department store business, which historically provided the training grounds for the great merchants, a role that has all but evaporated.
The consequence is that there are precious few executives, say many in the industry, who can carry the torch of the great founders of American merchandising -- people like Adam Gimbel, Stanley Marcus and Mary Ann Magnin, whose names were over the front door. Nor are there any big stars on the horizon like those who emerged in recent decades from department store training schools and now head their own retail concerns -- people like Allen I. Questrom, chairman of Federated Department Stores; Leslie H. Wexner, who now runs the Limited; Millard S. Drexler, chief executive of Gap Inc., and Rose Marie Bravo, president of Saks Fifth Avenue.
"In my mind, this is a huge issue in our industry that none of us are addressing," said Kirk Palmer, who runs his own retail-executive search firm. "There is not a pipeline to develop talent anymore, and when companies go looking for a chief merchant, there is no one there to replace them."
As a result, the excitement in retailing has shifted away from the traditional stores. Mr. Drexler of the Gap breathed new life into the chain by offering colorful basic fashions to all ages. Gordon Segal brought buying smarts to the housewares business at Crate and Barrel, a unit of Euromarket Designs. Phil Knight, the chairman of Nike, has moved from selling running shoes to creating new lines of athletic wear to opening his huge Nike Town emporiums. And clothing designers like Calvin Klein, Giorgio Armani, and Donna Karan have gone into the business of opening their own stores.
Among retailers, special wrath is held for Wall Street, where the desire for little more than a rich bottom line and expansive growth plans has made creativity take a back seat to ledgers. Wall Street executives who have been content to wear the same three colors for the last century, do not want to hear complicated explanations of why ostrich-skin suits failed to fly out of the stores.
"You have to satisfy your owners, your numbers crunchers," Mr. Loeb, the consultant, said, adding that financial professionals and merchants rarely share the same temperament or objectives. "And merchants are by their nature optimistic and emotional."
For instance, retailers now tend to treat deals with suppliers as pure transactions -- bargaining over, say, who will take the hit on unanticipated losses or how to split the advertising budget -- rather than as opportunities to develop a standout line of clothing.
All too many merchants, critics say, are no longer creators focused on ferreting out the next Armani but nerdy bean counters who have replaced hype with Hewlett-Packard calculators. Fiscal conservatism in retail, they argue, has all but eliminated the kind of merchant who not only knew in his heart that fur could sell in August but who could also make it happen.
Consider Stanley Marcus, the model of the old school merchant who is chairman emeritus and son of the founder of Neiman Marcus, now a unit of Harcourt General. Early in his career, Mr. Marcus recalled in a recent interview, he was admiring a magnolia tree on a street in Dallas. "I thought: 'It would be great to create a series of clothes that looked like that tree,' " he said. "Clothes that gave you the green of the leaf and the warm brown of the underside of that leaf and the vanilla colored blossom."'
Inspired, Mr. Marcus enlisted designers to made silk dresses and jackets, then managed to sell them with great fanfare at his Dallas department store.
Jump to 1991, during an exchange between Lisa Holland-Nelson, then an executive at the clothier Evan Picone, and a room full of retail merchants who had come to see her spring line.
"They came in, sat down, and never looked up," said Ms. Holland-Nelson, now a principal at Apparel Resource Group, a consulting firm. Instead, she said, the buyers were feverishly punching away on their laptop computers. "I realized that my business was in trouble in that moment," Ms. Holland-Nelson said, "because merchandising had moved from the gut to the numbers. Units and dollars had taken over."
Indeed, clear cultural and economic shifts have whittled away at some of the glamour of merchandising.
Many of the earliest American merchant stars were immigrants from Europe, often Jews who only had limited opportunities in most types of business. They started with pushcarts or a single family store, which, through sheer discipline and touches of kookiness, sometimes became an empire.
In 1888, Mary Ann Magnin turned her home embroidery business into an I. Magnin store on Market Street in San Francisco, where she trained her sons. In his book, "Merchant Princes" (Kondansha America, 1979), Leon Harris describes how Mrs. Magnin forced her son Grover to stand with his hands behind his back to learn to identify different types of lace by touch alone.
P. G. Winnett, who ran Bullocks Wilshire in Los Angeles, came up with the bright idea in 1928 of employing highly specialized merchants. He hired a merchant just to select men's robes, and when that succeeded, hired another to focus just on silk robes.
"He figured that a buyer who had nothing else to do but dream about robes," Mr. Marcus said, "would develop a better business then one who bought socks and shirts and something else."
Even during the Depression, the merchants who created the great stores that later dominated the postwar era were encouraged not to think about the bottom line. Extra money was squirreled away so that harebrained schemes could be tried without worrying about the risk of failure. Innovative offerings drew traffic, the thinking went, and traffic eventually drove sales.
Such freewheeling ways withered away in the late 1980's, as the wave of department store mergers left the survivors with huge debt obligations, not just shelves, to fill. The consolidation also led to much greater centralization of buying.
All this, industry insiders say, helps explain why so many department stores seem so dull and interchangeable. "A lot of department stores have similar merchandise today," Peter Rizzo, the executive vice president and general merchandise manager for Barneys New York, said, "because the senior executives do not take aesthetic control of the product the way they take financial control."
As the local department stores with individual character, like Abraham & Straus in Brooklyn and Marshall Field's in Chicago, died or were absorbed into national operations, they no longer were in a position to provide the long, specialized training that encouraged future executives to learn every facet of the business.
"Executive development got a bad name," said Henry Jackson, a retail investment banker at the Peter J. Solomon Company in New York. "It was a 50's kind of concept. People didn't want to go from picking up pins off the floor to moving into the executive suite."
A.& S. raised a whole group of important current retail executives. "You had a great sense of stability at A.& S.," said Michael Gould, chief executive of Bloomingdale's, who like Mr. Drexler of the Gap and Mr. Questrom of Federated is one of the A.& S. alumni. "People didn't go to other jobs back then. You got great responsibility at an early age."
The spread of overseas buying, while adding enormous economic benefits to retailers, has also contributed to the erosion of the intimate relationship between merchants and their vendors. Just a few decades ago, it was common for suppliers to drop in on buyers once a week to show their goods, and a buyer would often test a few samples by putting them on the rack.
"Small acorns grew into big oak trees," said Bud Konheim, owner of the design firm of Nicole Miller. "You would know what was selling, and you could get it right away because it wasn't from Indonesia."
These types of pressures leave little room for the inevitable goofs that all merchants who take chances sometimes make -- and which led to Ms. Kasaks's demise. She gambled one year on youthful fashions for her working-woman customer and lost. When her stores failed to recover after a year, Wall Street grew impatient for results. Next time, experts say, creativity is likely to be replaced by predictability.
"If you can't screw up," Mr. Konheim said, "then you may as well buy Mao suits and just put those on the floor. He sold billions of them."

HEADLINE: J. P. Morgan Names U.S. Equity Strategist

 BODY:
J. P. Morgan & Company has hired Douglas R. Cliggott, formerly of Merrill Lynch & Company, to be its United States equity strategist, in a step toward further enhancing its adolescent equity business. He will be responsible for the bank's global investment strategy, forecasting interest rates and suggesting how assets are allocated among cash, stock and bonds.
The appointment is a major coup for Morgan because it signals that investment banking executives, who typically look down on commercial banks and bankers, are beginning to consider the bank a contender in the lucrative business of buying and selling stocks, traditionally the province of Wall Street firms like Goldman, Sachs & Company and Merrill Lynch. 
 For the last decade, Morgan has been working to create an investment banking business, alongside its traditional role as a commercial bank. The bank has 1,000 people working in its equity group, and its research is well-regarded by institutional investors. In the first half of this year, J. P. Morgan ranked eighth in the underwriting of equities, up from 22d in 1991 when it first went into the business.
Nonetheless, competitors regard equity underwriting as the least threatening of the bank's advance onto Wall Street's turf, and it has had trouble attracting investment bankers with experience in equities.
Mr. Cliggott, who is 39, was Merrill's second-string investment strategist after the high-profile Charles Clough.

 BODY:

Wall Street Is Startled By Strong Economic Data
Stocks tumbled to their worst losses in six weeks after a surprisingly strong report on new home sales and a sharp revision upward of the second-quarter gross domestic product renewed concern that in a buoyant economy, borrowing costs could rise and thus cut corporate profits.
The Dow industrials fell 64.73 points, to 5,647.65. The S.& P. 500 dropped 7.41 points to 657.40, and the Nasdaq composite index slipped 8.85 points, to 1,145.03. [Page D7.]

The prices of Treasury securities tumbled on the signs of stronger strength. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond rose to 7.03 percent, from 6.98 percent on Wednesday. [D13.]
 
New Snags for a European Currency
Nervousness over the prospects for European monetary union has spread, as Governments in France and Italy feel pressed to avoid a slowing of their economies and the accompanying job losses by extending the timetable for introducing a single currency, and some German officials seemed to soften their opposition to such a prospect. [D3.]
 
I.M.F. May Sell Gold to Help Poor
The International Monetary Fund has indicated it may sell some of its gold supply and use the proceeds as a gift to cut the debts of the poorest developing countries, letting them improve economic growth and attract more foreign investment. [D3.]

Deal for Blood-Products Maker
Baxter International said it would buy Immuno, a Swiss blood-products company, for $715 million. The deal would help Baxter catch up to the world's biggest maker of blood products, Centeon. [D2.]
 
Daimler-Benz Is Back in the Black
Daimler-Benz posted a first-half net profit of 782 million German marks, or $530 million, bouncing back after a reorganization that brought a record loss last year. [D3.]

Iran Accused of Breaking Embargo
The United States has accused Iran's Revolutionary Guards of helping smuggle oil and gasoline out of Iraq in violation of the United Nations embargo. If Iran's Government is implicated in violating the embargo, it could face sanctions. [A4.]
 
Valujet Gets Flight Approval
The F.A.A. gave Valujet permission to resume flying under greater scrutiny. The agency grounded the discount carrier 10 weeks ago after a fatal crash in the Everglades. Flights could resume as early as Thursday. [A12.]
 
A Broad Hilton-Ladbroke Deal
Hilton Hotels and the Ladbroke Group, which owns Hilton Hotels International, agreed to a broader-than-expected alliance that lets each company buy a fifth of the other. The deal reunites ownership of the Hilton name in the United States and overseas. [D2.]

Editor of New York Is Dismissed
Kurt Andersen, the editor of New York magazine since 1994, who supervised a costly redesign of the magazine, was dismissed. The redesign and a shift in editorial focus have been resisted by important segments of New York's subscriber base. Mr. Andersen's interim replacement is Richard Babcock, editor of Chicago magazine, also owned by K-III Magazines. [D4.]

HEADLINE: Big Theater Is Proposed For Complex In Queens

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
A company founded by the basketball star Magic Johnson is opening a multi-screen movie theater in a new multimillion-dollar retail and entertainment complex planned for South Jamaica, Queens, the largest private investment in the community in decades, an official said yesterday.
The city has designated the Mattone Group, a developer in Whitestone, Queens, as the builder of the complex, which is to be built at 160th Street and Parsons Boulevard near York College, the Queens Borough President, Claire Shulman, said. 
 The 500,000-square-foot complex is to have about 200,000 square feet of office space, with the Catholic Medical Center serving as a major tenant, she said. The Mattone Group, which must seek financing for the project, was selected by the city from a list of 70 developers.
The complex is expected to create approximately 650 new jobs and $15.5 million in tax revenues over the next decade, officials said.
"The developer came to see us some time ago," Mrs. Shulman said. "They were one of several applicants. They seem to be pretty experienced and interested in doing a good job."
Magic Johnson Theaters, a partnership between Mr. Johnson and Sony Retail Entertainment, was formed to develop first-run movie theaters in minority neighborhoods to stimulate the economy. Last year, the company opened its first theater in the Crenshaw section of Los Angeles, and it has become one of the highest-grossing Sony theaters in the country.
Mr. Johnson, who retired from the Los Angeles Lakers after a comeback during the 1995-96 N.B.A. season, plans to open additional theaters in Atlanta and Houston.
"I think the community would be interested in having a first-class motion-picture theater," Mrs. Shulman said. "There really isn't anything there now."

HEADLINE: Dole Says He's the Trustworthy Candidate

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif., Aug. 29

 BODY:
Bob Dole suggested at an outdoor rally here tonight that he was more trustworthy than President Clinton, saying, "Bob Dole is honest, his word is good, when he makes his commitment, you can take it to the bank, and that's what we need in America."
He told several hundred people here in front of the Old Mission: "When you think about the word trust, keep in mind the phrase President Reagan used when he was dealing with the old Soviet Union. He said trust but verify." 
 "That's not a bad way to approach this election," the Republican Presidential nominee advised. "Don't just trust the candidate. Take time to verify by looking at his record. Does he honor his commitment? Does he tell the truth? Does he say what he means? Does he keep his word? You make that judgment."
He said Americans needed leadership they could trust, adding: "Leadership you can trust. Leadership your children can trust. Leadership that foreign countries will trust. It's about leadership. It's about trust."
Later, at a boisterous outdoor rally in this coastal town in Central California, Mr. Dole welcomed hundreds of supporters to what he called "the Clinton retirement party" and focused on his own economic plan. He ran through the highlights of the plan, promising in crisp fashion to cut taxes, balance the budget, cut estate taxes and overhaul the educational system.
As he has throughout his vacation in Santa Barbara, he invoked the name of California's Republican hero, referring to Ronald Reagan numerous times. Today, he said that his plan would be "good for the economy" because President Reagan had "proved" that it could be done.
He said his plan would allow people to keep more of their money and that they could spend it better than bureaucrats could. "We believe more decisions ought to be made here, and that's the thrust of our campaign," he said.
He also derided Mr. Clinton's train ride to the Democratic convention in Chicago, saying he had taken "the status quo express" and that Mr. Clinton had made so many promises on his train ride that they added up to about $12 million per mile.
The Dole campaign also released a letter the candidate wrote to President Clinton today urging that the elections in Bosnia be postponed because they were "a sham in the making." He said the opposition parties did not have adequate resources to campaign and that there had been "widespread intimidation" of opposition leaders. "Elections held under these circumstances will only serve to unfairly legitimize nationalist extremists, entrench ethnic divisions and condemn Bosnia and its people to authoritarianism and partition," he wrote.
Earlier today, the Dole campaign released a letter written by Jack Kemp, Mr. Dole's running mate, to Vice President Al Gore pleading for civility in the political discourse.
He said that Mr. Gore at the Democratic convention in Chicago had engaged in "a misleading assault on Senator Dole's record and reputation," including calling Mr. Dole one half of a "two-headed monster."
Mr. Kemp pledged to take the high road. "Since my nomination as the Republican candidate for Vice President," he wrote, "you have not heard me, nor will you hear me, engage in misleading rhetoric or in ad hominem attacks on the President."
But even as he sought to correct the record, he mentioned specific votes of Mr. Gore that he said he could pull out of context to show that the Vice President was "unwilling to punish drug dealers."
Before Mr. Kemp accepted the Vice-Presidential slot, he said, told the Dole campaign he would not act as an attack dog for Mr. Dole.
 
In His Own Words
 
BOB DOLE
At a rally yesterday in San Luis Obispo, Calif.:
"In a Bob Dole Administration, let there be no room for doubt that we respect the men and women in uniform and we will continue to respect the men and women that wear the uniform of the United States of America.
I've been told that there are 17,000 who wear our uniform who are still on food stamps. That should not happen in America. If you wear the uniform, you ought to be paid enough to buy your groceries and to pay your rent. We're going to repair the morale of the military. We're even going to respect military men and women at the White House.
I have a lot of respect for people in uniform. They served their country; they risk their lives for liberty and freedom every day. And I'm very proud to be one of them, just as many in this audience are proud to know someone or somebody who's been in the service. We are never going to send them into some danger around the world unless I make the decision. It's not going to be made by Boutros Boutros-Ghali at the United Nations."

HEADLINE: The Exploding Strategist

 BODY:
President Clinton delivered his convention speech like the luckiest guy in Chicago instead of a candidate whose grand entrance had been marred by the year's messiest bit of campaign gossip. Until yesterday, his luck had seemed too good to last, and that turned out to be the case. Dick Morris, the undisputed author of Mr. Clinton's comeback, was the cause of a uniquely ill-timed gust of bad publicity for a White House that has seen its share of ill winds. Allegations that Mr. Morris frolicked with a Virginia prostitute came trailing clouds of irony. One of his special gifts had been crafting issues affirming family values and the sanctity of the home that invited voters to forget Mr. Clinton's confessions of infidelity.
As a result, it is easy to assess the short-term damage from tabloid accounts of Mr. Morris's purported sex sessions at the Jefferson Hotel. First, it reactivates the aura of immorality that has always been a liability for Mr. Clinton. At a time when the Republican campaign was sinking again in the polls and seemed to lack a clue as to what to do, the Dole-Kemp ticket has been given an opening. Also, Mr. Morris's supposed peccadilloes stole some attention from Mr. Clinton's well-crafted and gamely delivered speech that stirred delegates by using Mr. Dole's praise of the past in San Diego to depict him as a man of the past. 
 What else might happen depends in part on Mr. Dole's response and in part on Mr. Clinton's. If the Republican ticket stays down in the polls, sooner or later Mr. Dole will be tempted to take the low road. By most playbooks, August is too early to go for the mud. But the Republicans will not find a more sharply delineated opportunity than that created by Mr. Morris's apparent blend of cupidity and stupidity. Even if Mr. Dole does try to make Mr. Morris a symbol of a generalized moral turpitude, he could well be defeated by his own clumsiness.
Mr. Morris will be remembered for teaching President Clinton to claim Republican turf on the balanced budget, welfare and traditional values. He also helped teach the Democrats how to use the main attack weapons wielded by Republicans in recent Presidential campaigns. In 1980, G.O.P. strategists discovered that the chisel-and-hammer techniques employed to break up large stones could also be used to break apart candidates. First you find a tiny fissure in a person or policy of the opposing campaign. Then you set a sharp chisel in the weak spot and tap relentlessly.
The Republicans used this trick to break apart Jimmy Carter on the issue of vacillation, Fritz Mondale as a spendthrift, Michael Dukakis as a wimp on crime. What was really new about the New Democrats who ran Bill Clinton's campaign in 1992 was that they discovered they had a hammer too, and they used it to open up the natural fissures in the George Bush Presidency to expose its intellectual emptiness and its sense of preppy entitlement.
This year the Clinton team has been hitting Mr. Dole, though they could not have predicted how cooperative he would be in pointing out the weak spots in his candidacy. Take his militantly foolish remarks on tobacco. There is also his blind spot on guns. There are more urban and suburban voters worried about getting shot at the 7-Eleven than there are duck hunters who believe there is a national conspiracy to take away their shotguns. Only Wednesday, Mr. Dole made a hallucinatory declaration about the economy being "in the tank."
Mr. Dole is not likely to become a more dextrous candidate, but the Morris episode puts a burden on Mr. Clinton to show that whatever Mr. Morris's failings, they do not point up a central weakness in his own policies or his judgment in choosing him as his chief strategist. Cutting Mr. Morris loose quickly was the smart tactical response. Now the President needs to show that the policies he adopted under Mr. Morris's tutelage also reflected his own independent instincts. Luckily for Mr. Clinton, so many Congressional Republicans were close to Mr. Morris that they will have to contain their glee over the Trojan horse that exploded on the White House lawn.
If Mr. Morris is lucky now, his client will roll through this episode, and Mr. Morris will become an ignominious footnote to the 1996 campaign rather than a turning point. Either way, he should be remembered with contempt for a resignation statement in which he had the gall to link himself to the tradition of Robert F. Kennedy and claimed to have saved the President he embarrassed from a "landslide" defeat. With those delusional parting words, Mr. Morris has guaranteed that no one, friend or foe, will ever accuse him of having been a class act.

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS: NEWS ANALYSIS;
Chill Behind Spotlight's Warm Glow

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 29

 BODY:
It did not seem to matter much to the Democratic partisans on the convention floor that President Clinton's chief strategist, accused of sexual peccadilloes, had headed home in disgrace.
With the smell of victory in their nostrils, they greeted Mr. Clinton tonight with a long, full-throated, placard-waving ovation. And he, ever the smiling optimist, responded by assuring them that "we are on the right track to the 21st century." 
 As they cheered and he spoke, in a polished piece of political oratory tailored to the age of the small screen and the strictures of fiscal stringency, in a 67-minute acceptance speech far more fluent than his main rival's if not as eloquent, he looked like a man without cares.
But in truth he was not. Trouble could not possibly have come at a worse time, just a few hours before Mr. Clinton delivered his appeal to the nation that he hopes will elect him, nine weeks hence, to a second term -- trouble not so much with party loyalists, perhaps, but with those on the fence.
From the Democrats' point of view, at least, it could not have been a worse kind of trouble. It would have been better if Dick Morris, midwife of President Clinton's political rebirth, a co-author of tonight's speech, had been accused of robbing a string of banks, like one of Chicago's least favorite sons, John Dillinger.
But Mr. Morris, the ambidextrous strategist who nudged Mr. Clinton back into the center after the Democrats' disastrous losses of 1994, was accused by Star, the supermarket tabloid, of consorting with a prostitute. Neither he nor the White House confirmed or denied the charge, but in a sense, that was beside the point; the minute the story hit the streets, the damage was done.
Not to the President's campaign team. The shape of the campaign is set, and he has other political advisers, although none of the others has as close a link to Mr. Clinton as Mr. Morris did. In any event, control of the campaign was already passing from the strategists to the political mechanics.
What hurts is the symbolism.
At the height of a convention week that the Democrats have filled with warm, fuzzy images of family and fealty, specifically to counter pervasive public doubts about Mr. Clinton's character and that of his associates, the Morris episode generates an unwelcome, contrasting image of sleaze and scandal.
The President continued tonight on the tack chosen by earlier speakers, describing a second term that he said would be "pro-family, pro-education and pro-economic growth." There were also new tax-cut proposals. It added up to a direct challenge to his Republican rival, Bob Dole, and his efforts to paint the Democrats as the party of crime and spending and deficits.
"Let us do the work that is before us," he said in a finely wrought peroration, "so that when our time here is over, we will watch the sun go down, as we all must, and say, truly we have prepared our children for the dawn."
Mr. Clinton sought to picture Mr. Dole as a man of the past and himself as a man of the future, another major theme of this convention. No fewer than 12 times he promised to "build a bridge to the 21st century;" Mr. Dole, at 73, 23 years older than he, had promised to build a bridge to a golden past.
He sounded notes meant to appeal to conservatives, like promises to balance the budget and fight crime, and notes meant to appeal to liberals, like a promise to preserve Medicare and environmental-protection laws. He rattled off initiatives past and present, jumped from topic to topic, spewed out numbers, sounding at times as if he were delivering a State of the Union speech.
But for the moment at least, the spotlight is back on character, which is bad news for the Democratic nominee. In the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, completed 10 days ago, Mr. Clinton trailed Mr. Dole by 20 percentage points on a pair of questions related to honesty and integrity.
It may last, and it may not. Mr. Clinton's address tonight will be followed by many other speeches in the 67 days that remain until Election Day, although none with tonight's guaranteed live network audience, and they will change many minds. Many people have already decided, and many others are focused on economic questions, fears about crime and other matters.
But the Democrats had hoped the President would come roaring out of Chicago, supercharged with momentum. They had hoped to open such a commanding lead over Mr. Dole in the first two weeks of September that the Republican nominee had no realistic hope of catching up. That now seems highly improbable.
Not only did the accusations against Mr. Morris upstage the speech; they also overshadowed an economic report, showing strong growth in the second quarter, that the Administration would have loved to capitalize upon.
It tried. But when Joseph E. Stiglitz, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, was trotted out before a throng of reporters to spread the news, he was hooted down.
"I don't want to say it," James Carville, the President's 1992 political guru, told a reporter at midday. "But it's certainly fair for you to say that this is the last thing that Clinton needs before his speech."
Other Democrats were no less staggered by the news. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, who was told just moments before a live interview on CNN, could only begin with comment, "Oh, woe is me. Dumb and dumber."
Nothing even remotely like this has happened to a senior White House aide since the late Walter W. Jenkins, an aide so close to Lyndon B. Johnson that he was authorized to sign the President's name to letters, was arrested late in the 1964 campaign in the men's room of a Washington Y.M.C.A. and accused of homosexual behavior. But Mr. Johnson was far ahead at that point, and Barry Goldwater, the Republican nominee, made no effort to exploit the incident.
The Republicans will have to decide quickly how to treat the lurid, detailed charges against Mr. Morris, a Republican who also worked for Democrats. "I don't think we'll be reprinting the Star piece in ads in every paper in the country," a Dole strategist said tonight. "But I don't think we'll refrain from portraying this as a very, very seamy White House, either."
Before the allegations appeared in Star, The Washington Times, a newspaper closely identified with Republican conservatives, said they were apprehensive that the President was stealing their party's values agenda.
In Chicago, the Democrats have staged a special "family night," capped by speeches by Tipper Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton, and a day with women orators dominating the program. To help reinforce their appeal to "family values," the Clintons brought their carefully sheltered daughter, Chelsea, into the limelight for the first time. That appeal has been compromised, and Mr. Dole may have a chance, however brief, to close the gender gap.
Michael D. McCurry, Mr. Clinton's press secretary, struggled to keep the focus off the story.
What mattered, he said, was that the President pressed ahead to "lay out his agenda for a second term and make the case about why his vision of change is preferable to those of his opponents."
In fact, Mr. Clinton had less to do tonight than Mr. Dole did two weeks ago.
For better and for worse, the President is known to the country, whereas Mr. Dole was not. So Mr. Dole had to define himself, whereas Mr. Clinton had to define his program, even if he made few new large-scale commitments.
"No staff person, no adviser, no guru, no Svengali," Mr. McCurry continued, "makes up for what's in the heart and soul of a candidate running for President, because that's what the American people measure and that's what their choice will come down to."
But people cannot look into a candidate's heart through a window in his chest. They must approximate, and one of the ways people measure his heart and soul is by weighing and evaluating those he surrounds himself with.
So far, Mr. Clinton has done well enough, and unless the President's standing is far more drastically damaged by the Morris episode than anyone here expects, Mr. Dole will have to fight history to stage a comeback this fall.
Three times since World War II a Presidential candidate who trailed in the polls immediately after the conventions stormed from behind to win.
But only Harry S. Truman, 11 percentage points behind Thomas E. Dewey in the Gallup survey after the 1948 conventions, and John F. Kennedy, six points behind Richard M. Nixon in 1960, made up substantial ground.
Ronald Reagan was a point behind Jimmy Carter in 1980, a statistically meaningless deficit.
Before the Democrats met here, with Mr. Dole having enjoyed the usual "bounce" from the Republican convention, the former senator trailed by 50 per cent to 39.
Even making allowances for the Morris imbroglio, the Democrats expected an improvement on that spread by the time they got home.

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS: THE THE ISSUES;
Clinton Proposes Tax Cuts on Profits in Home Sales

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 29

 BODY:
Trying to counter his Republican opponent's tax plan and to placate some of his own Democrats over welfare, President Clinton this evening proposed eliminating taxes on profits from home sales and offering incentives to businesses that hire welfare recipients.
Aides to Mr. Clinton briefed reporters on the ideas this afternoon, hours before he was to announce them himself in his acceptance speech before the Democratic National Convention. 
 Together with a proposed national reading program for children and some new environmental initiatives that were announced on Wednesday, the tax and welfare plans are the pillars of the policy platform that the President has built his re-election hopes on.
Under the tax cut plan, homeowners filing joint returns would be exempt from paying capital gains taxes on profits of up to $500,000 from the sale of their principal home, and single taxpayers would have a $250,000 exclusion. Sellers would not have to reinvest their profits in a more expensive home within two years, as they must do now to avoid the tax.
Under current law, an exemption from the gains tax is also available to taxpayers over 55 years of age, who can take a one-time exclusion of up to $125,000 of gain from the sale of their home.
Mr. Clinton's proposal would apply to all homeowners, regardless of their age or income, and as often as they sell a primary residence. The only prohibition is a two-year waiting period between home sales.
Robert Clair, a manager in the economic consulting services unit of KPMG Peat Marwick, said he thought Mr. Clinton's proposal would be good for the economy because it would allow homeowners to take their profit out of their houses and invest it elsewhere, like the stock market.
"The capital gains tax on houses never generated very much revenue because people worked so hard to avoid it, particularly by rolling over their gain into a more expensive house," Mr. Clair said.
A senior economic adviser to Mr. Clinton, Gene Sperling, said the plan would exempt 99 percent of home sales from the capital gains tax.
Mr. Sperling also said the change, if approved by Congress, would take effect next Jan. 1.
The plan would cost the Federal Government about $1.4 billion over the next six years, and would be offset by nearly $8.5 billion in cuts in Federal programs and by eliminating certain corporate tax breaks.
Bob Dole, the Republican Presidential nominee, has endorsed a similar proposal as part of a $548 billion plan he announced last month that also offers a 15 percent across-the-board income tax cut.
Anticipating Mr. Clinton's move, the Dole campaign chided the President on Wednesday for not backing the capital gains exemption for homeowners.
"Can't we at least agree that the American family deserves to have tax relief on the biggest single investment -- their home?" Mr. Dole asked.
One of the major differences between the plans is that Mr. Dole's proposal would require a seller to live in their principal residence for at least three of the previous five years to gain the exemption.
Mr. Sperling said the President had been mulling the idea for nearly a year and had first raised it last December during budget negotiations with the Republican Congressional leadership.
Mr. Clinton's welfare plan was, in part, intended to calm liberal Democrats angered over his support for a Republican bill that shifted primary responsibility for care of the needy to the states. The President signed the welfare bill last week.
The plan that Mr. Clinton proposed today would give employers who hire welfare recipients who have received aid for 18 months or longer a 50 percent tax credit on the first $10,000 of wages paid to each worker. That plan would cost $383 million and run until the year 2000.
A second component offers tax incentives to increase investment in distressed areas.
And Mr. Clinton's plan has what his aides call a welfare-to-work jobs initiative that is intended to help state and local governments find jobs for one million of the hardest-to-employ welfare recipients by the year 2000.
The Administration estimates that the plan will cost $3 billion over three years.

Following is President Clinton's speech last night at the Democratic National Convention in which he accepted the party's nomination for re-election as transcribed by The Associated Press:
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice President, my fellow Democrats, and my fellow Americans. Thank you for your nomination. I don't know if I can find a fancy way to say this, but I accept. Thank you. 
 So many have contributed to the record we have made for the American people, but one above all, my partner, my friend and the best Vice President in our history, Al Gore.
Tonight I thank the city of Chicago, its great Mayor and its wonderful people for this magnificent convention. I love Chicago for many reasons; for your powerful spirit, your sports teams, your lively politics, but most of all for the love and light of my life, Chicago's daughter, Hillary.
Four years ago, you and I set forth on a journey to bring our vision to our country, to keep the American Dream alive for all who were willing to work for it, to make our American communities stronger, to keep America the strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity.
Four years ago, with high unemployment, stagnant wages, crime, welfare and the deficit on the rise, with a host of unmet challenges and a rising tide of cynicism, I told you about a place I was born, and I told you that I still believe in a place called Hope.
Well, for four years now, to realize our vision, we have pursued a simple but profound strategy: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, a strong, united American community.
Four days ago, as you were making your way here, I began a train ride to make my way to Chicago through America's heartland. I wanted to see the faces; I wanted to hear the voices of the people for whom I have worked and fought these last four years. And did I ever see them.
I met an ingenious businesswoman who was once on welfare in West Virginia; a brave police officer, shot and paralyzed, now a civic leader in Kentucky; an auto worker in Ohio, once unemployed, once unemployed, now proud to be working in the oldest auto plant in America, to help make America No. 1 in auto production again for the first time in 20 years.
I met a grandmother fighting for her grandson's environment in Michigan, and I stood with two wonderful little children proudly reading from their favorite book, "The Little Engine That Could."
At every stop, large and exuberant crowds greeted me, and maybe more important, when we just rolled through little towns, there were always schoolchildren there waving their American flags. All of them believing in America and its future.
I would not have missed that trip for all the world, for that trip showed me that hope is back in America. We are on the right track to the 21st century.
Look at the facts. Just look at the facts: 4.4 million Americans now living in a home of their own for the first time. Hundreds of thousands of women have started their own new businesses. More minorities own businesses than ever before. Record numbers of new small businesses and exports.
Look at what's happened. We have the lowest combined rates of unemployment, inflation and home mortgages in 28 years. Look at what happened: 10 million new jobs, over half of them high-wage jobs. Ten million workers getting the raise they deserve with the minimum wage law. Twenty-five million people now having protection in their health insurance because the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill says you can't lose your insurance anymore when you change jobs, even if somebody in your family has been sick.
Forty million Americans with more pension security. A tax cut for 15 million of our hardest-working, hardest-pressed Americans and all small businesses. Twelve million Americans, 12 million of them, taking advantage of the Family and Medical Leave law so they can be good parents and good workers.
Ten million students have saved money on their college loans. We are making our democracy work.
We have also passed political reform: the line-item veto, the motor-voter bill, tougher registration laws for lobbyists, making Congress live under the laws they impose on the private sector, stopping unfunded mandates to state and local government. We've come a long way. We've got one more thing to do. Would you help me get campaign finance reform in the next four years?
We have increased our investments in research in technology. We have increased investment in breast cancer research dramatically. We are developing a super-computer that will do more calculating in a second than a person with a hand-held calculator can do in 30,000 years. More rapid development of drugs to deal with H.I.V. and AIDS and moving them to the market quicker have almost doubled life expectancy in only four years and we are looking at no limit in sight to that. We'll keep going until normal life is returned to people who deal with this.
Our country is still the strongest force for peace and freedom on earth, on issues that once before tore us apart, we have changed the old politics of Washington. For too long, leaders in Washington asked, Who's to blame? But we ask, What are we going to do?
On crime, we're putting 100,000 police on the streets, we made three-strikes-and-you're-out the law of the land, we stopped 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting handguns under the Brady bill. We banned assault rifles, we supported tougher punishment and prevention programs to keep our children from drugs and gangs and violence. Four years now, for four years now, the crime rate in America has gone down.
On welfare, we worked with states to launch a quiet revolution. Today there are 1.8 million fewer people on welfare than there were the day I took the oath of office. We are moving people from welfare to work.
We have increased child-support collections by 40 percent. The Federal work force is the smallest it's been since John Kennedy. And the deficit has come down for four years in a row for the first time since before the Civil War, down 60 percent on the way to zero. We will do it.
We are on the right track to the 21st century. We are on the right track. But our work is not finished.
What should we do?
First, let us consider how to proceed. Again, I say the question is no longer, Who's to blame, but, What to do?
I believe that Bob Dole and Jack Kemp and Ross Perot love our country, and they have worked hard to serve it. It is legitimate, even necessary, to compare our record with theirs, our proposals for the future with theirs, and I expect them to make a vigorous effort to do the same.
But I will not attack; I will not attack them personally, or permit others to do it in this party if I can prevent it.
My fellow Americans, this must be a campaign of ideas, not a campaign of insults. The American people deserve it.
Now, here's the main idea. I love and revere the rich and proud history of America, and I am determined to take our best traditions into the future. But with all respect, we do not need to build a bridge to the past, we need to build a bridge to the future, and that is what I commit to you to do.
So tonight let us resolve to build that bridge to the 21st century, to meet our challenges and protect our values. Let us build a bridge to help our parents raise their children, to help young people and adults to get the education and training they need, to make our streets safer, to help Americans succeed at home and at work, to break the cycle of poverty and dependence, to protect our environment for generations to come, and to maintain our world leadership for peace and freedom.
Let us resolve to build that bridge.
Tonight, my fellow Americans, I ask all of your fellow citizens to join me and to join you in building that bridge to the 21st century, four years from now. Just four years from now. Think of it. We begin a new century, full of enormous possibilities. We have to give the American people the tools they need to make the most of their God-given potential. We must make the basic bargain of opportunity and responsibility available to all Americans, not just a few. That is the promise of the Democratic Party. That is the promise of America.
I want to build a bridge to the 21st century in which we expand opportunity through education, where computers are as much a part of the classroom as blackboards, where highly trained teachers demand peak performance from our students, where every eight-year-old can point to a book and say, "I can read it myself."
By the year 2000, the single most critical thing we can do is to give every single American who wants it the chance to go to college. We must make two years of college just as universal in four years as a high school education is today, and we can do it. We can do it, and we should cut taxes to do it. I propose a $1,500-a-year tuition tax credit for Americans, a Hope scholarship for the first two years of college to make the typical community college education available to every American.
I believe every working family ought also to be able to deduct up to $10,000 in college tuition costs per year for education after that. I believe the families of this country ought to be able to save money for college in a tax-free I.R.A., save it year in and year out, withdraw for college education without penalty.
We should not tax middle-income Americans for the money they spend on college. We'll get the money back down the road many times over.
I want to say here, before I go further, that these tax cuts and every other one I mention tonight are all fully paid for in my balanced-budget plan, line by line, dime by dime. And they focus on education.
Now, one thing so many of our fellow Americans are learning is that education no longer stops on graduation day. I have proposed a new G.I. Bill for American workers, a $2,600 grant for unemployed and underemployed Americans, so that they can get the training and the skills they need to go back to work at better-paying jobs, good high-skill jobs for a good future.
But we must demand excellence at every level of education. We must insist that our students learn the old basics we learned and the new basics they have to know for the next century.
Tonight let us set a clear national goal: All children should be able to read on their own by the third grade. When 40 percent of our 8-year-olds cannot read as well as they should, we have to do something. I want to send 30,000 reading specialists and National Service Corps members to mobilize a volunteer army of one million reading tutors for third-graders all across America. They will teach our young children to read.
Let me say to our parents, you have to lead the way. Every tired night you spend reading a book to your child will be worth it many times over. I know that Hillary and I still talk about the books we read to Chelsea when we were so tired we could hardly stay awake. We still remember them, and, more important, so does she.
But we're going to help the parents of this country make every child able to read for himself or herself by the age of 8, by the third grade. Do you believe we can do that? Will you help us do that?
We must give parents, all parents, the right to choose which public school their children will attend, and to let teachers form new charter schools with a charter they can keep only if they do a good job. We must keep our schools open late so that young people have some place to go, and something to say "yes" to, and stay off the street.
We must require that our students pass tough tests to keep moving up in school. A diploma has to mean something when they get out. We should reward teachers that are doing a good job, remove those who don't measure up. But in every case, never forget that none of us would be here tonight if it weren't for our teachers. I know I wouldn't. We ought to lift them up, not tear them down.
We need schools that will take our children into the next century. We need schools that are rebuilt and modernized with an unprecedented commitment from the national government to increase school construction and with every single library and classroom in America connected to the Information Superhighway by the year 2000.
Now, folks, if we do these things, every 8-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old will be able to log in on the Internet, every 18-year-old will be able to go to college, and all Americans will have the knowledge they need to cross that bridge to the 21st century.
I want to build a bridge to the 21st century in which we create a strong and growing economy to preserve the legacy of opportunity for the next generation, by balancing our budget in a way that protects our values and ensuring that every family will be able to own an protect the value of their most important asset, their home.
Let us proclaim to the American people we will balance the budget, and let us also proclaim we will do it in a way that preserves Medicare, Medicaid, education, the environment, the integrity of our pensions, the strength of our people.
I could never allow cuts that devastate education for our children, that pollute our environment, that end the guarantee of health care for those who are served under Medicaid, that end our duty or violate our duty to our parents through Medicare. I just couldn't do that. As long as I'm President, I'll never let it happen. And it doesn't matter if they try again as they did before to use the blackmail threat of a shutdown of the Federal Government to force these things on the American people. We didn't let it happen before. We won't let it happen again.
Of course, there is a better answer to this dilemma. We could have the right kind of a balanced budget with a new Congress -- a Democratic Congress.
I want to balance the budget with real cuts in government, in waste. I want a plan that invests in education, as mine does, in technology and yes, in research, as Christopher Reeve so powerfully reminded us we must do.
And my plan gives Americans tax cuts that will help our economy to grow. I want to expand I.R.A.'s so that young people can save tax-free to buy a first home. Tonight, I propose a new tax cut for homeownership, that says to every middle-income working family in this country, if you sell your home, you will not have to pay a capital gains tax on it ever, not ever.
I want every American to be able to hear those beautiful words, "Welcome home."
Let me say again, every tax cut I call for tonight is targeted, it's responsible, and it is paid for within my balanced-budget plan. My tax cuts will not undermine our economy, they will speed economic growth. We should cut taxes for the family sending a child to college, for the worker returning to college, for the family saving to buy a home or for long-term health care, and a $500-per-child credit for middle-income families raising their children who need help with child care and what the children will do after school. That is the right way to cut taxes: pro-family, pro-education, pro-economic growth!
Now, our opponents have put forward a very different plan, a risky, $50 billion tax scheme that will force them to ask for even bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than they passed and I vetoed last year.
But even then, they will not cover the cost of their scheme, so that even then this plan will explode the deficit, which will increase interest rates by 2 percent, according to their own estimates last year. It will require huge cuts in the very investments we need to grow, and to grow together, and at the same time slow down the economy.
You know what higher interest rates mean. To you, it means a higher mortgage payment, a higher car payment, a higher credit card payment. To our economy, it means business people will not borrow as much money, invest as much money, create as many new jobs, create as much wealth, raise as many wages.
Do we really want to make that same mistake all over again.
Do we really want to stop economic growth again.
Do we really want to start piling up another mountain of debt?
Do we want to bring back the recession of 1991 and '92?
Do we want to weaken our bridge to the 21st century?
Of course, we don't.
We have an obligation, you and I, to leave our children a legacy of opportunity, not a legacy of debt. Our budget would be balanced today, we would have a surplus today, if we didn't have to make the interest payments on the debt run up in the 12 years before the Clinton-Gore Administration took office.
So let me say this is one of those areas in which I respectfully disagree with my opponent. I don't believe we should bet the farm, and I certainly don't believe we should bet the country. We should stay the on the right track for the 21st century.
Opportunity alone is not enough.
I want to build an America in the 21st century in which all Americans take personal responsibility for themselves, their families, their communities, and their country. I want our nation to take responsibility to make sure that every single child can look out the window in the morning and see a whole community getting up and going to work. We want these children to learn the thrill of the first paycheck, the challenge of starting the first business, the pride in following in a parent's footsteps.
The welfare reform bill I signed last week gives America a chance, but not a guarantee, to have that kind of new beginning, to have a new social bargain with the poor, guaranteeing health care, child care and nutrition for the children.
But requiring able-bodied to work for the income. Now I say to all of you whether you supported the law or opposed it, but especially to those who supported it, we have a responsibility, we have a moral obligation, to make sure the people who are being required to work have the opportunity to work. We must make sure the jobs are there.
There should be one million new jobs for welfare recipients by the year 2000. States under this law can now take the money that was spent on the welfare check and use it to help businesses to provide paychecks. I challenge every state to do it soon.
I propose also to give businesses a tax credit for every person hired off welfare and kept employed. I propose to offer private job placement firms a bonus for every welfare recipient they place in a job who stays in it.
And more important, I want to help communities put welfare recipients to work right now, without delay, repairing schools, making their neighborhoods clean and safe, making them shine again. There's lots of work to be done out there. Our cities can find ways to put people to work and bring dignity and strength back to these families.
My fellow Americans, I have spent an enormous amount of time with our dear friend, the late Ron Brown, and with Secretary Kantor and others, opening markets for America around the world, and I'm proud of every one we opened. But let us never forget the greatest untapped market for American enterprise is right here in America, in the inner cities and the rural areas who have not felt this recovery. With investment and business and jobs, they can become our partners in the future, and it's a great opportunity we ought not to pass up.
I propose more empowerment zones like the one we have right here in Chicago to draw business into poor neighborhoods. I propose more community development banks, like the South Shore Bank right here in Chicago, to help people in those neighborhoods start their own small businesses. More jobs, more incomes, new markets for America right here at home, making welfare reform a reality.
Now, folks, you cheered, and I thank you, but the Government can only give so much. The private sector has to provide most of these jobs. So I want to say again, tonight I challenge every business person in America who has ever complained about the failure of the welfare system to try to hire somebody off welfare and try hard.
After all, the welfare system you used to complain about is not here anymore. There is no more "who's to blame" on welfare. Now the only question is, What to do? And we all have a responsibility, especially those who have criticized what was passed and who have asked for a change and who have the ability to give poor people a chance to grow and support their families. I want to build a bridge to the 21st century that ends the permanent underclass, that lifts up the poor and ends their isolation, their exile, and that they're not forgotten anymore.
I want to build a bridge to the 21st century, where our children are not killing other children anymore, where children's lives are not shattered by violence at home or in the school yard, where a generation of young people are not left to raise themselves on the streets. With more police and punishment and prevention, the crime rate has dropped for four years in a row, now. But we cannot rest, because we know it's still too high.
We cannot rest until crime is a shocking exception to our daily lives, not news as usual. Will you stay with me until we reach that good day?
My fellow Americans, we all owe a great debt to Sarah and Jim Brady and I'm glad they took their wrong turn and ended up in Chicago.
I was glad to see them. It is to them we owe the good news that 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers couldn't get handguns because of the Brady bill, but not a single hunter in Arkansas or New Hampshire or Illinois or anyplace else missed a hunting season.
But now I say, we should extend the Brady bill, because anyone who has committed an act of domestic violence against a spouse or a child should not buy a gun.
And we must ban those cop-killer bullets. They are designed for one reason only: to kill police officers. We ask the police to keep us safe. We owe it to them to help keep them safe while they do their job for us.
We should pass a victims' rights constitutional amendment because victims deserve to be heard, they need to know when an assailant is released, they need to know these things and the only way to guarantee them is through a constitutional amendment.
We have made a great deal of progress. Even the crime rate among young people is finally coming down. So it is very, very painful to me that drug use among young people is up. Drugs nearly killed my brother when he was a young man, and I hate them. He fought back. He's here tonight with his wife. His little boy's here, and I'm really proud of him.
But I learned something in going through that long nightmare with our family. And I can tell you, something has happened to some of our young people. They simply don't think these drugs are dangerous anymore, or they think the risk is acceptable.
So beginning with our parents, and without regard to our party, we have to renew our energy to teach this generation of young people the hard, cold truth: Drugs are deadly, drugs are wrong, drugs can cost you your life.
General Barry McCaffrey, the four-star general who led our fight against drugs in Latin America, now leads our crusade against drugs at home, stopping more drugs at our borders, cracking down on those who sell them, and most important of all, pursuing a national anti-drug strategy whose primary aim is to turn our children away from drugs. I call on Congress to give him every cent of funding we have requested for this strategy, and to do it now.
There is more we will do. We should say to parolees, "We will test you for drugs. If you go back on them, we will send you back to jail."
We will say to gangs, "We will break you with the same anti-racketeering law we use to put mob bosses in jail. You're not going to kill our kids anymore, or turn them into murderers before they're teen-agers."
My fellow Americans, if we're going to build that bridge to the 21st century, we have to make our children free, free of the vise grip of guns and gangs and drugs, free to build lives of hope.
I want to build the bridge to the 21st century with a strong American community, beginning with strong families; an America where all children are cherished and protected from destructive forces, where parents can succeed at home and at work. Everywhere I've gone in America, people come up and talk to me about their struggle with the demands of work and their desire to do a better job with their children. The very first person I ever saw fight that battle was here with me four years ago, and tonight I miss her very, very much. My irrepressible, hard-working, always optimistic mother did the best she could do for her brother and me, often against very stiff odds. I learned from her just how much love and determination can overcome.
But from her and from our life I also learned that no parent can do it alone, and no parent should have to. She had the kind of help every parent deserves, from our neighbors, our friends, our teachers, our pastors, our doctors and so many more.
You know, when I started out in public life with a lot of my friends from the Arkansas delegation down here there used to be a saying we'd hear from time to time, that every man who runs for public office will claim that he was born in a log cabin he built with his own hands. My mother knew better. And she made sure I did too. Long before she even met Hillary my mother knew, it takes a village, and she was grateful for the support she got.
As Tipper Gore and Hillary said on Tuesday, we have all of us in our Administration worked hard to support families in raising their children and succeeding at work. But we should do more. We should extend the Family and Medical Leave Law to give parents some time off to take their children to regular doctor's appointments, or attend those parent-teacher conferences at school -- that is a key determination of their success.
We should pass a flex-time law that allows employees to take their overtime pay in money or in time off, depending on what's better for their family.
The F.D.A. has adopted new measures to reduce advertising and sales of cigarettes to children. The Vice President spoke so movingly of it last night, but let me remind you, my fellow Americans, that is very much an issue in this election, because that battle is far from over, and the two candidates have different views. I pledge to America's parents that I will see this effort all the way through.
Working with the entertainment industry, we're giving parents the V-chip. TV shows are being rated for content so parents will be able to make a judgment about whether their small children should see them. And three hours of quality children's programming every week on every network are on the way.
The Kennedy-Kassebaum law says every American can keep his or her health insurance if they have to change jobs, even if someone in their family has been sick. That is a very important thing. But tonight we should spell out the next steps.
The first thing we ought to do is to extend the benefits of health care to people who are unemployed. I propose in my balanced-budget plan paid for, to help unemployed families keep their health insurance for up to six months. A parent may be without a job, but no child should be without a doctor. And let me say again, as the First Lady did on Tuesday, we should protect mothers and newborn babies from being forced out of the hospital in less than 48 hours.
We respect the individual conscience of every American on the painful issue of abortion, but believe as a matter of law that this decision should be left to a woman, her conscience, her doctor and her God. But abortion should not only be safe and legal; it should be rare. That's why I helped to establish and support a national effort to reduce out-of-wedlock teen pregnancy.
And that is why we must promote adoption. Last week, last week the minimum-wage bill I signed contained a $5,000 credit to families who adopt children, even more if the children have disabilities. It put an end to the racial discrimination in the adoption process. It was a good thing for America.
My fellow Americans, already there are tens of thousands of children out there who need a good home with loving parents. I hope more of them will find it now.
I want to build a bridge to the 21st century with a clean and safe environment. We are making our food safer from pesticides, we're protecting our drinking water and our air from poisons. We saved Yellowstone from mining. We established the largest national park south of Alaska in the Mojave Desert in California. We are working to save the precious Florida Everglades. And when the leaders of this Congress invited the polluters into the back room to roll back 25 years of environmental protection that both parties had always supported, I said, No.
But we must do more. Today 10 million children live within just four miles of a toxic waste dump. We have cleaned up 197 of those dumps in the last three years, more than in the previous 12 years combined. In the next four years, we propose to clean up 500 more, two-thirds of all that are left, and the most dangerous ones. Our children should grow up next to parks, not poison.
We should make it a crime even to attempt to pollute. We should freeze the serious polluter's property until they clean up the problems they create. We should make it easier for families to find out about toxic chemicals in their neighborhood so they can do more to protect their own children. These are the things that we must do to build that bridge to the 21st century.
My fellow Americans, I want to build a bridge to the 21st century that makes sure we are still the nation with the world's strongest defense; that our foreign policy still advances the values of our American community in the community of nations. Our bridge to the future must include bridges to other nations.
Because we remain the world's indispensable nation, to advance prosperity, peace and freedom, and to keep our own children safe from the dangers of terror and weapons of mass destruction.
We have helped to bring democracy to Haiti and peace to Bosnia. Now the peace signed on the White House lawn between the Israelis and the Palestinians must embrace more of Israel's neighbors. The deep desire for peace that Hillary and I felt when we walked the streets of Belfast and Derry must become real for all the people of Northern Ireland. And Cuba must finally join the community of democracies.
Nothing in our lifetimes has been more heartening than when people of the former Soviet Union and Central Europe broke the grip of communism. We have aided their progress, and I am proud of it, and I will continue our strong partnership with a democratic Russia. And we will bring some of Central Europe's new democracies into NATO so that they will never question their own freedom in the future.
Our American exports are at record levels. In the next four years, we have to break down even more barriers to them, reaching out to Latin America, to Africa, to other countries in Asia, making sure that our workers and our products, the world's finest, have the benefit of free and fair trade.
In the last four years, we have frozen North Korea's nuclear weapons program, and I'm proud to say that tonight there is not a single Russian nuclear missile pointed at an American child. Now we must enforce and ratify, without delay, measures that further reduce nuclear arsenals, banish poison gas, and ban nuclear tests once and for all.
We have made investments, new investments, in our most important defense asset, our magnificent men and women in uniform. By the year 2000, we also will have increased funding to modernize our weapons systems by 40 percent. These commitments will make sure that our military remains the best-trained, best-equipped fighting force in the entire world. We are developing a sensible nation missile defense, but we must not, not now, not by the year 2000, squander $60 billion on an unproved, ineffective "Star Wars" program that could be obsolete tomorrow.
We are fighting terrorism on all fronts with a three-prong strategy.
First, we are working to rally a world coalition with zero tolerance for terrorism. Just this month I signed a law imposing harsh sanctions on foreign companies that invest in key sectors of the Iranian and Libyan economies. As long as Iran trains, supports, and protects terrorists, as long as Libya refuses to give up the people who blew up Pan Am 103, they will pay a price from the United States.
Second, we must give law enforcement the tools they need to take the fight to terrorists.
We need new laws to crack down on money laundering and to prosecute and punish those who commit violent acts against American citizens abroad; to add chemical markers or taggants to gunpowder used in bombs so we can track the bomb-makers; to extend the same power police now have against organized crime to save lives by tapping all the phones that terrorists use. Terrorists are as big a threat to our future, perhaps bigger, than organized crime. Why should we have two different standards for a common threat to the safety of America and our children?
We need, in short, the laws that Congress refused to pass. And I ask them again: Please, as an American, not a partisan matter, pass these laws now.
Third, we will improve airport and air travel security. I have asked the Vice President to establish a commission and report back to me on ways to do this, but now we will install the most sophisticated bomb detection equipment in all our major airports, we will search every airplane flying to or from America from another nation -- every flight, every cargo hold, every cabin, every time.
My fellow Democrats and my fellow Americans, I know that in most election seasons foreign policy is not a matter of great interest in the debates in the barber shops and the cafes of America, on the floors and at the bowling alleys, but there are times when only America can make the difference between war and peace, between freedom and repression, between life death.
We cannot save all the world's children, but we can save many of them.
We cannot become the world's policeman, but where our values and our interests are at stake and where we can make a difference, we must act and we must lead. That is our job, and we are better, stronger and safer because we are doing it.
My fellow Americans, let me say one last time, we can only build our bridge to the 21st century if we build it together and if we're willing to walk arm-in-arm across that bridge together.
I have spent so much of your time that you gave me these last four years to be your President worrying about the problems of Bosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Burundi. What do these places have in common? People are killing each other and butchering children because they are different from on another.
They share the same piece of land, but they are different from one another. They hate their race, their tribe, their ethnic group, their religion.
We have seen the terrible, terrible price that people pay when they insist on fighting and killing their neighbors over their differences. In our own country, we have seen America pay a terrible price for any form of discrimination, and we have seen us grow stronger as we have steadily let more and more of our hatreds and our fears go. As we have given more and more of our people the chance to live their dreams.
That is why the flame of our Statue of Liberty, like the Olympic flame carried all across America by thousands of citizen heroes, will always burn brighter than the flames that burn our churches, our synagogues, our mosques.
Look around this hall tonight, and to our fellow Americans watching on television, you look around this hall tonight. There is every conceivable difference here among the people who are gathered. If we want to build that bridge to the 21st century, we have to be willing to say, loud and clear, if you believe in the values of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, if you're willing to work hard and play by the rules, you are part of our family, and we're proud to be with you.
You cheer now because you know this is true. You know this is true. When you walk out of this hall, think about it. Live by it.
We still have too many Americans who give into their fears of those who are different from them. Not so long ago swastikas were painted on the doors of some African-American members of our Special Forces at Fort Bragg.
Folks, for those of you who don't know what they do, the Special Forces are just what the name says; they are special forces. If I walk off this stage tonight and call them on the telephone and tell them to go halfway around the world and risk their lives for you and be there by tomorrow at noon, they will do it. They do not deserve to have swastikas on their doors.
So look around here, look around here. Old or young, healthy as a horse or a person with a disability that hasn't kept you down, man or woman, Native American, native-born, immigrant, straight or gay -- whatever -- the test ought to be: I believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence. I believe in religious liberty, I believe in freedom of speech, and I believe in working hard and playing by the rules. I'm showing up for work tomorrow. I'm building that bridge to the 21st century.
That ought to be the test.
My fellow Americans, 68 nights from tonight, the American people will face once again a critical moment of decision. We're going to choose the last President of the 20th century and the first President of the 21st century. But the real choice is not that. The real choice is whether we will build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past, about whether we believe our best days are still out there or our best days are behind us, about whether we want a country of people all working together or one where you're on you're own.
Let us commit ourselves this night to rise up and build the bridge we know we ought to build all the way to the 21st century.
Let us have faith, American faith, that we are not leaving our greatness behind. We're going to carry it right on with us into that new century, a century of new challenge and unlimited promise. Let us, in short, do the work that is before us so that when our time here is over, we will all watch the sun go down, as we all must, and say truly that we have prepared our children for the dawn.
My fellow Americans, after these four, good, hard years, I still believe in a place called Hope, a place called America.
Thank you. God bless you.

HEADLINE: Will We Pull Welfare Jobs Out of a Hat?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Welfare Clients Outnumber Jobs They Might Fill" (front page, Aug. 25): Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York and others ask us to accept that our economy can absorb all the people who will be cut off public assistance by the new Federal law. They expect the reformed welfare system to yield tax savings and a flood of cheap labor, stimulating the economy to grow and providing plenty of jobs. Rube Goldberg might have drawn a cartoon to illustrate how this would work.
Even if we can imagine this golden world, a question remains: Why would businesses create jobs for former welfare recipients when they can continue to take advantage of cheaper labor abroad? Can anyone imagine Nike quitting Indonesia for the Bronx? 
 Do our representatives in Washington have plans they are not sharing with us? Will they eliminate or modify the minimum wage, to make the low end of the American labor market competitive in the global economy?
Will our representatives offer corporations tax incentives to hire off the welfare rolls? Would these incentives count as tax savings? Or will lawmakers let jobs become local problems, so that cities and towns hire their former welfare clients, exchange property tax breaks for jobs, and just try to chase the deadbeats away?

HEADLINE: THE DEMOCRATS: THE OVERVIEW;
CLINTON, DECLARING 'HOPE IS BACK,' DEFENDS HIS FIRST TERM AND LISTS PLANS FOR SECOND

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 29

 BODY:
Declaring that "hope is back in America," President Clinton accepted his party's nomination for a second term tonight by vowing to protect Government programs for children, the elderly and the environment in a "strong, united American community."
In a speech that blended outsized optimism with small-scale proposals, Mr. Clinton summed up his efforts of the last four years and sketched out his plans for the next, claiming credit for a new kind of politics mixing ideas without regard to their partisan origin. 
 "On issues that once tore us apart, we have changed the old politics of Washington," Mr. Clinton said in a veiled dig at the sharply partisan tone of the Republican Convention in San Diego, his voice husky from four days of campaigning by rail. "For too long, leaders in Washington have asked who's to blame. But we ask, 'What are we going to do?' " [Transcript of speech, page A20.]
The President answered himself by repeating his vigorous defense of existing Government programs like Medicare and Medicaid -- a stand that has scored highly in public opinion polls in recent months -- and by reciting a list of modest proposals for new ones, from tax credits for college education and families with children to tax breaks for homeownership and job creation. Over and over again, he pledged to "build a bridge to the 21st century."
But the speech, lasting one hour and seven minutes, was not so much a sustained exploration of either the man himself or any overarching vision as it was something of a State of the Union laundry list of all the multi-facted things he has done, tried to do or vows yet to do.
He took on critics of both the welfare system -- and of the bill he just signed overhauling it -- challenging every American "to try to hire somebody off welfare and try hard," and declaring:
"There is no more 'Who's to blame on welfare.' Now the only question is what to do, and we all have a responsibility -- especially those who have criticized what was passed and who have asked for a change and who have the ability -- to give poor people a chance to grow and support their families."
Mr. Clinton set an ebullient tone for the campaign he hopes will make him the first Democratic President elected to a second full term since Franklin D. Roosevelt 60 years ago -- and only the third in this century. But for all the flags and cheering in the hall, his speech tonight made it plainer than ever that he presides over a vastly different party, its old coalitions splintered, its majority status shaky and its ambitions limited by the President's own repeated pronouncements that the era of Big Government is over.
And what he had planned as a moment of meticulously staged triumph was marred by a cinematic sideshow: the sudden resignation of Dick Morris, the political strategist responsible for many of the themes in the President's speech, and for helping to reposition Mr. Clinton over the last 18 months as a man of the middle road.
Mr. Morris stepped down today after a tabloid newspaper, Star, reported that he had conducted a yearlong affair with a Washington prostitute and had discussed confidential White House business with her in private moments.
The news echoed Mr. Clinton's own unhappy encounter with Star in 1992, when it published Gennifer Flowers's accusation of a long extramarital relationship with Mr. Clinton when he was the Governor of Arkansas. The situation today sent the traveling White House staff, holed up with the President in the Sheraton Hotel here, into a frantic tailspin of damage control.
In contrast to his first acceptance speech four years ago in Madison Square Garden, in Manhattan, when his challenge was to introduce and humanize himself to a public that knew relatively little about him -- and to Bob Dole's self-consciously personal speech in San Diego -- Mr. Clinton faced the nation tonight as an all too known and human commodity, striving to show how the disparate pieces of his Presidency would fit together in a second term.
The President did so in a speech studded with the sort of modest, moderate proposals for executive and legislative action he has made his stock in trade in recent months, including two new ones: a new capital-gains tax break for homeowners and tax incentives for businesses that create jobs to employ welfare recipients.
Mr. Clinton mades nods to the politics of personality, recalling his younger brother's recovery from cocaine addiction in his speech and beginning the brief film, produced by his friend Linda Bloodworth Thomason, that introduced him in the hall with an account of the deaths of friends and family he has suffered since taking office.
It featured testimony from his wife, Hillary, that he is "a person who combines the best of his heart and his head," and his own assertion that his parents would have punished him if he made personal attacks of the sort he implied the Republicans rely on.
"I will not attack them personally or permit others in this party to do it if I can prevent it," Mr. Clinton said in his speech. "This must be a campaign of ideas, not of insults. The American people deserve it."
The President vowed to "build a bridge to help parents raise their children, to help young people and adults get the education and training they need, to make citizens feel safer on our streets, to help Americans succeed at home and work, to break the cycle of poverty and dependence, to protect our environment for generations to come, and to maintain our world leadership in the face of new threats and new opportunities."
Mr. Clinton summed up his goals in the terms of children and families that have become his unceasing refrain.
"If we do these things," he said, "every 8-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old will be able to log on to the Internet, every 18-year-old will be able to go to college, and Americans will have the knowledge they need to cross that bridge to the 21st Century."
Mr. Clinton drew his sharpest contrast with Mr. Dole at the very end, saying the real choice was "whether we will build a bridge to the future, or a bridge to the past, about whether we believe our best days are still out there or our best days are behind us, about whether we want a country of people working together or one where you're on your own."
And, as he has repeatedly, Mr. Clinton vowed to protect the most popular, mainstream Government programs from any who would diminish them.
"I could never allow cuts that devastate education for our children, that pollute our environment, that end the guarantee of health care for those served under Medicaid, that end our duty or violate our duty to our parents through Medicare," he said. "I just couldn't do that. As long as I'm President I'll never let it happen."
He continued: "Of course, there is a better answer to this dilemma. We could have the right kind of balanced budget with a new Congress -- a Democratic Congress."
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the scarred, silver-maned war horse of the party's liberal past who briefly flirted with making a bid for the Presidency at the last Democratic convention in Chicago, in 1968, and who scored victories in Congress this summer on the minimum wage and health insurance legislation, started the evening on a full-throated, partisan note. Senator Kennedy mocked Mr. Dole's warning against intolerance to the Republicans in San Diego two weeks ago.
"We are proud of who we are, proud of where we stand and proud of who leads us," Mr. Kennedy told the delegates. "No one in this convention hall has to point to the exit signs to tell the prejudiced, the extremists and the intolerant that they are not welcome here."
And with mirror-image mimicry of one of the most pointed speeches of the Republican Convention, Mr. Kennedy drew raucous cheers and whoops of laughter by turning Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson's hyphenated attacks back against her, denouncing the Republicans' platform as a Trojan Horse of hidden hazards.
Interrupting himself at one point to accommodate the applause, Senator Kennedy declared, "It is the radical wish-list of the education-cutting, environmental-trashing, Medicare-slashing, choice-denying, tolerance-repudiating, gay-bashing, Social-Security-threatening, assault-rifle-coddling, Government-closing, tax-loophole-granting -- there's more, there's more to come -- minimum-wage-opposing Republican majority than dominated the delegations in San Diego."
For weeks, Mr. Clinton's aides have billed his acceptance speech tonight as his first specific effort to sketch out the details of a second term, and the aides and advisers most charged with drafting it -- from Mr. Morris on down -- are squarely in the moderate mold.
Mr. Clinton made two new specific policy promises: a modest proposed tax break for homeowners and tax cuts for businesses providing jobs in depressed areas. The first amounted to a nod to longstanding Republican proposals for cutting capital gains taxes and, the second, a way to assuage the concerns of liberal Democrats that the Republican-sponsored welfare bill Mr. Clinton signed last week would cut off benefits for poor people without providing adequate job opportunities.
Mr. Dole has already endorsed a nearly identical capital gains proposal, and his running mate, Jack Kemp, has long supported the concept of tax incentives to spur economic development in urban "empowerment zones."
White House aides said Mr. Clinton spent virtually the entire day going over drafts of the speech at the dining room table of his 31st-floor hotel suite, reworking triple-spaced computer printouts with a black felt-tipped pen. The aides said President Clinton was so intent that his daughter, Chelsea, joked that he was sitting in exactly the same spot when she returned from a day out on the town at 5 P.M. as he had been at 10 A.M.

HEADLINE: New York, Cradle Of Labor History

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
IT may be hard to imagine, but not far from Manhattan in-spots like the Union Square Cafe and CBGB's, not far from the Bowery and Orchard Street, many of the nation's epic labor battles took place.
In New York City's streets, figures who were titans of their times -- Samuel Gompers, David Dubinsky, Emma Goldman -- led thousands of workers in struggles to end the 60-hour workweek and the treacherous conditions that made the 1911 fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist factory possible. Although New York does not pulse with union struggles as it once did, a tour of its labor sites teaches much about the working conditions New Yorkers once faced and about the people who braved arrests, beatings and wintry weeks picketing to build a better tomorrow. 
 Sixty, 80 and 100 years ago, workers' battles often dominated the news. On the Lower East Side, strikers were set upon by thugs. They were thrown into jail on West 10th Street. They thronged into Union Square for rallies and filled the Cooper Union Great Hall for meetings. In such showdowns, Irish, Italian, German and Jewish immigrants fought to secure the basics that many Americans now take for granted: the 40-hour workweek, a safe workplace and wages high enough to support a family. Many immigrants to New York felt tossed into a sea of brutal capitalism, and they banded together to struggle for the better life they had sought when they left Europe.
Immigrants led some landmark strikes in New York, like the Uprising of the 20,000 in 1909, a three-month walkout by apparel workers that was the first mass strike by women in American history. In a far cry from today's climate, labor's cause was embraced by high society, so much so that Mrs. August Belmont, wife of the renowned millionaire, joined Miss Anne Morgan, J. P.'s daughter, to sponsor a Carnegie Hall benefit to support the 20,000 strikers.
Gompers, a Lower East Side resident who became the American Federation of Labor's first president, called New York City "the cradle of the American labor movement." With all due respect to Detroit and Pittsburgh, there is more labor history per square inch between Chambers Street and Union Square than anywhere else in the nation. In taverns off the Bowery, Gompers helped establish the cigar workers' union, while at the Garden Cafeteria on East Broadway, Socialists, Communists and anarchists debated, over their borscht, whose ideology would create a workers' utopia.
New York may be notorious for bulldozing over its history, but somehow the wrecking ball has spared many sites that served as crucibles for labor.
A walking tour of all of the New York sites would be too ambitious. But a localized labor history tour of Greenwich Village and the Lower East Side is feasible because these neighborhoods are filled with so many squares, meeting halls and tenements that shaped the history of the American worker. This tour does, however, omit some pivotal Manhattan sites, like the Park Row building where Susan B. Anthony founded the Working Woman's Association in 1868 and the Harlem buildings where A. Philip Randolph lived and worked while building the first black-led union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.
Probably the best place to start a tour is the site of the TRIANGLE SHIRTWAIST FACTORY, east of Washington Square at the northwest corner of Washington Place and Greene Street. Here 146 garment workers, almost all of them Jewish or Italian immigrant women, died on March 25, 1911, when a fire swept through the top three floors of the 10-story building. Most were trapped because many exits were locked and there was only one fire escape. At the time, neither fire ladders nor hoses reached above the seventh floor. Rather than be burned alive, many women jumped to their deaths, shocking onlookers who rushed to watch.
New York University now uses the stately building for biology and chemistry studies. The only hint of the place's gruesome history comes from two plaques, one from the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union reading: "Out of their martyrdom came new concepts of social responsibility and labor legislation."
Frances Perkins, a member of the state committee that investigated the fire who became President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor, called the incident "the torch that lit up the whole industrial scene." As a result, the State Legislature passed 36 laws tightening regulations on job safety.
From here, it is a short walk to WASHINGTON SQUARE, where there is a statue of Giuseppe Garibaldi, who united Italy and once worked as a carpenter while living in exile in Staten Island. In 1834, stonemasons clashed with the police at this site while protesting New York University's use of prison labor to construct its early buildings.
Head next to the JEFFERSON MARKET COURTHOUSE, now a public library, at the Avenue of the Americas and West 10th Street. This remarkable 1877 structure, modeled after Ludwig II's castle in Bavaria, has pinnacles, gables and a delicate clock tower. Here the police dragged hundreds of female strikers arrested during the Uprising of the 20,000. The workers went on strike to protest low wages, the requirement that they pay for their needles and thread, and favoritism toward compliant workers. Mrs. Belmont once sat up all night in this courthouse and put up her palatial Madison Avenue mansion as collateral to get several strikers out of jail pending trial.
One judge condemned the women for striking against God, "whose firm law is that man shall earn his bread from the sweat of his brow." George Bernard Shaw, commenting upon the judge's ruling, replied: "Delightful. Medieval America always in the intimate personal confidence of the Almighty."
Nearby are two picturesque cul-de-sacs, PATCHIN PLACE (off West 10th Street, between Greenwich Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas) and MILLIGAN PLACE (on the Avenue of the Americas between West 10th and 11th Streets). Here, rooming houses were built around 1850 for the Basque waiters at the Brevoort Hotel on Fifth Avenue. Patchin Place's tenants included E. E. Cummings, Theodore Dreiser and John Reed, the Harvard dropout turned radical who chronicled the Russian Revolution in the book "Ten Days That Shook the World."
A School for Organizing
Head over to 7 East 15th Street, a building that once housed the nation's first major workers' school, the RAND SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE. Founded in 1906, it taught thousands of workers over 50 years about history, economics and union organizing. Its teachers included John Dewey, Bertrand Russell, Charles Beard and Stephen Vincent Benet.
Next is UNION SQUARE, which contrary to popular belief is not named after labor unions. In 1811, it was already known as Union Place, because two major streets, Bloomingdale (later Broadway) and the Bowery (later Fourth Avenue), intersected here. New York's first Labor Day Parade was held here in 1882, when 25,000 people under a Knights of Labor banner marched for an eight-hour day and a ban on child labor. In 1930, 35,000 demonstrators protested the Depression and clashed with the police here, leaving 100 people injured.
Union Square has been the home of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union and the Amalgamated Bank, the nation's first labor-owned bank, the Communist Party and its newspaper, The Daily Worker. Many artists, including Reginald Marsh and Raphael Soyer, had studios around 14th Street in the 1920's and 1930's and painted working people at this square.
Emma Goldman's Home
Next, walk to 208-210 East 13th Street, an orange-brick tenement where Emma Goldman, the anarchist and advocate of free love, lived from 1903 to 1913. She was born in Lithuania and moved to Rochester, where she worked as a seamstress. Soon after moving to New York City, she earned a reputation as an incendiary leftist orator. Her lover Alexander Berkman tried to assassinate Henry Clay Frick, the steel magnate, during the 1892 Homestead steel strike near Pittsburgh. She was sentenced to a year in jail for incitement to riot after a speech she gave at a Union Square hunger demonstration in 1893 in which she told the poor to steal bread if they could not afford to buy it. She was deported to Russia during the Red Scare of 1919, but she soon condemned that nation's Communist repression.
Nearby, at 12th Street and Fourth Avenue, wealthy women who had joined the Women's Trade Union League supported the ascendant working woman by climbing a ladder each afternoon to beseech apparel workers to join a union.
Head to WEBSTER HALL, at 119 East 11th Street, where Woody Guthrie sang on behalf of unions in the 1930's and where earlier the Socialist magazine The Masses held fund-raising balls. As part of a public-relations effort during the 1910 textile strike in Lawrence, Mass., Margaret Sanger, the Socialist who became famous for promoting birth control, led more than 100 Lawrence children from Grand Central Terminal to Webster Hall for dinner. Afterward, New Yorkers lodged and fed Lawrence children.
Walk next to TOMPKINS SQUARE PARK, at 10th Street and Avenue A. In the recession of 1874, 6,000 protesters from the Workingmen's Party gathered to hear New York's Mayor, William F. Havemeyer, speak about helping the unemployed. When he failed to appear and the police declared the rally illegal, the protesters clashed with the police, injuring hundreds of officers. Gompers cowered in a doorway nearby, and it is said that the riot turned him away from radical unionism.
Then walk along St. Marks Place to COOPER UNION, founded in 1859 by Peter Cooper, the philanthropist who made the first rolled steel railroad tracks and helped Samuel Morse lay the first Atlantic telegraph cable. Cooper created this school to provide free art and technology education to working people. In 1860, Abraham Lincoln gave a major address in the school's Great Hall. In 1909, Gompers led an emotional meeting of shirtwaist workers that authorized the Uprising of the 20,000. "There comes a time," he said, "when not to strike is but to rivet the chains of slavery upon our wrists."
At 64 East Fourth Street was the LABOR LYCEUM, a center for workers' classes, lectures, rallies and social gatherings. This boarded-up building once housed The Volkszeitung, a German-language workers' newspaper, and it was where the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union was founded in 1900.
Just south (at 55 East Third Street and 36 East First Street) are two buildings used by the Catholic Worker movement and its weekly newspaper (which still costs one cent), founded in 1933 by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin. Day, who died in 1980, tirelessly backed pacifism, unions, helping the poor and reconciling Roman Catholicism with radicalism. She inspired many imitators when she opened a soup kitchen in 1933. The two buildings, MARYHOUSE and ST. JOSEPH HOUSE, today shelter several dozen homeless people and provide meals to about 300 people daily.
Commerce and Spirit
Across Houston Street is the Lower East Side, where many of the 1.2 million Jews who immigrated from 1880 to 1920 first settled. Many thronged into the garment trade, often working in sweatshops or sewing at home in their tiny, overcrowded apartments and even on their fire escapes.
Off the Bowery, at 10 and 80 Stanton Street, once stood the taverns where Gompers and other cigar workers met to organize a union. Gompers said the tavern owners complained that the unionists did too much talking and not enough drinking.
Just south of Rivington Street is UNIVERSITY SETTLEMENT, a handsome, dark-brick building at 184 Eldridge Street. Founded in 1886, it is the nation's oldest settlement house, and it provided immigrants with citizenship lessons and English instruction. It also inspired innovations like kindergartens and public baths. Eleanor Roosevelt used to teach dance here.
In a white-painted tenement at 174 Eldridge Street, some early meetings of the Workmen's Circle, a combined immigrants' mutual aid society and Socialist political group, took place in HYMAN LEVY'S APARTMENT.
Raucous Orchard Street, with its bustling shops, remains the neighborhood's commercial and spiritual heart. At 90 Orchard Street is the LOWER EAST SIDE TENEMENT MUSEUM, which uses a 132-year-old tenement to show the dark, sardine can-like conditions in which struggling immigrants once lived. As many as 15 people often inhabited a three-room apartment, and the neighborhood had the world's highest tuberculosis rate.
Throughout the neighborhood, the ghosts of labor remain. At Rivington Street and the Bowery, 30,000 people rallied during a 1912 garment workers' strike. At 127 Rivington was EISLER'S GOLDEN RULE HALL, where, during an 1882 longshoremen's strike, union leaders led 500 Jewish immigrants fresh off the boat to urge them not to work as scabs. Each morning, at the corner of Ludlow and Hester Streets, hundreds of immigrants gathered, hoping to be picked by hiring agents.
From a Polish Village
A surprisingly stylish building stands at 5 Ludlow Street, just above Canal Street. Constructed in 1892, it housed the INDEPENDENT KLETZKER BROTHERLY AID SOCIETY, a mutual aid society set up by workers from Kletzk, a Polish village. Nearby, at 54-58 Canal Street, is the JARMULOVSKY BANK BUILDING. Thousands of immigrants deposited their pennies here, but a panic developed before World War I when many depositors withdrew their money to help relatives flee Europe. On Aug. 4, 1914, Black Tuesday, the bank was ordered closed and riots broke out as thousands of immigrants lost their savings.
Head east to STRAUS SQUARE, at East Broadway and Rutgers Street, once the center of Jewish immigrant life. At the southeast corner, 165 East Broadway, was the Garden Cafeteria, founded in 1911, where Leon Trotsky, Isaac Bashevis Singer and other immigrants schmoozed and debated. It was closed in 1983, and replaced by Wing Shoon, a Chinese restaurant.
THE JEWISH DAILY NEWS was once published at 185 East Broadway. It hired a young apparel worker from Cleveland, Rose Pastor Stokes, to write an advice column. She became known as the Cinderella of the Sweatshops because after she interviewed James Graham Phelps Stokes, a millionaire who helped run University Settlement, he asked her to marry him. She became famous as an advocate of Socialism, Communism and birth control.
At 197 East Broadway is the EDUCATIONAL ALLIANCE, which German Jews who had immigrated four decades earlier founded in 1889 to educate Eastern European Jews, especially in English. Its tranquil rooftop, used for reading and relaxing, was dubbed "tar beach." Sholom Aleichem, the Yiddish writer, once spoke here and was called the Yiddish Mark Twain; later, when Mark Twain spoke here, Aleichem said he was happy to meet the English-language Sholom Aleichem.
The 12-story building at 173-175 East Broadway long dominated the Lower East Side, architecturally and intellectually. It housed THE JEWISH DAILY FORWARD, which was founded in 1897 by Abraham Cahan, a charismatic intellectual and labor advocate. To support Franklin D. Roosevelt's re-election in 1936, Cahan helped found the American Labor Party with David Dubinsky, the garment workers' union president, and Sidney Hillman, president of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers. On the building's facade is a frieze with busts of Marx and Engels, but they have been covered over by the building's current owner, the New York Ling-Liang Church. Still, the Yiddish lettering for Forward remains on the roof parapet.
The Forward's most popular feature was its Bintel Brief, or "bundle of letters," which was a colorful mirror of immigrant life and attitudes.
One letter said, "Dear Editor: I am a Socialist and my boss is a fine man. I know he's a capitalist but I like him. Am I doing something wrong?"
Another letter: "Esteemed Editor: My son is already 26 years old and doesn't want to get married. He says he is a Socialist and he is too busy. Socialism is Socialism, but getting married is important, too."

Shortages and Labor Problems Send Copper Prices Up Sharply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Copper prices surged in New York yesterday as labor problems at a number of mines and smelters led to fears of shortages.
On other commodities markets, heating oil and unleaded gasoline retreated. 
 Copper prices rose after an unexpectedly small increase in London Metal Exchange stockpiles. The exchange did not release a warehouse inventory report on Tuesday, and said yesterday that its stocks had increased 3,968 tons, to 303,439 tons. Expectations were for an increase of nearly 10,000 tons.
Announcements of labor problems added to uncertainty about supply.
The state-owned Chilean copper producer Codelco announced that a strike was planned at one of its divisions, and a strike in Namibia also supported prices.
Both operations contribute a relatively small amount of copper to world stocks, but many smelters have not been running at full capacity because of production problems.
"It's just not a bad time to buy some copper," said Wayne Atwell, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. "The economy is strong here, it's picking up in Europe and consumer demand is rising."
Copper for December delivery rose 4.55 cents, to 95.25 cents a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest price for an active contract since June 26.
The expiring September gasoline and heating oil contracts retreated on the New York Mercantile Exchange because of profit taking after several days of strong gains.
The losses, however, were limited. Tight nearby supplies are likely to support prices in the short term, said John Saucer, an analyst with Smith Barney in Houston.
Reserves of heating oil and other distillates are about 17 percent below levels of a year earlier, while gasoline stockpiles are 3 percent below normal.
September unleaded gasoline fell 0.90 cent, to 62.82 cents a gallon, and September heating oil fell 0.85 cent, to 62.82 cents a gallon. October crude oil rose 60 cents, to $22.25 a barrel.

Dollar Rises in Choppy Session As Higher U.S. Rates Are Seen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most leading currencies yesterday, holding onto gains made from a second day of strong economic data that pointed to higher interest rates in the United States.
"It's been pretty volatile," Chris Iggo, an international economist with Barclays Bank P.L.C., said of the choppy moves by the dollar before it ended higher in light, pre-holiday trading that saw many traders taking off by early afternoon. 
 In late trading in New York, the dollar stood at 108.92 Japanese yen, up from 108.30 yen on Thursday, and 1.4808 German marks, up from 1.4764 marks. But the dollar slipped against the British pound, which rose to $1.5620 from $1.5575.
The dollar was bolstered in European trading after Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, was quoted by the German Press Agency (D.P.A.) as saying the economic fundamentals of the United States "show that the dollar could be somewhat higher."
"Initially, the dollar was just up on these Tietmeyer comments overnight," said Richard Vullo, a vice president at Hypo Bank. "We came in with a stronger dollar."
But the dollar fell in early trading in New York, following the stock and bond markets lower on reports of rising consumer confidence and higher orders received by factories in the United States.
These were among other indications that the United States had a more robust economy than analysts had thought and than the markets had wanted.
Yesterday was the second consecutive decline in American stock and bond markets. Investors fear that signs of strong growth will soon prompt the Federal Reserve to push short-term interest rates higher.
But higher rates can help make the dollar more attractive by increasing returns on new investments in dollar-denominated assets.
A Federal Reserve governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, helped the dollar yesterday with comments that traders interpreted as indicating that the Fed might be ready to raise interest rates.
The central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee next meets on Sept. 24.
"The main feature here is that the dollar gave back early gains following stocks and bonds lower but is well supported by the notion the Fed will have to move as early as the September F.O.M.C. meeting," said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn.
In other currency trading, the dollar rose to 5.0685 French francs, from 5.0580 French francs on Thursday and to 1.2024 Swiss francs, from 1.1944 francs.

HEADLINE: Journal;
Sex, Drugs And Dole

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
Is it true that Dick Morris shared the First Lady's and the Vice President's convention speeches with a prostitute days before they were delivered to the public? If so, let history note that this is the first recorded instance of the official oratory of either Hillary Clinton or Al Gore being used as an aphrodisiac.
The Democrats were certainly asking for this mess. Those who live by the infomercial die by the infomercial. There were 15,000 journalists gathered at Chicago's United Center with nothing but Harry Thomason's scripted show to cover, and 15,000 journalists abhor a news blackout as surely as nature does a vacuum. Mr. Morris, by choosing to play a scene from the wrong Thomason script ("Designing Women"), rode valiantly to the press's rescue, and, with impeccable showmanship, did so in the final reel. 
 But before Republicans get too giddy, they should remember that Mr. Morris, a bipartisan cad, may have spilled secrets about such other clients as Trent Lott and Jesse Helms at Washington's Jefferson Hotel. And they should remember that their candidate, as prone to repeating self-destructive behavior as is Mr. Clinton, remains remarkably inept. If Mr. Morris's alleged misadventures were the week's most profusely covered political story, the least covered, no less significant, was the Dole campaign's continued haplessness.
As the preponderance of the nation's political press partied on in Chicago, the Republican standard-bearer was on a "working vacation" in California. Heaven help the G.O.P. once Mr. Dole resumes stumping full time. In Santa Barbara on Tuesday, the same day that brought the first of the week's several positive economic indicators (a rising consumer confidence rating), he flatly declared that "the economy's in the tank." On Wednesday in Ventura, he started flip-flopping yet again about tobacco. On Wednesday night he responded to Al Gore's anti-tobacco speech in Chicago by calling the Vice President a "hatchet man" -- a bizarre choice of epithet, given its association with the low points of Mr. Dole's own career that he'd presumably like voters to forget.
Still, these self-immolating asides are nothing next to the overarching theme of Mr. Dole's week -- his repeated speeches pinning the rise of drug use among America's young entirely on the Clinton Administration. So shrill was the attack and so far-fetched was Mr. Dole's own proposed drug-prevention policy, which stopped just short of calling for the carpet-bombing of Latin America, that anyone could see that the candidate was once again playing the generational card. By attributing all drug criminality to the White House, Mr. Dole was reinforcing the combative thrust of his San Diego acceptance speech, in which he assaulted all the President's men and women as an "elite" who "never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed," and offered himself as "a bridge" to a far more moral generation, his own.
The political wisdom of such generational warfare has always been cloudy. Why risk alienating some 76 million baby boomers, all potential voters? Perhaps this week Mr. Dole was betting that the Democrats, once back at the scene of their '68 blowout, would prove counterculture recidivists. Maybe a Clinton aide or two would get busted for drugs by a new Mayor Daley and conveniently provide lurid TV imagery to support boomer-bashing rhetoric.
This was not to be. Though Crosby, Stills & Nash and a revival of "Hair" were in proximity, Chicago '96 was more tourist trap than acid trip. When the surviving members of the Chicago Seven reunited, it was only for the purpose of waxing nostalgic on "Larry King Live."
Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton, walking though the door opened for them by their opponent's speech in San Diego, impaled Mr. Dole on the generational issue by recasting it as the age issue in their own acceptance speeches. With the determination of brainwashers, they repeatedly inverted his metaphorical use of the word "bridge," wielding the phrase "bridge to the 21st century" as a battering ram to portray him as an out-of-touch relic of a distant past.
So far Mr. Dole and his handlers seem more than willing to cooperate. With enemies like these, Mr. Clinton will have no trouble surviving friends like Dick Morris.

HEADLINE: Cracks Appear Yet Again In Transit Authority Buses

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
A problem that has plagued the Transit Authority repeatedly over the years is back: at least 50 relatively new buses, battered by New York City's washboard streets, have developed cracks, officials said yesterday.
The buses were built in 1993 by Bus Industries of America, a company that was based in Oriskany, N.Y., but that no longer exists. They have fractures in the beams and plates that hold up their rear floors, and in external panels above the rear wheel wells. Some of the cracks are as much as four inches long, and are visible to the naked eye. 
 "At this point, it's probably something that we can very easily fix, and keep it from becoming a structural problem," said Millard L. Seay, the Transit Authority's senior vice president in charge of buses. "It's one of those things that clearly, if you let it go three or four more years, it could be a serious issue."
In the bus industry, the Transit Authority is widely regarded as the toughest customer in the country. Largely because of the demands on city buses -- heavy passenger loads, pothole-scarred streets, frequent stops and starts and 24-hour operation -- the authority has more stringent specifications for construction than any other transit agency. Only two manufacturers' buses have met its standards in recent years, and most bus makers refuse even to try.
"We think some of their requirements are unreasonable," an official of one bus company that has not bid on a New York contract in many years said on condition of anonymity. "But to some degree, they just have to insist on higher tolerances than anyone else because of the punishment the buses have to take."
Several batches of buses have developed cracks over the last couple of decades, most notably those built in the early 1980's by Flxible, a Grumman Corporation subsidiary. The authority eventually decided that the problems with the Flxible buses were so intractable that it got rid of all 850 of them when they were still relatively new. Yet many of those buses had a long second incarnation with New Jersey Transit, running on more forgiving roads.
Mr. Seay said that conditions in New York may well have something to do with the latest spate of cracks. "Clearly, New York is a different environment than just about any other place," he said. "We run the buses longer and harder than anyone else, and we have tougher streets than most cities."
Since the cracks began to turn up a few months ago, the authority has checked 350 buses of similar vintage made by Bus Industries of America -- about 10 percent of the total fleet -- and found that 50 had cracks. "More than likely, it will show up in others as we go along," he said.
The buses are still under warranty, and transit officials said they were sure that the authority would not have to pay for the repairs.
Bus Industries of America, which had chronic financial troubles, was a subsidiary of Ontario Bus Industries, which was owned by the province of Ontario, Canada. Ontario Bus was later bought out by a private company, Orion Bus Industries, but New York City transit officials said they believed that as a condition of the deal, the province of Ontario, and not Orion, was responsible for making good on the warranty.
Officials at Ontario's Ministry of Economic Development in Toronto did not return phone calls yesterday.
The cracks were detected as buses were taken in for a routine three-year overhaul, and will be fixed as part of that overhaul without significantly delaying their return to service, Mr. Seay said. He said it may just be a matter of welding the fractures and welding new supports into place under the rear floors. How difficult and time-consuming that will be will depend, he said, on whether the repair can be made without removing the floors.
The Transit Authority has had trouble not just keeping its buses running, but buying enough of them. Its main supplier over the last 15 years, the Transportation Manufacturing Corporation of New Mexico, has had recurring financial troubles, and it has at times fallen far behind on its orders, as did Bus Industries of America. As a result, the authority has kept more than 1,000 buses in service past their scheduled 12-year retirement age.

HEADLINE: Mixed Signs in Flurry of Economic Data

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 30

 BODY:
The United States economy is giving mixed signals, but financial markets reacted today to two nongovernmental indicators that depicted the economy as picking up speed quickly after a midyear lull.
The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago said its overall index soared to 60 in August from 51.2 in July. An index reading higher than 50 means manufacturers that reported improved business outnumbered those that reported deteriorating conditions. And a report from the University of Michigan showed that its final index of consumer sentiment for August rose to 95.3 from 94.7 in July -- the highest reading since January 1995. 
 For many investors, those signs of an economy powering ahead overshadowed an early morning Commerce Department report that showed consumer spending rose only two-tenths of 1 percent last month.
That was an improvement from June's decline of four-tenths of 1 percent but only half the four-tenths of 1 percent average monthly increase for the first seven months of the year. Weak spending on autos and other big-ticket goods restrained the July spending increase.
Also, personal income inched up just a tenth of 1 percent in July -- the weakest showing since January and a noticeable reduction from June's nine-tenths of 1 percent increase and the five-tenths of 1 percent average for the first seven months of the year.
In response to the signs of the economy's heating up, stock and bond prices plunged for a second consecutive day. The concern is that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to try to cool the economy.
"It's the best of both worlds if you're a manufacturer, but it's the worst of all worlds for the Federal Reserve," Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Bank, said.
Signals of quick growth also came from the Government. Orders placed with American factories rose in July to the highest level on record, led by demand for electronics and industrial machinery, Commerce Department figures showed. The 1.8 percent increase for the month was double what analysts had expected.
The president of the National Association of Manufacturers, Jerry J. Jasinowski, who for months has been arguing against a rate increase by the Fed, said July's small rise in spending led him to conclude investors were overreacting.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 11/32 points, to 9516/32 , after the day's second wave of economic reports was released at 10 A.M. The long bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose 9 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.12 percent. Stocks also fell. The Dow Jones industrial average, after slumping almost 60 points, closed down 31.44 at 5,616.21.
The Commerce Department also said today that disposable income increased a tenth of 1 percent in July, while the savings rate was unchanged from a month earlier at 5.3 percent.
Because it accounts for two-thirds of economic activity, consumer spending provides a key indicator of where the economy is going. Based on the findings of the last two months -- June's consumer spending decline turned out to be twice as large as the two-tenths of 1 percent loss originally estimated a month ago -- the message from today's Commerce Department spending report was mixed.
Still, retail sales have increased since a stall in July, which analysts linked to people's staying home to watch television coverage of the Olympic Games.

HEADLINE: Unbridled Wanderlust;
Vacationers Are Hitting the Road in Record Numbers

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Vacationers have taken to the roads and the air in record numbers this summer, undaunted by fires in national parks, power failures in the West, a hurricane threat that forced widespread evacuations in the Southeast and unseasonably cold, rainy weather from New England to the Carolinas. Not even the crash of T.W.A. Flight 800 curbed their wanderlust.
"From every report we've gotten, we feel confident it was another record summer," the third in a row, Shawn Flaherty, a spokeswoman for the nonprofit Washington-based Travel Industry Association of America, said this week of the travel season that officially ends this weekend. She said that the number of individual trips of at least 100 miles taken by Americans during June, July and August would apparently rise 2 percent from last year's record. 
 As another example, the number of miles flown by paying passengers increased 6.5 percent in July over a year earlier, and the percentage of seats occupied by paying passengers on airline flights rose to 74.3 percent in July from 71.7 percent a year earlier, according to the Air Transport Association. In fact, the seat occupancy, or "load factor," for the entire industry so far this year is 71.7 percent, far higher than 1995's record 67 percent, which was the highest since World War II.
To the surprise of some travel officials, the crash of Paris-bound T.W.A. Flight 800 on July 17 appeared to have had no measurable impact on international travel. "There was some talk at the time of that happening, but the people I talk to say there's been no impact," said Jon F. Ash, managing director of Global Aviation Associates, a consulting firm in Washington. "Instead, demand for Europe is probably up 4 percent this summer, and load factors almost everywhere are very high." AMR's American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and UAL's United Airlines also say their advance bookings are well ahead of last year's.
Indeed, Americans apparently fulfilled European Travel Commission predictions of a record 4.9 million American visitors this summer. The commission expects a record 9 million for all of 1996.
United Airlines averaged more than 80 percent of its seats filled this summer on its routes to Europe. And its nine daily flights to Hawaii averaged 93.9 percent two weeks ago. With practically every flight full, the lead item in United's employee newsletter said: "Going to Hawaii? Make backup travel plans."
Backup plans were not a bad idea on the ground either. Marriott International said its occupancy rate this summer averaged as much as 12 percent above the national average, which would put Marriott occupancies around 80 percent. Occupancy at Manor Care's Choice International hotels -- Comfort, Quality, Clarion, Sleep, Econo Lodge and Rodeway -- averaged 9.2 percent higher this summer than last summer. Both the increases are exceptionally strong for the hotel industry, and come on top of a strong summer last year.
The reasons for the disaster-defying summer, tourist officials agree, are a relatively strong American economy, the dollar's gathering strength against European currencies and a decline in gasoline prices from their peak of $1.38 a gallon on May 24 (although still almost 8 cents a gallon higher than in August 1995). Also, "You had more air fare sales than I can ever remember, although some were from a higher base than last year," said Jerry Cheske, a spokesman for the American Automobile Association in Heathrow, Fla.
In late June, Continental Airlines slashed domestic fares as much as 40 percent for travel through September, and other carriers basically matched the sale prices on directly competitive routes.
Yet while air fares, gasoline prices and the cost of meals and lodging obviously have an effect on travel, attitudes may be even more decisive. Statistical evidence suggests that Americans increasingly regard travel and tourism as an important part of their life style.
Total trips taken by Americans increased 45 percent from 1985 to 1995, even as the population grew only 10 percent, according to a survey of 18,000 households by the Travel Industry Association of America. And the percentage of American adults who took at least one trip of 100 miles or more away from home in 1995 rose to 76 percent from 63 percent a decade earlier.
The automobile association predicted last spring that summer vacationers would spend an average of 8.5 nights away from home this summer, compared with 7.9 nights last year, but that a family of four would spend the same $1,076 this year as last, and Mr. Cheske said the figures still looked to be on target.
Jim Sortino, owner of the Sleep Inn in Sandusky, Ohio, the site of Cedar Point Amusement Park, said that even though bad weather kept people away in May and June, July and August resulted in one of Sandusky's biggest seasons ever.
California has had an especially strong summer tourist season. Although attendance was down at Sequoia National Park, whose giant, ancient trees for a time were threatened by wildfires, Universal Studios and other theme parks chalked up record attendance, and Los Angeles and San Diego enjoyed their highest hotel occupancies in years. San Diego tourism officials said the Republican convention, which drew thousands of delegates and journalists, was an added bonus for the city's hotels and restaurants.
Orlando, Fla., and surrounding towns also had good summers, as did even steamy New Orleans, which was host to this summer's Junior Olympics and increased its convention business with lower summer rates for hotels.
The national parks appear to be "booming as usual," Elaine Sevy, a National Parks Service spokeswoman, said, despite the problems at Sequoia and at the Cape Hatteras, N.C., National Seashore, where visitors fled Hurricane Bertha's fury.
Attendance at Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee and North Carolina has been up slightly over last summer, Bill Miller, a spokesman there, said, adding that it might have been even higher, were it not for the Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
While the Games proved to be a bonanza for Atlanta and nearby cities -- with almost two million visitors spending an estimated $4 billion, according to the Georgia Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism -- tourist industry officials from Wilmington, N.C., with its miles of ocean-front beaches, to the Florida state line said they had received little spillover.
A sampling of some smaller attractions turned up a mixed record. The Lawrence Welk homestead in Strasburg, N.D., had a "very good" summer, according to Rosemary Schaefbauer, the president of Pioneer Heritage, Inc., which maintains the site in memory of the musician who died in 1992. Overall attendance is up only about 4 percent from the usual summer average of 5,000 visitors, but souvenir sales have risen, she said.
The National Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City is off about 7 percent this summer, according to M. J. Van Deventer, the director of publications, perhaps because of a $36 million expansion program in advance of the Sept. 22 opening of the hall's yearlong Frederick Remington exhibition -- the biggest Remington exhibition ever assembled. But, Ms. Van Deventer added, hundreds of cars with out-of-state license plates come to Oklahoma City each weekend to view the site of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal building, where 168 people were killed in an April 1995 bombing.
Across the country, vacationers with advance reservations still flocked to the beaches from the New Jersey shore to as far south as Myrtle Beach, S.C. -- even though it sometimes meant wearing sweaters and sleeping beneath blankets.
While beach concessionaires suffered from the cold, rainy weather, tourists found other places to spend their dollars.
"If they didn't go to the beach, they went shopping, or ate out more often," said Linda Conlin, the director of tourism for New Jersey. "So many of our retailers still benefited." More than half of New Jersey's $22.9 billion in tourist revenue last year came from the shore communities, including Atlantic City, whose casinos appear to have profited from the forgettable weather.
Las Vegas, Nev., the other major gambling mecca, had a big summer, as usual, with hotel occupancy up about 3 percent. When the second blackout that hit the West this summer knocked out power several hours for millions of people in at least nine states in August, Las Vegas casinos simply switched to backup generators, and the good times continued to roll.
"The blackout affected air-conditioners and electricity in private houses," said Myram Borders, a spokeswoman for Las Vegas. "So a lot of local residents went to the casinos to eat in order to stay cool."
Adversity had its compensations elsewhere, as well. When the approach of Hurricane Bertha forced Bill and Gloria Gillette of Cleveland to vacate the Outer Banks of North Carolina a day before their vacation was to end, they and their two children drove inland to Virginia's Skyline Drive and made an unscheduled stop at Monticello, the home and burial place of Thomas Jefferson, who designed it.
"The evacuation turned out to be a bonus," said Mr. Gillette, the executive editor of Hotel & Motel Management magazine, "because we got to see another part of the country."

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Fall Again on Fears of Fed Move

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities continued Thursday's retreat yesterday as more economic evidence suggested that the economy was not slowing as much as many investors had hoped, making a Federal Reserve move to push up interest rates increasingly likely.
In an abbreviated session, ahead of Monday's Labor Day holiday, the 30-year bond tumbled 11/32 , to a price of 9516/32 to yield 7.12 percent, up from 7.03 percent on Thursday. The yield is the highest since July 9, when it was 7.13 percent. 
 Investor concern was fed by data on July factory orders, which rose a larger-than-expected 1.8 percent, double what the market had expected. Furthermore, the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, increased to 60 in August from 51.2 in July, well above the expected 53.1 reading, and the final number on the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for August rose to 95.3, from July's reading of 94.7. The latest figure was the highest since January 1995.
Jack Ablin, director of fixed-income securities and senior fund manager at the Private Bank of the Bank of Boston, said the market saved its strongest reaction for the purchasing managers' report. "The fact is, it was a good predictor of the National Association of Purchasing Management report the last time around, so people obviously took notice today," he said. The national report for August is due for release at 10 A.M. on Tuesday.
Mr. Ablin said, however, that the wild card in the mix of economic data is labor. The question is whether there is a tight labor market, and consequent price acceleration. "The only other unanswered question is the Fed," he said. "We don't believe they will tighten in September, but there is certainly more evidence for those in the September camp who expect a rate rise."
Discussing the personal income and spending data, Mr. Ablin said the rise of one-tenth of 1 percent in income was only a bit above the expectation for a drop of one-tenth of 1 percent, while spending came in right on expectations, with a gain of two-tenths of 1 percent.
Ken McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, a research firm, said, "Confirming earlier releases, the income and spending report shows that the economy was growing more slowly as it entered the second half of 1996."
He said the small increase in income was centered on nonwage components like dividends, interest, transfer payments and proprietor's income, all of which rose enough in July to offset a drop of one-tenth of 1percent in wages and salaries.
"Although the markets have suddenly turned jittery over the possbility that the economy is not slowing," Mr. McCarthy said, "the data we have seen so far certainly suggest that the economy continues to grow at a moderate pace."
In his opinion, the economy is not strong enough to create inflationary pressures, and he, therefore, does not expect the Fed to move between now and the end of the year.
Jack Regan, chief derivative strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, took another view. Yesterday's numbers, he said, are compounding the feeling within the market that the economy has more strength and is moving ahead faster than previously thought. Mr. Regan said he saw a change in the market's perception, and that is "that the Fed is now behind the curve and that on or if not before the next F.O.M.C. meeting on Sept. 24, the Fed may find it necessary to tighten."
"Some talk of a 50-basis-point increase in interest rates," Mr. Regan said, adding, "I think the Fed will wait to see next week's data."
The statistics due next week include the leading indicators, the national purchasing managers' report, auto sales and, on Friday, the all-important employment data.
"Today the market probably priced in about a 25-basis-point move by the Fed," Mr. Regan said, "next week we could see another 25 priced in if the data continue to show stronger-than-expected strength."

HEADLINE: The Easy One In Tax Breaks: Who's Against Homeowners?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
It's not hard to guess what homeowners will think of the very similar plans offered by Bob Dole and Bill Clinton to expand tax breaks on home sales. Both are intended to eliminate taxes on capital gains on all but the most profitable homes.
Nor is it hard to see why both candidates were quick to embrace the idea. The beneficiaries will mostly be affluent suburbanites in states with high housing costs whose votes and campaign donations could spell the difference between victory and defeat in November. Moreover, the cost will be minimal since few home sellers today pay capital gains taxes anyway. 
 "This cat is 99 percent out of the bag," explained Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley. Freeing it entirely, he suggests, might actually help the economy by encouraging homeowners to "trade down," taking their profits out of their houses and investing them elsewhere.
Owner-occupied housing is already king of the very large hill of deductions, credits, deferrals and exemptions that riddle the Federal tax system. Among the most prized of these preferences: taxes on capital gains from the sale of a principal residence are deferred indefinitely if the seller buys an equally valuable house within two years. Sellers age 55 or over can also take a one-time, tax-free capital gain of $125,000 with no strings attached.
Bob Dole would retain the tax deferral for sellers who soon buy another house. But his plan would also let sellers of any age have the option of realizing up to $250,000 in capital gains tax free for houses owned for five years, with an extra $25,000-a-year exemption for longer tenure. Hence a family that bought a house for $125,000 and sold it 30 years later for $1,000,000 -- an $875,000 capital gain -- would owe no tax. Nor would there be a limit to the number of times the exemption could be claimed.
President Clinton's alternative is less generous in some ways and more in others. Unlike Mr. Dole, he would end the capital gains deferral on house sales. But a seller could take a maximum of $500,000 in tax-free capital gains on the sale of a principal residence every two years.
Both plans, then, would eliminate Federal tax liability on all but a narrow sliver of home sales. And both would be selective in awarding the goodies, favoring the rich over the middle-income homeowners who generally have smaller capital gains and lower tax rates on the gains they do realize. "The benefits would be distributed regressively," Joel Slemrod, an economist at the University of Michigan Business School, said.
The generational and regional distribution of the benefits within income groups would also be capricious. Winners would mostly be people who bought houses before the run-up in prices from 1975 to 1990, not to mention residents in a few urban areas on the East and West Coasts -- Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay area, Seattle, New York City, Boston -- where housing prices rose into the stratosphere.
But most economists, for all their complaints about the politically inspired tax advantages enjoyed by homeowners in general, do not seem disturbed by the latest proposals. And in large part, their attitude follows from the fact that the latest proposals would cost the Treasury very little.
Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the existing combination of deferral of capital gains on rollovers and the one-time $125,000 credit at age 55 will reduce tax revenues by a bit more than $20 billion this year. But decisions to sell houses are now so carefully tuned to tax consequences that the additional breaks would probably add only a few hundred million dollars to the annual revenue loss.
"Hardly anybody pays the capital gains tax on housing, so eliminating it wouldn't make much difference," said Harvey Rosen, an economist at Princeton University who was a deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury for tax analysis in the Bush Administration.
That, of course, makes broadening the capital gains exemption a deficit-conscious Presidential candidate's dream. Here, after all, is a tax break with great popular appeal that requires only modest offsetting revenues. And here, miracle of miracles, is a tax break that even passes muster with policy wonks -- and for many of the same reasons that it would please homeowners.
For one thing, the tax break would eliminate the "lock in" effect for people inclined to move to smaller quarters or to become renters -- say, when their children leave home -- but who are loath to pay taxes on what are often the profits of a lifetime. Those most affected within this group are people in their late 40's and early 50's who can now take a $125,000 gain tax free only if they wait until age 55.
It is even conceivable, Mr. Auerbach says, that the tax change would reduce the overall demand for large houses, partly offsetting existing tax-induced distortions that virtually all economists agree funnel too much of Americans' savings into housing at the expense of investment in productivity-enhancing industrial capital. This inclination to downsize, incidentally, might also gradually bring down the price of large houses.
Note, too, that the change would eliminate a source of friction between taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service. Under current law, homeowners must keep records of housing purchases and improvements indefinitely, carefully distinguishing outlays for capital improvements from spending on maintenance. A lot of home sellers never even file the proper forms. Under the Dole and Clinton plans, the record-keeping would be greatly simplified.
The only real downside, Mr. Slemrod suggests, is the erosion of the spirit that animates calls for a fundamental overhaul of the tax system. All the major tax plans floated over the last two years -- everything from the Forbes flat tax to the Lugar national sales tax -- envisioned a broadening of the tax base and a winnowing of special preferences. But the enthusiasm with which both the Dole and Clinton campaigns have embraced these latest targeted tax breaks demonstrates just how hard it is to take the politics out of tax policy.

HEADLINE: Arafat's Call for Prayer Protest Gets Modest Response

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Aug. 30

 BODY:
A rigid Israeli police cordon and an apparent shortage of enthusiasm among Palestinians made for a modest and peaceful turnout today at Al Aksa Mosque, where Yasir Arafat had called on Palestinians to converge for protest prayers.
Palestinian officials said about 15,000 worshipers gathered at the mosque here, and the Israeli police put the number at 8,000. On a normal Friday, the holy day for Muslims, the sacred site draws as many as 50,000. 
 Palestinian spokesmen blamed a taut Israeli security operation, in which thousands of policemen and soldiers blocked roads from the West Bank and checked identity papers in Jerusalem to prevent Palestinians without permits from entering the city.
"They are fighting people economically and socially, and even banning them from practicing their worship," declared Hassan Tahboub, the minister of Islamic affairs in the Palestinian Authority, who had predicted that more than 100,000 would heed Mr. Arafat's call.
But a tour of the checkpoints showed relatively few Palestinians trying to pass, and many Jerusalem residents, who had no trouble reaching the mosque, stayed away. There was also no sign that Israeli Arabs had come in any large numbers.
Palestinians gave varying explanations for the evident shortage of interest. Chief among them was a sense that a four-hour strike called by Mr. Arafat for Thursday had already produced results, reducing the sense of urgency.
"The turnout was not a failure for Arafat," said Mofid Abu Rabbo, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council from Tulkarm. "Yesterday's strike was successful, so today there was no seriousness in dealing with this. The strike achieved its aims and had results and there were contacts between the two sides."
The contacts, prominently reported on evening television programs in Arabic and Hebrew, included one between a lawyer close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Yitzhak Molho, and Mr. Arafat; another between Mr. Netanyahu's foreign affairs adviser, Dore Gold, and Mr. Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, and a third between the chief Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, Dan Shomron and Saeb Erekat.
There were also reports that Mr. Netanyahu had a long telephone conversation about the Palestinian situation with King Hussein of Jordan and that the Israeli leader received an urgent message from President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. Another report said the United States Ambassador, Martin Indyk, held a secret meeting with Mr. Arafat in Ramallah on Tuesday to deliver a message from President Clinton.
Though no details of the discussions were disclosed, the meetings were followed by speculation that a major development was imminent in the stalled Israeli-Palestinian relations, and that a meeting between Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat could be announced soon. Mr. Netanyahu's reluctance to meet with Mr. Arafat has been viewed as one of the obstacles to resuming peace talks.
These reports evidently lowered the sense of urgency that Mr. Arafat had generated when he declared on Wednesday that Israeli policies on settlements and on Jerusalem were effectively a "declaration of war against the Palestinian people."
Palestinian officials further noted that Mr. Arafat did not press the call for prayers too energetically. His original appeal on Wednesday was less forceful than his call for the general strike, and Palestinians said no efforts were made to spread the summons through neighborhoods. Mr. Arafat himself went to Nablus today for prayers and meetings with local officials.
Some Palestinians suggested that Mr. Arafat's call for prayers in Jerusalem was intended more as a signal to the Israelis than as an actual summons to mass protest -- that it was meant to show Israelis that Mr. Arafat was not abandoning his claim to the city, which Mr. Netanyahu has declared to be solely and eternally Israeli.
Abdul Malik Dahamshe, an Arab member of the Israeli Parliament, said Mr. Arafat's call came as a surprise, and left no time for leaders to organize. "There was no coordination with us, it was a spontaneous call," he said.
Hatem Abdul Kader, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, said "the call was not organized in a way that would allow a flood of worshipers to pray in Al Aksa."
"In my opinion," he added, "the call for prayer was more for the media than for the people in the streets. If Arafat wanted it, it would have had another shape. He wanted to send a signal to Israel and the world."
Mr. Kader also said the lukewarm reaction of Palestinians from Jerusalem reflected their dissatisfaction with the Palestinian Authority and Mr. Arafat. "The citizens are not satisfied with the way the Authority is acting," he said. "There's no transparency, no accountability, and Jerusalemites feel the Authority has a lack of interest in Jerusalem."
The mounting pressures on Mr. Netanyahu to start dealing with the Palestinians were countered by new pressures from his right-wing Government. The evening news program reported that Ariel Sharon, the Minister of Infrastructures and one of the staunchest hard-liners in the Government, angrily protested at a Cabinet meeting his exclusion from the team negotiating with the Palestinians. Among Cabinet members, only Mr. Netanyahu and Foreign Minister David Levy are on the negotiating committee.
"I will not be a consultant to the Government," Mr. Sharon stormed. "The subject of Hebron was one of the main reasons I joined the Government."

HEADLINE: Tokyo Stocks at 5-Month Low, Reflecting Worries Over Growth

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 30

 BODY:
Japan's benchmark stock index plunged to its lowest level in five months today, led by declines in shares of car and steel makers, reflecting concern that Japan's economic growth has stalled.
"The recovery is much weaker than anyone expected," said Yoshio Inamura, who manages 50 billion yen at Tokyo-Mitsubishi Asset Management Ltd. "There's nothing positive for the market. It can only be flat or sink." 
 The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index fell 386.26, or 1.88 percent, to 20,166.90, the lowest since it fell to 19,923.7 on March 14. It was the index's biggest one-day decline since July 24. For the week the index fell 5.6 percent.
The announcement on Wednesday of an unexpected decline in the Bank of Japan's closely watched "tankan" survey of business sentiment led to concern Japan's economic recovery has yet to take hold, and the market fell Wednesday, Thursday and today.
Shares of steelmakers and other companies that tend to track the performance of the overall economy, known as cyclicals, led the decliners.
The NKK Corporation fell 4 yen, to 287, while the Kawasaki Steel Corporation shares slipped 6 yen, to 365.
Among the auto makers. Toyota fell 30 yen, to 2,620; Nissan lost 17 yen, to 813; Suzuki was down 20 yen, to 1,240, and Isuzu Motors plunged 22 yen, to 548.
The Nippon Metal Industry Company, which makes stainless steel, fell 27 yen, to 427, after forecasting a pretax loss of 1.8 billion yen ($16.6 million) for the half-year ending in September.
Reports that the Government may be reluctant to continue pumping up the economy with public spending also hurt shares, said Hiroshi Masuda, equity trading manager at the Yamaichi Securities Company.
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told reporters in Hawaii Thursday that it was too early to discuss whether the Government should compile a supplementary budget for this fiscal year.

HEADLINE: Drums That Beat Out the Sounds of Home;
A Corner of Central Park Has Become a Gathering Spot for Sunday Rumba

BYLINE: By MIRTA OJITO 

 BODY:
Directions to a Sunday party: enter Central Park near the Dakota on West 72d Street and walk through Strawberry Fields past the John Lennon memorial. Right about there, if the wind is blowing a certain way, you'll hear the insistent call of the drums. Tum-taca-taca-tum.
Follow it. 
 There, by the side of the Lake, you will find a piece of Cuba, or of its music, which for many of the drummers and listeners who gather here every Sunday is the same.
"This, and nothing but this, is the essence of being Cuban," said Arturo Cuenca, 40, a painter who left Cuba six years ago and now lives in Manhattan. "I didn't know that in Cuba. I learned it from a distance. Here, with these drums."
These drums have lured Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans -- and just about anybody who cares about rumba -- to Central Park for a long time. They offer free weekly entertainment for New Yorkers of a certain sensibility. And more importantly for some, they offer what many immigrants are perpetually searching for: a whiff of home, a space where people ask not what country you come from, but what town.
It is here, perhaps more than in any other place in New York, where many Cubans feel at home. This is the one corner of the city where they encounter old friends, enjoy homemade Cuban food, and effortlessly revert to rapid-fire Spanish.
"I have found people here that I hadn't seen for years," said Rosa Nieses-Torres two Sundays ago. "I come here as much as I can. I was born and raised in the old part of Havana, where this sort of thing was an everyday event.
"Coming here is spiritual for me," said Ms. Nieses-Torres, a college literature professor who came to New York from Cuba in 1979. "It's an act of remembrance; a ritual."
It starts with the music.
The drummers begin arriving shortly after noon.
Eddie Bobe is one of them.
Mr. Bobe was born 36 years ago in Puerto Rico to a Cuban father and a Puerto Rican mother, and the beat of the drums "is in his blood."
"I'm following a tradition, that's all," he said, wiping the sweat from his brow with an open palm. "For me, it's a cultural expression, a way of defining who I am, because rumba means people. The instruments alone can't do it. You need to have people to have rumba."
Before long, a crowd has gathered.
Mothers with babies in strollers sit on the green benches. Young couples share an old blanket on the lawn. Old men respectfully stand by the drums, waiting for the first cue to join in the chorus. Food vendors peddle their dishes: pasteles and tamales from Puerto Rico; cod fritters and rice with chicken from Cuba. A man sells beer out of a brown plastic bag packed with ice.
The drums attract a mixed crowd: the die-hard rumba aficionados, the tourists who stop to take yet another picture of New York City life (some make awkward attempts to follow the rhythm with their hips) and the nostalgic types who come not just for the music but also for a slice of Caribbean warmth and camaraderie in the land of McDonald's and rock-and-roll.
And then there are the curious passers-by who stay for so long that eventually someone hands them an instrument. There seems to be a silent command behind the friendly gesture: here, you make music, too.
It happened to Iwao Sado, 48, a sushi chef who came to New York from California 11 years ago.
As Mr. Sado tells it, he was walking in the park one day when he heard the sound of drums. He followed it and came upon a group of people singing in Spanish, a language he is now trying to learn. He became fascinated by the music's rhythm and timing. An electric bass player in Japan, Mr. Sado had never been as deeply touched by any other music.
"Something happened inside of me," he said. "It just totally transformed me."
He started taking lessons from Mr. Bobe and others and soon got a chance to play for the Central Park crowd. The music led him to Santeria, an Afro-Cuban religion practiced on the island and increasingly abroad. Mr. Sado recently made a trip to Cuba, where he officially joined the religion.
Nowadays, "El Chino" -- a term that Cubans and Puerto Ricans use to describe anyone with Asian features -- plays the drums next to some of the most experienced musicians in the park.
Nobody here seems sure how these rumba Sundays started. Some say it started spontaneously 80 years ago with a group of friends who wanted to play drums outdoors. Others recall a day in May 14 years ago when a group of Latinos, looking for a place to continue to party after a big parade, settled on this specific spot in Central Park and started a tradition.
Morton Sanders has another version. His, he insists, is the true story.
Mr. Sanders, a retired architectural designer who is 75, said he became immersed in Cuban culture after a series of trips to the island in the 1940's and 50's. He had gone to Cuba for the first time on his honeymoon and was immediately smitten with the island's sensuality and contagious joie de vivre.
For $35, he bought a drum and hired a private instructor. He returned to his Manhattan apartment and practiced until his fingers were calloused and his palms no longer hurt.
Eventually, accompanied by two friends, Mr. Sanders took his drum to a fountain in Central Park where Latinos, mostly Puerto Ricans born in New York, used to gather. That was 30 years ago.
With his blond hair and blue eyes, Mr. Sanders wasn't immediately accepted, he said. Undaunted, he took his music someplace else. He found a bench he liked next to the boat lake under the shade of a big old tree. And there, with his drum and his friends, Mr. Sanders began to play for fun.
Intrigued by the music, the Latinos who had shunned him soon followed. Since then, Mr. Sanders said, musicians and fans have got together every Sunday, from spring to fall, in the same spot.
In 1980, the gatherings received an unexpected jolt when Cubans who had arrived in the Mariel-Key West boat lift began appearing.
The Cubans, most of them blacks from economically poor but culturally rich Havana neighborhoods, brought new energy and authenticity to the gatherings.
Rumba, which is not a rhythm, but rather a concept that means to party, was born in Cuba more than a century ago. It is regarded as the first musical expression of Cuba's nationhood, said Rene Lopez, a Puerto Rican record producer who lives in New York.
It began with the black Cubans who had moved to the cities from rural areas. Influenced by Spanish music, but emotionally tied to their traditional African rhythms, they took elements of both and created a new sound.
Although the sound is distinctly Cuban, it has traveled the world.
It was popularized in the 1940's in New York's biggest nightclubs by performers like Chano Pozo and Miguelito Valdes, who used trumpets and other musical instruments to make it more palatable to American dancers. Yet rumba can be played on just about any surface, from a wooden box to an upside-down dresser drawer. Most often, it is played with at least three drums, a set of claves (sticks), a lead singer and a chorus.
In the early 60's, Mr. Lopez said, Puerto Ricans played drums on the rooftops of El Barrio. Eventually, they took their music to local parks, but the police used to chase them away and confiscate the drums.
"They said it bothered the neighbors, but nobody believed them," Mr. Lopez said. "They just weren't ready for us, didn't understand us."
Today, Mr. Sanders said, the police do not bother the Central Park crowd, though it can get rowdy at times toward the end of the day. Sometimes, there are too many people, maybe even one or two who have had too much to drink. There have been fights, often over who gets to play the drums.
But most Sundays, by early evening, the party has become a huge family picnic. Budding friendships are cemented with a drunken hug and a promise to call. Old friends agree, once again, to keep in touch. A shirtless man gently touches a baby's forehead and asks the gods, his gods, to bless him.
The drummers, perspiring from hours of intense pounding, get up to leave, already making plans for the next weekend.
Mr. Sanders is one of the last to go. "I have had such good times here," he said. "I don't want to stay away. I have told my wife that when I die I want her to throw my ashes in this lake. That way, I'll always be close to the music."

HEADLINE: A Union Gives an Old Refinery a New Lease on Life

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

DATELINE: MARCUS HOOK, Pa., Aug. 30

 BODY:
In an agonizing choice but one that is often faced by unions these days, members of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union approved a new contract today under which about one-third of the workers will lose their jobs when the Tosco Corporation reopens a refinery here by next July.
Denis J. Stephano, the president of union local 8-234 in Linwood, Pa., said tonight that 93 percent of the 230 members who voted were in favor of the contract. Two hundred workers will get new jobs when the refinery is reopened, but about 100 will lose their jobs. 
 The workers had voted down a previous company offer and have been out of work since Tosco shut down the refinery at the end of January. For many, the vote today was a grudging acceptance of economic reality -- it was necessary to retain a job, get off the unemployment rolls and begin paying off bills when the refinery reopens.
"It's been bad for everybody," said Ed Creely, a 52-year-old worker who has spent 18 years in maintenance at the refinery. His unemployment benefits ran out months ago, and his bills have been mounting. Sitting in the union hall today, he said he had been seeking work but had had no offers. "Jobs are very hard to get around here," he added, since many other plants have closed in the area.
But he considers himself one of the lucky ones because he was offered a job by Tosco and hopes that he may even begin working in the next few months as the company upgrades the refinery.
For Tosco management the new contract provides an opportunity to extend the company's already powerful position as an important Northeastern refiner. It plans to invest about $110 million to upgrade the refinery, which it acquired from British Petroleum last November. It will be able to turn out 150,000 barrels daily of various products including 100,000 barrels of gasoline or about 10 percent of the region's production.
Combined with the huge 280,000-barrel Bayway refinery in Linden, N.J., which the company took over from the Exxon Corporation in 1993, the Pennsylvania refinery will bring Tosco close to the capacity of the region's largest refiner, the Sun Oil Company, based in Philadelphia.
Tosco has also begun to build up its retail end, having bought the rights to sell gasolines produced at Tosco refineries through about 500 B.P. stations in the Northeast. It also supplies gasoline to stations of other major oil companies in the region, including Exxon.
"We're making a fresh start," Thomas J. Nimbley, a senior vice president of Tosco who helped forge the contract, said in an interview at his office at the Bayway refinery. Tosco has poured $120 million in improvements into that refinery.
The reopening of the Marcus Hook refinery, which will be renamed Trainer after the town where most of it is situated, is expected to help stabilize gasoline supplies and prices in the Northeast during times of peak demand, notably the summer.
This summer, gasoline spot prices often jumped when refiners were operating at full capacity, and there were concerns that supplies might be interrupted should Caribbean refineries, major suppliers to the region, be shut down by tropical storms or other unforeseen events.
The nation, which a decade ago had a large surplus refining capacity, has seen that surplus shrink because of numerous closings. In recent years, capacity has remained level, while demand for gasoline has been going up.
Tosco shut down the Marcus Hook refinery just before gasoline prices began to soar last spring, enabling the local union leaders here to get the attention of some Congressmen and Senators in their battle with Tosco management.
They asked whether Tosco had deliberately shut down the refinery to force up gas prices in the region. The company denied it had done so, noting that when supplies became tight and prices rose in the Northeast, refiners in Europe began to ship in gasoline.
Although the union was able to get wide publicity and political attention, it was short-lived. Gasoline prices turned back down, and union members had to sit down with Tosco managers and make concessions to persuade the company to invest in reopening the refinery, which sprawls along the Delaware River.
"They were holding all the big cards," Mr. Stephano, the local president, said, referring to Tosco's bargaining position in the last few months.
Nevertheless, he and other union leaders were able to make some important gains. For example, the local contract will incorporate any gains made by the union in the next nationwide bargaining in February 1999 for a new contract that would run until July 2002.
Also, the workers who will be hired will retain their vacation and some other benefits that they built up during their previous employment.
John Saracina, who has worked in the refinery for 17 years as a machinist, came in grim-faced and cast his ballot in the basement. He said that he had not been offered his job and that it had been a big blow to his self-esteem. "I can't figure out why I wasn't picked," he said. "It just doesn't make sense. That's the way it goes."
Some other workers also said that there seemed to be little sense in how the company made its decision.

Stocks Slump on Fears Fed Will Raise Rates Soon
Stocks slumped in the slowest trading session of the year -- 258 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange -- after unexpectedly strong economic data heightened fears that the Federal Reserve would soon raise interest rates to counter inflation.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 31.44 points, closing at 5,616.21, after being down nearly 60 points early in the day. For the week, the Dow lost 106.53 points, its worst decline since the last week of May. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 5.41 points, to 651.99. The Nasdaq Composite index dropped 3.53 points, to 1,141.50. [Page 37.]
 
Yield on 30-Year Bond at 7.12%
Prices of Treasury securities continued Thursday's retreat on fear of Fed action. The 30-year bond tumbled 11/32 , to a price of 9516/32 to yield 7.12 percent, up from 7.03 percent on Thursday. The yield is the highest since July 9, when it was 7.13 percent. [43.]
 
Economic Indicators Show Strength
Two nongovernmental indicators showed the economy picking up speed quickly. The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago said its overall index soared to 60 in August from 51.2 in July. And the University of Michigan's final index of consumer sentiment for August rose to 95.3 from 94.7 in July -- the highest reading since January 1995. Less worrisome to investors was a Commerce Department report that consumer spending rose only two-tenths of 1 percent last month, after dropping four-tenths of 1 percent in June. Also, personal income inched up just a tenth of 1 percent in July. [34.]
 
Tobacco Executives Subpoenaed
Philip Morris executives have been subpoenaed by the Justice Department to testify before a Federal grand jury investigating whether tobacco companies and their executives knowingly provided false information about nicotine's addictiveness, a Government official said. [34.]
 
British Brokerage to Scale Back
Winchester Brokerage, a British metals brokerage firm, said that it would scale down operations and cut a number of jobs because it had lost business after adverse publicity from the copper scandal involving the Sumitomo Corporation of Japan, which was a client. [35.]
 
UST to Buy Walden Bancorp
The UST Corporation said that it would buy Walden Bancorp of Acton, Mass., for $155.9 million in stock and take a $13.5 million pretax charge. UST, which is seeking to increase its presence in eastern Massachusetts, said in June that it planned to acquire 20 Baybanks and Bank of Boston branches. [34.]
 
Stock Prices Plunge in Tokyo
Japan's benchmark stock index plunged to its lowest level in five months, led by declines in shares of car and steel manufacturers, reflecting concern that Japan's economic growth has stalled. The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index fell 386.26, or 1.88 percent, to 20,166.90, the lowest since it fell to 19,923.7 on March 14. For the week the index fell 5.6 percent. [37.]
 
Dollar Up Against Yen and Mark
The dollar rose against most leading currencies, holding onto gains made from a second day of strong economic data that pointed to higher interest rates in the United States. In late trading in New York, the dollar stood at 108.92 Japanese yen, up from 108.30 yen on Thursday, and 1.4808 German marks, up from 1.4764 marks. [36.]
 
Copper Futures Prices Surge
Copper futures prices surged as labor problems led to fears of shortages. The contract for December delivery rose 4.55 cents, to 95.25 cents a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest for an active contract since June 26. Futures prices for heating oil and unleaded gasoline retreated. [36.]

HEADLINE: Bilingual Parents Dismayed By English's Pull on Children

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 30

 BODY:
In Marcel A. Apple's bedroom, the book "The Three Little Pigs" rests on a shelf next to "Mi primer libro de palabras en Espanol" ("My First Book of Spanish Words"). The 3-year-old can sing along to both a Sesame Street song and "La Bamba," or have as much fun watching "Barney," a purple, English-speaking dinosaur, as he does "Tito," a blue, Spanish-speaking shark.
But when Marcel tired of pounding on a piano one recent afternoon and sat on the lap of his Nicaraguan nanny, it was English that he spoke. 
 "Estan descansando?" ("Are they resting?") Josefina Avendano asked him, pointing at a picture of a countryside in a children's book.
"No, they're eating," he answered.
"I try to put him in an environment where there's as much Spanish spoken as possible but it never seems to be enough," said Marcel's mother, Esther Perez-Apple, a Cuban-American who herself is trying to recapture the Spanish she heard while growing up in her native New York. "He knows he can speak in English and people could understand him."
Last month Congress entered into a heated debate over English-only legislation, with proponents insisting that the very survival of American culture and civilization, as well as the language, was at stake. On a more down-to-earth level, the English-only drive has also been fueled by resentment against bilingual rules and other accommodation of immigrants, both old and young, who have not learned English.
But what new immigrant families across the nation are learning, as their predecessors did before them, is that the power of American culture, and particularly, the lure of television, is so strong that it is a challenge to raise a child who can speak a foreign language fluently.
Parents send their children to foreign countries for summer vacations, hire bilingual nannies and read bedtime stories in a cacophony of tongues, all in an effort to pass on the family's language, give the children a linguistic advantage for the future or simply enrich them culturally. Still, the languages, parents say, often lose out to television, schools and peer pressure.
Even in Miami, one of the country's most Hispanic areas, parents say it is hard to get their children to learn Spanish. The challenge to raise a child to be bilingual can be even greater for families speaking less-prevalent languages like German, Swedish or Japanese, parents say.
This experience runs counter to concerns that English is in danger of being diluted. And some bilingual educators argue that anti-immigration sentiments and the English-only laws, which generally require government business to be conducted in English, only help foster a climate that plays down the importance of other languages. They say that for a child to become bilingual it is essential that he places value on speaking more than English.
"You can have a bilingual child a lot of different ways," said Barbara Z. Pearson, a linguist who is part of a University of Miami research team on bilingualism. "But what you have to make sure is that the kid hears both languages, values both languages and wants to speak to the people who speak those languages."
But Mauro E. Mujica, chairman of U.S. English, a group in Washington that lobbies for English-only laws, says the language restrictions, which have been enacted in 23 states and are under consideration in Congress, are not meant to discourage other languages or dictate what people choose to speak or learn. A native of Chile who came to this country in 1964 and married an American, Mr. Mujica said he reared his three children speaking English and Spanish.
"We are in no way forcing people to speak anything; they can speak whatever they want," Mr. Mujica said. "But when dealing with the government, they need to speak English."
In Miami, however, a center of Latin American commerce that is heavily dependent on tourism, the problem is not getting people to learn English but getting them to retain their Spanish. Sandra H. Fradd, a University of Miami professor who conducted a study for the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce released this year, concluded that businesses worried that a shortage of bilingual workers would hamper the city's economic growth. Many employers, she said, said they relied on foreign citizens or first-generation immigrants for jobs that require Spanish because they have found that many Hispanics are not fluent enough to conduct business.
Often, when efforts to raise a child to be bilingual fall short, he ends up with what is known as "kitchen Spanish," the kind that is good enough only to order at a restaurant or talk to grandparents. Dade County Public Schools officials say only about 2 percent of high school students graduate fully fluent in Spanish -- which means able to read, write and converse in it -- in a school system where half the students are of Hispanic descent.
"We have enough Spanish courses offered that students can graduate with the fluency of Cervantes," said Lourdes Rovira, director of foreign-language skills for Dade County schools. But, she added, "the youngsters are not taking them."
Census figures show Miami to be the nation's most bilingual area, with 57 percent of the residents speaking a language other than English at home, the overwhelming majority of them Spanish. But linguists here say that is largely because of the constant influx of immigrants, not necessarily the language skills of the natives.
In the Apple-Perez home in the Coconut Grove section of Miami, Marcel hears Spanish from Ms. Avendano, his mother and tapes, videos and books. He hears English from both his parents (his father, Larry, speaks English only), his paternal grandparents and television, as well as at his preschool.
On any given day, it all adds up to about one-third Spanish, not enough for him to say "zanahoria" when he sees the picture of a carrot but plenty to carry on a 15-minute conversation with a Costa Rican during a recent vacation in which he was asked questions in Spanish and he answered them in English.
"He understands everything," Ms. Avendano noted.
But Lourdes Alvarez, whose 11-year-old daughter Cristina spoke only Spanish before Kindergarten, saw English quickly take over after the girl started school. Mrs. Alvarez says she now has to force Cristina to speak Spanish at home.
"She fights it," Mrs. Alvarez says.
Cristina, who insists she wants to be bilingual, says English just comes more easily to her. Despite taking Spanish as a subject in school, she cannot write it and barely reads it.
"Spanish is really hard," she says.
University of Miami linguists and psychologists who study the development of languages in elementary-school children have found that students are more proficient in English than in Spanish as early as second grade, even at schools that emphasize both languages. But they say that can only be expected when English is society's primary language and that the children would still be considered bilingual if they can speak and write in both languages.
In Miami, where Spanish is ubiquitous, spoken on the streets and in corporate offices and heard on numerous radio and television channels, many children fail to learn the language well because parents assume it will happen automatically. But parents who have successfully promoted Spanish skills in their children say that to become literate in the language the child needs not only to hear it but to study it.
Many immigrant families see English as so fundamental to a better life that they allow their children to even shun their first language, researchers who have studied the subject say. Bilingual educators say English usually becomes the first and sometimes only language by the first American-born generation.
Census figures show that of the country's 230 million residents 5 years old and older in 1990, 198 million spoke English only at home. Among the remaining 32 million, a majority, 17 million, said they spoke Spanish at home. Nearly 13 million of those said they also spoke English "well" or "very well."
"Many teen-agers say they never spoke Spanish and their parents can't speak English," said Professor Fradd, who conducted the study for the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce. "Something happened there -- trying to pass, to assimilate, not being seen as different."
English, indeed, is so powerful it has become in effect the international language in most fields. But the need to compete for jobs in an increasingly global economy is one of the reasons for a resurgence of language study at universities and two-year colleges nationwide in the 1990's, says the Modern Language Association, an organization of college language teachers.
In some schools, like Miami's Florida International University, the Spanish classes are filled with students who were native speakers before English took over. But even families, like that of Barry Brown, a credit union accounting clerk with no language other than English in his background, have chosen to make language skills a priority in their children's education. Mr. Brown's 8-year-old daughter, Megan, who attends a school here whose goal is to turn out bilingual graduates in English and Spanish, now can translate at the market and with neighbors for her mother, Mary, a presser at a dry cleaner who gets teased by her daughter for knowing only two Spanish words: "si" and "no.".
"Any type of education is a real asset," Mr. Brown said. "You feel your kids will have a better shot at the jobs that are opening."
The Congressional bill to formally make English the official language of the United States, which awaits a vote in the Senate, is the latest effort by English-only proponents to curtail bilingual government documents, ballots and other programs. This fall the Supreme Court will weigh in by reviewing Arizona's law.
Supporters of the laws say they promote unity, cut government costs and encourage new immigrants to learn English. But often they portray other languages as a threat to nationalism and point north at the conflict between French-speaking Quebec and the rest of Canada, which is predominantly English-speaking.
Canada scholars question the Quebec analogy, noting there is no region in the United States where a language other than English predominates and where a local majority wants to preserve that. And detractors of the laws, including President Clinton, who has promised to veto the bill if it is passed, say the laws only harm the minority of elderly and newly arrived immigrants who cannot communicate in English.
Florida is among the states where voters approved a constitutional amendment to declare English the official language. But legislation needed to enforce the eight-year-old law has never been passed.
Parents who want their children to speak other languages say the laws are unnecessary.
"There's no question that the nation's language is English, but we have to broaden ourselves," said Ligia Esteva, a Miami area resident who sends her 9-year-old son, Eric, to a school where instruction is given in Spanish and English. "You go to Israel and the cabdriver speaks seven languages. I'd like my son to take French."

HEADLINE: Pataki Panel Says Casinos Could Bring In $2.6 Billion

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 30

 BODY:
A commission created by Gov. George E. Pataki issued a report today that said casino gambling could generate as much as $2.6 billion in business for New York State annually and create 38,000 jobs.
The findings will probably be the focus of debate early next year as the State Legislature takes up a measure to legalize casino gambling. The Legislature already passed such a bill once, but a second vote is required before the measure can be put before voters in the form of a Constitutional amendment. 
 Legalizing casinos would put the Catskills and the Niagara Falls region, where casinos would be permitted under the amendment, in direct competition with Atlantic City and the Indian casinos of Connecticut. The report projects that New York casinos would recapture tens of millions of dollars now flowing into neighboring states, as well as draw 19 million visitors a year from outside New York.
The report makes no recommendation on whether to legalize casinos, and it warns that casinos could reduce lottery revenue, as well as attendance at horse races.
Mr. Pataki said he would not comment on the report because he had not reviewed its findings. But it clearly bolsters his contention that casino gambling could help the state's tourism industry.
"I think the most important thing is to be able to stop losing billions of dollars to surrounding states and surrounding communities," Mr. Pataki said at a news conference in the Capitol this afternoon.
"I think we want to see the Catskills and other historic tourism areas able to successfully compete," he said.
The report also provides powerful ammunition to hotel owners, resort companies and casino operators as they prepare for what is sure to be an intense lobbying campaign by opponents of legalized gambling.
The supporters of casino gambling praised the report as the most comprehensive study to date on the potential benefits of casinos.
"I'm pleased because the timing is perfect," said Assemblyman Ronald C. Tocci, a Democrat from Westchester who is a member of the Assembly's Racing and Wagering Committee.
"It comes just as we're slated to vote on whether to place this issue on the ballot," Mr. Tocci said.
But opponents of casinos sharply questioned the report, saying it failed to adequately take into account the many hidden costs of legalizing casinos, like the need to expand police forces and courts in order to deal with gambling-related crimes.
They also charged that the report was compiled merely to provide Mr. Pataki, a Republican, the political cover he needs to campaign on behalf of legalizing casinos at the same time many of his more conservative supporters voice opposition to the idea.
"The report sounds like it's virtually irresponsible," said Lee Karr, chairman of the Coalition Against Casino Gambling. "It seems to be making the case for casino gambling based on insufficient data."
The measure that lawmakers will vote on would allow casino gambling in four places: the Catskills, the cities of Niagara Falls and Buffalo and either Saratoga or Warren counties near Lake George.
Each area would be allowed one casino, except for the three counties of the Catskills -- Greene, Ulster and Sullivan -- where a larger but undetermined number of casinos would be authorized.
Last year, the measure passed 34 to 21 in the Republican-controlled Senate, in almost a straight party-line vote.
It passed 88 to 62 in the Democratic-controlled Assembly, where 27 Republicans joined 61 Democrats in supporting the measure.
The report based its estimates on the number of casinos permitted under the resolution. For example, it said that a resort casino in western New York could attract as many as 10.5 million visitors a year and create 4,000 jobs.
But the report went beyond the scope of the resolution, noting that Long Island and New York City would be suitable spots for casinos. It also found that resort casinos would pump about $278 million in taxes into state coffers alone.
In its report, the commission estimated that New Yorkers, largely New York City residents, spend $2.35 billion a year at casinos in Atlantic City and Las Vegas, Nev., and at the Foxwoods casino in Ledyard, Conn.
But some of the report's estimates were questioned. Dennis Tompkins, a spokesman for State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, said the amount of money the report estimated New York casinos would get by reclaiming New York gamblers from casinos in neighboring states was based on the premise that those states would not expand casino gambling.
"That's an optimistic assumption that probably won't hold up," he said. "You certainly can't expect that New Jersey and Connecticut are going to say, 'O.K., New York is going to have gambling.'
"They're going to fight to keep their business."
In fact, more casinos are already planned for Atlantic City, and a new Indian casino is to open in Connecticut this fall.
The eight-member task force was composed largely of the Governor's top aides.
They included Michael H. Urbach, the Commissioner of Taxation; Alexander F. Treadwell, the Secretary of State; Bernadette Castro, the Commissioner of Parks; Paul S. Schectman, the director of criminal justice; Edward Martin, Executive Deputy Commissioner of the State Department of Economic Development; Jerry Belinski, a former chairman of the State Racing and Wagering Board, and Thomas Griffen, the executive director of the state's Office of Real Property Services.
The other member is Robert J. Sise, former New York State chief administrative judge.

HEADLINE: STUNG BY ATTACKS, MEXICO INTENSIFIES SEARCH FOR REBELS

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 30

 BODY:
The Mexican Government, stung by widespread attacks this week by a new leftist guerrilla organization, condemned the rebels as terrorists and stepped up the hunt for them today in seven states.
The Government of President Ernesto Zedillo was caught off guard by the coordinated assaults on military and police posts across southern Mexico on Wednesday night by the shadowy new rebel organization, the Popular Revolutionary Army. 
 Struggling to recover, Mr. Zedillo said late Thursday that he had concluded that the group does not enjoy any widespread popular following and ordered the army and police to pursue the rebels as criminals.
Officials ruled out any possibility of political discussions with the group, whose surprise assaults in faraway villages and sleepy army barracks left 13 people dead.
The new insurgency battered the image Mr. Zedillo has worked hard to build of a country climbing out of a painful recession, moving toward a more open political system and reaching peace with the Zapatista rebels, an apparently unrelated group that rose up in the southern state of Chiapas three years ago.
The Popular Revolutionary Army appears to present a much more formidable security challenge to the Government than the Zapatistas did when they briefly occupied a city in Chiapas in January 1994 and made their plea for relief from the abuses suffered by Indian peoples.
But the new rebels' hard-core revolutionary message seems unlikely to attract anything like the following the Zapatistas enjoy among the Mexican public, which has shown time and again its fear of instability and radical change.
"In this country at this time, the method of armed struggle is inappropriate and it also encourages the most repressive and violent elements in the Government," said Pablo Gomez, a leading member of the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution. "There is no possibility of a generalized rebellion."
But Mr. Zedillo's economic strategy has kept wages at rock bottom and has left hundreds of thousands of Mexicans in debt and out of work. The rebels' message of despair with the Government could begin to resonate over time, especially in rural states like Oaxaca and Guerrero.
"This Government has forgotten to respond to the needs of everday people," said Alfredo Castillo, a human rights activist who has worked closely with grass roots organizations around the country.
Based on the events this week, it appears that Mexico may face a period of sporadic guerrilla attacks on its police, military and infrastructure, possibly rattling the military and frightening tourists and investors.
Prices on the Mexican stock market took a dive this morning but rallied to close only 0.88 percent down. Likewise the peso slipped and then recovered somewhat, indicating that the news has not spread any panic in Mexico's markets.
Politicians, analysts and human rights observers across the political spectrum said today that the new insurgents do not pose a real threat to Mexico's long-stable political institutions.
Government officials have not tried to conceal the extent of the attacks on Wednesday night, but they dismiss the new rebels' political relevance. New reports issued late Thursday disclosed that there had been assaults or propaganda actions in six states on Wednesday night, including three small attacks in the state of Mexico, on the edge of Mexico City.
Arturo Nunez, the Under Secretary of the Interior Ministry, called the Popular Revolutionary Army "a mini-group left over from the 1970's." He said Government intelligence indicated that the core militants of the group number only about 50, and that no more than 200 guerrillas took part in Wednesday's actions.
"We can definitely affirm that they have no popular base," Mr. Nunez said. "What they may have are some accomplices in their crimes."
Based on their actions this week and glimpses of their organization they have given in clandestine interviews, the Popular Revolutionary Army seems to be much better financed and more heavily armed than the Zapatistas.
They demonstrated their ability to move surreptitiously throughout much of southern Mexico in both cities and mountains, to pop up, strike and vanish. Their fighters seem to be trained in the ideology and tactics of classic guerrilla warfare, and their political beliefs are forged by Marxist doctrine.
The Zapatistas said they took up arms to dramatize an essentially peaceful cause and did not aspire to state power, but the Popular Revolutionary Army, according to its manifestoes, regards armed struggle as the way to force out the Government.
Sergio Bautista Martinez, a former high-school teacher turned guerrilla who was arrested Wednesday by the police in the state of Mexico, told the police that "the final objective of the group is to destabilize the country," the policeman who questioned him, Gilberto Vargas Munoz, said today.
According to Mr. Vargas, Mr. Bautista said that "since they hadn't been able to bring the Government down peacefully, they hope to do it with arms."
President Zedillo sought to make a clear distinction between his approach to the Zapatistas and the treatment he has ordered for the Popular Revolutionary Army. Out of deference to the Zapatistas' strong roots among the Indians of Chiapas, the Government has agreed to a cease-fire and carried on peace talks with them since last year.
The search for the new rebels by the army and police will be based on arrest warrants on charges ranging from illegal weapons possession to murder and sedition, officials said. Four men were arrested on Thursday in the southwestern state of Guerrero on suspicion of being members of the group. The Interior Ministry has issued summonses for 41 people who are members of above-ground peasant and worker groups it has identified as fronts for the Popular Revolutionary Army.
The Zapatistas "burst into our national life by means of violence, not terrorism," Mr. Zedillo said. He said the security forces had been instructed not to "affect the rights of third parties" in their operations.
Reinforced army and police units were deployed in the states of Mexico, Oaxaca, Guerrero, Chiapas, Puebla, Hidalgo and Veracruz. Security was also stepped up on federal highways and around key electrical and petroleum installations, officials said.
Mexicans reacted with shock as they began to realize what groups are behind the Popular Revolutionary Army. By the admission of its own commanders, the central organization is a long-time clandestine revolutionary party whose origins date back to a stubborn guerrilla war waged by peasants in the mountains of Guerrero in the 1970's.
The organization has claimed responsibility over the years for a series of political bombings and killings, including a bombing in the parking lot of a Mexico City mall in 1994. Many of its targets have been members of other less radical leftist groups.
"The first reaction, now that everyone realizes they are really for real, will be fear," said Jorge Castaneda, an expert on leftist movements in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America.

 
 
Military Convoy Attacked
 MEXICO CITY, Aug. 30 (Reuters) -- Heavily armed men attacked a military convoy today in Michoacan State, in western Mexico, killing one soldier and wounding two, a local police commander said.
 A Radio Red broadcast quoted a police official in the town of Tacambaro, 50 miles south of the state capital, as saying 40 to 50 armed men attacked the convoy.
 Gonzalo Montoya, a police commander in Tacambaro, said in a radio interview that the attackers were armed with AK-47's and other high-powered assault rifles and wore military-style fatigues.
 The commander said he thought the attackers were linked to drug trafficking or kidnapping in the area. "We often see people dressed in military-style clothing here," he said.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICAN;
Dole Promises Energy Department Cuts Won't Shut New Mexico Laboratories

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., Aug. 30

 BODY:
Bob Dole reassured voters here today that despite having previously urged abolishing the Energy Department, he would preserve the national defense laboratories in New Mexico.
The statement that the labs are "going to remain open" again points up potential difficulties in Mr. Dole's economic plan to balance the budget and cut taxes. The two laboratories at Los Alamos and Sandia account for about 10 percent of the Federal Department of Energy budget. Including the Lawrence Livermore laboratory in California would raise that to about 15 percent. 
 To a boisterous afternoon crowd of about 1,000 people at the Spanish Village of the New Mexico State Fairgrounds, Mr. Dole offered assurances to the 14,000 workers employed by the Energy Department at the Los Alamos and Sandia nuclear laboratories that he did not mean to suggest they would lose their jobs.
"When I talk about getting rid of the Energy Department, I'm talking about getting rid of the micromanagement from Washington, abolishing the bureaucracy in Washington," he asserted. "That does not mean eliminating the labs in New Mexico."
"When I'm President of the United States, the labs are going to remain open because they have an important job to do, as Pete Domenici has told me," he said of the Senator from New Mexico. "So don't be scared." Mr. Dole told reporters later that his plans were to "downsize" the Energy Department, not eliminate it.
He also mocked President Clinton for saying in his acceptance speech on Thursday night that he wanted to build a bridge to the future -- a turnaround of Mr. Dole's pledge in his own acceptance speech that he wanted to build a bridge to the past.
"He raised enough taxes to build a big, big bridge -- all the way from L.A. to New York," Mr. Dole said of President Clinton. "We need a bridge from Washington, D.C., to Little Rock, Ark. That's where the bridge ought to be built, and it ought to be one way. And it ought to be open for one day, Jan. 20."
Before flying to New Mexico, Mr. Dole bid farewell to his vacation state of California at a rally in Costa Mesa, but he pledged to return.
"I want to touch every hand in California," Mr. Dole said as the morning sun beat down in the dusty horse ring of the Orange County Fairgrounds. "I've still got about 37 million to go. But I'm working on it."
The Dole campaign is giving every indication so far of contesting California, where the latest Field poll a week ago showed that Mr. Dole had cut Mr. Clinton's 20-point lead in half after the Republicans convention.
Both Mr. Dole and Jack Kemp, his running mate, spent the last week vacationing on the California coast and have insisted at every stop that they will devote time and resources to California, which President George Bush wrote off in 1992, to his detriment.
Kenneth Khachigian, a top Dole strategist and adviser in California, said that the campaign had spent one-third of its entire national media budget in California since mid-August. But aides have suggested that the campaign will make a final determination on spending much later when the shape of the race becomes clearer.
Orange County calls itself "the most Republican county in America." Thomas A. Fuentes, the Republican county chairman, said the billing was based on the fact that the county has not elected a single Democrat at any level of government. Of the county's one million registered voters, there are 235,700 more Republicans than Democrats.
Taking the podium at the fairgrounds, Mr. Dole said: "Twelve years ago, President Ronald Reagan kicked off his campaign re-election right here in Orange County, and from here he went on to a big victory in November, and we're going to do it again on Nov. 5, 1996."
President Reagan drew about 50,000 people to that event, held at a nearby park; today, Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp drew a fraction of that number, perhaps 3,000, to the arena, which seats 8,000.
Because of the Labor Day holiday, local Republicans were worried about attendance and organized a telephone tree to try to coax out all 15,000 activists and volunteers listed in the party's data base at county headquarters, Bill Christiansen, the party's executive director, told The Los Angeles Times.
The Dole campaign also bought radio time to increase turnout. Mr. Dole himself called Mr. Fuentes, the chairman, on Wednesday to generate enthusiasm. And the Kemp family bused in 27 relatives.
"We're on very fertile ground here," Mr. Dole announced. "I told your chairman last night we would settle for a margin in Orange County of say, oh, let's say 425,000 votes. That would be a good margin in Orange County."
Mr. Dole stayed away from the topic of Dick Morris, President Clinton's top strategist who resigned Thursday over allegations involving a prostitute. Nelson Warfield, Mr. Dole's spokesman, said there was no need for Mr. Dole to take up the charge. "Word is getting out without a megaphone," he said.
Dole aides also released a letter that Scott Reed, Mr. Dole's campaign manager, wrote to Peter Knight, Mr. Clinton's campaign manager, seeking to arrange the fall Presidential debates. Former Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina, who had been under consideration as Mr. Dole's running mate, is to represent the Dole camp in the debate negotiations.
Mr. Warfield said the Dole campaign at this point had "no position" on whether Ross Perot, the third-party Presidential contender, should join the debates.
Mr. Kemp had no comment on his debate plans. "Quarterbacks don't talk about the game before the game," he said.
 
In His Own Words
 
 BOB DOLE

 At a rally at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Cosa Mesta, Calif.:
 
"We have the most detailed accounting of how to cut taxes and balance the budget of any Presidential campaign in history, because I will not make a promise unless I know I can keep it.
 "And this is a promise I have made, and this is a promise I will keep. . . .
 "And it is not that complicated, I would say to our critics. We're not talking nuclear physics here, but we are talking Nobel Prizes. The other day, three of the world's most famous and respected Nobel Prize-winning economists endorsed our plan, and they're not into politics. They wouldn't have stood with me and spoken out unless they knew we could do it.
 "These people aren't in politics as we are. They looked at our plan, they examined our plan, they analyzed our plan, they studied our plan, they said it's a good plan.
 "It's a good plan to get America moving again after wage stagnation in the last four years, where actual wage rates have gone down one cent an hour, not up, but one cent down under President Clinton.
 "So we're going to get it done. "
