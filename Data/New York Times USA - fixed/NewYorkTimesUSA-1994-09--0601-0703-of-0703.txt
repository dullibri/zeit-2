HEADLINE: Growing Peril on South African Roads: Wave of Carjackings

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Sept. 22

 BODY:
During the bleakest days of apartheid, when schoolchildren were shot for picketing and funerals were used as a forum for protest, township militants often forced motorists into funeral processions all in the name of the struggle.
Now the struggle has apparently been won, but the practice of diverting motorists continues, this time in a context that has nothing to do with politics. 
 At suburban intersections and on township roads, robbers as young as 12, pointing AK-47's or 9-millimeter pistols, force motorists from their cars and shoot them if so inclined. The motorist is sometimes taken hostage and later dumped along a roadside, left to watch his what may represent his life savings roll off in a cloud of red dust to a chop shop for dismantling or out of the country for resale.
Everyone seems to know someone whose car has been hijacked if he himself has already not become a victim. Taxi drivers have been hijacked after dropping off their last passenger, truck drivers have been hijacked for their cargo of rice or cigarettes, and some people's B.M.W.'s have been hijacked, recovered and then hijacked again.
The crime wave has resulted in part from the years of apartheid, when guns streamed into the country for the resistance and people grew accustomed to violence.
"There is a contempt for the law because of a culture of violence," said Col. David Bruce, spokesman for the South African Police Service in the Johannesburg area. "Your massacres and your political violence have dissipated. Now, I believe that violent crime is the biggest problem in South Africa."
The violence threatens to overwhelm the new Government as it tries to attend to the basic tasks of providing jobs and shelter. As reality has set in that it will take years for the Government to bridge the disparities created by apartheid between rich and poor, black and white, crime has soared.
This year, carjackings have more than doubled in South Africa, rising in the Johannesburg area alone from 1,879 in the first six months of 1993 to 4,656 in the first six months of 1994. About 40 people have died in carjackings in Johannesburg this year and many others have been wounded.
A motorist is 10 times more likely to be carjacked in South Africa than in the United States, where the rate is one carjacking for every 6,200 cars, according to figures from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In South Africa, one out of every 600 cars is hijacked, according to police and insurance company figures.
Every week, from the wealthy white suburbs north of here to the poorer black neighborhoods of Soweto, 200 vehicles are taken from their drivers at gunpoint.
It happened to Mapula Plessy, a real estate agent, when she stopped for a traffic light in Soweto during rush hour one afternoon. Two young men came up to her B.M.W. with a 9-millimeter pistol.
"The keys, sisi," she recalled one of them saying as he used the township term for 'sister.
The motorists behind her, she said, nervously sped around her and never looked back.
"I was left with nothing," she said. "I felt paralyzed. People were standing there and did nothing."
It happened twice to Thabo Setaka, a truck driver. Once he was parked by the side of the road to finish some paperwork on the 450 bales of rice he was hauling. Two robbers came up to him with automatic weapons, took the truck and the rice and left him by the highway.
The second time he and his crew thought they were being pulled over by plainclothes police officers doing cargo checks. The men were robbers instead and ordered them into another car to be dumped far from the carjacking site.
Mr. Setaka looked closely at their faces, praying that they were strangers. "I thought, "Please, my God, I don't want to know them,' " he said. "If they know you, they will kill you. If you can recognize them, you are supposed to die."
He was spared. But when the police came in pursuit of the robbers, a co-worker was killed in the crossfire.
What is in all the vehicles is quick money in a country where nearly half the people are unemployed and where the economy is trying to shake a recession. With the involvement of body shops and gangs, auto theft has become such an organized business here that some cars and parts are stolen to order, police and insurance officials say.
Because of decades of isolation and protectionism that added heavy tariffs on imports to South Africa, car prices are wildly inflated; some cost more than the average house. In the great majority of cases, no one is arrested and the car is never found. That is partly because blacks, the primary victims of carjackings, are wary of going to the police out of fear of reprisal from the carjacker or suspicion of the police after decades of abuse under apartheid.
The threat of a carjacking figures into people's everyday routines now. Some people no longer stop at traffic lights, especially at night. They just pause and move on. Some are careful not to drive with a full tank of gas, hoping that if the robbers find that the tank is near empty, maybe they will let them pass.
Many insurance companies refuse coverage unless a car has an alarm system and some reject the priciest B.M.W.'s altogether. Insurance rates have risen 60 percent for some cars in the last year because of the increase in claims. Because of the cost, 70 percent of cars here have no insurance at all, said Damon Deavin, executive manager of the Aegis Insurance Group here.
Fear has prompted motorists to seek ever more advanced means of protecting their cars, but robbers immediately find ways to decode or sidestep them. Nearly every new car includes a remote control alarm system and a device that prevents a would-be robber and sometimes even the hapless motorist from starting the engine unless the security system is overridden.
"To make sure the driver doesn't use the cutoff device, they take the driver hostage," Mr. Deavin said.
Some people like Timothy Jiyana have changed their driving habits now, riding only in certain kinds of cars, the more downscale and beat up the better.
The other day a friend wanted Mr. Jiyana to help haul some equipment in a pickup truck like the one that was seized from him at gunpoint early one morning in Soweto. Mr. Jiyana said he preferred to ride in his old hatchback, which he figured nobody would want.
"I told him, "I will not ride with you,' " Mr. Jiyana said. " 'I will follow you. So if they take your buggy, I can give you a lift in my car.' "

HEADLINE: President's Words: Fight Between Hope and Fear

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the speech given yesterday by President Clinton to the United Nations General Assembly, as transcribed by The Associated Press:
Today I am proposing a first step toward the eventual elimination of a less visible but still deadly threat -- the world's 85 million anti-personnel land mines -- one for every 50 people on the face of the earth. 
 I ask all nations to join with us and conclude an agreement to reduce the number and availability of those mines. Ridding the world of those often hidden weapons will help to save the lives of tens of thousands of men and women and innocent children in the years to come.. . .
 
On Haiti
 Never before has the United Nations been in a better position to achieve the democratic goals of our founders. The end of the Cold War has freed us from decades of paralyzing divisions, and we all know that multilateral cooperation is not only necessary to address the new threats we face, but possible to succeed.
The efforts we have undertaken together in Haiti are a prime example. Under the sponsorship of the United Nations, American troops, now being joined by the personnel of an ever-growing international coalition of over two dozen nations, are giving the people of Haiti their chance at freedom.
Creative diplomacy, the influence of economic power, the credible threat of military force -- all have contributed to this moment of opportunity.
Essential civil order will be restored. Human rights violations will be curbed. The first refugees are returning within hours on this day.
The military leaders will step down, the democratic government will be restored. President Aristide will return. The multinational mission will turn its responsibilities over to the United Nations mission, which will remain in Haiti throughout 1995, until a new President is elected.
During this time, a multinational development effort will make available more than $1 billion to begin helping the Haitians to rebuild their country.
In the spirit of reconciliation and reconstruction, President Aristide yesterday called for the immediate easing of sanctions so that the work of rebuilding can begin immediately.
Accordingly, I intend to act expeditiously within the Security Council Resolutions 917 and 940 to enable us to restore health care, water and electrical services, construction materials for humanitarian efforts, and communications, agricultural and educational materials.
Today, I am also announcing that the United States will suspend all unilateral sanctions against Haiti except those that affect the military leaders and their immediate supporters.
This will include regularly scheduled air flights when the airport becomes available, financial transactions and travel restrictions. I urge all other nations to do the same.
In Haiti, the United States has demonstrated that it would lead a multinational force when our interests are plain, when the cause is right, when the mission is achievable and the nations of the world stand with us.
But Haiti's people will have to muster the strength and the patience to travel the road of freedom. They have to do this for themselves.
Every new democratic nation is fragile, but we will see the day when the people of Haiti fulfill their aspirations for liberty and when they are once again making genuine economic progress.
 
On Bosnia
 United Nations actions in Bosnia, as those in Haiti, demonstrate that progress can be made when a coalition backs up diplomacy with military power.
For the first time ever, NATO has taken, since we met last year, military actions beyond the territory of its members. The threat of NATO air power helped to establish the exclusion zone around Sarajevo and to end the Bosnian Serb spring offensive against Gorazde.
And NATO's February ultimatum boosted our mediation efforts, which helped to end the war between the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Croats and forged a federation between those two communities.
The situation in Bosnia, to that extent, has improved, but in recent weeks, the situation around Sarajevo has deteriorated substantially and Sarajevo once again faces the prospect of strangulation.
A new resolve by the United Nations to enforce its resolutions is now necessary to save Sarajevo, and NATO stands ready to act.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues' Prices Are Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday in a quiet session as the market awaited the outcome of a meeting that will determine the Federal Reserve's monetary strategy for the next few months.
For weeks, dealers and investors have been split over the timing of another increase in interest rates by the Fed, which has already raised rates five times this year. Some expect a move to increase short-term rates to take place during a meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee that starts today, while others lean toward an action after the November meeting, which would allow the Fed time to assess the most recent economic data to see if the last few increases have worked their way through the economy. 
 The price of the 30-year bond slipped 1/32 , to 9620/32 , for a yield of 7.79 percent, unchanged from Friday's close. Shorter-maturity bill rates were mixed. At yesterday's auction of new three- and six-month bills, rates surged to their highest level in three years.
James Hale, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International, a market research and analysis firm, said the Fed would move to raise rates soon despite the past track record. "Time and time again in the past they have shown that they err on the side of caution," he said.
The market sees the need for another tightening to prevent an acceleration in inflation, he said.
"The data we've seen over the last two months has provided two reasons for a rate hike," Mr. Hale said. "First there are the signs of inflation pressures building, not just in commodities but also at the producer price levels. And they are certainly moving in the direction of the consumer level. It's only a matter of time."
The second reason, he said, is that economic growth is nearing a point were wage pressures will develop.
But there are those like Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, who called the market's fear of inflation unwarranted. Before a meeting of the National Association of Business Economists yesterday, she said "today the economy is doing very well."
"In the next two to three years, the economy will continued to have a moderate expansion with modest inflation," she said. "Fears of a large uptick in inflation are unwarranted."
The five rate increases by the Fed have raised short-term rates 125 basis points. A basis is one-hundredth of 1 percent. By historical standards, an increase of 125 basis points is not all that much, so another tightening would not endanger the economy. "First they took the foot off the gas now, and now we see the need for them to start tapping the brake," Mr. Hale said.
Some traders note that if the Fed does not change policy this week then the short end of the market will likely benefit as a safe haven.
Yesterday's report on existing- home sales in August had a negligible impact on the bond market. Existing-home sales fell 1.8 percent in August to 3.90 million, consistent with the declining trend seen in conjunction with the rise in interest rates.
The market is also bracing for the auction of new two- and five-year notes today and tomorrow.
The following are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	 	Average Price	98.789	97.361	 	Discounted Rate	4.79%	5.22%	 	Coupon Yield	4.92%	5.44%	 	High Price	98.794	97.371	 	Discounted Rate	4.77%	5.20%	 	Coupon Yield	4.90%	5.41%	 	Low Price	98.789	97.361	 	Discounted Rate	4.79%	5.22%	 	Coupon Yield	4.92%	5.44%	 	Accepted at low price	38%	29%	 	Total applied for	$46,343,451	$44,512,944	 	Accepted	$11,728,244	$11,628,764	 	Noncompetitive	$1,299,018	$1,333,356	 	
 
Both issues are dated Sept. 29, 1994. The three-month bills mature on Dec. 29, 1994, and the six-month bills mature on March 30, 1995.

HEADLINE: MISSION TO HAITI: POLICY;
Lifting Sanctions on Haiti Will Take Up to 2 Weeks

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Administration officials said that the lifting of sanctions on Haiti, announced today by President Clinton, would not go into effect immediately. It would take several days to lift the ban on most financial transactions with Haiti, and at least a week or two before scheduled flights are resumed to Port-au-Prince, they said.
In an address today to the United Nations General Assembly, the President said that one part of the unilateral sanctions would not be lifted: the freeze on the assets of Haiti's military officer corps and their close financial supporters. The freeze on those 600 individuals would remain at least until the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, is restored to power, State Department officials said. 
 Within the next few days, the Treasury Department is scheduled to issue new regulations that will officially remove the ban on most financial transactions as well as the freeze on assets owned by Haitians, except for the targeted list of 600.
The Administration plans to ease the ceiling that limits to $50 a month the amount that American residents can send to their relatives and friends in Haiti. The Administration will also ease its restrictions on granting travel visas to Haitians.
President Clinton announced the tough unilateral sanctions on June 10 as part of an effort to press Haiti's military leaders to cede power.
Before flights are resumed, the American military must first declare the Port-au-Prince airport safe. The United States will also confer with France, Canada and the Netherlands, all of which also suspended flights to Haiti.
Tim Smith, a spokesman for American Airlines, the American carrier that traditionally had scheduled flights to Haiti, said his airline would also wait for a green light from the Federal Aviation Administration before it resumed its flights.
"We have concerns involving stability and safety in Haiti for the sake of our employees, our equipment and our passengers," Mr. Smith said. He said that in the face of a volatile situation like the American military occupation, his airline wants information about the physical condition of the airport, the security situation in the area and the availability of personnel to provide navigation assistance, weather information and other services.
Mr. Smith said it would be at least several more weeks before American Airlines resumed its flights to and from Haiti. The airline used to have daily flights of a 266-seat, A-300 Airbus from New York and Miami to Port-au-Prince.
Under the United Nations trade embargo, the international sanctions are to remain in force until the military leaders surrender power and President Aristide returns.
Nonetheless, President Clinton said today that his Administration would, with Father Aristide's approval, begin shipping more oil, food, medical supplies, and telecommunications equipment into Haiti. The Administration would use an exemption in the United Nations embargo resolution that allows the United States and the multinational military force in Haiti to provide what is necessary to create a safe and stable environment to pave the way for President Aristide's return.
Thus, the United States will import more oil not just for the American troops, but to power Haitian hospitals and power stations that have had only enough fuel to run three hours a day.
According to a White House statement, this will "increase security and improve the general daily life of Haitians in metropolitan areas."
To improve the lot of Haitians, the United States will also bring in more educational materials, agricultural supplies and construction and transportation materials to help relief efforts. As soon as the airports reopen, the United States will also grant permission for charter flights.

HEADLINE: Spanish Economy Picking Up, but Many People Still Suffer

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MADRID

 BODY:
After suffering the ravages of the deep European recession, the Spanish economy is perking up and should grow at a reasonable rate over the next several years. Exports are surging. Corporate profits are improving. Inflation is under control.
But none of that means much to Soledad Arevalo Sastre. She recently lost her job as a history and geography teacher, has little hope of finding a new one and is living on unemployment insurance. She does not expect the economic recovery to change the outlook for her or for most of the 3.7 million other Spaniards who are out of work, a staggering 24.3 percent of the work force, nearly four times the current rate of 6.1 percent in the United States. 
 "I have absolutely no idea what will happen to them or to me and my life," said Miss Arevalo, a 35-year-old resident of Madrid. "The world is changing too fast."
Across Western Europe the recovery is gathering steam, bringing an end to one of the bleakest economic periods in the region since World War II. But for the European Union's 20 million unemployed people -- 10.8 percent of the work force -- the rebound is only confirming what many of them had feared and what economists had been predicting: that their plight will not end with the recession.
Instead, the jobless are beginning to understand what analysts mean by "structural" unemployment, the kind that will not be swept away by a cyclical economic improvement. Like Miss Arevalo, they are at risk of being caught permanently between an array of problems that are much discussed but difficult to solve.
There is an ever-intensifying worldwide industrial competition that has been forcing companies to pare their work forces. There is the high cost of employing workers in Europe, where businesses foot much of the bill for generous social welfare programs. And there are Europe's rigid labor laws, which inhibit business expansion by making it expensive and difficult for employers to hire and dismiss workers.
"Economic growth will play a part in reducing unemployment," said a recent report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a research group based in Paris that is financed by the largest industrial democracies. "But beyond the cyclical component of unemployment is a structural element that persists even into recovery. This is harder to reduce and is even more troubling."
Nowhere is the problem more troubling than in Spain, and nowhere are the difficulties of solving it more clear. Although the figure appears to be inflated to an unknown extent by fraudulent claims from people who are working in undocumented jobs, Spain's jobless rate is by far Western Europe's highest. The country's Socialist-led Government has tried to address the problem with an ambitious package of new labor laws that went into effect earlier this year. Among other changes, the laws make it easier for employers to hire temporary workers and to pay them, in some cases, less than the minimum wage.
Economists said the new laws appeared to be spurring the creation of jobs. But they said that some of the jobs might be coming at the expense of permanent, better-paid employment for other workers. In any case, they said, Spain has so far shown little ability to create or attract new jobs in industries with bright futures like technology.
"Although the labor market reforms are helping the Spanish economy to create more jobs with low growth, unemployment rates are going to stay high for some time," said Sonsoles Gallego Herrero, an economist with Analistas Financerios Internacionales, a consulting firm in Madrid. "Things will improve next year, but not substantially."
A recent forecast by NatWest Markets, an investment firm based in London, projected that Spain's unemployment rate would decline only marginally, to 23.9 percent next year and 23.3 percent in 1996.
While the jobless rates in the rest of Europe are not so high, the projected improvement over the next few years is equally slight. According to NatWest, France's unemployment rate will decline to 11.9 percent in 1996 from its average level for this year of 12.5 percent.
Over the same period, Italy's rate will drop to 10.7 percent from 10.9 percent. In western Germany, joblessness is projected to decline from 8.3 percent this year to 7.6 percent in 1996.
"The situation in this country is very bad," said Maria Carmen Conde, a 27-year-old Madrid resident who has been out of work for a year despite having two years of college and experience in a variety of secretarial and public relations jobs.
What jobs there are, she said, are going to people 25 and under who qualify for special programs under the new labor laws. She said she has little hope of being able to support herself and her 6-year-old daughter independently, a realization that she said was devastating.
"I feel very, very disillusioned and deceived," she said.
Her 27-year-old boyfriend, Pablo Ferrari, who recently lost his job as a restaurant manager, is so pessimistic that he is thinking of moving to New York City. There, the unemployment rate of 8.5 percent, while higher than the national average of 6.1 percent, would be much lower than Spain's.
Europe has remained calm at least in part, economists said, because unemployment benefits are relatively generous -- they start at $470 a month in Spain for a single person and go up to more than double that for a worker with two or more children -- and generally continue, in some form, for as long as workers remain jobless.
What progress there has been in battling unemployment has come largely as a result of deregulating the labor force. The need for such steps -- once seen as unacceptably Thatcherite on the Continent -- has gained widespread acceptance, even among Socialists such as Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain, who pushed a package of changes through Parliament last year despite strong opposition from his party's left wing and from the country's trade unions.
Under the new system, companies can hire workers up the age of 25 into an "apprentice" program. The jobs can last for up to three years. Employers pay no social security taxes on them, a savings of hundreds of dollars a month a job, and can pay workers as little as $312 a month -- 70 percent of the minimum wage.
The laws have also been changed to make it easier for employers to hire part-time workers, a practice that the old laws made difficult. Moreover, the new system seeks to make it less risky for employers to hire permanent, full-time workers by reducing the payments companies must make to any workers they lay off, from a maximum of five years' salary to a maximum of one year's salary.
Employers want more.
"In my opinion and that of the employers' association, the reforms are necessary but not complete," said Felipe Manzano Sanz, a labor relations specialist with the Spanish Confederation of Employers' Organizations.
He said that among other changes, the country should scale back its collective bargaining system, in which centralized union contracts are imposed across entire industries, leaving little room for the needs of individual employers.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
$400-an-Ounce Price of Gold Is Expected to Prevail Soon

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Inflation worries and a rebounding global economy have lifted demand for gold, and the experts are confident that the new price level of $400 an ounce will soon prevail.
On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for delivery in December yesterday breached the magic $400 level for a second consecutive trading session, retreating to close at $397.80 an ounce. 
 On Friday, the December contract also hit $400 an ounce before closing at slightly less than the mark. It was the first time gold had broken through that barrier since August 1993.
Analysts yesterday remained optimistic that gold, after gaining more than $10 since the beginning of September, would stay close to $400 in the near term and would eventually work its way higher, partly because of fears of inflation after the release of strong United States economic data recently, leading nervous investors to shift money out of stocks and bonds and into gold and cash.
"The market has built a nice head of steam," said Andre DiMino, trading strategist for Apostle Capital Management.
Morgan Stanley doubled the share of gold in its global model investment portfolio to 4 percent yesterday, citing expectations that stock prices would languish or decline.
Running counter to inflationary expectations, however, the Commodity Research Bureau index gave up 0.49 point, closing at 232.24, pushed down by declines in coffee, oil and other contracts.
Orange juice prices soared to four-month highs as the drought searing Brazil's coffee plantations began to hit its orange groves as well.
The Agriculture Department, in a report from its officer in Sao Paulo, Brazil, lowered its estimate of Brazil's 1994 orange crop slightly to 14.3 million metric tons. Local authorities complained that the dryness had created problems for processors.
On the New York Cotton Exchange, the November frozen orange juice contract rose 4.4 cents, to 99.35 cents a pound, the highest since June 3. At one point, the contract reached the key $1-a-pound level.
Coffee prices retreated. December coffee fell 3.05 cents, to 226.60 cents a pound, on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York. Light rain in Brazil's coffee regions over the weekend prompted selling.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, November crude oil fell 16 cents, to $17.67 a barrel, after failing to rally past $17.99.

HEADLINE: An Abundance of Passion At Public Smoking Debate

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Some spoke passionately about the danger of secondhand smoke and pleaded for measures to restrict smoking. Others talked with equal fervor about smokers' rights and the economic threat to their businesses from any move to further curtail smoking in restaurants and public places.
The City Council held a full day of often emotional hearings yesterday on a bill that would effectively ban smoking in virtually all public places in New York City. And a wide array of New Yorkers -- and even people from other cities -- descended on City Hall in droves to testify before the Council's Health Committee, from the powerful tobacco industry, restaurant owners and surgeons to ministers, public officials and a beauty queen. 
 Before the hearing began, people stood in a line that wrapped around City Hall, waiting to enter the building to testify.
Many used their time before the committee to engage in tirades in general terms about their opposition or support of antismoking measures. But some offered specific recommendations on how to improve the bill, which was submitted in March by Speaker Peter F. Vallone and co-sponsored by 31 more of the Council's 51 members.
The bill, in its current form, would ban smoking in all restaurants, retail stores, business establishments, concert halls and auditoriums, stadiums and convention centers. The measure has been fiercely denounced by the tobacco industry and some restaurant owners and hotel officials. Opponents have complained that the bill would inflict great hardship on businesses, which could lose the patronage of smokers.
The hearing came one day after the Philip Morris Companies, the world's largest cigarette maker, said it would consider moving its headquarters out of New York City if the legislation passed. And in yesterday's hearing, several Council members angrily denounced Philip Morris for what they characterized as the ultimate in hardfisted lobbying techniques.
"I don't know if that's how you lobby in the tobacco country of North Carolina," said Anthony D. Weiner, a Councilman from Brooklyn, speaking to an official of the Tobacco Institute, the industry trade association. "But New Yorkers don't like to be threatened. What does not add to the debate is a company saying that 'if we don't get our way, we're going to take our ball and go home.' Well, you know, my view is, go home now."
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani told reporters at an unrelated ceremony at City Hall yesterday that he was sympathetic to the complaints from restaurant owners of the economic risk of legislation limiting smoking. But he said he generally supports smoking restrictions and that the savings in health costs would ultimately offset any reduction in business.
About Philip Morris considering leaving the city, Mr. Giuliani said, "That's not the best way to carry out a public policy debate." He added, "If they leave, they leave. If they don't leave, they don't leave. We should be looking at the long-term impact."
By yesterday afternoon, Philip Morris had released a statement saying that the company "never threatened to leave New York City." The statement added, "We said it was an option we would consider if the proposed legislation passed in its current form." The company did not testify at the hearing but sent officials to monitor the proceedings.
The Council's ornate chamber, where the hearing was held, was filled to capacity with more than 350 people. The crowd seemed to be evenly divided between supporters and opponents of the bill with much of the testimony greeted with either wild applause or thunderous boos.
Council officials initially suggested that the Health Committee might vote on the bill yesterday. But the sheer volume of people who came to testify -- more than 150 witnesses -- meant that it will be some time before a vote will occur. Richard A. Riley, a spokesman for Mr. Vallone, said the volume of witnesses suggested that the committee would likely conduct another hearing and that the committee would spend time considering the various suggestions. He said that a vote by the Council might not occur until November and that Mr. Vallone would like to see a bill enacted by the full Council by the end of the year.
While most of those who supported the bill proposed little in terms of revisions, some opponents of the legislation suggested a few changes. For example, Fred G. Sampson, president of the New York State Restaurant Association, suggested amending the bill so that restaurants could be allowed to devote just 25 percent of the seats for smoking areas. Under the current smoking regulations, adopted in 1988, restaurants can devote 50 percent of their space for smokers.
Joseph E. Spinnato, president of the Hotel Association of New York City, suggested that the bill require seating areas be arranged so that nonsmokers do not have to walk through smoking sections, and that it establish a minimum number of times air filters must be changed. He also suggested increasing the fines for violations of maintenance on ventilation equipment.
Among those who testified in favor of the smoking restrictions were cancer patients, doctors and several public officials, including State Attorney General G. Oliver Koppell and Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi. Patrick Reynolds, the grandson of the founder of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and an ardent antismoking crusader, said the measure would help save lives.
Another supporter of the measure was Kelly Gray Johnson, Miss Greater New York City. She said that as an aspiring singer who has worked in restaurants that serve smokers, "I can attest to the thousands of dollars in medical bills I have paid because of respiratory infections from being around smokers."
While saying that the Council was genuinely interested in hearing from all parties, Mr. Vallone made it clear in his opening statement that he was deeply committed to a bill that would severely restrict smoking in public places.
"I know that this bill will be unpopular with some people," Mr. Vallone said. "I also know that smokers feel that they have a constitutional right to smoke. But I strongly believe that they do not have a right to make others breathe that smoke."

HEADLINE: Restoration of Long Island Sound Is Pledged

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

 BODY:
The top Federal environmental official came to Long Island Sound yesterday with pledges that its cleanup is a priority -- as long as Congress comes through with money to do the job.
"Long Island Sound is a national treasure and one of the nation's most important waterways," said Carol M. Browner, administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, who joined Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York and Eunice S. Groark, the Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut, in signing a joint agreement to restore and protect the Sound, estimated to cost $7 billion over 20 years. 
 The agreement, which contains no new Federal or state money, calls for the cleanup of the Sound through existing programs, or through new legislation.
At the signing, on the campus of the State University Maritime College on the Throgs Neck peninsula in the Bronx, overlooking the confluence of the East River and the Long Island Sound, cautions were sounded both about the price of cleaning up the sound and the price of doing nothing.
"It's going to be very, very expensive, and very hard to do," said the Governor, who is up for re-election this fall, cautioning that changes in the political lineup could make money even harder to get.
But Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who is also running for re-election this fall, noted the Sound's benefit to the region's economy -- in excess of $5 billion annually.
The agreement, based on nearly a decade of studies, identifies six problems that Federal and state environmentalists say merit special attention, including low levels of oxygen, toxic and pathogen contamination and floating debris.
Mrs. Browner said that low oxygen level, or hypoxia, was the most critical threat to the Sound, which is approximately 110 miles long and about 21 miles across at its widest point.
Hypoxia occurs when marine plants grow profusely, fed by nitrogen. When the plants die and decompose, they consume oxygen, harming other plants and shellfish while repelling fin fish. In the Sound, the nitrogen comes from sewage plants ringing the shore in Connecticut, the Bronx and Westchester County and on Long Island.
The agreement calls for New York and Connecticut to take steps by the end of 1995 to reduce nitrogen levels by 18 percent in the next six years, at an estimated cost of $120 million.
Mrs. Browner said that because the Administration was seeking changes in the Clean Water Act, it was unclear what money would be available for states to spend on sewage treatment beyond projects already underway.
She also noted that Congress had approved $1.3 billion for the Safe Drinking Water Act, but had not yet determined how to allocate the funds.

HEADLINE: Right to Life Nominee Looks Beyond Albany;
Diverting Votes as a National Message

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DEER PARK, L.I., Sept. 22

 BODY:
For all the ballot-proven fervor of the Right to Life Party in state elections, its dedication this gubernatorial year is extra heated and targeted to teach a larger national lesson to Republicans intent on retreating strategically from the politics of the abortion issue.
The party's dapper, affable gubernatorial candidate, Robert T. Walsh, is incensed not just by the fact of legalized abortion but also by the party's former favorite son, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. Right to Life leaders say the Senator epitomizes this retreat in his masterminding the nomination of State Senator George E. Pataki as the Republican gubernatorial candidate. 
 "Al who?" said Mr. Walsh, 49, a bank management and securities specialist, as he strategized in his suburban home here with party loyalists who labored hard for Mr. D'Amato's re-election two years ago.
The Right to Life Party's goal is to achieve, if not victory, then the 3 or 4 percent of the vote that political handicappers think is attainable in this unsettled year. That might be enough, if the race is tight, to block victory by Senator Pataki, a politician who denies the Right To Life Party's charge that the further into statewide politics he has ventured, the more he has hedged his earlier abortion criticism.
"Mario's doing all he can to elevate this guy Walsh and his name identity, get him into the debates, hoping he'll siphon off the A.B.C. voters -- anyone but Cuomo," said Maureen Connelly, a political consultant, noting the needs of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the 12-year incumbent.
Ms. Connelly, who has no candidate in the race, stressed this strategy might only work if Mr. Cuomo can narrow what she estimates is Mr. Pataki's 10-point lead.
Senator Pataki, who previously voted against Medicaid financing of abortion, has said that he would permit such financing as Governor and that his position has consistently been that "abortion is a woman's decision, period."
He is being lambasted as "multiple choice Pataki" by Mr. Walsh, a first-time candidate running with the 16-year-old party's usual shoestring budget of several thousand dollars plus highly dedicated volunteer help.
Mr. Walsh, the managing director of the American Institute of Banking, one of the industry's main educational arms, grew up poor as one of 12 children in a four-room flat on the East Side of Manhattan. "I know what it is like to be hungry," he said, "and to feel the prejudice of those in society who do not understand poverty."
He offers himself as a candidate who appreciates moral as well as material need. "We were blessed with a hard life," he said of an Irish-Catholic upbringing in which his mother died at age 46 and his father was laid off chronically from a shipping company job.
"But they had the courage to bring forth life," said Mr. Walsh, offering his explanation of why he is in the party.
In the Cuomo camp, Raymond B. Harding, the Liberal Party leader who is one of the Governor's chief strategists, looks on Mr. Walsh as critically needed to force abortion to the fore as a potentially negative issue for Senator Pataki.
"Pataki must have read the same poll finding that D'Amato used to select him -- a Roman Catholic who is pro-choice," said Mr. Harding, gauging voters' gradual acceptance of legalized abortion. "Walsh more than anyone else will be able to credibly point at the flip-flops Pataki has taken on the choice issue over the years."
Harding said he hoped to see a three-way debate of the candidates. But Mr. Pataki insists voters would be best served in one-on-one debates with Governor Cuomo that exclude Mr. Walsh.
Zenia Mucha, the Republican campaign spokeswoman, contended, "Mario Cuomo is trying to hide behind a third-party candidate because he lacks the courage to debate George Pataki one on one." She said that Mr. Pataki in accepting Medicaid financing for abortion had proposed adding an "educational component" about birth control, and that Senator D'Amato, while opposed as ever to abortion, considered Mr. Pataki the ideal candidate in a race far broader than a single issue.
For his own needs, Mr. Walsh takes care to condemn the recent wave of attacks on abortion clinics, calling for less aggressive tactics by abortion opponents and for discussions by both sides aimed at solutions that lessen the need for abortion. "The alarming incidence of violence raises the importance of peaceful communication," he said.
Mr. Walsh, a lean, 6-foot-2-inch executive in banker's tailoring of chalk-striped, double-breasted blue, complains he has been ignored, even blackballed by the news media in three months of campaigning, even though the 33,000-member party could theoretically prove decisive in the gubernatorial outcome. With no funds for television, he hopes to garner attention and money for mailings if he can surface in a televised debate.
"Then, hey, he could pick up the 90,000 to 120,000 votes that might eventually make the difference," said one Cuomo adviser, thinking wishfully of tarnishing the pro-choice stance of Mr. Pataki.
The campaign is very much a Walsh family effort. Six of the candidate's siblings are involved, led by his younger sister, Diana, who is the campaign manager. "Bank On Bob! Thirty years of financial experience!" she says, dreaming of television spot ads that the party cannot afford.
Mr. Walsh, who is married with three children and five grandchildren, is trying to win votes as a "multi-issue candidate in a single-issue party." He speaks of the "slaughter of 31 million fellow Americans" as well as a raft of education, economic and anti-crime policies. These include his opposition to the death penalty and his view that citizens entitled to own guns ought to first pass a licensing test.
In the context of national politics, Cuomo strategists would like to identify Mr. Pataki with the Republican's fumbling history in 1992 of some stridently moralizing convention rhetoric followed by policy revisions in defeat. Mr. Walsh hopes New York voters will reject Mr. Pataki and signal hope for former Vice President Dan Quayle's attempt to revive the family values debate and his chances for the Presidency.
"There is a war on for the soul of the Republican party," said Lena Harknett, state chairwoman of the Right To Life party, summarizing her loyalists' nationally oriented motivation. "Two years ago, we delivered 224,000 votes to Al D'Amato," twice his slender margin of victory. "Without us he couldn't have done it," she claimed.
For all that furor, "D'Amato is not the candidate this year," one Cuomo sympathizer conceded. "The Right To Life line could eventually be crucial," this politician said. "But right now it's not, not the way Pataki's been moving ahead."
But Mr. Walsh, with less than $10,000 in his campaign kitty, was smiling this week, as he brandished his first invitations to two televised gubernatorial debates. "You'll see," he insisted. "Before this is over, I'll rock the political establishment."

HEADLINE: Atom Plant Is Assessed At a Hearing

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CROTON-ON-HUDSON, N.Y., Sept. 26

 BODY:
The Indian Point 3 nuclear reactor will not be worth reopening unless it can operate much more reliably than it has in the past and can cut operating expenses sharply, both opponents and supporters agreed in testimony today at a legislative hearing. And even supporters acknowledged that if the plant were closed, the economic consequences might be quite small.
The plant, which has faced stiff political opposition through most of its 18 years, has been shut for 19 months because of safety problems. It has been producing power in the last few years that is more expensive than the electricity from plants that use oil, coal or natural gas. But the New York Power Authority, the state-owned utility that runs the plant, hopes to reopen it next spring, after extensive retraining of workers and improvements in equipment. 
 The hearing was conducted today by Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, Democrat of Greenburgh, who is the chairman of the Assembly's Committee on Environmental Conservation.
An energy expert, Charles Komanoff, testified that the state could save $15 million to $20 million a year over the next five years by closing the plant. This would be true even if the reactor could operate 60 to 70 percent of the time, compared with a historical average of about 52 percent as of the end of last year, and even if Indian Point's operating expenses could be permanently cut by 15 percent, he said.
Even the plant's supporters painted a tough picture and the support they gave seemed lukewarm sometimes. The president of the Power Authority, S. David Freeman, in effect, proposed a probation period. "We should not rely on anyone's opinion and projections," he said. "We should give this reactor an opportunity to show its stuff."
But Mr. Komanoff said, "There are more instances of lousy plants remaining lousy than of lousy plants turning around and becoming good."
Francis J. Murray Jr., the New York State Energy Commissioner, testified in favor of the plant's operation. But if the plant were closed, by his calculation, the effect on utility bills would be decidedly modest: between $211 million and $451 million over the next 20 years, taking into account the value today of money that would be paid in decades to come. That would be one-tenth of 1 percent to two-tenths of 1 percent of the state's utility bills. Even including environmental effects, the price difference would be less than one-half of 1 percent, according to calculations by his office.
The Indian Point 3 reactor, and the adjacent Indian Point 2 plant, owned by Consolidated Edison, were the subject of the longest safety hearings in the history of the nuclear industry a decade ago, when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission evaluated emergency plans. Almost 300,000 people live within 10 miles of Indian Point, which is about five miles north of here in Buchanan, on the east bank of the Hudson River.
Con Edison officials also testified today in favor of Indian Point 3, a plant which it built and sold to the Power Authority in 1975. Con Ed operates the adjacent reactor, which is nearly a twin, and it might come under pressure to close that reactor if Indian Point 3 were closed. In addition, if Indian Point 3 were closed, Con Ed might have to supply the customers the reactor formerly served.
The plant's customers are local governments and governmental agencies, including the City of New York, the city's Housing Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
If costs are higher than they should be, then governments pay extra, most of it raised from property taxes, Mr. Brodsky said. "We are looking at a property tax subsidy to operate a nuclear plant," he said. "That is unacceptable to any reasonable person."

HEADLINE: New York Looks to S. I. Site to Revive Port

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
The Howland Hook Marine Terminal on Staten Island was once a prosperous shipping hub, but since 1986 it has been virtually abandoned. Every so often, a maintenance crew cleans and powers up the cranes that used to hoist containers on and off freighters. The multilegged machines are put through a lonely pantomime of the chores that they once did, in the hope that someday New York City will again be a world-class port and they will be needed.
That day may now be coming. Howland Hook is scheduled to reopen by December, giving the city perhaps its last chance to win back some of the shipping business that fled en masse across New York Harbor to New Jersey in the 1960's. 
 "This means the rebirth of the waterfront industry in our city," said Carmine F. Ragucci, a longtime fixture on local wharves who is about to sign an agreement with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to operate Howland Hook. "This gives New York City the opportunity to shine again as a real partner in the dynamics of the port."
But not everyone is pleased that government agencies have spent tens of millions of dollars on the 187-acre terminal, which faces the Arthur Kill on the northwest corner of Staten Island. Though New York and New Jersey are partners in the administration of the harbor, through the Port Authority, their alliance has long been uneasy.
News of Howland Hook's resurrection has touched off accusations from the New Jersey side of favoritism and political gamesmanship in the management of the overall port, which handled $56.31 billion in cargo last year and generates more than 180,000 jobs in the region.
Some terminal operators in New Jersey contend that Howland Hook's reopening is a waste of money, intended to quiet complaints from city politicians about losing their dominance of the harbor.
"There is no need for another terminal at this time," said M. Brian Maher, president of Maher Terminals, which operates at both Port Newark and Port Elizabeth. "The only place the business can come from is the Jersey side. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out."
Either way, there is a lot at stake. If Howland Hook succeeds, the terminal could usher in a new era in the maritime history of a metropolis that was shaped by the sea, only to all but forsake it in recent years.
Mr. Ragucci said that when the terminal greets its first ship, it will be the largest private employer on Staten Island, with several hundred workers. Eventually, he said, it should have more than 500 people on its payroll and handle 250,000 to 400,000 cargo containers a year.
Depending on how much trade increases, that could be 20 to 30 percent of the containers shipped through New York Harbor, which is shared by New York City and New Jersey.
Last year, New York City accounted for only about 48,000, or 4 percent, of the nearly 1.2 million containers brought through the harbor. They were handled at the Red Hook Container Terminal in Brooklyn, which has long been hobbled by its poor transportation links. Until the 1960's, the piers of New York City were by far the busiest in the nation.
New York City bought Howland Hook in the early 1970's in a last-ditch response to a development that was having stark consequences for its maritime industry: the advent of containerized shipping. Instead of moving goods in odd-sized crates carried by longshoremen, companies in the 1960's found that it was more efficient and cheaper to load them into 20- and 40-foot containers that could be hauled by cranes on and off trucks or railroad cars.
This method requires swaths of land for storing the containers, as well as good transportation connections. The piers in Manhattan and Brooklyn, which had been receiving ships since the 1600's, were considered inadequate, and New York City officials were skeptical at first about the merits of containerized shipping, so the Port Authority and private companies built terminals in New Jersey. Shipping began to die in New York City.
Howland Hook enabled the city to keep a toehold until the tenant there, United States Lines, went bankrupt in 1986. At that time, the overall port was suffering from a reputation for high costs and poor infrastructure, so no company wanted to use the terminal, and it sat mainly unused.
Port officials now say that with a recent upturn in trade in New York Harbor, prompted by rising exports and improvements in service, the terminals in New Jersey are nearing capacity and there is demand for more space to insure that customers do not defect to rival ports like Baltimore.
"This means that there will be an alternative to New Jersey that will bring about enhanced competition and will also allow the regional port to grow," said Chris Ward, a senior vice president at the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which oversees the city's terminals. "It will allow many of the existing and smaller shipping lines increased service and better access."
Like the terminals in New Jersey, Howland Hook has plenty of land, and it is next to the Goethals Bridge, which allows trucks to drive from Staten Island to the New Jersey Turnpike. And in a step crucial to Howland Hook's success, New York City is completing negotiations to buy the Staten Island Railway, which runs from the terminal to the freight railways in New Jersey.
The purchase of the railroad, expected to cost about $10 million, is being financed by Federal money. The Port Authority, which began leasing the terminal from the city in the mid-1980's, is spending $25 million to repair it. Built from scratch, Howland Hook would cost more than $250 million.
"The strategic location makes it one of the most ideal locations in the port, and to not have it open is just mind-boggling," said Mr. Ragucci, who managed the terminal for United States Lines before it went bankrupt.
But Mr. Ragucci's enthusiasm is not shared across the harbor.
Phil Connors, president of Universal Maritime, which handles 210,000 containers a year at Port Newark, said he had expressed his concern about Howland Hook to the Port Authority, and would be watching it closely to determine whether it was receiving preferential treatment.
"There has been much influence put upon the Port Authority to look after Howland Hook, from the perspective of keeping the New York side alive," Mr. Connors said. "But in fact, the reality of life is that the New Jersey side is where the containerization market lies. There are major problems on the New York side, which is why so few lines call there."
Stanley Brezenoff, executive director of the Port Authority, acknowledged that officials in New York City had long lobbied for Howland Hook, but he said that the Port Authority would have sought a new tenant for the terminal regardless of pressure from the city.
"There is probably some concern among existing operators that this will serve to redistribute business," he said. "That is an understandable concern. But I really do think that the port is poised for growth. In addition, competition is good within the port. It keeps costs down and it makes us more competitive with other ports."
But even some officials on the New York side raise questions about Howland Hook. Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, who has long been an arch-foe of the Port Authority, said it was far more important that government examine building a new terminal in Brooklyn that would be fed by new freight railway lines.
Mr. Nadler, a Democrat whose district includes sections of Brooklyn, predicted that in the next century freighters might become so large that they might not be able to navigate the Kill van Kull, the waterway between Staten Island and Bayonne, N.J., that leads to Newark Bay, site of Port Newark and Port Elizabeth. Ships would have far less difficulty reaching a new terminal at Brooklyn, he said.
"Howland Hook is the one place in New York that enjoys the same geographic problems as New Jersey," he said. "The Kill van Kull is a narrow, treacherous body of water."
Mr. Nadler accused the Port Authority of refusing even to consider the idea of a new terminal in Brooklyn.
"The Port Authority has for the last 50 years been the enemy of New York," he said. "The Port Authority has given us a lot of glitzy projects that add very little to the economy, and has done very well for New Jersey."
But Port Authority officials contend that to create a new containerized shipping terminal in Brooklyn would require the government to obtain a huge parcel of land and spend hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps more than a billion. Port Elizabeth, for example, is so large that if it were in Brooklyn it would extend from the waterfront to Prospect Park.
Other shipping experts say the squabbling between New York City and New Jersey is shortsighted and fails to recognize the increasing integration of the region's economy. Howland Hook, they say, will benefit both sides.
"The entire port district is a regional resource," said Jack Dean, a research associate at the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit organization that studies land-use issues. "While it might be physically in New Jersey, it's still a regional resource. Many of the firms in the World Trade Center may operate in New York, but the cargo may actually hit the ground in New Jersey.
"To be very petty about which side of the river the Port Authority loves more isn't that productive."

HEADLINE: Pataki Riding Anti-Cuomo Wave, Poll Shows

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo faces a difficult battle for re-election, an independent poll released yesterday shows, as an increasing number of voters say they disapprove of his performance and are prepared to vote for his Republican rival, State Senator George E. Pataki, even though he remains relatively unknown.
The poll by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie shows Mr. Pataki leading Mr. Cuomo by six percentage points, 44 percent to 38 percent -- a statistical dead heat, given the poll's margin of sampling error. The Right to Life Party candidate, Robert Walsh, received 3 percent. 
 But the poll shows that many voters do not have strong impressions of Mr. Pataki and that 15 percent remain undecided, meaning the race is likely to remain volatile. When fence-sitting voters were asked which way they were leaning, Mr. Pataki's lead grew slightly to eight points, 48 percent to 40 percent.
"It speaks to an unpopular incumbent and an unknown challenger and suggests that the Pataki vote is largely an anti-Cuomo vote rather than a pro-Pataki vote," said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the institute.
The poll of 911 registered voters was conducted from Sept. 19-21. It had a sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points among registered voters and plus or minus four percentage points among likely voters.
With six weeks left in the campaign, the poll offered several signs that Mr. Cuomo, a three-term Democrat, was in grave political danger. Asked to evaluate Mr. Cuomo's performance, 32 percent said it was excellent or good, a record low for Mr. Cuomo and four points lower than in a Marist poll conducted in March.
When asked about their economic well-being, 77 percent said they were worse off or about the same as a year ago, an increase of 11 points from 1990. And when asked whether the state is heading in the right direction, 62 percent said it was not, about the same as in March.
"Why is the electorate in a grumpy mood? Mr. Miringoff said. "You can see the answer in the fact that the number of people who think they are better off has fallen decidedly. There is a sense of economic turbulence, which gets laid at Cuomo's doorstep."
The poll also showed that fewer people, 63 percent compared to 71 percent in March, think the state is still in a recession. But the decline has not translated into new support for the Governor, Mr. Miringoff said, indicating that voters do not think his economic policies have helped.
The poll offered a few bright spots for the Governor. Among likely voters, Mr. Pataki's lead fell to three points, 43 percent to 40 percent. And the poll showed that 73 percent of Mr. Cuomo's supporters plan to vote for him because they have positive images of him. By comparison, most of Mr. Pataki's supporters are motivated mainly by anti-Cuomo sentiments.
Mr. Miringoff said those figures suggested that Mr. Cuomo's base support was firmer and more committed than Mr. Pataki's, an important factor in drawing voters to the polls.
Mr. Cuomo's aides said the poll demonstrated similarities between this year's race and the 1978 gubernatorial campaign, when Perry B. Duryea, the Republican challenger, lost his lead over Gov. Hugh L. Carey, and eventually the election, as voters learned more about him.
"When voters have to make a choice between the consistent, honest, tough leadership Mario Cuomo has given them and George Pataki, who has waffled on major issues of the day, they will choose Mario Cuomo," said Joel R. Benenson, Mr. Cuomo's campaign spokesman. "At this point, they still don't know George Pataki because he's been hiding."
But Mr. Pataki's camp was buoyant about the poll, saying it showed that voters tended to like Mr. Pataki as they got to know him. In March, when he was virtually unknown, Mr. Pataki received 28 percent in a Marist poll. And they said the poll suggested that the undecided vote tended to break in Mr. Pataki's favor.
"People have two reasons for voting for George Pataki: because they like him and his policies for change, and because they are hostile to Mario Cuomo's failed policies," said Zenia Mucha, Mr. Pataki's campaign spokeswoman.

HEADLINE: Broad Market Mixed, but Dow Gains 17.49

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stock prices closed mixed yesterday in advance of today's Federal Reserve policy-making meeting on interest rates. Almost one stock advanced for every one that declined on the New York Stock Exchange.
Economists are split over whether the Fed will act today to raise short-term interest rates a sixth time this year, a move that would hurt bonds and most stocks. Some economists, citing the higher-than-expected Producer Price Index for August, say the Fed will raise rates. Others say the Fed will wait for more data. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 17.49 points, to 3,849.24, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 1.15 points, to 460.82. The Nasdaq composite index fell 1.83 points, to 755.63.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 272.5 million shares, about 5 percent below this year's average of 287 million shares.
In a generally humdrum market, Mercantile Stores, a Midwestern department store chain, fell 16 3/8, to 38 3/4, in heavy trading after it announced that it had ended talks with a potential acquirer.
For much of this month, Mercantile stock had been trading as much as 50 percent above its average share price of 37 for the year, on the basis of merger rumors, which the company later confirmed.
Nextel Communications, the wireless telephone company, established an intraday 52-week low of 20 5/8, before closing down 1 3/4, to 20 7/8. It announced that it would increase the number of its shares to 3.5 million from 3 million to acquire American Mobile Systems.
Nextel was sued by some American Mobile holders over its previous bid, which the holders considered too low. Nextel's share price has been dropping since an aborted alliance with MCI Communications in August.
Philip Morris, a Dow component stock, saw its shares rise after it issued a statement denying that it had threatened to leave New York City if a tough anti-smoking ordinance were passed, saying that a possible move was an option to be considered it the legislation passed. Philip Morris shares rose 1 1/4, to 59 3/4, helping lift the Dow about 3 points.
Marriott International shares rose 1 5/8, to 29 5/8, when the lodging and food services company paid $5 million to Wellington Management, a Marriott bond holder, to settle Wellington's portion of fraud claims against Marriott.
Some bond holders in Marriott contended that Marriott should have told them of a reorganizationplan before they bought the bonds. The plan reduced the value of their bonds by nearly a third. The other bond holders are continuing their suit, which went to trial yesterday.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Election Results Hurt Mark; Dollar Gains Against Yen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the mark yesterday after the results of a regional election in Germany raised concern that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition Government could suffer defeat in federal elections next month.
The dollar also gained against the yen amid speculation that the United States and Japan were making progress in talks aimed at curbing Japan's swollen trade surplus. 
 Many traders sold marks after Germany's Free Democratic Party, one of Mr. Kohl's coalition partners, failed on Sunday to win the 5 percent of the vote needed to remain in the Bavarian state legislature. The results raised concern that the Free Democrats would lose seats in the Parliament in federal elections on Oct. 16, hurting Mr. Kohl's ability to form a new government.
"If Kohl doesn't get a majority in Parliament, people will dump Deutsche marks," said Anil Agarwal, currency specialist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company. Mr. Kohl's opponents, the Social Democrats, are considered to be less committed to controlling government spending and inflation.
The dollar rose as high as 1.5573 marks yesterday before settling at 1.5527 marks in late New York trading, up from 1.5486 marks on Friday.
The dollar rose against the yen after Ambassador Walter F. Mondale told reporters in Tokyo that the Clinton Administration had made some progress in trade talks with Japan, but "we're not there yet."
With progress at the bargaining table, the Clinton Administration is considered less likely to resume calls for a strong yen, a tactic it pursued last year. A strong yen could help balance trade by making Japanese goods more expensive.
The dollar rose to 98.75 yen yesterday from 97.85 yen on Friday.
The Clinton Administration has set a Friday deadline for progress in the trade talks, after which the United States may impose trade sanctions on Japan.
The dollar strengthened against most other major currencies yesterday, rising to 5.3060 French francs from 5.2922 francs on Friday and rising to 1,563.50 Italian lire from 1,559.50 lire. The dollar was steady at 1.2870 Swiss francs. The Canadian dollar fell to 74.11 United States cents from 74.44 cents. The British pound fell to $1.5715 from $1.5772.

HEADLINE: Japan Plans Last-Ditch Visit To Avert U.S. Trade Curbs

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 26

 BODY:
With a deadline looming on Friday in trade talks with the United States, Japan's trade minister will leave for Washington on Tuesday in a last-ditch effort to avert sanctions against his country.
Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Minister of International Trade and Industry, is expected to meet on Wednesday with Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, and probably with Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, officials here said today. Mr. Hashimoto and Mr. Kantor spoke by telephone this morning. 
 Mr. Hashimoto's ministry is in charge of the talks on automobiles and glass, two of the four sectors being negotiated under the so-called framework agreement signed by the two nations in July 1993.
Officials in both nations say that agreements in those two sectors, especially automobiles, are unlikely by Friday because the two sides are so far apart. It seems likely, therefore, that Mr. Hashimoto's visit is aimed not at reaching an agreement but perhaps at moving close enough to persuade the United States not to impose sanctions in those areas.
There are two separate sets of sanctions that will be decided by Friday. If there is no agreement on opening Japan's markets in government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment, sanctions will almost certainly be applied under a section of United States law dealing with this matter. The Administration by Friday will also decide whether to cite Japan, and other countries, as unfair traders under the so-called Super 301 clause of the trade law, which would set in motion a process that could culminate in other sanctions.
At a news conference here today, Walter F. Mondale, the American Ambassador to Japan, predicted that there would be sanctions if there was no public procurement agreement by Friday. But he said it was "just too soon to know yet" if the Administration would decide on sanctions in other areas.
"On public procurement we have to get an agreement," Mr. Mondale said. He added later, "There will be a different tone to our relationship if we are able to break through on insurance and public procurement."
Of the four sectors under negotiation, Mr. Mondale said an agreement was closest on opening and deregulating Japan's insurance market. In government procurement, he said, "some progress has been made" but "we're not there yet."
Mr. Mondale said that "there has been some progress" on flat glass, which has not been as high a priority as the other three areas, but it is questionable whether it will be possible to reach an agreement by Friday. Talks on sales of foreign autos and auto parts in Japan are "not quite ripe" for a settlement, he said.
The sticking point in the government procurement talks is the issue of how to judge whether progress is being made. The United States essentially wants Japan to commit to an increase in procurement of foreign medical and telecommunications equipment.
Japan has argued that it cannot agree to any "targets," even one as vague as a commitment that foreign sales should go up without specifying by how much. If the public procurement system is to be made truly fair and open, it will be impossible for the Government to guarantee which companies from which countries will win the bids, officials here argue.
"We are not ready to reach a settlement by bending our principles," Mr. Hashimoto, the trade minister, said during a trip to Thailand last weekend, according to the Kyodo News Service.

HEADLINE: PERSONAL COMPUTERS;
Odd Keyboards May Help You Type; On the Other Hand, They May Not

BYLINE: By STEPHEN MANES 

 BODY:
"DO NOT REMOVE THIS TAG!" advises a sticker on the cord. A bigger sticker bears a bigger orange "WARNING" and a discussion of the perils of typing. These alarming admonitions appear on a mostly plastic product that the Microsoft Corporation bills as "natural."
Natural? The Microsoft Natural Keyboard looks surreal, as if it had been fished from the seas bloated, warped and whitened. It is the latest member of a growing collection of odd-looking "ergonomic" models pioneered in the general market by Apple Computer Inc. and sharing one tenet: the keyboards most of us use are unfit for human hands. 
 To quote Microsoft's legalese, "Continuous use of a keyboard may cause repetitive stress injuries or related injuries." But no modified keyboard has been proven any more "natural" than standard models. Microsoft "does not claim that its new Natural Keyboard will either cure or prevent" injuries. The Kinesis Corporation of Bellevue, Wash., notes that computer-related illness can have many causes, from bad chairs to inadequate break time, and reminds that its own keyboard "is not a medical treatment."
On the other hand (or, more accurately, on both), the problems are real. I have experienced pain and numbness so debilitating that they forced me to quit typing for a week. Exactly what caused the symptoms is impossible to say; typing too much definitely had something to do with it.
But "ergonomic" keyboards differ wildly from one another, suggesting that ergonomics, like economics, is a dismal science with a whole lot of guessing going on. Aside from a slightly modified QWERTY layout, about all these keyboards typically have in common is a separation of left hand from right to help keep users' wrists straight.
The design of the Kinesis Ergonomic Keyboard ($390) looks and is radical. It puts most of the keys in two concave bowls and realigns them vertically to minimize awkward reaches. It also moves keys like enter and backspace to the thumbs, divides the arrows between left hand and right and offers an optional foot pedal ($25) that can serve as a shift key or activate the laptop-style numeric keypad embedded among the letters. The keyboard is comfortable (though not adjustable), but mastering it is not a trivial task.
Microsoft's keyboard (less than $100) seems the Kinesis's antithesis. Unusually thick and wide with a rise toward the center, it puts the tops of many keys more than half again as far from the desktop as international standards dictate. The fixed angle between the left and right hands is meant to straighten them, but the navigational keys and keypad are arranged conventionally. The only adjustment is a two-position tilt intended to help keep the wrists horizontal.
In Windows, either of two new "Windows" keys works just like Ctrl-Esc, but they are much easier to hit by accident. A key with an icon of a drop-down menu is unexplained because it currently does nothing at all; future applications may find jobs for it. The best thing in the package may well be the software, including a surprisingly good mouse emulator for the numeric keypad and revamped Task Manager software, which should have been included with the operating system.
Split down the middle, the Select-Ease keyboard (about $150) from Lexmark International Inc., emphasizes flexibility. Its legs and adjustment knob afford an infinity of tilts and twists, including some the manual says should be "discouraged." Stunt typists may enjoy sloping the left and right sides at a 45-degree angle to form a sort of tent. Others are more likely to separate the left and right sides entirely or keep them together at a comfortable angle.
Lexmark's "Erase-Eaze" can cleverly turn either side of the split space bar into a handy backspace. The keyboard adds arrow keys for the left hand, but also repositions the right-handed navigational keys and makes the Alt and Ctrl keys annoyingly small. An adjustable numeric keypad, which will cost about $40 when available, will be a desk-hogging option.
The first couple of hours spent using any of these keyboards is irritating, but produces fewer errors than I would have guessed. Regularly switching back to a laptop or standard model would be a major nuisance.
And these designs may create new problems. For example, none includes a pointing device. Since Microsoft's unit is nearly three inches wider than standard, right-handed users will need to reach farther for their mice. Is that ergonomically correct?
All three manuals advise against using palm rests while typing, but most designs, including those from Lexmark and Kinesis, keep typists from dropping their wrists below keyboard level. Microsoft's palm rest drops off below the space bar. Can that be ergonomically sound?
Years ago, switching to a model that required a lighter touch seemed to help relieve my hand problems. But depressing the Microsoft and Lexmark keys requires about 25 percent more force than needed with the Kinesis or standard models. Ergonomically sensible? Who knows?
The keyboards sold with today's computers are often cheesy, but replacement models are widely available. Since keyboards are among the most personal of computer peripherals, make sure any one you buy, standard or unorthodox, comes with an unconditional money-back guarantee. And remember that no keyboard is a panacea, even if it is made from bean curd, looks like a pickle and is labeled "organic."

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
The Semantics Game May Be the Only Game in Town

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
This was supposed to be the last week of the season. This was supposed to be the week that the Yankees prepared for their first post-season appearance since 1981, that the Cleveland Indians ended their post-1954 post-season drought. This week was supposed to be filled with games that would determine the makeup of the playoffs.
This weekend Cincinnati and Houston were supposed to be playing for the first championship of the National League's new Central Division. In other season-ending series, Atlanta was going to play Montreal for the National League East championship and Los Angeles was going to try to hold off San Francisco for the N.L. West title. The league's first wild-card playoff team was going to emerge from those final series. 
 In the American League, the Kansas City Royals, who would still be managed by Hal McRae, were hoping to be close enough to the Chicago White Sox for their final-weekend series to be meaningful in the Central Division. The Indians would play the Yankees four times this week, then play the Baltimore Orioles during the weekend, possibly for the wild-card spot.
And the Texas Rangers would be playing California and Minnesota in one last chance at taking at least a .500 record into the playoffs.
But none of those teams will play this week. There is, in fact, no this week; there is no last weekend either, just too many lost weekends.
The final week and weekend of the season, as it turns out, began Aug. 5. The strike started a week later. Forty-seven days later, the strike has not ended.
Because it has not ended, professional sports has a terrific opportunity to establish a first. That is, after all, what players and teams try to do, isn't it?
Come Saturday, for the first time, two major professional sports could be shut down at the same time. Think of it. On what is supposed to be the last weekend of the baseball season and the first weekend of the hockey season, there will be no baseball and probably no hockey.
National Hockey League players and owners could reach an agreement in the next few days and avert a shutdown in their sport, but if they don't, Commissioner Gary Bettman has said he and the owners will lock out the players.
No, that's not quite right. Bettman did not use the word "lockout" nor the verb form "lock out." He said they would "postpone" the start of the season. But a lockout by any other name is a lockout. If the N.H.L. planned to open the season even without a labor agreement but players decided not to play, the owners would call that a strike, not a vacation.
By avoiding the word "lockout" in noun or verb form, Bettman is playing a game of semantics. That's what sports people do these days. They don't play baseball or hockey or maybe even basketball; they play semantics.
Bettman shuns the term "salary cap," too, saying that's not what they want. But a forthright member of baseball management said yesterday, "He's seeking exactly what we want and he doesn't call it a cap."
Give baseball management people credit. They have, for the most part, not played the semantics game. When they said last year they would do nothing to interfere with this season, they pledged not to lock out the players. They used the actual words. When they made their economic proposal to the players in June, they called it a salary cap, although they acknowledge the term is burdened with a negative connotation.
They have trotted out some euphemisms -- cost certainty and cost control, for two. But they never have tried to suggest what they want is not a salary cap.
The National Basketball Association brought the term to the sports world. Its officials would have everyone believe that their salary cap has been responsible for the resurgent popularity of the league, but that's highly dubious unless salary cap is spelled the same as Magic, Michael and Larry.
The National Football League was No. 2 on the salary cap roster, implementing it this season after using legitimate free agency as the carrot to induce players to accept it. The N.H.L. is holding out a similar inducement to its players.
But the N.B.A. faces its own problems in trying to maintain its cap. The league and its players so far have argued their labor differences in court but eventually will have to get to the bargaining table. Once there, management may have difficulty defending its position in the face of widespread effort by the league's member teams to circumvent the cap.
How do you defend a system that uses the players to protect the owners from themselves and their compulsive spending when the very people it is meant to protect try to skirt it?
It's a question worth pondering as the world of professional sports converges at the cap intersection and creates gridlock that has shut down one game, threatens imminent shutdown of another and holds out the prospect of interrupting a third.

HEADLINE: 'Glass Ceiling' Is Pervasive, Secretary of Labor Contends

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD 

 BODY:
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said today that subtle but pervasive patterns of discrimination dominate the public, private and nonprofit sectors of society because of a "myopia" on the part of many white male managers who "unthinkingly discriminate" without having any idea they are doing so.
Speaking in New York at the fifth and final hearing of a Congressional commission studying discrimination at the executive level, Mr. Reich said artificial barriers to advancement are holding back many women and minorities from attaining positions commensurate with their skills, training and numbers, and preventing the economy from growing to its full potential. 
 "Walk through the boardrooms or executive suites of many companies, and it's still difficult to find a single woman or minority man," he said in the fifth and final hearing of the Glass Ceiling Commission. "Even though women are half the work force, they make up only between 3 and 6 percent of corporate executives and officers. Minorities account for only one percent."
Statistics presented today painted a monochromatic picture of life in the executive suites three decades after the passage of the Civil Rights Act and long after calls by leaders of the women's movement for a revolution in America's boardrooms.
They also showed the Federal Government's top echelons out of kilter with its vast work force. Minorities account for 28 percent of Federal jobs but fill only 8 percent of the top posts, said Mr. Reich. Women make up 44 percent of the work force, but 87 percent of the top posts are held by men.
"In Washington sometimes," Mr. Reich told a packed hall at the City Bar Association's headquarters on West 44th Street, "the only architectural feature as prominent as the Capitol Dome is the glass ceiling."
The Glass Ceiling Commission was created by Congress in 1991 to study impediments to the advancement of minorities and women to the top rungs of power. It is expected to file a report to President Clinton early next year. Today's hearing explored inequalities in places that included corporate boardrooms, exclusive law firms and the nation's best colleges and universities.
Some of the solutions, several speakers said, are already in place in Federal legislation and policies. But a lack of resources and minimal enforcement efforts have led to an environment in which corporate heads and other leaders have been able to ignore existing regulations.
"Enforcement of the existing laws lags," said Christine Carty, a lawyer and chairwoman of the Obstacles to Advancement Subcommittee of the New York Women's Agenda, a nonprofit coalition of women's groups. Describing a "corrosive cynicism" among employers, she criticized the lack of financing for enforcement agencies and called for investigations into unfair practices to send a message to employers around the country.
Other speakers called on the Government to publish the results of investigations and provide more general information to both employers and workers through a broad program of public disclosure.
"Good-faith efforts are not enough"' said Sheila W. Wellington, the president of Catalyst, a nonprofit research group that studies women in business. She said that at least half of the top 1,000 corporations in the country have not one woman on their boards. Overall, women hold 6.2 percent of those seats.
Several witnesses testified that problems for minority women, and Latin American women in particular, far outstrip those of all other categories. Across the board, said Jenny Rivera of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, Hispanic women tend to hold less stable jobs at lower positions for lower wages than their peers.
Conditions for many blacks are similarly bleak, said Barbara Armwine of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. "We talk about the concrete ceiling or the concrete wall," she said. "But it is really old-fashioned racial discrimination."
That theme was heatedly replayed in the afternoon by Edward Jones of the Harvard Business School's Black Alumni Association. He said social barriers for blacks in the business world still keep them from the inner core of power. Blacks, he said, seldom win a full place in the top ranks of business.

HEADLINE: High Court to Review Kansas City School Desegregation Case

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The Supreme Court announced this evening that it would review a long-running Kansas City school desegregation case as well as seven other new cases in its new term, which does not formally begin until next Monday.
The Justices, who met privately for much of the day to consider the more than 1,700 new appeals that have accumulated since June, when the Court's last term ended, gave no explanation for their unusual early evening announcement. 
 The Kansas City case as well as one of the other new cases, a constitutional challenge to a Federal program designed to steer Federal contracting dollars to minority-owned companies, is likely to revive debates that have been quiescent at the Court for the last few years over appropriate remedies for past racial discrimination.
The Kansas City school case is an appeal by the State of Missouri, which under a series of Federal court orders dating to the early 1980's has been required to shoulder most of the cost for improvements in the once-segregated school district. The court-ordered remedy has included elaborate magnet schools, lower class sizes and a tax increase for the district's taxpayers that the Supreme Court upheld in a 5-to-4 opinion in 1990.
The cost so far, according to the state, has been $1.3 billion, with the state share totaling $838 million. The state went back to Federal court three years ago to ask for a ruling that the district was now "unitary" and had erased the vestiges of segregation. But both the Federal District Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis, refused. The court opinions suggested, without saying so explicitly, that the remedy would remain in place until student achievement, still below national norms as measured by standardized test scores, had improved.
The appellate court was deeply split in the case, and earlier this year it rejected, by a vote of 6 to 5, the state's request to reconsider the original decision, which had been issued by a three-judge panel of the court.
In its Supreme Court appeal, Missouri v. Jenkins, No. 93-1823, the state is arguing that the appellate court went far beyond the constitutional requirement of equal opportunity to impose an "outcome-based standard wholly foreign to traditional equal protection analysis."
For its part, the Kansas City school district opposed the state's appeal and has sought to keep the special remedial programs alive.
The constitutional guarantee of equal protection is also at issue in a second case the Court accepted today, a challenge by a Colorado construction company to a Federal law that takes race into account in awarding Federal contracts.
The Small Business Act requires government-wide goals to be set for purchasing from small businesses and from small "disadvantaged business enterprises." The law defines disadvantaged businesses as those owned by members of racial minorities as well as those owned by people who have been subjected to "ethnic prejudice or cultural bias."
American Indians, Asian-Americans, blacks and Hispanic people are presumed under the law to fall into the "disadvantaged" category, although this presumption is dropped in any individual case on a showing that the company's owners are not actually socially or economically disadvantaged.
The Department of Transportation awards prime contractors added compensation of up to 1.5 percent for subcontracting at least 10 percent of any contract to a disadvantaged business. This program was challenged by a non-minority contractor, Adarand Constructors Inc., which submitted a low bid on a federally financed highway project but lost a subcontract to a minority-owned company. Adarand filed suit on the ground that its constitutional right to equal protection had been violated. It lost in the Federal District Court in Denver and in the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, also in Denver.
The company's appeal, which the Clinton Administration urged the Supreme Court not to hear, gives the Court its first opportunity in several years to review the constitutional standard that applies to Federal affirmative action programs. While the Court has invalidated a set-aside program imposed by a local government, it has upheld similar Federal programs. The new case is Adarand Constructors v. Pena, No. 93-1841.
The new cases, and the others accepted for review today, will be argued in January. The Court will add more cases to its docket when it formally convenes on Monday.

HEADLINE: H.M.O. Drug Plans Are No Consumer Bargain

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Overlooked in the headlong rush to embrace the health maintenance organization managed-care concept as a solution to the health care crisis is one crucial fact. The H.M.O. bottom line imperative creates an environment in which subscribers are often forced to pay exorbitant amounts for relatively inexpensive medication. The "prescription plan" is the vehicle for overcharging patients. 
 I became aware of this when several H.M.O. patients with thyroid hormone deficiency asked me to rewrite their prescriptions for the thyroid hormone Synthroid for 30 days rather than for one year.
Their health maintenance organization policy provided for prescription medication, requiring them to pay "only" $15 a prescription, but it stipulated that they could receive only 30 pills. Thus, they would have to spend $180 a year for medication that ordinarily costs $65.66 to $88.47 a year (according to figures this month at five Boston pharmacies).
By paying $91.53 to $114.34 over retail cost, subscribers are unwittingly overpaying the pharmacy and subsidizing the health maintenance organization. Another H.M.O. demands a lower out-of-pocket expenditure, totaling $108 a year, still higher than retail costs, but to get this "bargain" subscribers must restrict shopping to one pharmacy chain.
I appealed to the health maintenance organization director, noting that patients with hormone deficiencies have lifelong medication needs and should not be obliged to congregate every 30 days at the pharmacy groveling for their monthly ration of thyroid hormone, insulin or hydrocortisone. I was advised no exceptions were possible, for the health maintenance group had a "contract with CVS," the pharmacy chain.
This contract, it turns out, guarantees a constant monthly flow of traffic to CVS, with the expectation that subscribers, while they are waiting for the pharmacist to put 30 pills into a vial, will roam the store purchasing toothpaste, hairspray and shampoo, thereby further increasing the revenue of CVS at the expense of the subscriber.
Now it is true that some medications cost more than Synthroid, and it is possible that pharmacies use the excessive money paid for one patient's Synthroid to defray the cost of another patient's Prozac. If this is the case, none of my health maintenance organization patients are aware of their philanthropy.
Such "prescription plans," promoted as a benefit to increase enrollment in the health maintenance organization, impose a hidden economic burden on subscribers, who have paid a hefty up-front premium and who have the misfortune to require care.

HEADLINE: H.M.O. Drug Plans Are No Consumer Bargain;
An Expensive Swallow

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In view of the debate regarding what sacrifices should be made to achieve universal health care, I note Merck & Company's contribution: 
 When my cardiologist first prescribed Mevacor in 1992, concern about the cost of this expensive drug caused me to shop around since no generic was available. The American Association of Retired Persons' pharmacy discounted price was then $94 for 60 tablets -- about a $1.60 a swallow.
Since Hillary Rodham Clinton's offensive against high pharmaceutical costs took shape, Merck has raised the price three times, and A.A.R.P.'s discounted price, still considerably below that of most other providers, has risen to $104.
In the interim Merck has spent thousands upon thousands of advertising dollars to promote its product and to increase its share of the hyperlipidemia drug market. With patent protection for some years into the future, and with cholesterol-reducing medications being prescribed much more widely, such unneeded advertising would appear to be a direct contributor to rising costs.
Will Harry and Louise do another television commercial to publicize these increases? They might note that conventional economic theory says the increased volume of production should result in a price decrease. Or are they too busy beating the drum for the insurance industry?

 SEPT. 22: President Clinton outlines his proposal to a joint session of Congress. Under this plan, most Americans would obtain coverage through purchasing groups called health alliances; employers would pay at least 80 percent of the insurance premiums for their employees, and universal coverage would be achieved by 1999.
 OCT. 6: Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee, introduces a proposal without employer payments that would rely on market forces to keep health care spending under control. A similar bill is introduced on Oct. 21 in the Senate by John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana.
 NOV. 20: The President's proposal is introduced as a bill in both houses of Congress.
 
1994
 
 JAN. 25: In his State of the Union Message, Mr. Clinton vows to veto any proposal that does not provide universal coverage.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Wants Mutual Fund Risk Disclosed

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Concerned about the increased riskiness of certain mutual fund portfolios, the Securities and Exchange Commission recommended today that fund sponsors be required for the first time to provide shareholders with some quantification of that risk. The commission also suggested a tighter limit on portfolio investments that cannot easily be sold.
The proposals, which the commission could carry out on its own, are aimed specifically at investments known as derivatives, because their value is derived from an underlying security, but one result would be a new dimension of disclosure by the entire fund industry. 
 "The S.E.C. has indeed confirmed that speculative use of derivatives by some funds does raise significant investor protection issues," said a senior aide to the House securities subcommittee headed by Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat.
Mr. Markey, along with Jack Fields of Texas, the panel's ranking Republican, asked the commission in June to study the use of derivatives by mutual funds after a series of derivative-related losses at funds investing in Treasury bonds and money market securities, generally regarded as among the most conservative of investments.
Derivatives are specially designed investments whose value is tied to, or derived from, the performance of an underlying asset or market, like a commodity or interest rates. While use of these investments may be intended to reduce risk, they often have the opposite effect, increasing the volatility and risk of portfolios.
In its response, the commission said that while funds' use of derivatives "appears to be limited" to relatively few funds and fund types, "they raise investor protection issues that merit serious consideration."
The 33-page document, which took the form of a memorandum to the S.E.C.'s chairman, Arthur Levitt Jr., from the agency's investment management division, said consideration should be given to requiring prospectuses to contain a numerical measure of portfolio risk.
Acknowledging the difficulty of this task, the agency listed three possible gauges. One is "duration," a measure of how much a change in interest rates affects a portfolio of fixed-income securities. Another is "standard deviation," or how volatile a fund's total return is during specified periods of time. The third is a fund's "beta," or its risk relative to that of the overall market.
Other possibilities, the committee aide said, might include graphs, tables, charts or scales as part of an effort to give investors information they can digest, instead of giving them still another layer of legalese.
A second recommendation would reverse a 1992 commission action that raised the limit, now 15 percent, on illiquid holdings by funds other than money-market funds. The measure was intended to make it easier for small businesses to raise capital. Previously, a 10 percent ceiling had applied. An illiquid holding is one that cannot be easily sold for roughly the same amount at which the fund has been carrying it on its books.
Certain mortgage derivatives have recently proved quite illiquid, as interest rates have climbed.
The commission also proposed reviewing the application of statutory restrictions on leverage to derivatives. Leverage magnifies gains or losses. And it proposed that the agency seek legislation to improve its ability to force funds to supply data needed to monitor derivatives adequately.
Paul S. Stevens, general counsel of the Investment Company Institute, the main industry trade group, said it supported the outlines of the S.E.C.'s recommendations but wanted more details.
Mr. Stevens expressed some enthusiasm for the proposal to lower the ceiling on illiquid holdings; few funds took advantage of their ability two years ago to move up to 15 percent of assets. But Mr. Stevens was dubious that the commission could adequately measure fund risks.
"The industry is somewhat skeptical -- and virtually everyone I've spoken to is skeptical -- that you can capture all risks in one statistical measure," he said.

HEADLINE: Rearranging Drugstore Shelves

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
In a surge of activity not seen in years, at least seven big pharmaceutical companies are pressing for Federal permission to sell some of their most important drugs without a doctor's prescription.
With profit margins on prescription drugs already squeezed by the growing pressure to lower health care costs, the companies are scrambling to win Food and Drug Administration approval for over-the-counter versions of prescription drugs. This strategy is especially attractive for drugs whose patents have expired, making them vulnerable to brutal price slashing as generic copies come on the market. 
 By selling milder versions of these drugs, and advertising heavily, manufacturers create new products that often have bigger revenues than the original drugs ever did.
An F.D.A. advisory panel recently recommended that conditional approval be given to two new nonprescription heartburn medicines. Each is a milder version of a widely used ulcer drug: Tagamet from SmithKline Beechamand Pepcid from Merck & Company. Applications are also pending for over-the-counter versions of important drugs made by Johnson & Johnson, Upjohn and Wellcome Holdings.
Glaxo Holdings plans to file next month for a nonprescription version of its ulcer treatment, Zantac, the world's best-selling drug. And Marion Merrell Dow says it will formally request over-the-counter approval later this year for Nicorettes, an aid in stopping smoking.
"We are breaking new ground, and the activity level is very high," said Dr. Michael Weintraub, director of the F.D.A.'s Office of Over-the-Counter Drug Evaluation. "It's one of the phenomena of the 90's."
Although Federal officials do not provide numbers, industry experts say that at least 16 new over-the-counter medications are awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration, a process that can sometimes take years.
The new products would join a market for over-the-counter drugs that already totals $12.2 billion in the United States and $18 billion overseas. Drug makers spent $1.57 billion last year advertising these medications, Michael Perlmutter, a pharmaceutical consultant at Kline & Company, said.
In a triumph of marketing, Warner-Lambert multiplied the sales of the antihistamine Benadryl tenfold in nine years to an estimated $155 million this year, up from $14 million in the 12 months before nonprescription Benadryl was introduced in 1985. Warner-Lambert spent $31 million last year to advertise a dozen Benadryl variations .
The over-the-counter products often greatly expand a market. Johnson & Johnson reported that 18 million women were using over-the-counter treatments, like its Monistat 7, for vaginal yeast infections; in 1991, when only prescription versions were available, 12 million women used them.
And Tylenol, which went over the counter when Dwight D. Eisenhower was President, is now the nonprescription champion with $855 million in United States sales, helped by an ad budget of $144 million last year. It is packaged in no fewer than 24 varieties. "Anything with the name Tylenol on it, retailers will love," Mr. Perlmutter said.
Sometimes the nonprescription version of a drug is close to the original, but more often it is less potent and has a label stating that it is intended for treating a problem, like heartburn or headache, that an individual can identify without professional help.
The over-the-counter option is especially attractive to drug makers as health maintenance organizations and other cost-conscious buyers increasingly force down prescription drug prices by favoring low-cost generics or newer, more cost-effective drugs.
Health insurers and health maintenance organizations have little influence on over-the-counter drugs since such medication is usually not covered under their plans. Still, they and governments, seeking to cut spending on both medical products and services, welcome the prospect of having more drugs available without the need of visiting a doctor and getting a prescription.
For the drug makers, pretax operating profits on over-the-counter drugs average a robust 15 percent, according to Samuel D. Isaly of Mehta & Isaly Worldwide Healthcare Research. That is well below the 25 percent average on prescription drugs, which often lose up to 70 percent of their market share when their patent protection ends. It is also triple the typical 5 percent operating margin of a generic drug.
Reflecting their growing importance, nonprescription drugs figured prominently in a number of recent big pharmaceutical company deals.
SmithKline Beecham of Britain bought the Sterling Winthrop consumer lines from Eastman Kodak for $2.9 billion in August. SmithKline then sold the North American portion to Bayer A.G. of Germany for $1 billion on Sept. 12.
Consumer brands were important in the recent agreement by American Home Products to acquire American Cyanamid for $9.7 billion. And earlier this year, Warner-Lambert and Wellcome P.L.C. of Britain announced a joint marketing venture for over-the-counter products. They are seeking F.D.A. approval for over-the-counter sales of Zovirax, a Wellcome treatment for genital herpes that is one of the world's 10 best-selling drugs.
The competition among brands can be fierce and, adding heat, big pharmaceutical companies like Johnson & Johnson are fending off copycat "private label" products of mass merchandisers like Wal-Mart and drugstore chains like Revco. The private labels have seized 17 percent of the market.
The manufacturers face three choices when exclusive patent protection runs out on a big drug, said Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a pharmaceutical economist at the University of Minnesota: patenting new prescription-dosage formulations; marketing or licensing lower-priced generic prescription versions, and "if the safety profile is reasonable," taking the drug over-the-counter.
Some companies try all three approaches. SmithKline Beecham, for example, is sponsoring a generic version of Tagamet, its ulcer treatment, and also seeking Federal approval for a milder over-the-counter version to treat heartburn.
Heading the F.D.A.'s over-the-counter waiting list are Tagamet, Pepcid and Nizoral, an antifungal shampoo made by the Janssen Pharmaceutica unit of Johnson & Johnson.
Nizoral was recently recommended for over-the-counter sale by a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel. The panel chairman, Randy Juhl, dean of the school of pharmacy of the University of Pittsburgh, said the group recommended conditional approval to Tagamet and Pepcid. Before the F.D.A. gives final approval, he said, the panel said the agency should have more information about the effectiveness of the Pepcid product, and potential problems if Tagamet was used with other drugs.
In another case, the Upjohn Company was told that it had "more work to do" on its application for Rogaine, a hair loss treatment, Dr. Juhl said. Unlike remedies for colds and headaches, he noted, it takes months of use to tell if Rogaine works and, if it does, customers will "use it forever," raising issues about long-term effects and the occasional case when baldness may be a symptom of a serious illness requiring a doctor's care.
An Upjohn spokesman said the company was working with the F.D.A. to try to meet such concerns. "Rogaine will ultimately be converted to over the counter," said Ronald Nordmann, a health care analyst with Deerfield Management, a money management firm, "but first, Upjohn will have to present better data."
In the next few months, the Food and Drug Administration plans to issue regulations requiring the makers of over-the-counter drugs to report cases of adverse reactions, already a requirement for prescription medicines, Dr. Juhl said.
"When kids start to abuse a type of cough syrup," he added, "we would like to pick up on those trends early on."

CORRECTION-DATE: September 29, 1994, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day on Tuesday with an article about a number of pharmaceutical companies seeking Federal approval to sell drugs over the counter misidentified the manufacturer of two prescription drugs. Both Pepcid and Dolobid are made by Merck & Company, not Johnson & Johnson. If over-the-counter versions of the drugs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, they will be marketed in a joint venture with Johnson & Johnson.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: IN THEIR OWN WORDS;
Why Health Care Fizzled: Too Little Time and Too Much Politics

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Everyone in the White House, in Congress and in the lobbyists' offices in Washington now agrees that major health care restructuring is dead for 1994. But people disagree on precisely what killed what might have been the boldest legislative initiative in decades.
Talking to those involved in the debate that consumed the first 18 months of the Clinton Administration is like taking depositions from witnesses in a complicated legal case: everything depends on where they stand. 
 So, too, the story of what happened to the health care bill is colored by policy goals, ideology and political ambition, from the President's plan to the alternatives from left, right and center in Congress.
What follows are comments by people who were intimately involved in the debate on health care, each offering his or her own view of events.
 
John J. Motley
VICE PRESIDENT, NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS
The adamant opposition of small business to any requirement that employers be required to finance their workers' health insurance coverage was a major stumbling block for those in favor of universal coverage.
The left killed health care reform by overreaching, by not being willing to accept a consensus approach, by not trying to put together a proposal in the middle of the political spectrum.
The seeds of the demise of the President's proposal were sown in the very early days of the Administration, within the task force that drafted his proposal. The left in this debate, the real liberals, were able to seize control of the creation of the proposal. They seriously overreached and developed a proposal that was too large and too expensive, that gave too big a role to the Government and that simply couldn't pass.
In the end, no one in the business community, no one in the opposition, believed the Administration or the Democratic leadership of Congress when they said they were willing to compromise. We feared the endgame so much that many of us were afraid we would be snookered. No matter what passed in the House and the Senate, we feared that the bill would be rewritten in conference.
 
Representative Richard A. Gephardt
DEMOCRAT OF MISSOURI
 Mr. Gephardt, the House majority leader, was a key ally in the White House effort.
It became very clear very quickly that there was little or no support for meaningful reform among Republicans in the House. They have a very different vision of what health care reform should be. With very few exceptions, Republicans cannot look their constituents in the eye and say that they made a good-faith effort to give health security to every American.
Next year we will have to figure out if there is a more modest and incremental way to pursue the same goals. I don't know if there is or not.
 
Senator Edward M. Kennedy
DEMOCRAT OF MASSACHUSETTS
Senator Kennedy heads the Senate Labor Committee, one of the most liberal in the Senate, which passed a bill similar in many respects to President Clinton's proposal.
Time was our principal enemy, and time just ran out, with the Republican blind obstructionism and gridlock that has been so apparent in recent weeks.
I think there will be a strong effort at the opening of Congress. The issue will be very live and very current and very compelling. It's not going to disappear and it's not going to go away. This is an issue that is current and real and absolutely penetrating in terms of every family condition, and that just isn't going to go away.
 
John C. Rother
LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR, AMERICAN
ASSOCIATION OF RETIRED PERSONS
Mr. Rother's group has long been committed to health care restructuring, with particular concern about extending prescription drug benefits and long-term care coverage to the elderly.
The death knell came on Aug. 11, the day the House defeated the Administration's anti-crime bill. It meant the leadership in Congress and the Administration had to completely divert themselves at a critical time, when time was the one thing we couldn't give up. That was the final obstacle.
The issue was made partisan both by Administration officials, in the way they proposed the bill, and by the Republican leaders of Congress, with their effort to bring down Clinton by defeating health care.
The various delays in bringing the bill forward gave the vested interests time to mobilize here in Washington and at the grass roots, to cast doubt and raise fears about the whole idea of health reform. Congress could not act until the Administration finished, and the institutional structure of Congress, with several committees claiming jurisdiction, contributed to the delay.
The President's proposal was very difficult to explain to people. It was difficult to generate real enthusiasm for it. People were not sure they understood it. We needed to explain better to the American people why it was in their interest to have this legislation passed.
At the start of this debate, in spring of 1993, there was clearly a zone of achievable compromise. The key disagreement was over how to pay for universal coverage. Some Republicans were willing to support an employer mandate, and it could have happened. But Presidential politics and Republican loyalty to Senator Dole made that impossible.
 
Bill Gradison
PRESIDENT, HEALTH INSURANCE
ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA
 The association, which made its case in the "Harry and Louise" commercials, opposed premium caps, mandatory insurance purchasing alliances and other provisions in the President's plan.
We failed to read the lessons of history on health reform. We're likely to get to universal coverage more quickly a step at a time rather than in one fell swoop. Regrettably, all or none often means none.
It takes time to build consensus for any major legislative proposal. It took six years to pass a crime bill. It took more than six years to pass Medicare and Medicaid. . . .
We are going to do a lot of introspection around here in the weeks ahead. I've sent signals to the White House that after they finish beating up on us, if that's what they choose to do, we'd like to examine ways to work more harmoniously together than we did in the last year or two, when they chose unwisely to demonize the health insurance industry.
To me, the turning point, the greatest disappointment, was when the White House dumped on Representative Jim Cooper and his bill. Instead of sitting down with him and looking for areas of agreement, they just leveled 16-inch guns on him. That showed how difficult it would be to achieve compromise.
 
Dr. P. John Seward
CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
The group, which represents almost half of the nation's doctors, supports the goal of universal coverage but opposes government regulation of doctors' fees.
The main reason that health system reform didn't pass is simply the complexity of the nation's health care system, and the complexity of the solutions proposed. Rather than blaming interest groups, the Administration or Congress, we have to learn lessons from this exercise.
We never thought it would be a simple job. The issues are very complex. They do not lend themselves to simple answers.
The main question right now is whether comprehensive reform is viable, or whether it should be done incrementally. Comprehensive reform is still an appropriate goal, but incremental steps may be more doable. We will continue our commitment. The status quo is not appropriate.
 
Senator Bob Dole
REPUBLICAN OF KANSAS
Mr. Dole, the minority leader and potential Presidential candidate in 1996, initially seemed open to major health care restructuring but moved further and further to the right as the year went on.
I think the American people, after all the debate and discussion, understood it and wouldn't buy it. It's just too complex, too beauracratic, too expensive. That's the key. The more the American people understood it, the more trouble it was in. Because it was too costly and too bureaucratic and too much government intervention.
I blame the Clinton Administration for coming out with this big bureaucratic nightmare and then not really making any effort to try to work it out with anybody in Congress except the Democrats. I met a lot of people at the Kansas state fair who didn't have any lobbyists and weren't represented by lobbyists, and, if I recall correctly, it was something like 86 to 14 for Congress not to try to pass it this year. So I think there were a lot of working people, small people who go to fairs, who weren't buying the product.
 
Senator Paul Wellstone
DEMOCRAT OF MINNESOTA
Mr. Wellstone, one of the most liberal members of the Senate, supports a Canadian-style system in which the Government would provide health insurance coverage for all Americans.
What killed health care? I think the unholy mix of money, power and politics. Communication technology became the main weapon -- just an all-out ad campaign that spread fear throughout the country. It was very effective. And the second part is unprecedented giving of money from the health industry to senators and representatives at the very time we were considering this legislation. And that money was not given out of the goodness of anybody's heart. It was to buy time and buy access.
So in a sense with health care, democracy for the few triumphed over democracy for the many. In fact, I would argue that health care makes the best case for campaign finance reform that you could ever find.
The interesting thing to me is that the universal coverage basically doesn't strike at the perogatives of the health care industry. . . . But when you got to the issue of cost containment you had the Congressional Budget Office telling us over and over there is only one way to contain cost, either a) you do single payer or b) you've got to put some controls over what insurance companies could charge.
The health care industry, with some notable exceptions, used its full range of power to block this. Not all the Republicans, but a large part of the Republican Party was on an all-out mission to block any reform, right up to the point of threats of filibuster, of thousands of ammendments and threats of essentially bringing this entire process to a grinding halt.
Even though health care reform is an idea whose time has come and come and come and come this century, it will still come back because none of the problems that people face every day are going to go away. They are only going to grow. And the second part of it, this issue of cost containment, is fundamentally important. If we don't contain costs, we are going to be in huge trouble economically. There will be reform, but not now, I'm sad to say, and angry to say.
 
Representative Jim McDermott
DEMOCRAT OF WASHINGTON
A liberal Democrat, Mr. McDermott is a leader of the single-payer forces in the House and an influential member of the Ways and Means Committee, which produced a bill siimilar in some respects to the President's plan.
People's fear of change was mobilized by a massive campaign paid for by the vested interests. Insurance companies took premium dollars and went out and advertised against the best interests of their patients. The American people ought to be outraged by that, but apparently they've not made the connection.
You can add other issues; the White House certainly underestimated the difficulty, in the timing issues with respect especially to Congress. The Republicans had a political agenda of not wanting the President to succeed.
And this is a complicated issue. It's like a spider web. You can't touch anything without shaking the whole web, so when you start talking about Medicare you start talking about medical schools. Everybody's for reform -- as long as you're not talking about the piece I'm involved in. You've got a $950 billion pot and nobody wants to lose a nickel. . . .
My belief was the President was absolutely correct that universal coverage was the issue. And once they started talk about incremental reform, I knew this baby's over -- we're not going to get anything that's worth the powder to blow it up.
That was a sad day for me. Up to that point I thought we had a chance.
 
Bill Kristol
CHAIRMAN, PROJECT FOR A REPUBLICAN FUTURE
A former top aide to Vice President Dan Quayle and a leading conservative strategist, Mr. Kristol saw the health care debate as an opportunity to define the Republican Party as holding the line against government expansion.
Clinton's plan failed because of its very nature. He thought the middle class would accept an expansion of government in return for quote health security, and I think he radically underestimated the American people's mistrust of big government liberalism. He thought he was elected to carry forward, to enact the final piece of the New Deal, Great Society agenda, and it turns out the American public is more interested in reversing course now rather than continuing that course.
Clinton's allies will talk about all the tactical errors and mistakes in timing and details and legislative obstacles and interst group opposition, but I think they all miss the fundamental point.
I think the key moment was when the quality argument came to the fore. Americans might have tolerated a little more bureaucracy or a few more regulations for the sake of covering the uninsured. But when it became clear that the Clinton plan threatened the choice of doctors and the quality of medical care available to Middle America, or available to most Americans, they -- correctly in my judgment -- turned against it.
 
 Dr. Paul M. Ellwood
PRESIDENT, JACKSON HOLE GROUP
The group, a conclave in Jackson Hole, Wyo., composed of health care experts from academia, the health insurance industry and other policy circles, favors a health care strategy known as managed competition, which tries to mix free market economics with government regulation.
No one killed health care reform. It died in the White House with the first set of proposals, the Administration's original proposals. We were never able to recover from the first Clinton plan. It assumed too much about how consumers, large purchasers of health care, providers of care and the health care system in general would behave under a new set of ground rules.
It was assumption built on assumption that really wasn't supportable by actual experience.
Managed competition is going very well in the private sector. Unfortunately, we did not get managed competition out of the White House. We got an elaborate regulatory scheme out of the White House.
One other thing went wrong. Trashing the moderates was a terrible mistake. The Administration did a lot of that, as did some members of Congress, particularly those who supported a single-payer plan or the original Clinton plan. Instead of starting in the middle and working out, people way to the left and way to the right worked toward the middle, and by the time they got there we ran out of time.
 
Representative Jim Cooper
DEMOCRAT OF TENNESSEE
Mr. Cooper sponsored a pared down, bipartisan health insurance proposal, which did not promise universal coverage or require employers to pay for their workers' insurance. Like other measures, it was still stalled at the end of the session.
I think the Administration's key mistake was not being bipartisan. They only had one Republican in America supporting their approach. They should have reached out to moderates in both parties in order to build a broad national consensus for health reform.
Partisan approaches are doomed to fail on any major issue. What was the Jefferson quote? "Great initiatives cannot be built on slender majorities." You have to have a consensus. We were always proud that our bill had bipartisan support.
We could still have passed an excellent bill if Congress had returned from the recess with clear resolve. Too many people were discouraged by the partisanship and the limited time available.
 
Ira C. Magaziner
SENIOR ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT FOR POLICY DEVELOPMENT
Mr. Magaziner and Hillary Rodham Clinton were principal architects of the White House health care proposal.
Oppponents of reform, the same interest groups that have historically opposed change, fought to defeat health care reform. While some paid lip service to the goals of reform, they spared no effort to protect the status quo. And they succeeded.
Although they failed to convince the American public that the fundamental goals of universal coverage and cost containment were wrong, they succeeded in scaring and misleading the public that the bills proposed by the President and various Congressional committees would threaten what they like about their own health care. They scared the public -- confusing them about whether they would be able to see their own doctor and whether the health care system would turn into a giant government bureaucracy.
It is interesting to note that despite the hundreds of millions of dollars spent to defeat health care reform, support for the President's goal of universal coverage remains strong. . . .
Why did these special interests triumph in the face of a united President and Democratic leadership? They succeeded through a combination of massive special interest money spent on advertising, delay, distortion and exploitation of the complexity of the Congressional process. . . .
Change is difficult in the current Washington environment. As is so often true, the forces of the status quo have the upper hand. Were mistakes made? Absolutely. Could the Administration have done a better job? Certainly. But the President, his Administration, many members of Congress and numerous groups and individuals fought as hard as they could to pass reform. . . .
But this battle is far from over. The efforts made and the lessons learned will contribute ultimately to reform of our health system. We will continue the fight to put the public interest ahead of the special interests and provide real health security to all Americans.

HEADLINE: At the Summit, It's All Uphill

BYLINE: By Stephen Sestanovich; Stephen Sestanovich is vice president for Russian and Eurasian affairs at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Bill Clinton's meetings with Boris Yeltsin have been, more than anything else, a series of photo-op's for reform -- a chance for America to vote its confidence (however shaky) in Russia's progress toward democracy and free markets. The summit talks today and tomorrow are different. Their real content is, for a change, diplomacy.
The increasing political and economic stability over which President Yeltsin presides means that the two leaders can spend less time on ritual heavy breathing about the abstract principles that unite them and more on the concrete policy disagreements that divide them. 
 Disagreement has become almost the rule of Russian-American relations, and while it may seem a sign of diplomatic normality, it has its dangerous side as well. In a setting of pervasive disagreement, it is more likely that one or both governments will make decisions that damage larger common interests.
The list of Russian-American disagreements includes almost all of the most important issues of international politics. What was meant as a step toward reconciling Moscow's and Washington's policies on Bosnia -- the creation of a Contact Group of outside powers -- has instead pushed their positions further apart. Russian officials have expressed incomprehension at American proposals to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims; U.S. officials say the Russians have been duped by President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia.
Peacekeeping in the former Soviet Union reveals similar differences. Seen from Washington, Moscow is sabotaging peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan by blocking proposals, prepared under the auspices of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, for a multinational peacekeeping force. The Russians retort that the Western plan could never be carried out, that only Russian forces can do the hard work of policing a settlement.
Arms control disagreements lengthen the list. The U.S. wants Russia to forswear weapons exports to known bad actors; Russia wants to sell to Iran and Iraq. The U.S. wants to stick with the terms of the 1990 treaty on conventional forces in Europe; the Russians say that it was negotiated in another era, when both the Warsaw Pact and Soviet Union still existed, and is irrelevant to the problems they face today.
Of all the issues that divide Moscow and Washington, none is more important than NATO's future. Last fall, the U.S. fashioned the Partnership for Peace, in an effort to defer the issue of accepting new members into the Western alliance. Now, barely three months after Russia joined this new grouping, American officials are reopening the broader question of expanding NATO itself.
In response to German calls for such a step, Vice President Al Gore said three weeks ago that NATO will take up the issue this fall. And the State Department's new European policy chief, Richard Holbrooke, is reportedly lining up support in the Administration to accelerate NATO membership for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
The Russians' view of this issue could not be plainer. A Yeltsin adviser said last week that "99.9 percent of the Russian elite is against it." They don't buy tortured explanations about how Russia need not be isolated just because it is left out.
With this list of disagreements growing, it is a tribute to both sides' interest in good relations that each is willing to excuse so many of the other's transgressions as the product of domestic politics. Russian and American officials have acquired a sympathetic and sophisticated understanding of each other's vulnerability to special-interest groups and mobilized lobbies.
While making clear its objections to major arms transfers to Iran, the U.S. sees Russia's policy as a commercial necessity rather than a hostile strategic choice. Similarly, Moscow's courtship of Mr. Milosevic is resented in Washington as a sign of timidity in taking on Russian nationalists, not as a single-minded effort to thwart U.S. policy.
The Russians also read President Clinton's policies as a function of his domestic imperatives -- the need to look tough, to record successes, to protect his Congressional majority in November and get re-elected in 1996. In this spirit, one recent article in Izvestia portrayed the summit meeting as a chance for the two leaders to compare "headaches."
Yet the most important Russian-American disagreements do not have a domestic origin. They involve each side's response to international rather than domestic difficulties and need to be addressed in these terms.
Moscow's policy in the "near abroad," for example, is above all the expression of a strategic desire to create stability in Russia's own neighborhood. This desire would almost certainly be played out in more ambitious ways were it not checked by domestic political considerations: Russia simply can't afford the burden of reabsorbing Ukraine or Belarus. Russian polls show clearly that the public does not want to pay for empire. For this and other reasons, their leaders are learning to live with uncertainty and disorder.
The U.S. policy that troubles Russia most -- bringing Eastern Europe into NATO -- is also a response to an authentic international problem: how to fill the vacuum left by the end of the cold war.
Unfortunately, neither Washington nor Moscow is handling the issue in a serious way. American explanations sometimes actually pretend that expanding NATO has no military implications of any kind. It is described instead as an innocent attempt to bolster the new democracies by showing that we consider them part of the West.
To Russian leaders, such talk is frivolous or dishonest. Discussion of this issue in the alliance does focus on the wrong questions. When NATO bureaucrats sit down to refine the membership criteria that will dictate which Eastern European countries are eligible to join the alliance, they don't ask who faces a real external threat, but who has established effective civilian control of the military.
As a result, NATO expansion is being debated without reference to what ought to be the only truly serious test: its likely impact on European security. U.S. officials lamely explain that they can't address the question of security because they don't know what Europe's future security problems will be. (Not knowing the illness, they are nevertheless certain of the cure!)
In this light, accelerating a decision on NATO expansion looks foolish. Yet, in trying to slow the process, Russia is responding with its own foolishness. Its proposals to make the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe the supreme institution of European security -- above NATO -- have too many echoes of Mikhail Gorbachev's "common European home." And what content they have discredits them further: Moscow will hardly get a fair hearing in the West by conducting a propaganda campaign to handcuff NATO, whether or not it expands.
Russia's ability to create a European security order of which it is a full member will depend not on flashy proposals but on how it treats its neighbors over the long term.
The most powerful argument Russian leaders can make is that new security alliances should start from the new realities of Russian policy. Only on this basis will they be able to defer an expansion of NATO for which there is no present need.
The growing success of President Yeltsin's reforms has liberated both sides from last year's worries -- that we were too closely identified with him, and he with us. The freedom to disagree is welcome. Even better would be signs that Moscow and Washington are grappling seriously with the problems that threaten their new partnership.

HEADLINE: MISSION TO HAITI;
Haiti's Priest-President Faces A Hostile Catholic Hierarchy

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Barely a day goes by without Haitians taking to the streets to cheer the impending return of their elected President. But from the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy that educated and ordained the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, there has come no word or gesture of rejoicing or support -- only silence.
To the President's many supporters within the church, it is clear that the mere thought of Father Aristide back in power is nearly as alarming to Haiti's Roman Catholic bishops as it is to the Haitian military. 
 In the past, the hierarchy has tried to prevent Father Aristide from running for office, condemned his presidency before he was even sworn in, supported the military leaders who overthrew him and opposed American efforts to restore him to power.
"Most of the bishops have sold their souls to the devil" and now fear that retribution, either at the hands of their flock or from Father Aristide, is on the way, said the Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste, an enthusiastic Aristide supporter. "People don't forget, and that's why the bishops are scared."
Just last month, Haiti's 11 bishops issued a statement saying any military intervention by the United tates to restore Father Aristide was "scandalous and immoral" and "makes us tremble with indignation."
Several of them then joined Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras and other military leaders at a Mass intended for "prayer and reflection" on the United Nations sanctions that were intended to force the military to step down.
More recently, resentment of the hierarchy's unwillingness to speak out on behalf of Father Aristide has been running especially high because of the death of the Rev. Jean-Marie Vincent, a close friend and ally of Father Aristide who was shot to death late last month, apparently by Government gunmen. When Bishop Joseph Lafontant, the apostolic administrator of the Port-au-Prince diocese, showed up at Father Vincent's funeral, he quickly found his presence was not welcome.
"Why are you here?" one mourner hissed at Bishop Lafontant as he approached Father Vincent's body, according to a priest who witnessed the scene. "You are one of the killers."
For his own part, Father Aristide has often been no less suspicious and critical of his church superiors. In his autobiography, published in 1992, he called Francois-Wolff Ligonde, the Archbishop of Port-au-Prince, "a zealous servant of Macoutism," referring to the Tontons Macoute, who terrorized civilians in the Duvalier era. Father Aristide said others were equally guilty, exempting only Bishop Willy Romelus, his sole ally in the hierarchy.
In the 29 years of the Duvalier family dictatorship, Father Aristide wrote, "bishops and Macoutes walked arm in arm, defending the same causes, but using a different vocabulary to mask their collusion for the benefit of the oligarchy." And in an apparent reference to Haiti's current military-backed Government, he added that any time a bishop "supports generals who murder liberty, he commits a crime."
Three of Port-au-Prince's Roman Catholic bishops were asked for comment about Father Aristide and his relations with the church, and none responded. The bishops' conference has made no comment about events here since its message in August criticizing American policy in Haiti, which came after more than a year of silence.
Nevertheless, Father Aristide's supporters within the church suggest, there is enough of a record to demonstrate that the hierarchy is hostile to him for both ecclesiastical and political reasons.
From the moment in 1982 that he was ordained a member of the Salesians, who are dedicated to the education of youth and parish ministry, Father Aristide's zeal to defend and fight for the country's poor, the same people who would eventually elect him to office, convinced his superiors that he was both a radical and an undisciplined priest.
The Vatican, the only body in the world that has diplomatic relations with the military Government, has also expressed doubts about Father Aristide through the papal nuncio here. Tensions have run so high that early in 1991, after a failed coup attempt, a crowd of Haitians, thinking the Vatican had had a hand in the effort to prevent Father Aristide from taking office, chased an assistant to the nuncio and ripped his clothes off.
"He is a problem for them, but not for the Haitian people," said Necker Dessables, executive secretary of the Commission for Justice and Peace, the human rights wing of the Roman Catholic Church. "Questions of obedience and canon law are perhaps primary to the bishops, but secondary to believers."
Indeed, Father Aristide appears to enjoy cordial relations with most of his fellow priests and the church faithful. "It is not Aristide who has distanced himself from the church, but the bishops who have distanced themselves from the people," said the Rev. Frantz-Michel Grandoit, a Dominican priest and university professor here.
Father Aristide has particularly close ties with the progressive wing of the church, the "ti legliz," or "little church." During the last 15 years, more than 1,000 "ecclesiastical base communities" have sprung up in Haiti to preach the gospel of liberation theology, which Father Aristide also endorses, and to work for social change.
"Ours are communities of faith that fight for justice, human rights and life," said Veronique Nelson, a member of a coalition of base communities. "Father Aristide works for that too, so we are very happy to think of his return."
But that sort of politicized approach to religion is precisely what the bishops do not want and fear will grow when Father Aristide resumes the presidency. "Direct democracy gives people too much autonomy, and they fear that in the church," Father Grandoit said. "They worry about a contamination of the church."
In 1988, it was conflicts over these and related issues that led to Father Aristide's expulsion from the Salesians. The document expelling him complained that he had engaged in "incitement to hatred and violence and a glorification of class struggle" and accused him of "profanation of the liturgy" and "a lack of sincerity and of a religious and priestly consciousness.
"Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide has always preferred to distance himself from the concrete demands of community," the decree added, "becoming a protagonist of the destabilization of the community of the faithful." What is worse, the Salesians concluded, "he has done so in a constant, public and incisive manner so that the organs of the press and groups of varied origins present him as the 'leader of the popular church' in Haiti."
Then, two years later, after Father Aristide had won election with two-thirds of the vote but just before he was sworn in, Archbishop Ligonde expressed doubts about Father Aristide's ability to govern Haiti. "Is Socialist Bolshevism going to triumph?" he asked darkly in a homily delivered from the cathedral here.
"Fear is sending a chill down the spines of many fathers and mothers of families," said Bishop Ligonde, who had presided at the wedding of Jean-Claude Duvalier, who took over from his father as a dictator.
He also expressed fear that Haiti was heading toward "an authoritarian political regime" that would install "a political police" and resort to "a campaign of denunciation."
Despite the residue of hostility left by such incidents, some of Father Aristide's supporters say his relations with the hierarchy may not be so difficult when he returns to Haiti next month. Father Aristide has contributed to that feeling with radio speeches calling for reconciliation and condemning the desire for revenge.
"He is more mature, redeemed, a democratic man," Father Jean-Juste said of Father Aristide. "He has learned a lot in the United States. If he can give amnesty to General Cedras, then why not the bishops?"

HEADLINE: ACCORD MAY GIVE NYNEX CUSTOMERS A BREAK ON RATES

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
Nynex and the staff of the New York State Public Service Commission announced yesterday that they had struck a tentative deal for a new kind of regulation that would give customers a break on rates and remove almost all limits on how much the company could earn.
The accord, if approved soon by the Public Service Commission itself, would make New York the first state in the nation to let long-distance carriers compete easily with local phone companies in handling medium-distance calls. Michigan plans to allow such competition beginning in 1996. In theory, this means that customers could end up dealing with three different phone companies: one for local calls, one for medium-range calls and one for long-distance calls. 
 The agreement announced yesterday is part of an effort by New York State to deregulate the local telephone business. It would end traditional "cost-based" regulation, in which the commission sets a limit on profits and then sets rates that will produce those profits. Instead, prices for services will be regulated and the company will be free to make as much money as it can by selling more of those services more economically. About 28 states have taken steps toward such a system, called "incentive regulation."
If the plan is approved, Nynex would cut customers' bills by a total of about $1 billion between 1995 and 1999, about 3 percent of its revenues. In 1996, rates would be 6 percent lower on average than they would have been.
"We're looking at this as a real win-win," said Richard A. Jalkut, president and chief executive of Nynex New York, the company's New York subsidiary, which serves 7.3 million customers with 10 million lines, or about 90 percent of the telephone market in the state.
Many outsiders also praised the deal. "These companies are all inefficient, and Nynex is probably the most inefficient," said Raymond E. Liguori, a telephone industry analyst at Salomon Brothers. Under traditional regulation, he said, a phone company has little incentive to cut costs because the savings go back to customers through reduced rates. "Under price regulation, they'll get to keep some of it," he said.
Nynex had 40,000 employees at the beginning of this year and reiterated yesterday that it planned to reduce its payroll by 13,000 by 1996.
If the deal is approved, consumers would notice a difference beginning on Jan. 1, when the extra charge for touch-tone service at residential numbers, now 50 cents a month, would be dropped.
The direction that prices would take in the absence of an agreement is not clear; some analysts think they would decline anyway because of competition or the threat of competition. Nynex has already lost its monopoly status in New York, with several other companies offering local telephone service, mainly to office buildings in Manhattan.
And beginning next year customers could sign up with other phone companies for the medium-range calls -- like those between, say, New Rochelle, N.Y., and Manhattan -- just as they now sign up with a long distance company for calls between New Rochelle and New Orleans.
But AT&T, MCI and some others that might be expected to enter that market said quickly yesterday that they would oppose the deal.
Those companies already do business with local phone companies on long-distance calls -- if the customer in New Rochelle calls Washington, D.C., the long-distance company would accept the call from Nynex and deliver it to the local company in Washington and pay a handling charge to each company. But the long-distance carriers are complaining that the handling charge Nynex wants for the medium-distance calls, which would be handled by Nynex at both ends, is so high that they could not compete with Nynex itself.
"The proposed plan," said Marc Rosen, an AT&T vice president, in a statement, "would effectively lock in Nynex's entrenched monopoly and lock out competitors at least until the end of the century."
But another long-distance competitor that was a party to the negotiations, Sprint, supported the deal.
Most rate cases in New York are settled through agreements among the regulated utility, consumer groups and other interested parties, and the commission staff; the commission itself then accepts the deal, rejects it or tinkers with the package and sends it back to the parties to accept or amend. The last two deals between the staff and Nynex were approved by the commission and the one before that was rejected.
That is little guide to how the commission will act in this case because the issue is not really the rates but the means of regulation itself. Still, this agreement, which has been under negotiation among 40 parties for nearly two years, follows a direction sought by the commission, toward deregulation.
The plan, intended as a bridge toward a period of even greater competition, includes several provisions designed to protect low-income consumers. It also allows for the commission to modify the arrangement if the company achieves what the staff termed "exceptional" profits.
Wall Street evidently thought Nynex could make money under the proposed deal; the stock closed yesterday at $38, up $2, in heavy trading.
The deal may have implications for the company in Washington since Nynex has applied to the Justice Department for permission to enter the long-distance market nationally. The company, analysts said, could argue that if AT&T can compete in Nynex's backyard in handling calls between New Rochelle and Manhattan, then Nynex should be able to compete with AT&T between New Rochelle and New Orleans.
Separate from yesterday's agreement on Nynex's rates, the Public Service Commission is now hearing a case about establishing competition in telecommunications, cable television and information services, and experts said this accord would push the commission toward more competition in the second case.


GRAPHIC: Nynex and the staff of the New York Public Service Commission announced an agreement yesterday that would result in major changes for the company and its customers.
 
WEHAT'S IN IT FOR CONSUMERS:
Chart: "AT A GLANCE: Reshaping Telephone Service"
The elimination of a 50-cent surcharge for Touchtone service on residential phone lines on Jan. 1, 1995.
The elimination of a $1.30 surcharge for Touchtone service on business lines on Jan. 1, 1997.
The capping of basic phone rates until 1999. Basic phone rates would be capped until 1999
Expansion of the local calling area for pay phones. For example, in New York City a call from Manhattan to Staten Island, now 40 cents, would be 25 cents.
 
WHAT'S IN IT FOR NYNEX
Elimination of the cap on profits imposed by the state, now a limit of a 9.15 percent rate of return on equity invested.
An agreement on pay phones that should let it earn more money by shortening the initial calling period, now five minutes, to three minutes.
New freedom in setting rates if the company introduces new services, like the capability to send voice messages scheduled for future delivery.
The right to argue before the Justice Department that its request to compete nationally in offering long-distance services should be granted, now that it has let national long-distance companies into its own backyard to compete in short-haul long distance calls. (pg. B2)

HEADLINE: So Much Yet to Do: Cuomo States His Case

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

 BODY:
By his own acknowledgment, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has not accomplished nearly enough in his 12 years in office on a variety of issues from education to mental health. But he argues that voters should re-elect him this year because of what he has managed to achieve in the face of a divided Legislature and a feeble economy, and because his opponent would not try to complete the work he has left undone.
The Governor spent five hours and 15 minutes delivering that message -- and demonstrating his endurance -- in a marathon interview with waves of reporters at The New York Times on Monday. Even for Mr. Cuomo, who has never had trouble talking at length, it was an uncommon performance. 
 The Governor, one of the country's most prominent Democrats, who now faces a formidable challenge from George E. Pataki, a freshman State Senator, made it clear that he would neither change the direction of his administration nor propose sweeping new programs if given a fourth term.
Instead, he said he hoped that a better economy and greater pressure from him on the Legislature would bring to fruition proposals he has failed to deliver, including a state assumption of local Medicaid costs and elimination of mandatory prison sentences for second-time drug offenders, who have swelled the state's prison population.
"I'm running again because I don't think I've gotten enough good things done," Mr. Cuomo said.
Throughout the interview, he repeatedly suggested that he has yet to create a legacy that satisfies him, even after 12 years. "What do I want to be remembered for?" he said, repeating a reporter's question.
"Being a four-term governor," he said with a smile.
Mr. Cuomo proposed the unusually long session with reporters and editors to demonstrate his command of governmental issues, in part to contrast with what his aides are characterizing as the shallowness of the Pataki campaign. He said he also wanted to create a record about his record, and like a lawyer addressing a court stenographer, he repeatedly insisted on reading a litany of statistics from note cards supplied by his special assistant, Kim Gold, who sat at his left elbow, equipped with a portable computer. A transcript of the session ran to 44,000 words.
Mr. Cuomo, who was accompanied by 11 aides, delivered a masterly performance in the role of himself: playful and jousting, tentatively repentant for self-confessed venial sins, ever eager to attack the premise before addressing the question. "A paraphrase can be a dangerous instrument," he warned at one moment, quibbling with a questioner's restatement of his views on local government. After a series of deadlocked exchanges on a single point with another reporter, he demanded: "What's the matter? You got a block?"
Mr. Pataki, a Republican, is scheduled to attend a similar session at The Times, although the questioning is not scheduled to last as long.
As if he were running against his own government, Mr. Cuomo acknowledged throughout the session on Monday many of the frustrations that have contributed to his lowest approval ratings. Taxes, he said, were too high. State government was inefficient. Spending was higher than he wanted, though not high enough to begin chipping away at plagues like homelessness, drug addiction and AIDS.
And yet he argued that the record of the last 12 years should be sufficient reason to return him to Albany. Voters, he said, "should be astonished" at how he had cut personal income tax rates, spent billions on road and bridge construction and encouraged bus and subway car manufacturers to locate in New York.
"I think New Yorkers should concentrate on the agenda I completed and say, 'My God, how did you do it?' " Mr. Cuomo said. He added: "Some things take time. And if I got so much done over the last 12, why can't you assume I'm going to get a whole lot done over the next four?"
More often than not, Mr. Cuomo attributed his governmental disappointments to forces beyond his control.
Bringing equity and order to the public schools, he said, was largely the province of local school administrators and the Board of Regents. Effective pilot programs in areas like welfare and education could not be expanded because a national recession dried up the state's revenues. Relieving local governments of Medicaid costs had not been possible because the Senate Republicans refused to agree. Taxes were high because local governments had failed to control spending.
Although he is perhaps best known for his oratorical skills, Mr. Cuomo said he had not always communicated effectively as Governor. He said repeatedly, for instance, that he should have lobbied individual legislators more aggressively, rather than just dealing with the legislative leaders in each house. The only other mistakes he could cite were cutting the state's tourism budget, raising the hotel tax and not traveling enough on trade missions overseas.
Throughout his tenure in Albany, Mr. Cuomo has been criticized for not expending political capital -- or not using it wisely -- to manhandle a Legislature where the Republican Senate and the Democratic Assembly oppose each other on virtually every issue.
Yet Mr. Cuomo described the process of squeezing incremental change out of the Legislature as one that takes time, like a stream eroding a canyon wall.
"You can't surrender on their ability eventually to be rational," he said. He added, "If you're persistent and keep pushing, something happens."
And yet, on the issue of raising the welfare grant, which Mr. Cuomo has said is unreasonably low, the Governor maintained that he had not proposed an increase in recent years because he knew the Legislature would never approve one. "I thought I wouldn't get it," he said.
Mr. Cuomo said he had not lost confidence in the liberal vision of government as a force for good. But he also paid homage to a father of supply-side conservatism, Arthur B. Laffer, whose philosophy Mr. Cuomo ridiculed during the Reagan and Bush administrations. "To some extent it works," said Mr. Cuomo, who signed tax cuts in 1987 and 1994 and has said he will propose more tax cuts next year if he is re-elected.
As he has throughout his political life, Mr. Cuomo said he opposed the death penalty because it is an instruction in brutality, because innocents could be executed and because there is no proof it is a deterrent.
But he said that life without parole for murderers and repeat felons would deter. "Living the rest of your life in a 6 1/2-by-8 cell, for an hour or two a day outside, with no intercourse of any kind with human beings that's meaningful, with no role in life, with no future, with no dignity, is regarded as a fate worse than death," he said.
In discussing social policy, Mr. Cuomo pointed frequently to pilot programs that have yet to be replicated statewide. He spoke of Working Towards Independence, a workfare program that requires public sector employment of 33,500 able-bodied recipients of Home Relief, or about 2 percent of the state's total welfare population. He touted 21st Century Schools, a new initiative to relieve schools of state regulations, which may be implemented at up to 60 of the state's 5,000 schools over the next five years.
He said the state was not spending enough to solve its social problems, but was spending far more than other states. "Are you spending so much that they call you a neo-socialist state?" he said. "Yes. Are you spending more than the Republican-Conservatives want you to? Yes. Are you spending more than you will if they win? Absolutely."
Ultimately, Mr. Cuomo said, New Yorkers must make a choice between philosophies, and he sought to depict Mr. Pataki as the captive of what he called the radical right.
"What I see happening in this country, and maybe in this state if we're not careful, is that you may be led by people who are driven by political winds and who will take you wherever the winds blow," he said. "Right now they're blowing toward Pat Robertson in this state, gun people."
Mr. Cuomo added: "I'm very eager to keep the voice of this state civil, sound, balanced, intelligent, honest. That's all I'm thinking about."

Chart: "GOVERNOR'S RACE: Recent Polls"
 The latest polls on the New York State Governor's race show the contest between Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and his Republican challenger, George E. Pataki, to be a statistical dead heat.
 A poll conducted by the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute in Hamden, Conn., released yesterday, found a 4-point lead for Mr. Cuomo among "likely" voters. The poll, conducted with 501 registered voters who said they would definitely vote on Nov. 8, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
 The Marist Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie, found the reverse in their poll released Monday. Mr. Pataki led by 6 points in the poll of 911 registered voters. Among 560 "likely" voters, Mr. Pataki led Mr. Cuomo by 3 points. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.
 One explanation for the difference in these two polls may be found in the proportion of New York City voters in each poll. Thirty-seven percent of the likely voters in the Quinnipiac College Poll were from New York City, while New York City residents only made up 30 percent of the likely voters in the Marist College Poll.
 Graphs show the results of the Quinnipiac College Poll and the Marist College Poll. (pg. B5)

HEADLINE: Republicans Offer Voters a Deal for Takeover of House

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
With flags waving, a band playing and a bank of television cameras rolling, Republican candidates for the House of Representatives mustered on the steps of the Capitol today to sign a list of tax cuts and other measures that they promised to press in their first 100 days if they win control of the House in November. They called it their "contract with America."
In a way, it was a throwback to the Reagan era with pledges of deep reductions in taxes for individuals and companies, a stronger military and a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget. In Reagan fashion, there was little mention of exactly where Government spending would be cut so that the lower taxes would not worsen the budget deficit. 
 But the 10-point list of promises made today differed with the Reagan policies in one important respect. The social issues like abortion, gun control, school prayer and flag-burning that dominated Republican dogma in the 1980's were ignored.
Democrats derided the Republicans as fiscally irresponsible.
"All told," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, "their contract would blow a hole in the Federal budget of roughly $1 trillion."
But Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who is in line to be Republican leader in the next Congress and Speaker of the House if Republicans are in the majority, was not fazed by Democratic accusations that Republicans sought a free lunch -- lower taxes with no way to pay for them.
He quoted Franklin D. Roosevelt: "We have nothing to fear but fear itself." He quoted Ronald Reagan: "We have every right to dream heroic dreams; after all, we are Americans." And he said that while it might be a heroic dream to think the budget could be balanced, it could be accomplished through "tremendous creativity and new effort."
The rally on the steps off the West Front of the Capitol had the flavor of a political convention. A band of retired military musicians played Sousa marches and college fight songs. Hundreds of miniature American flags were passed out. Candidates wore large name tags, and some waved placards. Eventually, more than 300 Republican candidates, incumbents and challengers alike, filed past a table covered with red, white and blue bunting and signed their "contract with America."
The contract resembled a party platform: a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget in five years and a three-fifths vote of both houses of Congress to raise taxes; a tax credit of $500 per child, regardless of the parents' income; a tax reduction for married couples; tax-free savings accounts; lower taxes for middle-and upper-income Social Security beneficiaries; tax breaks to help Americans buy insurance to cover long-term medical care; lower capital gains tax rates; more favorable depreciation rules for businesses; term limits for members of Congress; more applications of the death penalty; cuts in spending on welfare; a stronger military, and much, much more.
Adding to the festivities was a large fund-raising event tonight, similar to those held during party conventions, where the Republican candidates hoped to pocket donations from the very lobbyists and political action committees that they criticize in the abstract.
A net of 40 seats would have to swing from Democrats to Republicans for them to win control of the House in the November election. The morning line is that Republicans may well pick up 25 to 30 seats but are not likely to reach 40.
But Republican leaders today expressed confidence that they would beat the conventional odds. Representative L. William Paxon of upstate New York, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said he had reviewed all the opinion polls and believed that if the election were held today, Republicans would win the House.
One reason for the event today was to dispel the notion that Republicans are obstructionists who have no ideas of their own. Republican candidates for the Senate put out a similar platform last week.
"It's important that we stand for something," said Grant Lally, who is running against Representative Gary L. Ackerman in a district that includes parts of Long Island and Queens.
A matter that worries some Republicans is that they have given Democrats a target to shoot at for the rest of the campaign. Before this, when the Republican manifesto was limited to opposing President Clinton, Democratic candidates found it hard to take the offensive. Now, Democrats can tote up the Republican proposals and argue that they have promised to favor the rich at the expense of the less fortunate and would break the national economy.
Come what may on Nov. 8, today belonged to Mr. Gingrich. Standing in the sunshine, just below where Bill Clinton took the oath of office, he spoke with a flourish usually reserved for inaugurations and acceptance speeches at party conventions.
"If the American people accept this contract," he vowed, "we will have begun the journey to renew American civilization. Together we can renew America. Together we can help every American fulfill their unalienable right to pursue happiness and to seek the American dream. Together we can help every human across the planet seek freedom, prosperity, safety and the rule of law. That is what is at stake."

HEADLINE: Clinton and Yeltsin Smile and Hug and Set Bosnia Aside

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia tried today to sidestep disagreements on sticky issues between them, including what to do next in Bosnia, and put on a public display of shared affection as they opened a two-day summit.
The meeting between the Russian and American leaders is the first in the capital in more than two years, and from the moment Mr. Clinton threw a bear hug around Mr. Yeltsin at the diplomatic entrance to the White House this morning, almost everything about it seemed designed to project warmth and goodwill. 
 "The Russian-American relationship is at last, remarkably, a normal one, full of real accomplishment and genuine promise," Mr. Clinton declared in a welcoming ceremony on the South Lawn. He later showed off campaign memorabilia and other knickknacks to Mr. Yeltsin in the Oval Office, then escorted him to a garden patio from which the two leaders banished their aides and spent two hours swapping views on politics, both foreign and domestic.
Administration officials said that Mr. Clinton tried privately to persuade Mr. Yeltsin to halt weapons sales to Iran that amounted to $1 billion last year, and said tonight they believed he might have succeeded. They also expressed some discomfort about Mr. Yeltsin's recent talk of a Russian sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union, particularly his aggressive view of how to bring peace to Nagorno-Karabakh.
But now that Russia has withdrawn its last troops from the Baltics and Central Europe, there was finally no need for the American President to issue somber declarations about how important such a step would be, aides to Mr. Clinton noted with delight. And for the first time, they said, Mr. Clinton had no plans to complain about what he now regards as Russia's satisfactory progress toward building a market economy.
It was clear today, however, that Russia and the United States remain at least publicly divided on whether it is nearly time to allow weapons to flow freely to the Bosnian Muslims, a plan that Mr. Clinton and Congress have long endorsed to even the odds in the two-and-a-half-year-old war.
But as a compromise took shape today that would postpone such a step until next spring, it appeared that the two leaders might maintain -- at least for the duration of the summit meeting -- an appearance of common cause on Bosnia that aides to the two leaders say it is vital to maintain.
"The United States is a strong partner and not an easy one to deal with, just like Russia," Mr. Yeltsin said at this morning's ceremony on the South Lawn. The Russian Government maintains close bonds with the Bosnian Serbs, and Mr. Yeltsin declared during a photo session in the Oval Office later that his "response would be negative" if the United States moved on its own to arm the Muslim-led Bosnian Government. That is the step that Congress has said Mr. Clinton should take after Oct. 15 if he cannot win international approval to do so.
But Mr. Clinton quickly interjected to suggest that the disagreement might have become "largely academic" now that President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, in an address at the United Nations today, said that his Government agreed to a six-month delay in lifting the embargo.
Even as Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Clinton sat talking this morning across a glass-topped patio table on black wrought-iron patio chairs, their top advisers, including Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, were inside the White House discussing whether such a compromise could hold. Mr. Clinton must still honor a Congressional demand that seeks United Nations approval to arm the Bosnian Muslims if the Serbs do not agree to peace terms by the middle of next month.
Tonight, after an afternoon meeting at which the two Presidents finally joined their aides, Administration officials said it was not yet clear that Russia -- or Britain or France -- was ready to support a United Nations resolution setting a date to lift the embargo, even if the effective date were put off until next spring. Mr. Christopher said weeks of delicate diplomacy lay ahead.
By essentially setting Bosnia aside for now, however, the two leaders left themselves to revel today in what one senior Administration official called "a close relationship, a very good relationship, a positive relationship." Even before today's meeting began, Mr. Clinton had already spent more time with Mr. Yeltsin than with any other foreign leader, and that closeness was reflected this morning in the courtly kiss the Russian President bestowed on Hillary Rodham Clinton's right hand, and in the left-right-left series of Russian-style smacks Mrs. Clinton proferred on Naina Yeltsin's cheeks.
"It wasn't so long ago that Russian-American summits were moments of high drama and sometimes disappointing results," Mr. Clinton said at this morning's ceremony, at which the flags of the two countries fluttered in the breeze and a fife-and-drum corps adorned in fake powdered wigs played "Yankee Doodle Dandy."
"Today, we meet not as adversaries, but as partners in the quest for a more prosperous and more peaceful planet."
This is the fifth time that the two Presidents have met since Mr. Clinton took office 20 months ago, but it is their first meeting in Washington, and the White House has pulled out all the stops to make Mr. Yeltsin feel at home. He and his wife are staying not in the Russian Embassy, the overnight spot at every previous superpower summit meeting for at least two decades, but in Blair House, the guest residence across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House.
Tonight, the Yeltsins were guests at a state dinner that is just the second that the Clintons have given. And earlier in the day, to soothe Russian feelings bruised by exclusion from last summer's D-Day ceremonies, Mr. Clinton convened a Rose Garden gathering of retired Russian and American soldiers meant to commemorate the Soviet Union's contribution in helping to defeat Nazi Germany.
But Mr. Clinton also felt comfortable enough in the midst of the low-key summit meeting to dash away briefly this evening to a reception in honor of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus before returning to the White House -- already wearing his dinner jacket -- for the ceremonial dinner.
In a speech to the United Nations on Monday, Mr. Yeltsin left some Administration officials troubled with a declaration that Russia would bear "the burden for peacekeeping" within the former Soviet Union. The United States has already suggested that Russia should be more willing to work through international organizations in trying to control the war in Nagorno-Karabakh, where many people have died and a million people have been displaced over the last six years.
At a White House briefing this evening, Secretary Christopher declined publicly to criticize Mr. Yeltsin's speech. But Administration officials said the differences between the two countries over Russian peacekeeping operations had been a focus of this afternoon's meeting between the Presidents and their delegations.
It was unclear tonight what inducements the Administration might offer to persuade Russia to curtail its sales of weapons to Iran, which the United States has tried to establish as an international pariah, along with Iraq, Libya and North Korea. Last year alone, Russia sold submarines, tanks and air-launched missiles to the Iranian Government, but until now, Moscow has insisted that it should remain free to sell arms to third world countries, particularly since it badly needs hard currency and since the United States does the same.
While today's discussion focused on security issues, the summit meeting is expected to emphasize business deals. The United States has pledged $525 million to help finance and provide risk insurance for investments in Russia, and additional agreements to be announced this week are expected to boost the total of new American investments in Russia to $1 billion.

HEADLINE: White House Regrouping For Round 2 on Health

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
With funeral rites barely over for the year's effort to overhaul health insurance, Hillary Rodham Clinton and other White House officials are talking inside and outside the Administration about why they failed and how a pared-back proposal might be sold next year.
How much it would be pared back will not be decided until November, after elections determine how many Democrats will be in Washington next year to offer support. A senior White House official who insisted on anonymity called the discussions strictly informal: Even the most basic issues, including whether the Clintons should put their names on a new plan, will not be resolved until after Congress goes home and serious work on the 1996 Federal budget begins early this winter. 
 Still, Mrs. Clinton is already meeting with the private groups that were the Administration's strongest backers in this summer's crusade for health care legislation, telling them not to despair and asking their advice for a future effort.
White House and Congressional officials said in interviews today that they were in agreement on two points: If they do not try again next year to overhaul the health insurance system, many voters who expects Mr. Clinton to make good on his campaign promise will exact revenge at the polls. And if a health care overhaul does not become law, the Federal deficits that Mr. Clinton has bragged of cutting will begin to grow again.
"Health care reform is going to remain not only a social imperative, but a fiscal imperative as well," said Gene Sperling, a senior official of the National Economic Council. "It is still the most logical, the most sound way to bring down the rising costs of Federal health care spending."
Experts say the explosive growth of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which offer heavily subsidized health care to retirees and the poor, are most responsible for the annual deficit.
But with top officials consumed by Congress's last gasps and the midterm election campaign, neither the White House nor Democratic lawmakers have made much effort yet to prepare a health care strategy. "Presumably, this will stay high on the agenda," said a senior White House official.
He and others said no one has examined the potential scope of legislation, whether it would be written in the White House or Congress, how it would be marketed to voters and lawmakers, or even whether the Clintons would place their personal stamp on it, as they did this year.
Mrs. Clinton and Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, met last week with other high-ranking aides to discuss their failed legislative campaign and the odds facing a renewed effort next year, officials said, but no decisions were made.
And Mrs. Clinton has been making the rounds of the private groups that lobbied on behalf of the Administration's health care package this summer, offering sympathy and soliciting advice.
Dr. Irwin Redlener, president of the New York-based Children's Health Fund, said today that he told Mrs. Clinton in a meeting earlier this month that his group planned to support "Kids First" legislation next year that would extend health insurance coverage to all children.
At a meeting a year ago, Mrs. Clinton argued to him that the best way to help children was to enact universal insurance coverage, Dr. Redlener said.
He said of his recent meeting with Mrs. Clinton: "What I found was a person who was still incredibly committed to the big goals of fixing the health care system and getting to the point where she can again begin talking about universal coverage and access guaranteed to everybody. But she did say to me that the idea of getting children covered first was a very acceptable first step."
Dr. Redlener added that Mrs. Clinton "was frustrated and disappointed, certainly, but nowhere near giving up on this."
There is no shortage of advice on what to do next.
Moderate Democrats say the urgency of the deficit problem -- and the strong prospect that the next Congress will be more conservative and pinchpenny -- offers the Clintons an opportunity to cast an overhaul of the health care system as a budget issue rather than a new Government social program.
White House officials call that one of several options, and said the domestic agenda to be presented to the next Congress may well include other programs -- welfare overhaul, deficit reduction and so-called investments in the national infrastructure -- that would dovetail with an attempt to control health care costs.
But some say that tack would only put the Administration at odds with groups that supported this year's health care crusade, like the American Association of Retired Persons, and which oppose efforts to curtail Federal benefits.
Others suggest the White House should learn from this summer's effort, in which Republicans used Mr. Clinton's sagging popularity to tag the Democratic proposal as the "Clinton plan," and simply leave the drafting to Congress.
"The biggest lesson learned is that if you want Congress to pass something, it's got to be something that grows out of Congress," the Senate Democratic strategist said.
Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster whose firm has lent its voice to past White House political discussions, said Mr. Clinton was best advised to treat this month's collapse of the health care crusade as a public loss, not a personal one.
So far, Mr. Clinton appears to be doing that. White House officials say the President is unlikely to make Republican opposition to the proposal a major campaign issue, in part because the White House is likely to need Republicans next year if any legislation is to pass.
Another official who spoke on the condition of anonymity suggested that if Mr. Clinton campaigned on the issue much, it would be to rail against the "special interests" that played a role in defeating the effort.

HEADLINE: No Fed Rate Rise, and No Big Market Moves

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's top interest rate policy committee adjourned after a four-hour meeting today without announcing any change in short-term interest rates.
But the consensus of economists was that the committee probably gave Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, considerable leeway to raise rates again before the committee next meets on Nov. 15, particularly if Government economic data issued in the next six weeks show signs that inflation is rising 
 Financial markets showed little reaction to the central bank session. Stocks gained slightly, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 13.80 points, to 3,863.04. [Page D8.] Long-term interest rates edged up in the bond market, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond at 7.84 percent. [Page D15.]
The Fed issued only a brief statement after today's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which controls the interest rates that banks pay to borrow money overnight. "The F.O.M.C. meeting ended at 1 P.M.," the statement said. "There will be no further announcements."
A virtually identical statement followed the committee's meeting in early July. At that time the committee also chose to leave short-term interest rates unchanged, while giving Mr. Greenspan explicit permission to raise them in the ensuing weeks.
Mr. Greenspan did not do so, and the committee raised short-term interest rates by half a percentage point at its next meeting, on Aug. 16. Today's meeting was the first one since then.
The Fed's apparent decision not to raise short-term interest rates today makes it likely that the interest rates that Americans pay on their credit cards, adjustable-rate mortgages and home-equity loans will also remain unchanged for the time being.
The central bank has repeatedly raised rates because of concerns that the pace of inflation, now slightly less than 3 percent a year, may soon accelerate. Some members of the open market committee fear higher inflation may lie in the future because factories are operating closer to full capacity than they have in five years, a situation that could lead people to start bidding up the prices of scarce labor and materials.
Other members of the committee worry that the Fed may have supplied too much credit to banks last year, increasing the amount of money in circulation and allowing Americans to bid up the price of gold and commodities. Both methods of analysis have produced similar conclusions in Fed officials that interest rates should rise.
Those officials who look at whether factories are operating at full capacity -- a group that is believed to include Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman, and possibly Mr. Greenspan -- may have looked at figures issued today by the Conference Board, a New York-based research group supported by businesses, as evidence that the economy is not going to overheat soon. The Conference Board announced that its figures showed consumer confidence fell for the third consecutive month, suggesting that consumers may not be bidding up the prices for the limited output of factories any time soon.
Until this year, the Fed never issued any announcement at the end of such policy meetings, leaving investors to guess its intentions from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's purchases and sales of Treasury bonds every morning. While the open market committee could theoretically have decided on an interest-rate increase this morning but decided not to announce it, this seems unlikely given the strong support that many Fed officials are expressing privately in favor of announcing interest-rate increases.
The increase in interest rates on Aug. 16 was the fifth this year, following increases on Feb. 4, March 22, April 18 and May 17. Taken together, these increases have pushed up the Federal funds rate, which banks pay each other for overnight loans, to 4.75 percent from 3 percent.
The Fed has also raised the discount rate, which banks pay to borrow money overnight from the Fed, by half a percentage point on May 17 and again on Aug. 16. The two changes have increased the discount rate to 4 percent from 3 percent at the beginning of this year.
John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said that he thought Mr. Greenspan was likely to raise interest rates before the Nov. 15 meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee, particularly if the Labor Department reports strong growth in employment in September. The department's report will be released on Oct. 7.
While the White House took no position before today's meeting on whether interest rates should rise, some officials, including Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, have said repeatedly in recent days that they do not foresee any sharp rise in inflation in the coming months.
The Fed has come under slowly mounting pressure from businesses to slow the pace of interest rate increases or stop them entirely.
An informal survey by the National Association of Manufacturers of 81 of the 115 executives who attended a conference here on Saturday found that 40 wanted the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates. Another 29 executives wanted the Fed to wait until later this year or early next year before raising rates further, while only 12 executives wanted the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates soon.
Jerry Jasinowski, who was the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Policy in the Carter Administration and is now the president of the Washington-based trade group, welcomed today's silence from the Fed. "I think it is fairly obvious that they just decided, wisely, to take a wait-and-see attitude because they don't have enough information about inflation or growth to make a decision at this point," he said.

HEADLINE: The Cuomo Legacy, as He Would Tell It

 BODY:
Governor Cuomo was asked what legacy he thought he had left to New York after 12 years in office, and what he hoped to accomplish in another term.
CUOMO I don't talk about legacies. This is a big argument I had with my son a long time ago and he said unless you go out there and talk about legacy and pick one thing and say it over and over they'll never remember you for anything. And that's probably the way it will come out. Except I was against the death penalty. 
 Q. What do you want to be remembered for?
A. What do I want to be remembered for? [Smiling.] Being a four-term governor. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Have you changed your mind about anything in 12 years as Governor?
A. Well, I've changed my mind about how to deal with the Legislature. The things I mentioned to you before, about traveling.
Q. What do you mean about traveling?
A. I haven't traveled enough.
Q. Around the state, you mean?
A. No, no, no, around the country. Oh, the state, that I will never fault myself for. Thank God, I mean, I have seen more of the state than anybody who ever lived, I'm sure. And I love it. I mean, that's been all the joy. So, no, traveling around the state. Traveling internationally, everybody was after me in the early years, you have to travel and I was naive about that. I liked the desk. I liked the work. I liked feeling that I'm dealing with it and I know what's happening and I didn't think it was important for me to go to Brazil. . . .
Q. To put it another way, what have you learned in 12 years?
A. Oh, God. I have to go to the diary. I can -- I learn every day. Oh, I mean -- what can I tell you. I mean, I'm not sure I can distill it down to -- I've learned a lot about communication. I've learned a lot about how difficult it is. I've learned that the only way to communicate successfully . . . is simplicity and reiteration. Constant reiteration of simple ideas. . . .
Q. To use the word you like, what is really the rationale for a fourth term?
A. I took you through two recessions. And at the same time laid a foundation for a powerful new economy. More powerful than any you've ever had in the state. In the process of doing that, we changed all sorts of things dramatically. We created the first centers of advanced technology and gave you an infrastructure you never had before. We changed your taxes to the lowest level in 30 years. We changed your roads and bridges with the biggest building program in our history. . . .
We changed with Battery Park, which I built almost all up with Stuyvesant, with structures like that, all over the state. We introduced the first environmental protection fund, the first acid rain law, the first park fund, a whole series of firsts. We gave you one of the best Court of Appeals in the country with the first woman, the first woman Chief Judge, the first two blacks, the first Latino, and that after 200 years of waiting. We gave you an ethics law that I had to fight the Legislature to get and the strongest ethics law in our history. We're giving you a whole new approach to elementary education. We gave you 500,000 new jobs and 50,000 new businesses. And we gave you a whole new high-tech economy.
[But that was in the past, the Governor was reminded. What would he tell New Yorkers about the future?]
CUOMO Well, the recession is behind us. Happy days are near again. Happy days will be here again before I'm through. The evidence is clear -- you've had 90,000 new jobs from July of '93 to July of '94. You have all those indicators I gave you before about things getting better here. You have high-tech products being invented and sold around the world. You have exports growing faster and investment growing faster than anywhere else. This will be the high-tech capital of the United States of America. This will be the higher education capital of the United States of America -- over the next four years. It's very close to that now.
This will be the health services capital of the United States of America. It's very close to that now. We will be the primary care capital of America. We're very close to being, if we're not there already, the most progressive welfare system in the United States of America. . . .
[The Governor was asked whether he thought he would win.]
CUOMO I don't think about that. I never have. I don't live that way. I really don't. I'm planning on winning. I'm filled with things that we have to do after we win. . . .
I'm very proud of what we did with energy last week. And the taxes. You'll like what we're going to say about the taxes. It will still be very reasonable, we're saying we're not, if we can't do it without hurting the city, we're not going to do it. I know I'm very eager to get at the Legislature again. I'm very eager to keep the voice of this state civil, sound, balanced, intelligent, honest. . . .
I have always been luckier than I deserve. I can't imagine anything happening to me that would make me feel sorry for myself. So I'm not troubled so much. I would be very disappointed if I didn't succeed this time. I've wanted this one more than any of the previous three. Because this is a different moment in American history. There is a harshness and a negativism and a fear out there that concerns me and that New York can help relieve because we are seen and heard everywhere. . . .
So I would be very disappointed if I don't get the chance.

HEADLINE: Officer Shoots Boy Holding A Toy Gun

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
Playing with a toy gun in the Gowanus Houses in Brooklyn, where real guns are all too common, a 13-year-old boy was shot and wounded last night by a police officer.
Nicholas Heyward was one of about a dozen boys playing cops-and-robbers just after sunset, chasing each other in the project with toy firearms. The boys said the rules of the game, played in the grimy halls and dimly lit stairwells of the 14-floor tower at 423 Baltic Avenue, were these: Each boy got three lives, and after being "shot" three times had to change sides. 
 About 7:30 P.M., Brian George, 23, a housing police officer assigned to the project, was on his regular foot patrol through the building. "As he ascended the stairwell, he saw a youth with a gun," said Chief Joseph Leake of the housing police.
Officer George fired one shot from his .38-caliber service revolver. The bullet hit Nicholas in the stomach and passed out his back. He underwent surgery at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan and was listed in serious but stable condition.
Whether the boy somehow provoked the shooting was unclear, the police said. The Brooklyn District Attorney's office was also investigating.
Katrell Fowler, 14, and Ronald Herron, 12, were with Nicholas when he was shot, but both Katrell, who was standing directly behind Nicholas, and Ronald, who was farther up the stairs, said they did not see the officer approach or fire. Both boys were questioned at length last night at the 76th Precinct station house.
Nicholas apparently saw the officer, Katrell said. "He said, 'We're playing.' Then I heard the shot."
Ronald added, "We thought it was an M-80" firecracker. But then he heard Nicholas say, "Somebody help me," he said.
Rosemarie Rivera, whose apartment is near the stairwell, said she heard the shot and went to the stairs, where she saw Officer George kneeling over Nicholas, who lay on his back, his eyes blinking. "He said: 'Shot in the stomach. Do you know his mother?' " Mrs. Rivera said. "I said yes, and he said, 'Can you please go get her?' "
In an interview at the hospital, Nicholas's mother, Angela Heyward said: "When they said it was my son, I ran up there, but he was already on his way to the hospital. This is a bad dream."
The boys in the project often play football or basketball outdoors in the afternoon and evening, residents said, but they chose an indoor game yesterday because it was raining. The cops-and-robbers game is also a common one, and several adults said they had warned the boys about the dangers of playing with toy guns.
Chief Leake displayed an 18-inch-long, brown-and-black plastic toy rifle that he said was recovered from the landing. But people who saw the boys playing earlier disagreed on the description of the toy gun Nicholas had been brandishing, some saying it was an orange-and-black water gun.
Katrell Fowler said that Nicholas's gun was like the one the police recovered, but had an orange tip that broke off when the boy dropped it as he was shot. Katrell said his own gun was orange.
Whichever toy he had, residents said it was clearly not a real gun. "I saw my son with a little plastic toy rifle," his father, Nicholas Heyward Sr., said at the hospital. "If you looked at it you could see it was a plastic toy gun."
Tina McCloud, a family friend, said, "You can't say the gun looked real."
The shooting occurred just below the roof-level landing of the building, a spot that residents said is one of the most dangerous in the building, where officers often patrol with their guns drawn because it common site for criminal activity. Nicholas fell below a window that is pocked with bullet holes. Chief Leake said he did not know whether Officer George, who has been on the force for two years, had his gun out as he climbed the stairs, but said that he would not want to patrol there with his gun holstered.
Nicholas, who attends Intermediate School 293, lives with his parents in another building in the project, at 413 Baltic Avenue. His father is unemployed and his mother, Angela Heyward, said she works for the state, but would not be more specific.
"My son is a straight-A student," Ms. Heyward said. "He comes home, he walks the dog, he does his homework."
Neighbors agreed with his parents' description of Nicholas as a boy who stayed out of trouble.
There have been a number of instances of people waving toy weapons being shot, sometimes fatally, by police officers or others who thought they were real.

HEADLINE: Investors Lose Money In 'Safe' Fund

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Money market funds have long been thought to be among the safest investments for the average person, because they hold safe, short-term assets that do not stand to lose value if interest rates change. But the Securities and Exchange Commission said today that for the first time in memory investors in a money market fund had lost money.
More than a dozen other money market funds have experienced portfolio losses as a result of ill-advised investments in recent months, but their managers have made up for those losses themselves so that their investors did not lose any money. In this case, however, the fund manager, Community Assets Management, based in Denver, cannot afford to pay off investors, and will liquidate the fund at a loss. 
 "The moral is that any fund can lose money," said Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the S.E.C. "This serves as a warning of the steps the S.E.C. needs to take to protect investors who are not aware of the risk they are undertaking."
The cause of Community Assets' losses was ill-timed investments in complex financial instruments, called derivatives, which used Government securities as the basis for making risky bets on interest rate changes. While the fund experiencing the loss was small and catered to large institutional investors, the loss broke an unspoken assurance that investors have grown to rely on: When investors put $1 into a money market fund, they will always get at least $1 back.
This belief has helped money markets grow to more than $600 billion in assets and become a vehicle used by average investors as a higher-yielding substitute for bank passbook accounts. These funds typically invest in short-term, high-quality securities and are considered among the safest of investment products offered by mutual funds and banks.
Yesterday's disclosure comes amid increasing concern and mounting losses from derivatives throughout the mutual fund industry -- not just in money market funds. BankAmerica this year put in more than $60 million to cover derivative losses in two money market funds and 13 other banks or brokers have had to do the same in recent months. The Paine Webber Group is putting up $268 million to cover customer losses from a derivative-laden mutual fund. Piper Jaffray Companies, said it would pay up to $25 million to investors in a fund that has paper losses of $700 million from derivatives.
But the decision by Community Assets Management to liquidate, rather than to cover $2 million in losses is a first. Investors in the fund will receive 94 cents for each $1 invested, and while their losses are relatively small, the action is highly symbolic.
Mutual fund industry leaders quickly characterized this action as an isolated situation. But others say it could well be a harbinger of more trouble. On Capitol Hill, where Mr. Levitt made the disclosure today, Representative Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House committee that oversees the S.E.C., warned that this might be "the canary in the mine."
"This was inevitable," said A. Michael Lipper, chairman of Lipper Analytical Services, which rates funds' performance. "We only know how dangerous this is after the fact. I think much of this has been flushed out of lots of portfolios. But that's not to say there isn't more out there."
Steven E. Norwitz, a spokesman for T. Rowe Price, a Baltimore-based mutual fund company, said the incident was isolated, but that investors in T. Rowe Price funds had been expressing concern about the use of derivatives in funds, prompting the company to provide new assurances that it was careful.
Representatives for the Vanguard Group and Fidelity Investments, the nation's two largest direct-mail mutual fund companies, said that their funds invested only in low-risk derivatives, and sparingly. But they, too, have received investor questions.
"We hear from our telephone banks," said Jeremy Duffield, senior vice president at Vanguard. "And we've had to write new pieces to explain derivatives."
The fund facing the losses, Community Bankers Mutual Fund, has about $35.5 million of its $82.2 million in assets in derivatives, primarily secured notes that were created from a variety of United States Government agency securities. Their value floats with interest rates.
The use of these derviatives helped the fund become the best-performing of all United States Government Agency money market funds over the 12 months ended last August, with an annual return of 3.6 percent, according to Lipper Analytical. Its assets swelled from $86.1 million in September 1993 to $102.7 million at the end of August.
But, as interest rates rose this year, dealers who made markets in the underlying government securities that supported these derivatives stopped buying them. This made their value plunge and caused them to become illiquid -- or virtually impossible to sell.
In a letter to the fund's shareholders, 112 community banks, primarily in Colorado, the fund outlined a frantic attempt by its adviser to raise capital to cover these losses.
The letter said that the adviser first tried to get either debt or equity financing. Then it tried to seek loans from people who did business with it. Finally, it tried to sell the fund. It also negotiated without success with the broker-dealers who sold the derivatives to the fund, the fund's insurer and the Government agencies that issued the securities used to create the derivatives.
"The problem is that a lot of people don't understand derivatives," Mr. Levitt said in testimony before the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance.

HEADLINE: Blinking First on Trade;
The U.S. and Japan Duel for High Stakes As Clinton Wields the Threat of Sanctions

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Japanese and American negotiators engaged in a high-stakes economic duel today, with Japan insisting that it would make no more trade concessions to Washington and the Americans insisting that they would hit Tokyo with trade sanctions if more concessions were not forthcoming.
The Clinton Administration's confrontation with Japan, one American official remarked, is the economic equivalent of the confrontation with Haiti, with only one major difference: "This is really important." 
 As it did with Haiti, the Administration has spent more than a year trying to find a negotiated solution with Japan, and, as such a solution remained elusive, it gradually introduced the threat of force in the form of trade sanctions.
Now that the negotiations are in an endgame, the President finds himself in a position where he will either persuade the Japanese to make the concessions he is seeking in the next three days, or he will have to carry out his threat to initiate punitive tariffs on Sept. 30. If Mr. Clinton backs down, his credibility in economic warfare could be destroyed.
At this late stage, it is impossible to tell who will blink first. Both sides have enormous economic incentives to avoid a confrontation, but they also have enormous economic and political stakes in not backing down.
The betting within the Administration and among the Japanese is that some sort of compromise will be found in which the two sides will reach agreement in some areas and the United States will apply small sanctions in areas where it gets no satisfaction from Tokyo. Such an outcome could allow the Administration to reap at least some benefit from the last 14 months of negotiations, while imposing trade sanctions that are just enough to preserve its credibility but not enough to disrupt global currency markets.
Everyone involved in the talks, though, stresses that the outcome at this stage is unclear, and will not become clear until minutes before Friday's deadline.
Mr. Clinton's Administration is as divided on the question of using economic force against Japan as it was on using military force against Haiti.
On one side is the use-of-force camp -- primarily the Commerce Department and the United States trade representative's office. Their argument goes like this: If the history of American-Japanese trade negotiations teaches anything, it is that the Japanese will never make concessions except under extreme pressure. This would seem particularly so with the current weak and ideologically divided Japanese Cabinet.
The use-of-force camp insists that the importance of these talks with Japan goes well beyond the Japanese market. With the new global trade agreement, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, soon to take effect, the world is about to enter an era in which official, formal tariff barriers between countries will be disappearing. The GATT accord lowers or phases out most tariffs -- taxes that countries impose on imports -- over the next 10 years in 123 countries.
Because of this phase-out, it becomes all the more critical for the United States to work to lower non-tariff barriers -- regulations, monopoly agreements, sweetheart deals between companies in a country to deter foreign competition, and other techniques that nations use to keep out imports and send business to their own corporations.
No country is more adept at non-tariff barriers than Japan, which practically invented the art form. For instance, in the last few years Japan has eliminated all formal tariff barriers to American glass exporters, but through informal agreements between Japanese companies, Tokyo has managed to limit the American share of the Japanese glass market to less than 1 percent. There are hundreds of such cases.
The hard-liners argue that Washington will never really break into the Japanese market, the world's second largest, unless it takes a stand now and wins some real Japanese concessions in eliminating nontariff barriers to imports in automobiles, insurance and Government purchasing of medical and telecommunications equipment.
Moreover, they point out, China, South Korea, Singapore, Indonesia and the rest of Asia are watching. If these countries see Washington cave in, they will emulate Tokyo's restrictive trade practices more than they already do.
On the other side of this argument are the Treasury Department and some White House economic advisers. They contend that, yes, it is a new world, and it is a world in which financial markets rule.
These officials say that while Japan should lower its trade barriers, imposing sanctions if it does not would bethe economic equivalent of dropping a nuclear bomb to get the generals out of Haiti. The financial markets, they say, would take any American trade sanctions against Tokyo as a sign that the Clinton trade policy had collapsed and that the Administration's only option would be reliance on a weak dollar and a strong yen to address Japan's $60 billion trade surplus.
The dollar, already sagging at 98 yen, will drop through the floor, this view holds, and whatever millions of dollars the United States gains by trade sanctions, it will lose billions from a weaker dollar, higher import costs, inflation and interest-rate rises. This school also thinks that Japan's overregulated, overprotected economy is already suffering from inbreeding. As a result, it is falling behind on many of the technologies of the next century, from software to high-definition television. Their attitude is to let the Japanese choke on their own regulations.
President Clinton seems to be torn between the two camps. Aides say his heart is on the side of getting tough with the Japanese, but his mind is aware of the economic costs.
The Japanese are not making it easier for him to decide. Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto flew to Washington today to take part in the last-minute talks. Before leaving he declared, "I have no intention of making any new proposals or changing Japan's current position."
This tough talk could be just that smokescreen for last-minute concessions. That has been the Japanese style in the past. But then again, as with Gen. Raoul Cedras in Haiti, it may take not just the threat of force but its imminent use to win concessions from Tokyo.

HEADLINE: Carlos Lleras Restrepo, 86; Pressed Latin American Unity

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Carlos Lleras Restrepo, who as President of Colombia led the campaign for economic union in Latin America in the 1960's, died today. He was 86.
The cause of death was a respiratory infection, his family said. 
 Mr. Lleras Restrepo, President from 1966 to 1970, was the driving force behind the Andean Pact, a trade agreement that linked Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile. Chile later pulled out.
"His death is a great loss not only for Colombia but for the hemisphere," said Belisario Betancur, another former Colombian President.
The current President, Ernesto Samper Pisano, speaking in New York before cutting short his visit to the United Nations, said Mr. Lleras Restrepo "leaves an indelible mark with his passage through national history."
Born to a wealthy, patrician Bogota family on April 12, 1908, Mr. Lleras Restrepo had a 60-year career in politics, holding an array of posts, including minister, ambassador and congressman.
He was briefly head of the Liberal Party in 1941, then returned to the post in 1948, replacing the assassinated Jorge Gaitan. The killing was the trigger for what later became known as La Violencia, the 1948-58 decade of violent confrontation between the Liberals and the opposition Conservatives. An estimated 200,000 Colombians died in the political violence.
Mr. Lleras Restrepo was a die-hard Liberal, once forbidding members of his party to say "good morning" to Conservatives. His house was burned in 1952, and he spent two years in exile in Mexico. But in 1966, after the parties made peace and formed the National Front, he was the alliance's standard-bearer, winning easily over a former military dictator, Gen. Gustavo Rojas Pinilla.
His presidency included the imposition of an unpopular austerity program and price controls, as well as the continent's most sweeping and successful land reform program.
The 1970 elections to choose his successor as President were marred by fraud, beginning a new cycle of turbulence in Colombia. General Rojas Pinilla, once again his main opponent, asserted that he had been cheated of victory. Some of General Rojas Pinilla's supporters organized a guerrilla group called the April 19 Movement, known as M-19, which carried out spectaculr attacks on the Government. M-19 disbanded in the 1980's, but other rebel groups are still fighting.
Mr. Lleras Restrepo ran for re-election in 1978, but the Liberal Party didn't support him. Though he never fully retired from politics, he devoted much of his time to journalism, writing for his magazine Nueva Frontera.

HEADLINE: Cuomo on the Record: Excerpts From Views On Campaign Issues

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo met with editors and reporters of The New York Times for 5 hours 15 minutes on Monday to discuss the issues in the gubernatorial race, his record in 12 years in office, and his goals for a fourth term. A transcript of the session ran to almost 44,000 words. Here are excerpts.
 
ECONOMY
 
The Budget
 [In a wide-ranging discussion of the state economy and budget, the Governor was asked how his proposals to cut taxes, still partly unspecified, would affect both local governments and the state's own recurring gap between revenues and expenditures.] 
 Q. I just wanted to make sure that I understood your view about the projections of budget gaps in the years ahead. Are you saying you don't believe them or you're saying --
A. No, we've had them like for, every year you have them -- $2 billion, $3 billion, $1 billion -- and then you adjust. What you do is you spend less. You draw back on commitments. You had Liberty Scholarships three years ago, $70 million. I didn't fund it. Why not? Can't fund it. This is the argument I had with the Legislature all the time. I said be careful about what you're promising people. Explain to everybody that every year we must redo the budget or we'll lose credbility.
When they did the trust fund on transportation, I said don't do the lock box. You know, you say you're going to lock it up. You know we can't guarantee it's going to be locked up. What if you need the money for something else? And that's exactly what happened. We had to dip into the locked box.
 
Cutting Taxes
 Q. What you're saying, if I understand it, Governor, is the public hunger for tax cuts is so strong that you are willing to cut services that you know the public wants to give them a tax cut. Why not instead say, hey, I'd rather give you Liberty Scholarships, I think that's more important, that poor people can get college education. . . .
A. I think that those are all adjustments you have to make as Governor. And I would make you pause, though, over your first assumption . . . which is that this is what the people want. If you gave the people what they wanted, there'd be no taxes. You can't give them enough to satisfy them with tax cuts. That's not why you do it. I guarantee you no matter what tax cuts you do they will not be satisfied.
[Asked about the burden of state and local taxes in New York, the Governor said, "Local taxes are high because the local government made them high." He complained that a Times editorial had sought to blame him for passing costs along to localities, which compensated by raising their own taxes, and denied that he had done so.]
A. It doesn't make any difference, except it's The Times and now it's out there in the atmosphere for everybody to read, that the -- the state is responsible for the local taxes. What you failed to mention is that we picked up $7.3 billion [in long-term Medicaid costs] since 1984 -- we're trying to pick up more -- that our budget has gone from 58 percent for the local government to 70 percent for the local government. That our budget has gone from 26 percent for the state -- superintendent of police and this job, all the other things -- to 18 percent. I have done more -- not I, the Legislature and I have done more to lift the burden off the shoulders of local government than ever before in the modern history of the state. No one's even close, no one even tried, except Hughie [Carey]. In 1975, we took courts off your hands -- remember we had to bail out New York City. That was the last time we did anything significant.
Now, the -- this isn't being mentioned. You fail to note that we reduced our own expenditures over a billion dollars. How? I reduced my public payroll from '90 to '92 14 percent. I laid off 6,000 people, I gave no raises for two years. Until Rudy Giuliani when did that ever happen at the city level? When has it ever happened at the Federal level? When has it ever happened in Nassau or Suffolk or Westchester or Rockland, the people whose taxes you want us to cut? . . .
Q. If you have a billion and a half dollars that you could use, why not use it in some form to relieve local tax burdens?
A. A good possibility that what would develop, what you'd have to do, is you'd have to call in the locals and say: "Look, guys and gals. There are two ways we can do this. I can reduce my taxes or we can figure out a guaranteed way we use this wealth for you to reduce yours. I want to do Medicaid pickup. Medicaid pickup is not contingent upon you reducing your taxes. Let's sit down. Let's talk turkey. Let's talk topics. Come on, bring in the county executives. If we give you this many dollars, what do you do at the local level to reduce your own costs?"
I have no way of ordering that. I have no way, you know, of passing a tax bill. Politically, it would be impossible, but even legally, jurisdictionally, I couldn't pass a tax bill that said to the local governments, "You're going to get benefits from us and Medicaid pickup and you must all cut your payrolls 10 percent." I can't do that. It would have to be negotiated. . . .
The local government makes its judgments. It judges not to reduce public employees. That's fine, that's your local judgment. O.K. It's not a fault. I'm not finding fault with them. I'm saying, if I lay off 6,000 people -- as I did, approximately -- if I give no raises to -- for two years to people who are changing sheets in mental institutions and they're only making $19,000 -- if in effect I cut her salary 7, 8 percent because of the effect of inflation, and then the locals come up, as they did, and say, "You must give us more money or we will raise our local taxes," and they do none of the things that I did, then I'm in a position where I say, "Now, wait just a moment. It doesn't make sense for me to impose these burdens on my people to take the money and give it to you so that you don't have to impose the burdens on your people." And that's what I did. . . .
Q. What is the role of the Governor in trying to influence these high level taxes, high local tax burden for New Yorkers, the Medicaid problem of local governments, and to what extent should the Governor be held accountable for the failure to make changes? . . .
A. Our role is to encourage them every way we could to reduce the cost and even to do some of it for them. For example, managed care. Managed care in New York City now is being done at our prodding and our request, even at our insistence. And we have about 400,000 people in managed care, and the last time I looked that brought down costs to about 9 percent.
Now that's a -- that's a formidable way to help the local governments. In other areas, for example, school expenditures, which are so great in so many places, we have been counseling, instructing, asking for consolidation. They won't consolidate at the local level. Why not? It's politically unpalatable. On Long Island and Nassau, specifically, you have about one-half the students you had in 1972 but you have the same number of school districts. Why? Because it's inconvenient politically to change the number of school districts. As a political matter you can't change those school districts without their permission.
So our role is to point out to them how they can save money. We have been doing that over and over. There is great reluctance -- in some places they -- they respond. Mayor Giuliani has now responded very forcefully with this budget by taking down personnel expenditures or at least controlling them. . . .
Q. From the point of view of the average citizen, whose responsibility is it that some individuals' taxes are higher than they would be out of New York State?
A. The citizens as much as anybody, because if you don't demand the services, or you don't elect these people who make these judgments.
Q. You get the government you pay for?
A. See, it's not as easy . . . The simplistic thing is, low taxes are good. Are they really? What would you do about AIDS if you reduced the taxes much lower in New York City and New York State? That's a concern I have. What do you do about crack? What do you do about addicted children? What do you do about H.I.V. babies? What do you do about Stuyvesant High School, where it cost you $127 million? Was that worth 127 million bucks? I thought so. So you have all these other judgments to make.
If you didn't reduce the taxes, what do you do with those tax dollars? How do you spend them? About 28 -- all the health care -- if you took all education and health care, I'll bet it's 65, 66 percent of our budget.
 
Making Things Work
 Q. So are people just grousing and things really aren't as bad as people think they are?
A. No, they are bad. The perception all over America is -- and I said this to the Ross Perot thing last week . . . What I said was all over America, the people believe that the price of government is too high, and that they're not getting their money's worth from the government. That's true everywhere.
Q. Are they right or are they wrong?
A. I believe that government is a lot less efficient than it should be and, worse than that, could be here in New York State -- and probably everywhere else, but I know my state. This is not an efficient government. I suspected that when I started attacking this government as a lawyer a long time ago, and did that for nearly 20 years. I was absolutely convinced when I came into government in '75 that it was not efficient. And needlessly inefficient. I'm more convinced now than ever, and each year I have said so. . . .
But I think yes, the answer is it is inefficient in a lot of different ways. The legislative process is totally inefficient. There is no excuse for the budget being late every year for 10 years. They do it deliberately to leverage the Governor. . . .
[Mr. Cuomo acknowledged that the state budget process was often painfully deadlocked because of a divided Legislature, and said he had erred over the years by not seeking to co-opt individual Republican State Senators, instead of dealing exclusively with their leaders, who often opposed him. He conceded that voters were looking for a change.]
Q. What's the difference between the change that they get when elected you and the change they get by electing your opponent?
A. Well, you'll have to ask my opponent, and I don't know what change he's offering. What change could he possibly be offering? Senator Marino is going to convert? The 34 members, the Senate Republicans, are going to be different with him? What's going to change? What's he going to do differently? What's he ever done?
 
CRIME
Death Penalty
 Q. Governor, we've been at this issue for so long that it sometimes doesn't get asked, but would you briefly state for us why you're against the death penalty? Briefly.
A. I tried doing on this what I did for abortion because I couldn't answer -- I couldn't answer it briefly, so I wrote a speech for St. Rose of Lima once. And I just hand that out when people ask me.
The whole Western world has given up on the death penalty. Israel voted against it in 1954; they got rid of it except for treason. The experience everywhere has been that the death penalty does not deter. As a matter of fact, there is a considerable amount of evidence that the death penalty encourages killing by being a kind of instruction in brutality and more. . . .
You know who is the most honest, I think, one of the most honest in arguing it is Ed Koch. Ed Koch will tell you: "Forget about deterrence. All I know is it's right -- I feel good, they killed and you should kill them. Period." Call it whatever you want. He's very honest about it. So is my mother. So I don't think it deters. I think it is an instruction in brutality. I think it sends exactly the wrong message. If you make a mistake it is irretrievable, and we have made the mistake 50 times in a half century, eight times in New York. Are you absolutely positive? . . .
And -- and I tried to imagine a situation where you make the mistake and you kill somebody and it's clearly a mistake, and there's plenty of evidence of the possibility of that happening. And now his family comes in and says, "Governor, why did you approve of that execution?" "Well, I had to do it, it was the law." "But why did you have to do it, what good did you do with it?" "Well, the people are all angry, they're all upset, you know, and they felt better because ----." "Well, how do they feel now that they know that they killed an innocent person as the price of their kind of nourishing this feeling they have for vindication?" "Well, I don't know what to tell you, lady and sir, you know, we just -- we felt we had to do it."
What -- what kind of answer is that? What -- how can you explain that? . . .
Q. Now if we go back to the point that you blocked the death penalty in New York for so many years ----.
A. I don't block the death penalty.
Q. By vetoing it.
A. I do not block the death penalty. I voted -- I'm trying like heck to ----.
Q. Well, if you had not vetoed it, it would have been on the books.
A. You could get a two-thirds vote and get it on the books.
Q. O.K., but if you hadn't vetoed it, it would now be on the books. I think that's a given.
A. I blocked it, you're right.
Q. Thank you. Why then -- why then propose again that it go to a referendum and that the people decide ----.
A. I don't -- I didn't propose it go to a referendum. They proposed a constitutional amendment for the death penalty. I said, "If you're going to have a constitutional amendment, it's got to be death penalty or life in prison without parole." I do that every year and every year that ends the argument, and it ended it this year.
Q. But why would you allow it if ----.
A. Because I may die or lose an election. Because if I lose this election you have the death penalty and that is an abomination especially for this state -- the last great voice for civility. Forget about it, we're going to have a New York State electrocution. But unless people are ticked -- everybody knows it does not deter. Everybody knows it's an instruction in brutality. . . .
 
Prison and Prevention
 Q. Governor, one of the major investments, if you want to call it that, of your administration has been in prison cells. If the ----.
A. May I say I really don't think of it as an investment. When I put people -- when I build cells, knowing that these are drug addicts who are not violent, who probably are not going to get the drug treatment they need, and who are costing us -- now it's down to about $28,000 a year, it was above that a year -- in a $150,000 or a $100,000 cell, I don't see that as an investment, I see that as stupid. We shouldn't have to do that. That person should be punished -- probation, drug treatment and $15,000 -- and we should save that cell for a violent person. Just to let you know I don't think of it as an investment, because it's not making them better.
Q. Let's back up and ask the question that way: First of all, characterize for us how you feel about [having] built more cells than any governor in history.
A. I'm unhappy about it. It had to be done because those people have to go to jail, we have no alternative. We are required to put them into jail, so you need cells for them because you know you want cells for violent people. You have to build more cells. We have no choice. I'm now at 129 percent of capacity. We have people [in] double bunks, which is not good. I'm not thinking about the inmate, I'm thinking about the corrections officers. . . .
[Mr. Cuomo was asked about the level of spending on prisons compared to programs to prevent crime.]
A. We're spending much too much on prisons. That's what I tried to say before. Because we have this group of prisoners who ought not to have to go to prison. And I spend the money because I have to. I have all sorts of diversion programs that my opponent is blaming me for. We have [Drug Treatment Alternatives to Prison] programs and we have deferred sentencing programs because we don't see prison as a salvation. We do believe that violent people have to be locked up because a disproportionate number of the violent crimes are committed by a very small percentage of the violent people. You have to lock them up, just to protect the rest of the population. But we are locking up an awful lot of nonviolent people and we would like to change that, and I try every year. And it would be more intelligent to spend that money on programs of prevention. . . .
Q. What proportion of the population in New York State prisons today do you believe would be better handled elsewhere?
AIDE One-fifth?
Q. I'm sorry, you ----.
CUOMO Oh, no, it's 20,000, not one-fifth. It's closer to a third.
Q. One-third of the current population shouldn't be there?
A. Well, they're nonviolent, therefore they should be somewhere getting drug treatment. Maybe not all of them. I would leave it up to the judges, incidentally. I'm not saying that you should have a law that does this. I'm saying you should let the judges, who have this case before them, make the determination. Second-felony offenders, now they don't get a choice. . . .
 Q. How could the fear of life in prison deter someone from committing a crime that the fear of death wouldn't?
A. Because living the rest of your life in a 6 1/2-by-8[-foot] cell, for an hour or two a day outside, with no intercourse of any kind with human beings that's meaningful, with no role in life, with no future, with no dignity, is regarded as a fate worse than death.
 
EDUCATION
School Financing
 [The Governor was asked why so many New York City schools are failing and whether the city was receiving a fair share of education aid.]
CUOMO The funding is unfair and has to be corrected. We did extremely well this year, relatively. We got it up to 34 1/2 percent. We have 37 percent of the children, we should -- they call us average wealth, so we should have probably gotten about 37 percent of the money.
Q. We, New York City?
A. Yeah, New York City. The truth is New York City, you probably should have gotten more because the problems are greater than they are anywhere else because of the sociological difficulty. Whose fault is it --
Q. Is money ----.
A. No, no, money is not the solution. But it could be useful paying teachers, having more teachers, better schools, better schools, better schools, the buildings you need. . . . And we made progress, made a lot of progress, but it's not enough.
Who's responsible for that? Well, I'm running again because I don't think I've gotten enough good things done. This is one of the good things I haven't gotten done. But I think the answer on the school formula is going to be, eventually, a lawsuit which declares it unconstitutional. We tried that 11 years ago or so and were disappointed by the Court of Appeals judgment. I think it may be different this time and there are lawsuits working their way up. . . .
 
Public Universities
 Q. I wonder if you think that the public university system in this state has diminished and how you think it compares with that of other states.
A. I think it's strengthened. I think it's a great system, and compared to other schools in the country and in the region, you know, the tuition is reasonable, to put it mildly. I'll get some numbers here in a minute.
I stopped tuition increases for seven years and then stopped it again when the Legislature almost unanimously adopted a tuition increase of $45 million -- I vetoed it. And I said, you give me seven days and I'll find the $45 million in the administrative budgets of the two systems -- CUNY and SUNY. In six days we found the money and there was no tuition increase.
Q. But it has doubled in five years.
A. Still very reasonable. What you left out is for eight years you didn't have an increase. . . .
Q. Governor, is it too reasonable?
A. Look, it should be zero.
Q.Should it be zero?
A. Of course it should be zero.
Q. What proportion of the costs should be borne by students and should it be based on the ability to pay?
A. My view? The Republican-Conservative view was that you should apply a means test which would mean that the tuition could go to something like $17,000. I think that would be devastating. . . .
I believe in a society that regards education as so valuable that it is made available to all of the people at the least possible expense to those people so that you can synthesize the society. I believe that this is a community obligation that when people go to schools it's more than just a benefit for them and a privilege for them; it is good for the entire community that they should go to school. The whole community is uplifted by a high degree of expertise and knowledgeability. And therefore, the way you pay for public schools . . .
Why should a rich person be able to go to District 26 free? I'm rich. Why should my child go free? It's exactly the same logic. And if you want to do it at the college level, why not the high school level, where we never did it that way?
 
 
SOCIAL PROGRAMS
Welfare
 Q. Can you actually take people who don't have experience in work and get them off the welfare rolls?
A. . . . In my State of the State, and in my inaugural, I think, I said, "Work is better than welfare." That was one of my emphases from the very beginning. We since then have probably been the most progressive state in the United States of America in terms of making changes in the welfare system. . . .
And that is a program that starts with a requirement that you produce the father of a child and a support award, to establish his responsibility and to get his revenues, and then allows you to work, the mother usually -- theoretically it could be a father -- allows the mother to work without the disincentives of the current system. She doesn't lose her health care, she doesn't lose her money. . . .
The question really should be, does everybody have the programs we have, and the answer is no. Does everybody have the innovativeness we have? The answer is no. Does anybody have programs out there we don't have -- now, you'll have to tell me that. Because I haven't heard from you that others have programs we don't have and we ought to be looking at. . . .
Q. And why then do we have so many people on welfare?
A. Because there are no jobs. In 1987 I had the lowest level in 17 years because there were a lot of jobs. I wasn't a genius: 1987, lowest level of people unemployed on welfare in 17 years. If I had had a little more shamelessness I would have gone out and said, "See what I did for you? I put all these people to work." I did nothing. The economy took care of it. When you have jobs they wish to work. And they will work.
Now the real problem are the babies having babies. It's the children having children. And then working on to welfare before they know how to parent, before they know how to show up for work, before they've ever been given the requirement of performing a task predictably well for a long period of time, before they're educated. That is the problem.
When you find the older welfare mothers with one or two kids, the ones who have had a little work experience, they will kiss your hand for a job. America Works works because they go to those women -- they're terrific. They're all dying to work. They don't make money on welfare. You can't live well on welfare if you're limited just to the welfare money. They all want to work, and when there are real jobs, the ones who are quick to work will be the first ones off welfare. . . .
 
Limit on Benefits
 [The Governor was asked about the idea of limiting welfare benefits to two years, as President Clinton has proposed.]
A. You have to explain to me first what they do. I mean, if you are saying that the objective should be to get the welfare client into work, then of course, that's where we began. If you're saying that you should push very hard for them to take advantage of education opportunities and to train themselves for work, well, of course, we agree. That was the new social contract. If you say that after two years they can be expected to find work, I don't know what you mean by that. What if they don't, because you have a recession and there is no work. Now that is the crucial question.
If you're saying that if there is no private-sector job for them you will create a public-sector job -- well, then you'd better show me where you're going to get the money to create this whole bureaucracy. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but if you're going to create public-sector jobs for them, how are you going to do that? And how are you going to deal with public employees who have been laid off in a state like New York. So it remains to be seen what you do with the person who does not have a job. If you're saying, "Create a public-sector job," I'm not sure that that is going to work economically. If you say, "You just drop them from the rolls and let them starve," that's not going to happen. . . .
 
Mental Health
 [The Governor was asked if the state had spent enough on housing and other services for the homeless mentally ill.]
A. Hold it, hold it. Of course not. Of course you're not spending enough, are you kidding? What are you spending enough on? Are you spending enough to solve your education problem? No. Are you spending enough to solve your primary health care problem? No. Are we spending more than anybody in the United States of America? By far. Are you spending so much that they call you a neo-socialist state? Yes.
Q. But, Governor ----.
A. Are you spending more than the Republican-Conservatives want you to? Yes. Are you spending more than you will if they win? Absolutely.
The answer is the same to all of these questions. Underspending? Of course you're under --.
We have the richest mental-health budget in the United States of America by far. It's grown at, what -- 237 percent increase.
Q. In what period of time?
A. Since I became Governor, a 237 percent increase. . . .
Q. Governor, I'm probably asking the same question but in a less technical form. Do you feel that during the 12 years of your administration the state has done what needed to be done to deal with the homeless mentally ill or the mentally ill population that turned out to be the people on the streets of the city that so frighten New Yorkers?
A. No, of course not. But we've done more than anybody in America, by far. We've been extremely generous by every measure, but it's not enough. What Andrew [Cuomo] is saying in his report is what I said about Forest Hills in 1970. What Andrew says is with the homeless people it shouldn't be a question of shelter, it should be a question of addressing their individual problems. There is one percentage of them who have no problems other than homelessness, and for them you should find housing. But there are more who are either substance abusers, mentally ill, both, alcoholic, and you have to deal with those problems.
And you have to deal with them not in a shelter context, because that does not deal with them. Or even a housing context, because that does not deal with them. They need care -- for mental illness, for substance abuse, for alcoholism. And you have to get them into that care. And you need case management, you need a lot of other things. And that's what we have begun to do, what we're working with the city to get that done.
 
GOVERNANCE
Term Limits
 [Mr. Cuomo's opponent, State Senator George E. Pataki -- whose name the Governor never mentioned in more than five hours -- has broadcast commercials accusing Mr. Cuomo of opposing term limits for public officials and a ballot initiative allowing voters to enact government proposals directly. The Governor was asked his view.]
CUOMO When my opponent says he wants initiative and referendum and he wants term limitations and the Governor does not, that's very effective on television, I know. But it is clearly a distortion. It is saying to the people, "The Governor is stopping you from having initiative and referendum and term limitations."
The Governor is not stopping. The Governor is saying over and over, "Call a constitutional convention,' which the Legislature could do. It could put it on the ballot for -- it could have put it on for this year. If they won't, vote for a constitutional convention in 1997 and then you can consider all these things -- even things I don't like, like casino gambling. I'm against it. But I am very much for your considering it. . . .
Term limitations, I have not concluded. My previous conclusion was I think it is not intellectually sound. But if you can't find another way to end this permanent government you have here, maybe you have to do term limitations. And I've said that to the legislators over and over. The alternative would be financing, campaign financing, more ballot access. I prefer that. I prefer campaign financing and more ballot access. . . . I'll take that over term limitations.

HEADLINE: From Governor Whitman, A New Quest for Tourists

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
A decade ago, a popular New Jersey Governor sought to bolster the state's image, along with his own, in an advertising campaign that featured the slogan, "New Jersey and You, Perfect Together." Gov. Thomas H. Kean appeared in a frequently aired television commercial, walking barefoot along the beach while extolling the state's virtues.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who would also like to lure more tourists and businesses to New Jersey, said today that her administration had reinvented Mr. Kean's idea. For six months, state officials have been researching and field-testing a new slogan, and today they made public the results: "New Jersey, What a Difference a State Makes." 
 The slogan, or more correctly, the "advertising theme line," is the first attempt to promote a positive image of the state under a broad unifying banner since the Kean administration's campaign a decade ago. Mrs. Whitman will be seen in a number of ads, including one showing her on a fishing boat.
George Nagle, director of economic research for the state's Commerce and Economic Development Department, said the advertising and marketing campaign, beginning next month in newspapers and magazines and on radio and cable television, had to answer two questions: why New Jersey and why not someplace else?
The theme that the state is banking on was culled from an original list of 59, which was reduced to 12 after testing reactions inside the state and out, and then to 4 before the final selection was made.
Officials said that when New Jersey residents were shown parts of the new campaign during testing, 7 percent reported that they were more likely to vacation within the state. Of the out-of-state residents who participated in the research, 18 percent said the ads increased their interest in coming to New Jersey.

Treasury Issues Retreat As Rates Don't Change

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury long-term securities fell yesterday after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged.
The 30-year bond fell 18/32 , to a price of 962/32 , for a yield of 7.84 percent, up from 7.79 percent on Monday and the highest since June 23, 1992. The rates on shorter-term Treasury bills fell, however, as investors sold long-term notes and bonds into less volatile three-month and six-month bills. 
 The market moved after the Fed announced in the afternoon that its Federal Open Market Committee has decided not to raise its target for short-term interest rates, which is now 4.75 percent. An increase would have been the sixth of this year as the Fed sought to fight future inflation by slowing economic growth.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities, said because the Fed did not tighten yesterday doesn't mean that it will not happen. "I suspect they'll hike rates a few more times," he said. "The last time the Fed raised rates was on Aug. 16, and they said then it would suffice for a time."
"People were keyed up for the Fed to tighten at the meeting simply because capacity utilization at 84.7 percent, close to the historic inflation threshold, and thought the Fed would get nervous about that," Mr. Fine said.
"Given global competition, my instincts tell me that the inflation threshold today is higher than in the past." Equally as important, he added, is that the factory sector today is not as great a percentage of the economy as it was in the past. As a result, Mr. Fine said, "You can't look at capacity utilization by itself as a guide to inflation."
One sign of concern about inflation may have been the surge in the price of gold to over $400 an ounce just after the announcement by the Fed that it would not raise interest rates. The concern by some that the Fed was not being tough enough in its fight against inflation may have also pushed long-term yields higher yesterday, traders said. Longer maturities, which are viewed by some as a gauge of investor concerns regarding inflation, also came under pressure yesterday from the supply side, as the Treasury gets ready to sell $11 billion of five-year notes today. In addition, dealers and traders braced for more economic reports, like the August durable goods report due today, followed later this week by the second-quarter gross domestic product, new home sales, corporate profits, personal income and the Chicago purchasing management report.
Joseph V. Battipaglia, managing director of Sterling Advisors, saw the weakness in bond prices as a message to the Fed. "The prospect of waiting another four weeks for additional economic data or more intepretations of the data has thrown the market into confusion," he said. "Had the Fed come out with a defintive statement as to what they were doing and why, it would have been enough to generate a sharp bond rally," he said. "The bond market doesn't like to be left in the dark and with the end of the quarter approaching, your certainly not going to see many buyers."
In the market's wait for some indication by the Fed of its intentions on interest rates, dealers had a difficult time setting up before yesterday's auction of new two-year notes.
As it turned out, those who bought before the Fed made its announcement managed to make some money, said Matthew F. Alexy, a government trading strategist for CS First Boston. "In general terms the auction was average and probably ok given some much uncertainty in the market," he said.
At auction the high yield for a two-year issue was 6.55 percent, up from 6.27 percent last month and the highest since 6.94 percent in July 1991.
During the early part of trading, the budget director, Alice Rivlin, was quoted on the news services as saying that the Fed had not tightened too much yet, and also saying that she sees no imminent threat of inflation. She described the Fed's decision on whether or not to tighten furthers a tough call.
Yesterday the Conference Board's consumer confidence index edged down to 88.4 in September from 90.4, slightly lower than expected. The market got a brief pop on some quick short-covering before settling lower. A poll by Reuters showed economists had expected a 90.2 September reading.
The following are the results of yesterday's two-year note auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Yield . . . 6.55%
Low Yield . . . 6.45%
Median Yield . . . 6.50%

Saudi Prince Is Buying Big Hotel Stake

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Four Seasons Hotels, a Canadian-owned chain as praised for its luxury and service as its accounting practices have been criticized, said yesterday that a Saudi Arabian Prince had offered to acquire 25 percent of the company for $122.1 million.
The investor, Prince Walid bin Talal, has gained increasing prominence since 1991 as he took major stakes in Citicorp, Saks Fifth Avenue and Euro Disney. 
 Yesterday, he also agreed to buy one-quarter of the personal holdings of Isadore Sharp, Four Seasons' chairman and founder, for $22 (Canadian) a share -- $16.28 (United States). Mr. Sharp controls 20 percent of the company's stock but owns 80 percent of voting stock. The company had said in April that it was seeking a buyer.
Prince Walid, a billionaire born in 1954, who lives in a 130-room palace in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, will provide $79 million (United States) to finance the company's expansion.
In becoming a major investor in North America and Europe, the Prince has bought into businesses with lackluster performance but good growth potential. His investment in Four Seasons comes as luxury hotels are leading the industry's recovery from recession.
The Prince, a nephew of King Fahd, became Citicorp's biggest shareholder in 1991, buying $590 million of the banking company's convertible preferred stock. Early last year he acquired roughly 10 percent of Saks Fifth Avenue for about $100 million. Three months ago he agreed to acquire 24 percent of the financially troubled Euro Disney theme park near Paris for about $400 million, and in July, he bought 50 percent of the Fairmont hotel chain for an undisclosed amount.
In Four Seasons, he will invest in a 44-property chain in 19 countries, including a hotel on East 57th Street in Manhattan and another in London.
Yet like many chains, Four Seasons has increasingly avoided ownership in favor of joint ventures, limited partnerships and minority investments, preferring the far less risky business of managing the properties for a fee. It said yesterday that it would also receive a contract to manage a hotel Prince Walid is developing in Riyadh.
The Four Seasons chain is known for attentive service, and in the July issue of Consumer Reports was ranked a close second in customer satisfaction to the Ritz-Carlton hotels in the luxury category.
By using Canadian accounting rules, it issued quarterly profit-and-loss statements that did not show the financial weakness of many of its holdings. It also converted large ownership positions in six hotels into small passive stakes, using an accounting loophole.
Howard M. Schilit, an accounting professor at American University, who wrote a report on the company last December, said Four Seasons was economically weak. "The financial statements are misleading," he wrote, "even if they're not in technical violation of the rules."
In April, Four Seasons hired Goldman, Sachs to help it find a buyer, Mr. Sharp said he would insist that the buyer postpone closing the deal for three to five years to allow for a smooth transition. Yesterday, he told Bloomberg Business News that the transactions "create a long-term relationship which will help insure access to significant capital and accelerate our growth plans globally."
Irene Nattel, hotel analyst for BZW Canada, a Montreal brokerage firm, said the transaction indeed fulfilled Mr. Sharp's objectives and left room for growth.
"For shareholders, the investment will facilitate Four Seasons' continuing growth as the premier manager of luxury hotels globally," she said. "As the Middle East develops, any relationship with the Prince is bound to be valuable."

Gold Tops $400 an Ounce As Inflationary Fears Rise

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Busines News 

 BODY:
Gold prices settled above $400 an ounce yesterday for the first time in more than a year as concerns over inflation heightened when the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged.
Traders fear consumer prices could go up, and the value of assets like stocks and bonds could erode. 
 "It's quite obvious that inflation is accelerating," Leonard Kaplan, vice president of the Imperial Bank in Los Angeles, said. "The economy is too ebullient."
Yet any decision by the Fed at its meeting on monetary policy yesterday would have been interpreted positively by gold traders, George Milling-Stanley, an analyst with Lehman Brothers in New York, said. "The fact that we were close to a big number attracted us toward it," he added.
Gold for December delivery jumped $3.60, to $401.40 an ounce, the highest the active contract has been since Aug. 2, 1993. December silver rose 8.8 cents, to $5.76 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. October platinum rose $1.10, to $419.40 an ounce, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price rises come as jewelers, who account for about 70 percent of the world's demand for gold bullion, are increasing their gold buying ahead of the holiday season. Analysts estimate that jewelers buy about half their gold for the year in the months before Christmas.
On other markets, coffee and crude oil fell, pushing the Commodity Research Bureau index down 0.59 point, to 231.65.
Traders said that a drought in Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, that threatened the coffee crop could be easing. Light rain fell on the crop over the weekend.
December coffee fell 6.65 cents, to $2.1995 a pound, on the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange in New York.
Crude oil fell for a second day, while gasoline prices fell to a six-month low, amid concern over abundant supplies of refined products.
United States' inventories of gasoline are more than 3 percent above a year earlier, while stockpiles of distillate fuels including heating oil and diesel fuel are more than 10 percent higher, according to the American Petroleum Institute.
After the close of trading, the Institute said crude oil stocks surged by 6.6 million barrels, or 2 percent, to 328 million barrels. Gasoline stocks fell by 1.5 million barrels, less than 1 percent, to 209.5 million barrels.
Crude oil for November delivery fell 12 cents, to $17.55 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while October gasoline slumped 0.69 cent, to 43.58 cents a gallon, the lowest price since March 28. October heating oil slipped 0.12 cent, to 47.66 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar, Following Bonds, Falls on Fed Rate Inaction

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most leading currencies yesterday after a decline in American bond prices.
Bond prices fell after the Fed's policy-making committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, ended its meeting yesterday without announcing any change in short-term interest rates. Currency traders often watch the performance of the bond market to gauge foreign investors' appetite for American assets, and the dollars needed to buy them. 
 Both bonds and the dollar steadied later in the day because many investors suspected that Fed policy makers had given Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, authority to raise rates at his discretion before the next policy meeting on Nov. 15, said David Durst, a currency-options trader at Bear, Stearns & Company.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5417 marks, from 1.5527 marks on Monday. The dollar also fell to 1.2771 Swiss francs, from 1.2870 francs on Monday.
The dollar fell against the yen yesterday on speculation that United States and Japanese trade negotiators were having trouble meeting a Friday deadline for progress in talks.
In New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 98.07 yen, from 98.75 yen on Monday.
The Clinton Administration has threatened to impose sanctions against Japanese goods if Tokyo does not agree to buy more American goods for Government use.
In addition to sanctions, many traders expect the Administration to resume calls for a strong yen, or at least let the dollar slide, if the deadline passes without an agreement. The dollar fell as much as 20 percent against the yen last year after Mr. Clinton and his aides said a strong yen could help balance trade by making Japan's exports more expensive.
In other currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 5.2625 French francs, down from 5.3060 francs on Monday and at 1,555.50 Italian lire, down from 1,563.50 lire on Monday.

HEADLINE: Breast Cancer Twice as Deadly in Blacks

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Black women are more than twice as likely as whites to die of breast cancer, in large part because their disease more often reaches an advanced stage before it is diagnosed, researchers have reported.
They said their new study also provided some evidence that cancerous tumors might be more aggressive in black women, but the researchers said the most important conclusion to be drawn was that early screening for breast cancer was essential. 
 "We're doing O.K. treating" black women, said Dr. J. William Eley of Emory University, the chief author of the study. "So we have to concentrate on access to mammography and physical breast exams and educating women to understand the risk of breast cancer."
Part of the problem, the researchers said, is that because of poverty or other factors, black women are less likely than white women to get to a doctor for early detection of cancer.
The study, being published on Wednesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, involved more than 1,100 women who received a diagnosis of breast cancer in 1985 and 1986. Participants were roughly split between blacks and whites in Atlanta, New Orleans and Oakland, Calif.,
Researchers looked at women's social and economic backgrounds, illnesses, the stage when the cancer was discovered, treatment and other factors. They tracked deaths through 1990 and found that black women were 2.2 times as likely to die as white women.
Forty percent of the higher death rate was attributed to the cancer's being more advanced when it was detected.
"The importance of this study is to nail down that the single most important factor to be addressed is how advanced the disease is when black women are diagnosed," Dr. Eley said.
Fifteen percent of the difference in death rates was attributed to tumors' being more aggressive in black women. "That's not to say the difference is due to genetics," Dr. Eley said. He said differences in diet and environment might account for more aggressive tumors.
Many experts recommend that women do monthly breast self-examinations, get annual physical examinations and have a mammogram every year after the age of 50.
Dr. Funmi Olopade, who specializes in breast cancer treatment at the University of Chicago Medical Center, said the study should send important messages to black women and to doctors.
"Black women should see themselves as being at risk for breast cancer, and they should do all that's in their power to reduce their chances of being killed by breast cancer," Dr. Olopade said.
And when a black woman seeks treatment for an illness or emergency, she said, "that's the opportunity for a physician to see them and order that mammogram instead of checking their blood pressure and sending them on their way."

HEADLINE: A Boom for New York Restaurants? Maybe

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER 

 BODY:
JUST 10 days old, the refurbished Monkey Bar in the Hotel Elysee on East 54th Street in Manhattan resembles halftime at a football stadium's concession stand. On a recent evening, its cocktail lounge teemed with after-work revelers. In its stylized 1950's dining room Sylvester Stallone and his entourage held court in a corner banquette, food groupies were exchanging opinions about the penne with shredded lamb shank, and the irrepressibly hip dropped by to case the scene -- but not to eat.
Down at C. T., the acclaimed new restaurant of Claude Troisgros on East 22d Street, the dining room was packed with customers ordering the likes of $24 crispy snapper with confit of eggplant and $26 beef tenderloin in red-wine sauce with yuca biscuits. Earlier in the day at Cafe Centro, the gleaming new 230-seat brasserie in the Met Life (ne Pan Am) Building, lunch customers were 12 deep at the reception desk. And at Gramercy Tavern, reservations for a weekend night -- if you are lucky enough to get through on the telephone -- must be made three to four weeks in advance. 
 Have New York restaurants bounced back? The answer, it seems, is maybe. There are certainly signs that the city's slump is over. Openings, particularly of high-end, high-profile restaurants, are at their highest point in six or seven years, according to many owners and suppliers. What's more, restaurant revenues in New York are up 8 to 10 percent, said Fred Sampson, the president of the New York Restaurant Association. In 1993 revenues grew less than 5 percent; in 1992 they were flat.
The scenario around the country is, in general, upbeat this fall. Restaurateurs in Boston, Chicago, Seattle and Dallas report relatively strong sales. Two exceptions are Miami, which has suffered a serious drop in tourism after a series of tourist shootings, and the Los Angeles area, which has endured three urban nightmares -- earthquakes, fires and riots -- in the last few years.
The surge in New York City tourism is clearly helping. Over the summer, hotels experienced the highest occupancy rates in a decade -- 80 to 85 percent -- said Jeanine Moss, a spokeswoman for the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau. "Finding a hotel room right now is very difficult, and getting a restaurant reservation can be the same, which is good, I guess," Ms. Moss added.
But while tourism has played a big part, Mr. Sampson said, New Yorkers also appear to be dining out more frequently. Yet, beneath all this cheer runs an undercurrent of wariness among restaurateurs who in the last six years have been beaten more than souffle batter. On their menu of woes have been a feeble national and local economy, rising food and labor costs and escalating rents. On top of that, the tax deduction for business meals has dropped to 50 percent, from 80 percent.
The opening of stylish new restaurants may not always be a valid barometer of industry health. Some restaurateurs say this surge reflects prosperity on Wall Street and the abundance of investors willing to back a business they consider glamorous. "All that means is that there are more 48-year-old divorced Wall Streeters who want to meet girls," said Brian McNally, a restaurant entrepreneur in the mid-1980's who now runs 44, the dining room in the Royalton Hotel.
Indeed, while more restaurants are opening, more are closing, too. Closings are up nearly 30 percent from 1993, said Lawrence Sarf, the president of Market Services Inc. a company in Great Neck, L.I., that monitors the food industry. But this is not unusual in a fast-growing market, he said, because when a large number of inexperienced investors enter a field, some are doomed to fail.
"The odds against success are still tremendous," Mr. Sarf said. "If you are in a good neighborhood, the rent can be $40 to $60 a square foot. Ridiculous!"
Still, there are signs of improvement, particularly for some of Manhattan's older restaurants, many of which have suffered significantly in recent years.
Le Chantilly, the 16-year-old French restaurant on East 57th Street, is having one of its best years ever, and patronage is up about 30 percent since 1992, said Camille Dulac, the owner.
"Dinner is very strong," Mr. Dulac added. "Lunch is coming back but not as strong as it used to be." .
At Oceana, a three-year-old luxury seafood restaurant on East 54th Street, business is up 25 to 30 percent over 1992, said Paul McLaughlin, an owner, and revenues are about 15 percent better than at this time last year.
"Everything is more upbeat," he added.
Companies that supply restaurants are noticing the change. Christopher Pappas, the president of Dairyland USA in the Bronx, a food distributor to restaurants in the New York City area, said business was much better this year. Much of the growth, he said, is in sales to inexpensive, mostly Italian restaurants where dinner checks total $15 to $20.
The majority of the new restaurants, while sporting flashy designs, are essentially modest in size and moderately priced. Even their names are economical: L'Udo, Arte, Lora, Alva, Aja, Zut.
The owners, too, "are a little bit shrewder than we were in the 80's," said Mr. McNally, the restaurateur. "They're not looking for a four-star restaurant, but they might have plans for spinoffs, like a Morton's or a Planet Hollywood."
As for food, Italian menus or those that offer some hybrid that includes pasta or risotto are still hot, as is anything related to the Mediterranean.
Arte, the former Acrobaleno on East Ninth Street, is typical of that trend: dishes on its menu are from France, Spain and Turkey.
The most significant growth on the dining scene appears to be at dinner rather than lunch.
"Lunch is still off because of the tax situation," said Alan Stillman, whose New York Restaurant Group operates four Manhattan establishments: Smith & Wollensky, Cite, the Manhattan Ocean Club and Park Avenue Cafe.
But Alex von Bidder, a partner in the Four Seasons, said he was "guardedly optimistic" about the return of business lunchers.
"There seems to be a lot of pent-up energy and a desire to get back" to the business lunch, he said.
What's hard to gauge is the meaning of the interest in the new restaurants, a boom that has not been seen since before the stock-market collapse in 1987.
"Over all, there is a keener interest in going out, but a lot of that could be voyeurism by people who want to try all the new places that are opening," said Drew Nieporent, whose stylish new Japanese restaurant, Nobu, in TriBeCa is turning away more than 100 people a day.
Perhaps the prevailing wariness of most restaurateurs was best expressed by Mr. Sampson of the restaurant association when he said, "Call me on the 15th of February."

Washington Legislators Ready to Take the Field Again

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The nation's capital, which hasn't had a baseball team since 1971, has become the only place for baseball in the absence of games and labor negotiations.
For the second successive Thursday, a Congressional subcommittee will hold a hearing aimed at ending the season-shattering strike and insuring a whole 1995 season. Tomorrow's session deals with a House of Representatives bill that would impose binding arbitration on the dispute between the owners and the players if they have no agreement by Feb. 1. 
 Pat Williams, Democrat of Montana, introduced the bill in the House last Friday. He will hold tomorrow's hearing as chairman of the labor-management relations subcommittee of the House Committee on Education and Labor.
Among those scheduled to appear are Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief labor executive; Charles O'Connor, general counsel of the clubs' labor relations committee; Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel; Bernie Williams of the Yankees, and Orel Hershiser of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The bill would create a three-member arbitration panel that would conduct hearings into the reasons for the dispute and baseball's economics. The panel would have the power to subpoena books and records from the clubs and witnesses to testify. It would be made up of one person designated by each side and a third selected by both sides. The bill would require the panel to render a decision by March 15 to insure that next season would start on time.
Because Congress is scheduled to adjourn no later than Oct. 15 and probably by Oct. 7, the bill is not very likely to go anywhere this session. But if the players remain on strike when Congress returns in January and Representative Williams has developed any support for the idea, it's not inconceivable that the bill could move forward.
It would probably have a better chance than the House bill that would strip baseball of its antitrust exemption if the clubs impose their salary cap. That bill was the subject of a hearing last Thursday.
Bud Selig yesterday reiterated the clubs' opposition to binding arbitration.
"I can't see where the arbitration process would play a role," Selig, the acting commissioner, said by telephone from Milwaukee. "We'll be there and express that opinion. In the end, to strike any reasonable deal, it has to be done at the table. Collective bargaining is the only way you can do that."
Asked if binding arbitration might be the only honorable way out for two sides that have been unable or unwilling to compromise, Selig said: "I don't now. I still can't conceive of any long-term peace that is meaningful and at least gives both parties a chance to have participated in the process other than through the collective bargaining process. You could have something imposed that both parties are terribly unhappy about. That doesn't produce a result that's any good."
The players association has not endorsed the idea of binding arbitration. Donald Fehr, the union's executive director, was in Los Angeles for a meeting with players and was not available for comment on Williams's bill.
The two sides have not met at the bargaining table for nearly three weeks. Fehr and Ravitch met last Friday in a one-on-one session, but nothing emerged from it. No negotiating sessions have been set.
Fehr has been conducting a series of seven regional meetings with players. He has two left, in Phoenix today and in Dallas tomorrow. Selig had said earlier that he was considering having an owners' meeting in the first or second week of October, but yesterday he said that if there is a meeting, it won't be held before mid-October.
"There's been no great clamor for one," Selig said.

HEADLINE: Price of Higher Education Becomes Even Dearer

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
The average tuition at the United States' four-year colleges rose 6 percent this year -- the smallest increase since 1989, but still twice the rate of inflation, according to an annual survey by the College Board, an association of 2,800 institutions of higher education.
Separate Government statistics also show that the proportion of money used by colleges for instruction, libraries and maintenance is shrinking, and that the amount spent on public relations, marketing and fund-raising is increasing.
Average tuition is $11,709 at four-year private colleges and $2,686 at four-year public colleges and universities, both 6 percent increases over last year. The cost of two-year private institutions rose 5 percent, to $6,511, and two-year public colleges, 4 percent, to $1,298. 
 When room, board, books, supplies and transportation are added in, the average total cost of a college education comes to $18,784 for resident students at four-year private institutions and $8,990 at public ones.
"We're paying more and getting less than we got 10 years ago," said Stephanie Arelonio, president of the United States Student Association.
Much of the tuition increase was caused by health-care benefits for faculty members and staff, said David Warren, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.

HEADLINE: The G.O.P's Deceptive Contract

 BODY:
Over 300 Republican candidates for the House of Representatives promised yesterday that, if elected, they will provide a positive new vision for their party and for the country. The body and soul of this vision is to be found in 10 bills they plan to offer in the next session of Congress.
It is a vision that looks backward, Reaganism in a rear-view mirror. What this self-styled "Contract With America" says to voters is that these Republicans do not speak candidly. 
 Tote up the promises. Led by the minority whip, Newt Gingrich, this group of Republicans would balance the budget while adding to defense spending and cutting taxes on capital gains and Social Security benefits for wealthier recipients. They would also ease the tax burden on non-poor families with children, corporate investment, retirement savings and the estates of wealthy families.
The Republicans, historically a deficit-conscious bunch until Ronald Reagan came along, estimate that their largesse would cost the Treasury about $150 billion over five years. The White House estimates the cost to be about $800 billion. Even the White House estimate may be low.
The Congressional Budget Office says that it would take more than $700 billion in budget cuts over five years to balance the existing budget -- before the Republicans start hiking defense spending and cutting taxes. The Republicans would keep costs in line by finding fat in Federal programs, though the contract does not say where. In the past John Kasich of Ohio has drawn up bold proposals, but even if Congress adopted every one -- a politically preposterous prospect -- the Republicans would be hundreds of billions shy of their promises.
The contract is not only reckless but deceptive. The tax cuts on capital gains income, corporate investment and retirement savings are structured to cost little money during the five-year period for which the Republicans do their accounting. But the proposals are certain to pry open gigantic holes in the budget beyond five years.
Nor does the contract reflect a sense of fair play. The cut in the capital gains tax would largely benefit high-income families and, because it would also apply to profits on old investments, is not targeted to stimulate new investment. The tax credit for children would yield nothing to families too poor to owe taxes. The Social Security tax cuts apply only to high-income families. Tax breaks for investment and savings, even if they favor the rich, can be defended. But they would have to be carefully designed to boost productivity and be part of an overall package that spreads tax burdens fairly. By this standard, Mr. Gingrich's compact flunks.
The other bills that make up this vision deal with issues ranging from welfare to crime to long-term health care. Some are good, some bad, but most are presented honestly. That is not true of the economic nostrums. The Republicans ought to admit that their programs would require cutting hundreds of billions out of about $1.5 trillion in Federal spending -- thus slicing 20 percent or more out of every program from Social Security to the F.B.I. Mr. Gingrich promised a positive vision. What voters got instead was duplicitous propaganda.

HEADLINE: Pataki, a la Whitman, Proposes Broad Cuts in State Income Tax

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

 BODY:
Following the lead of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman in New Jersey, State Senator George E. Pataki, the Republican candidate for governor, yesterday proposed deep and broad-based cuts in personal income taxes that would reduce the tax bill of virtually every New Yorker.
Coming a week after he was bitingly criticized by other Republicans for not detailing an economic plan, Mr. Pataki said he would cut the top income tax rate by 25 percent over four years and reduce the number of people paying that rate. By 1998, the plan would reduce state revenues by $5.6 billion, making it one of the largest tax cuts in state history. 
 "Taken together, these measures will go a long way toward making New York once again the place the most enterprising people flock to, not the one the flee from," Mr. Pataki said in a speech in Manhattan to trustees of the Citizens Budget Commission, a fiscal watchdog group financed by businesses.
Mr. Pataki offered only a general outline of how he would pay for the tax cuts. He said he believed the state work force could be cut by one-third and state agencies could be consolidated without reducing services. But that would raise only $300 million of the $5.6 billion. He also included one-time revenue sources like selling the governor's 28-year-old airplane and two helicopters.
The bulk of the tax cut would be paid for by holding the growth of state spending, most of which provides aid to local governments and schools, to the rate of inflation, 3 percent this year. At the same time, Mr. Pataki is counting on a vibrantly growing economy to increase state revenues by 6 percent a year, even with the tax cuts.
Economists said that even a slight economic downturn could undermine the plan, driving down tax revenues and forcing the state to cut services, which could in turn pressure local governments to raise local property taxes.
"If everything was hunky-dory now, there is a chance it would work," said Frank J. Mauro, director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonprofit group financed by labor unions and foundations that frequently opposes tax cuts. "But we're not at a stable position now."
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a three-term Democrat, called the proposal a "magic act" that would require "holy water" to get through the State Legislature. And he called himself the only real tax cutter in the race, having signed income tax cuts in 1985 and 1987, though the final phase of the 1987 bill has been postponed since 1990 because of the recession.
"The other candidate does not have the same credibility," Mr. Cuomo said of Mr. Pataki after he announced a child-health program in Harlem yesterday. [Page B9.]
As much as it was an economic plan, Mr. Pataki's proposal also seemed a political position paper. It placed him on the offensive in a tax-cut duel with Mr. Cuomo, who last week hazily outlined $1.5 billion in income and business tax cuts. It gave Mr. Pataki a platform plank that would appeal to almost every taxpaying New Yorker. And it sought to answer, at least in part, critics who have said his ideas are shallow and unformed.
Mr. Pataki cited the example set by Mrs. Whitman, who has promised to cut state income taxes by 30 percent over three years, as his model, saying she has shown that reduced state spending can pay for deep tax cuts. One of the architects of her plan, Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., the publisher of Forbes magazine, was also an economic adviser to him. And like her, the candidate released the plan with six weeks left in the campaign.
Income taxes are New York State's single largest source of revenue, accounting for an estimated $17.6 billion this year, 54 percent of the $32.9 billion the state expects to raise through taxes and fees.
Mr. Pataki would cut the tax in several ways. He would reduce the top rate from the current 7.875 to 5.9 by 1998, a 25 percent decrease. He would raise the annual income for the top tax bracket from the current $26,000 for a married couple to $50,000, removing "several hundred thousand" middle-income families from that top level, he said.
He would also keep the bottom tax rate at 4 percent, which he said would help low-income New Yorkers. That rate is to rise to 5.5 percent under the 1987 tax cut law.
Other provisions in the plan include replacing the $1,000 exemption for dependents with a tax credit of $200 per dependent, a change that Mr. Pataki said would be most beneficial to less wealthy taxpayers, and increasing the standard deduction to $13,000, from $9,500, for married couples. Mr. Pataki said he would also phase in an existing earned income tax credit for low-income families in one year instead of three.
For a family of four with an adjusted annual gross income of $45,000, Mr. Pataki's plan would reduce their state taxes to $985, from $1,920, a 49 percent decrease, according to figures provided by the Pataki campaign.
There is a risk for Mr. Pataki in modeling his plan after Mrs. Whitman's and praising her ability to balance her budget despite $122 million in tax cuts this year. The balancing act involved laying off state employees, freezing state aid to most municipalities and school districts and resorting to about $1.8 billion in "one-shot" savings.
In the past week, Mr. Pataki has been sharply criticized by one of his own running mates, Herbert London, the candidate for State Comptroller, for not offering a detailed plan to stimulate the economy. Yesterday, Mr. London's campaign said they would not comment on Mr. Pataki's new plan until after they had met with him.
Another Republican critic of Mr. Pataki, New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, also expressed concerns that the tax-cut plan would lead to reductions in state aid to the city. "It depends very much on how you do it," said Mr. Giuliani.
Mr. Pataki has been pursuing Mr. Giuliani's endorsement, and in his speech to the budget commission he spoke glowingly of Mr. Giuliani's efforts to cut city spending.
Mr. Pataki also used the 35-minute speech to underscore his differences with Mr. Cuomo. "The Cuomo philosophy, basically, is that whatever sounds virtuous is, ipso facto, the business of government," Mr. Pataki said. "That's wrong."
Mr. Pataki's aides said they expected to release this week television commercials about the tax cuts. One spot is intended to spoof Mr. Cuomo's claim to be a tax cutter by suggesting that the appearance of Elvis Presley on Long Island is more likely than a tax cut under Mr. Cuomo.

HEADLINE: Disney Drops Plan for History Theme Park in Virginia

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company announced last night that it had abandoned its chosen site in Northern Virginia for a sprawling American history theme park, a project that was reviled by historians and environmentalists and hotly debated at local planning boards as well as the United States Senate. The company said it would seek another site for the development, possibly in Virginia.
Peter S. Rummell, president of the Disney Design and Development Company, made it clear in a statement that the company had bowed to a torrent of criticism, in part out of a fear that opposition could delay the project. "Despite our confidence that we would eventually win the necessary approvals, it has become clear that we could not say when the park would be able to open, or even when we could break ground," he said. 
 The company planned to build the park, Disney's America, 35 miles southwest of Washington, near the site of the First Battle of Bull Run, the first big conflict of the Civil War, and in a region that contains many battle sites from that war. The proposed park, which was to be the centerpiece of a 3,000-acre, $650 million development, inspired fervent opposition from some historians who said it could blot out important Civil War sites and from environmentalists who said that it would bring crowding, road congestion and smog to an area where all these problems have mushroomed in recent years.
In a meeting late yesterday afternoon, Disney officials told Gov. George F. Allen and other state officials who had backed the project that they had decided against the rural site at Haymarket, in Prince William County. The Governor had said the project would provide 19,000 jobs and $47 million in annual revenue for the state. He was the driving force behind a $163 million bond issue that would have paid for new roads to serve the area surrounding the park.
"I would characterize our reaction as absolute shock," Robert T. Skunda, the state Secretary of Commerce and Trade, said last night. He noted that just in the last week, the project had cleared two important hurdles, winning the approval of the Prince William County Planning Commission and the regional Transportation Planning Board.
Mr. Skunda said Disney officials still hoped to find another site in Northern Virginia, within reach of the millions of tourists who visit the nation's capital each year. But the process of finding another location and once again negotiating the thickets of public opinion and governmental approval could delay the park, which was to open in 1998, by years.
In his statement, Mr. Rummell said, "In our mind, Virginia would still be an ideal place for this park."
James M. McPherson, a Princeton University historian who was a leader of the efforts to block the project, said Disney began to reconsider its choice of location about a week ago but held off making an announcement.
"We do feel good about it," said Mr. McPherson, president of Protect Historic America, a group of historians, scholars and authors opposed to the development. "Disney recognized what it was costing them in terms of image, public relations and the potential for a long, drawn-out controversy and lawsuits from environmental groups. They decided to respond to all the criticism and what we have emphasized all along, location."
Opponents said it was not the project itself they opposed, but the location. "The proposed site would have worsen traffic and air quality," said Fred Krupp, the executive director of the National Environmental Defense Fund, which led a coalition of 30 groups that opposed the project. "In a different location closer to public transportation, this development can strengthen the economy and improve air quality."
Despite polls showing that the proposed park had the support of a majority of Virginians, it attracted a wide range of opponents. In June, 16 representatives introduced a resolution in the House opposing the project, and the Senate's public lands subcommittee held hearings on the subject.
Opposition also came from the Interior Department, where some officials objected to the consequences such an ambitious project could have on nearby national park lands.
Last week, Sierra Club officials said they might go to court to stop, or at least delay, the project.
Some historians and writers questioned Disney's ability to address the darker issues of American history in a realistic or sensitive fashion. "I have doubts whether the technical wizardry that so entrances children and grown-ups at other Disney parks can do anything but mock a theme as momentous as slavery," the novelist William Styron wrote in an Op Ed page article last month in The New York Times. "To present even the most squalid sights would be to cheaply romanticize suffering."
Disney mounted a huge public relations campaign to try to overcome the opposition, but to no avail.
The outcome had a bitter taste for supporters of the project. "It's been a campaign of misinformation by well-financed out-of-state interests, and it worked," Mr. Skunda said. "No company wants to have its reputation dragged through the mud, and that's what happened here."
The park was to include a ride through a blast furnace; virtual reality Revolutionary War battles, in which visitors would have had a chance to fire muskets, and nightly recreations of the Civil War battle between the Monitor and the Merrimack, the first duel between ironclad ships.
In addition to the American heritage theme park, Disney had requested approval to build as many as 2,281 homes, 1,340 hotel rooms and 1.96 million square feet of retail and commercial space.

HEADLINE: Banker Hired For a Top Job With Schools

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

 BODY:
The New York City Schools Chancellor, Ramon C. Cortines, who has been criticized for trying to run the schools by himself, yesterday filled a newly created post to oversee the day-to-day management of the school system. But he drew immediate criticism from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for giving the job to a former banker who served as a deputy mayor to David N. Dinkins.
The new post of chief operations officer for the system of 1,100 schools will be filled by Barry F. Sullivan, who served for the final year and a half of the Dinkins administration as Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development. Since then he has led the New York City Partnership, whose members include 150 leaders of the city's biggest corporations, and the city's Chamber of Commerce. He has close ties to the city's business elite, like David Rockefeller, the former chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank. 
 Mr. Cortines said that Mr. Sullivan's fiscal experience and his ties to business would be valuable to the schools. "I know he will bring the benefit of those executive experiences and practices to the school system and help us improve," he said.
But in naming him, Mr. Cortines brushed aside entreaties from City Hall. He said last night that Deputy Mayor Ninfa Segarra had urged him in a meeting Tuesday evening not to appoint Mr. Sullivan to the powerful post, with oversight over the board's $8.5 billion budget and its 135,000 employees. And Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers intervened directly to ask Mr. Sullivan not to take the job, said the Mayor's press secretary, Cristyne F. Lategano.
After Mr. Cortines announced his decision yesterday, Mr. Giuliani called the selection "a mistake."
"I don't think Barry Sullivan is the right choice for that position," Mayor Giuliani said. "I think you would have been far better to have brought in someone that first of all is independent of the prior administration and comes to it with a new spirit, with an independent spirit."
Mr. Sullivan, a Republican, led First Chicago Bank until December 1991. In an interview yesterday, Mr. Cortines said that given his eight-month feud with Mr. Giuliani over the school budget, he had tried to select an administrator who would be able to both work with City Hall and build new partnerships with the city's business community.
He suggested that he had been taken aback by Mr. Giuliani's objections to Mr. Sullivan, and he said he had considered them carefully before finally putting them aside out of the belief that Mr. Sullivan was the right man.
"I was looking for someone who could work with City Hall, who understood the importance of working collaboratively with the city, even though we are an independent agency," Mr. Cortines said.
Even Herman Badillo, the Mayor's special deputy commissioner for school finances, had kind words for Mr. Sullivan. At City Hall yesterday he said he thought it would be useful for Mr. Cortines to turn outside the central bureaucracy in filling one of the top two management positions.
Former Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez had two deputy chancellors: Argie Johnson, for instruction, who handled the board divisions dealing with curriculum and other classroom issues, and Stanley S. Litow, for operations, who oversaw the board's business and operational side. Both Ms. Johnson and Mr. Litow left the board on Mr. Fernandez's departure in June 1993. Mr. Cortines appointed Beverly Hall earlier this year to replace Ms. Johnson.
He changed the name of the deputy chancellorship for operations to chief operations officer, but the post remained vacant for 15 months.
Mr. Sullivan's appointment comes at a time when many business leaders have criticized the school system for failing to provide the well-educated labor force the city needs.
In the new post, which he is scheduled to assume later this fall, Mr. Sullivan will oversee the board offices that administer the budget, personnel, labor relations, payroll, computer services, school lunches and busing. He will share oversight over the division that manages custodial services and maintenance in the city's 1,070 school buildings.
Mr. Sullivan was vacationing in Europe, but he issued a statement through the Chancellor's office.
"This is the right job at the right time with the right Chancellor," Mr. Sullivan said. "Nothing is more important to the future of this city than our schools, and I am glad to be part of an effort to improve them."
Mr. Cortines would not discuss details of his meeting Tuesday night with Ms. Segarra. "It was a professional conversation I had last evening with the Deputy Mayor, and she shared their professional concerns," Mr. Cortines said. An official who insisted on anonymity said that City Hall officials followed up on Ms. Segarra's meeting yesterday morning in a phone call to Mr. Cortines, again urging him not to appoint Mr. Sullivan.
"I considered the information that City Hall shared with me, because there's an improved relationship," Mr. Cortines said. "But I had to consider the good of the system."
John Fager, co-chairman of the Parents Coalition for Education in New York City, said Mr. Sullivan, as chairman of First Chicago, had helped push an act through the Illinois Legislature in 1988 that led to Chicago's radical decentralization of the school system, in which committees of parents, teachers and administrators manage schools.
"If he's going to bring the kinds of changes to New York that he helped bring to Chicago, then it's an exciting appointment," Mr. Fager said. "If he's simply being brought in to manage the status quo, then it's disappointing."
Mr. Sullivan is a Jesuit-educated native of the Bronx -- he graduated from the prestigious Regis High School in Manhattan -- who turned down a chance to play basketball with the New York Knicks before beginning a career in banking.

HEADLINE: U.S. Planning to Hold a Lottery To Pick Some Cuban Immigrants

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Having promised President Fidel Castro that it would grant entry rights to at least 20,000 Cubans a year, the Clinton Administration has decided to select about one-quarter of that total by a lottery of Cuban applicants.
Administration officials who are putting the finishing touches on the immigration plan said this lottery is intended to create opportunities for Cubans who have no hope of being admitted under American immigration law because they neither have close relatives in the United States nor qualify for refugee status. The other 15,000 would be accepted largely by broadening the definition of refugees and close relatives. 
 One official said that so many Cubans -- perhaps more than 100,000 -- might apply for entry through the lottery that it could become an embarrassment for Mr. Castro and increase pressures on him to liberalize his economy.
"One advantage of the lottery over accepting people on a first-come- first-served basis is you won't have people standing in long lines outside the American Interest Section in Havana," said an Administration official.
Another advantage of the lottery, Administration officials say, is that it might encourage some of the 30,000 Cuban refugees being held at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station to return voluntarily to Cuba -- something the Administration wants them to do -- to try their luck in the lottery. If Cubans were granted entry on a first-come-first-served basis, the Guantanamo refugees would have little chance to qualify and thus little incentive to go back to Cuba.
State Department officials repeated this week that the refugees at Guantanamo Bay have no chance to go directly to the United States. They noted, however, that Venezuela, Mexico and other Latin American countries have agreed to resettle several hundred of the Cubans.
The Administration agreed on Sept. 9 to admit more than 20,000 Cubans a year as part of a deal in which it won Mr. Castro's promise to stop the exodus.
Last week, Ricardo Alarcon, Cuba's chief negotiator in the immigration talks with Washington, complained that the Administration was dragging its feet in announcing exactly how it would grant entry to the 20,000 Cubans a year. At a news conference on Sept. 9, Attorney General Janet Reno indicated that the details would be released late the following week.
In explaining the delay, one Justice Department official said, "It's more important to do it right than to do it fast."
State Department officials said they were pleased by two steps the Castro Government took this month: it met in Madrid with three prominent exiled dissidents and it permitted farmers to sell their produce.
But Administration officials said these steps did not go far enough to warrant the "carefully calibrated" response that the United States promised if Havana took major steps toward democracy.

HEADLINE: Croat Presses U.N. to Act Against Serbs

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 28

 BODY:
After hearing pleas this week for the protection of Muslims in Bosnia, the President of Croatia told the United Nations today that Belgrade must also be forced to stop supporting Serbian forces occupying large areas of Croatia.
The Security Council voted last week to ease economic sanctions on Serbia in return for its help in controlling the Bosnian Serbs, but Croatia's problems were not dealt with. 
 President Franjo Tudjman told the General Assembly today that the time had come for tougher action by the United Nations to end the fighting in the former Yugoslavia that has gone on for almost three years.
During meetings with President Clinton, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and members of the Security Council, Mr. Tudjman said he emphasized "that Croatia's patience with respect to its occupied territories may be wearing thin." He also demanded "stronger and urgent commitment."
"Croatia welcomes Belgrade's announced readiness to isolate the Bosnian Serbs with their suicidal war option, but expects Belgrade to do the same with regard to the insurgent Serbs in Croatia," he added.
The Security Council last week also adopted two resolutions aimed at punishing the Bosnian Serbs for continuing to wage a "persistent and systematic campaign of terror." But again, no mention was made of the problems within Croatia.
After speaking to the General Assembly today, Britain's Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, defended his Government's opposition to the lifting of an arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia. The Muslims were put at a disadvantage because the Serbian-controlled Yugoslav Army stocked the arsenals of the Bosnian Serbs.
British and French opposition to the Security Council's action to ease sanctions in Serbia played a large role in changing the position of the Bosnian Government. President Alija Izetbegovic told the assembly on Tuesday that he would agree to a six-month delay in pressing for the lifting of the embargo.
Mr. Hurd said, "I welcome the decision of the Bosnian Government to accept that it is not the moment to lift the arms embargo." But he left open the possibility of changing this position, bearing in mind that British and French United Nations troops are at the greatest risk of casualties should the war intensify.
"We have said before that if the Bosnian Serbs do not join the peace process and agree to the map presented by the contact group," he said, "then our present approach may be exhausted, lifting the arms embargo may become unavoidable" and United Nations forces would have to be withdrawn. The United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia make up the negotiating team known as the contact group.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Russia to Speed Disarmament

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
In a cordial, almost jocular atmosphere, President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin agreed today to speed destruction of nuclear weapons, but they made only limited progress on several other issues.
"Relations between our nations are moving forward at full speed," Mr. Clinton said at a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House after the signing of documents pledging cooperation on economic and security matters. 
 On most things, Mr. Yeltsin said, "for peace, for humanity, for mankind, for our whole planet, we have agreed."
Two things made this, the fifth summit meeting between the two leaders, different from the others.
First, the contentious questions today are small potatoes compared with those of the recent past, like arms control and the very survival of the Russian reformers. Second, Mr. Yeltsin appears to have regained his stride after having seemed off-balance for months following the attempt to oust him a year ago.
The two leaders, burly extroverts who obviously enjoy each other, agreed to speed implementation of the Start II agreement, reached in 1993, which calls for the reduction of each nation's arsenal to between 3,000 and 3,500 long-range nuclear warheads by 2003. "Instead of taking the nine years allowed," Mr. Clinton said, dismantling will begin as soon as the accord is ratified.
But Start II cannot be ratified until an earlier agreement, Start I, comes into effect. The Administration hopes that will happen by the end of the year and that ratification can be completed -- and dismantling can therefore get under way -- by mid-1995. Congressional approval seems sure; a struggle is expected in the Russian Parliament, but Mr. Yeltsin will probably prevail.
Obviously delighted with what he had accomplished during two days in Washington, the Russian leader hammed it up with reporters, taunting them for falling behind. "You can't think fast enough?" he asked, stretching out his words to comic extremes. Mr. Clinton did not quite manage to keep a straight face.
Earlier, at the Library of Congress, Mr. Yeltsin robustly rebutted those who have suggested recently that the United States and Russia will eventually come into conflict.
"I would like to tell you," he said in his booming baritone, "that we never fought the United States, and I believe I can say as President of Russia that we will never fight the United States in the future. Instead, we will focus on building a world of decency and welfare."
But on Bosnia, cooperation between the two nations is still imperfect, and only limited progress was made. A close adviser to Mr. Yeltsin said, "If it were easy, the thing would have been settled long ago."
Russia, in part because of its cultural links to the Serbs, has long opposed the lifting of the international arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia, which would benefit the Muslim-led Government in Bosnia. The British and the French, who have peacekeepers in Bosnia, are also opposed. But under Congressional pressure, Mr. Clinton had pledged to ask the United Nations to lift the ban by Oct. 15.
An open split was averted when the Bosnian Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, suggested a six-month delay in authorizing arms shipments.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher expressed hope that some settlement could be reached during this period, but Mr. Yeltsin was blunt. After a meeting with United States Senators, he said that at the end of six months, "perhaps we can decide once and for all that this should not be done at all."
On another vexing question, that of Russian arms shipments to Iran, Mr. Clinton said only, "We've made progress." In fact, American officials said, Mr. Clinton was not able to extract from Mr. Yeltsin any firm pledge to slow the flow of submarines, tanks and air-launched missiles, which amounted to more than $1 billion last year.
The Russian leader said Russia would honor a contract signed with Iran in 1988 but would sign no new deals. But "we don't know how long or how wide the current pipeline is," an American expert said. Without that information, it is hard to say whether the Russian's new pledge has much significance.
Mr. Yeltsin also refused to budge much on Russian intervention in other nations of the former Soviet Union. Concerned about what might happen if Russian troops went into Nagorno-Karabakh, which is disputed between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe has asked to monitor any intervention.
So far Russia has balked, and Mr. Yeltsin showed no sign that he would yield. Instead he reasserted his claim to a Russian sphere of influence not unlike that which Washington claims in its hemisphere.
"These are our neighbors," he insisted. "Yesterday we lived in the same house, in the Soviet Union. They're our blood, right? Come on, let's be honest."
In the economic discussions, the emphasis was on American private investment, not American Government aid. The Russians promised to improve the laws governing business, which are so lax and change so often that most foreign business executives have shied away.
The Clinton Administration, for its part, pledged $525 million in financing and insurance for new investments in Russia, and additional agreements are expected to raise the total to $1 billion.
In the days when squabbles between the United States and the Soviet Union shook the world, American presidents encountering stormy political weather at home looked to summit talks for a bit of distraction. But this meeting was so low-key, so "normal," that Mr. Clinton, hard-pressed in the mid-term elections, can probably expect little in the way of direct obvious benefit.
Still, the change in the relationship has been remarkable.
When Mr. Clinton was in Moscow in January, he spent most of his time with Mr. Yeltsin, even though the political situation was confused, with reformers and pragmatists struggling for power. Some Russians and some diplomats complained, arguing that Mr. Clinton should have paid more attention to Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, an economic gradualist.
All that seems like ancient history.
Mr. Chernomyrdin did not come with Mr. Yeltsin to Washington; he is required by the Constitution to stay at home when Mr. Yeltsin is out of the country. But the two have long since reached an understanding on the pace of economic reform, and Mr. Yeltsin praised his erstwhile rival this week.
Several times he even used a very Chernomyrdin-like word -- pragmatism. Eight months ago that word would have upset American officials because it would have sounded like a signal that Mr. Yeltsin planned to ease reform measures as a concession to Russian nationalists.
This week, none of the Americans who heard him batted an eye.

HEADLINE: Kremlin Aide Says Yeltsin Faces a 'Struggle'

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Suggesting that it will take more than democracy to chase intrigue from the Kremlin, one of President Boris N. Yeltsin's closest aides asserted today that an "unseen struggle" was under way among Mr. Yeltsin's advisers over his political future.
"A struggle is going on for a democratic president, practically speaking, for the next term of Russia's history," the Russian President's press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, told the Interfax News Agency in an interview released this evening. "All the rest are emotions and the dust of political sideshows." 
 The fight is apparently over whether Mr. Yeltsin should run again for President in 1996, whether he should put the elections off until economic reforms have more time to take hold, how he should conduct himself as President, and what, if anything, Mr. Yeltsin should say about it all now.
Mr. Kostikov, often more outspoken than his boss or most other advisers to Mr. Yeltsin, was unexpectedly struck from the list of officials who traveled to the United Nations and Washington this week with the Russian President. So were several other close advisers to Mr. Yeltsin, prompting the newspaper Izvestia to predict mighty power struggles to come.
It is not clear why Mr. Kostikov was did not travel to the United States. But it is also not clear -- despite what Izvestia suggested today -- that the Yeltsin Administration has been torn apart by a split between democrats like Mr. Kostikov and more hard-line guardians of power like Viktor Ilyushin, a former Communist Party official and long a close ally of Mr. Yeltsin.
Mr. Yeltsin has jettisoned many democrats from his inner circle, and with opponents like Aleksandr Rutskoi and Gennadi Zyuganov, the Communist Party leader, already campaigning together with strong appeals to Russian nationalism, it puts Mr. Yeltsin in a difficult political position.
"It is not surprising that the President's name and position are giving rise to open and covert polemics," Mr. Kostikov said in the interview. "The stakes are too high.
"The President is about to take vitally important decisions on the date of the elections," he continued. "He is to decide whether he will seek another term, as a number of leaders are proposing, or use his influence to put off elections."
Clearly, Mr. Yeltsin faces political problems. There are many indicators of severe economic problems -- unproductive factories, unrealistic budgets, and inflation that, though greatly reduced, is still too high. On the other hand, foreign capital is returning to the country and Mr. Yeltsin's political opponents look far weaker than they have in months.
"Will he remain the democratic-minded President we knew in 1991 and 1993?" Mr. Kostikov asked. Will it be "power at all costs?" Mr. Kostikov continued, "or power for the sake of democracy and reform?"

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
Cuomo States the Cuomo Case Best, but Will It Pay Off at the Polls in November?

BYLINE: By Joyce Purnick 

 BODY:
SAY this for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. Whatever happens on Nov. 8, he will have run what is probably his last campaign, win or lose, on his own terms.
Oh, he's given a perfunctory nod or two to the prevailing political winds. He pledges to cut taxes, has opened the door to endorsing term limits and reminds people that a referendum on the death penalty is O.K. with him -- always carefully adding that he is sure the public would agree with him and vote for life sentences without parole instead. 
 But the essential Mario Cuomo remains the same as he always was as he seeks a fourth term. With the political center shifting to the right, with his own city now led by a Republican who believes in reducing the role of government as a matter of philosophy as well as fiscal need, Mr. Cuomo leaves little doubt that he is comfortable with himself. "I have been an old liberal for a long time," he said during a question-and-answer session of five hours-plus at The New York Times on Monday, later amending the label to "progressive pragmatist."
He may be both, but if a singular observation could be gleaned from so wide-ranging an interview -- irreverently dubbed the "Mariothon" by some participants -- it is that Mario Cuomo is not only an old liberal but an unreconstructed one, in words if not always in deed.
AT a time when people hate government and politicians are turning themselves into pretzels to prove they hate government, too, Mr. Cuomo says hey, wait a minute -- government is O.K., we need it.
At a time when his Republican opponent, State Senator George E. Pataki, says, "We can have better government with less government," the most Mr. Cuomo will allow is, "You must have all the government you need, but only the government you need."
At a time when the polls show people's frustration with government and politicians, the Governor of New York State quotes Lincoln, says today's poor should not be denied welfare any more than his immigrant parents should have been denied help, calls public education "the great doorway to opportunity" and reiterates his belief in government's "obligation to all of the disadvantaged people who can be helped with public education and public health care to give them that."
It may never become an issue in this campaign because Mr. Pataki attacks the Democratic Governor from the right, but it is curious -- supporters would say disappointing -- that despite his elegantly expressed philosophy, Mr. Cuomo cannot point to accomplishments that match his words. Mr. Pataki might not like to admit this, but Mr. Cuomo has not turned New York into the liberal bulwark of the country. Maybe in Mr. Cuomo's heart of hearts he wanted to. But he did not.
His most distinctive achievement is building more prisons than any governor in the state's history. "I'm not happy about it," he says, but he did it because he had no choice: more prisoners needed more cells.
DESPITE the Governor's regard for public education, cities, including New York City, still get less than their fair share of school aid compared with the suburbs. "The funding is unfair and has to be corrected," says Mr. Cuomo, calling his failure to provide more school aid to cities "one of the good things I haven't gotten done." The welfare housing allowance has not been increased in years; local governments still contribute to Medicaid despite the Governor's call for a state takeover of Medicaid costs, and though he favors free tuition in the public university system, tuition has gone up during his tenure.
The three Cuomo terms have had successes, too. And he has been limited in what he could do by a weak national economy and a Republican-led State Senate that, Mr. Cuomo frequently complains, often blocked his initiatives. The Governor says he wants a fourth term to complete the job because, limited by economic problems and that balky State Senate, he didn't do enough "good things" in his three terms. He says he wants to win so he can combat "a harshness and a negativism and a fear out there" that troubles him.
Nobody states Mario Cuomo's case better than Mario Cuomo. Over these next several weeks, his problem may turn out to be that as he campaigns so eloquently on his own terms, in words that ring with the best in American idealism and with a poetic sense of history, those words will come back to haunt him.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT VOWS VICTORY ON TRADE

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
President Clinton vowed today to keep Congress in session for as long as it takes to approve the global trade agreement after a key Senate Democrat, Ernest F. Hollings, threatened to block a vote on the pact. Failure to approve the accord could imperil the President's economic diplomacy and would be another legislative defeat after health care's demise.
Moving quickly to prevent that, President Clinton used a news conference with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia to argue for quick passage of legislation carrying out the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and to make clear that he was ready to adopt extraordinary measures to insure that it happens this year. 
 "This is the biggest trade agreement in history," Mr. Clinton said. "It's the biggest worldwide tax cut in history by reductions of tariffs. It will give us 300,000 to 500,000 new high-wage jobs in the next few years. So I urge the Congress to pass the GATT before they go home."
Partly by accident, partly by the failure of the White House to get the trade accord up to Congress for approval earlier and partly because of quirky Senate rules, Mr. Hollings is in a position to hold up the agreement. [Man in the News, Page D7.]
Mr. Hollings, a Democrat of South Carolina, called the pact a "tremendous danger" to American workers because, he said, its free trade provisions would encourage the flight of low-wage jobs abroad.
The view is shared by few economists or other politicians. Most Republicans support the global accord and most lawmakers of both parties agree that it would win easy passage in both the House and Senate if it can come to a vote. Republican legislators, though, were largely quiet today, apparently enjoying the spectacle of a Democratic Senator wounding his own President.
If the bill "passes the House and doesn't pass the Senate," Mr. Clinton said, "I will urge that the Senate stay in session, take a recess for the election, come back afterward and pass this. The United States has to lead on this, and I intend to do everything I can to see that we do lead."
Less than a quarter of the legislatures or cabinets of countries signing the agreement last December in Geneva have formally approved it since, something that every nation is supposed to do by the end of this year. Most countries are waiting for the United States to do so first. If Washington balks, it could indefinitely stall the pact, which was negotiated over seven years and involves simultaneous tariff reductions by 123 countries. The total tariff cuts worldwide are estimated at $740 billion over a period of 10 years. The GATT accord reduces other barriers to trade, too, and provides patent protection for the American software, drug and other industries.
With such stakes, the betting in Congress and the Administration is that some way, somehow, the President will get around Mr. Hollings and get the enabling legislation passed this year.
Senator Hollings is in a position to obstruct it as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, one of several committees in the House and Senate that have jurisdiction over the bill. The White House formally sent the legislation to Congress on Tuesday.
Under so-called fast-track rules intended to speed approval of the measure, all committees with jurisdiction have 45 working days to review the legislation. But since all the details have already been worked out by Congress and the White House in advance, all the committees were expected to send the bill to the floor for votes next week, before scheduled adjournment in mid-October.
For instance, the House Ways and Means Committee voted 35 to 3 today in favor of the measure. By a voice vote, the House Energy and Commerce Committee decided to send it to the floor without a recommendation.
Senator Hollings, though, refused to play along. Ideologically opposed to the global agreement, he argued that it would only encourage the trend of moving low-wage manufacturing jobs out of the country, particularly textile jobs in which his own state specializes. He said he intended to take all 45 days to review the bill in hopes that Congress would adjourn for the year and postpone it until 1995. President Clinton unsuccessfully tried to sway him at an Oval Office meeting on Tuesday.
Mr. Hollings told a news conference today that he was not tying up the bill just to protect the textile industry. "Yes, we'll lose a million textile jobs, but I'm not shilling for a single industry," he said, "I'm shilling for the United States of America."
At the sometimes rambling news session, Mr. Hollings said that the Smoot-Hawley tariff act was "a good thing at the time." The Smoot-Hawley law was a protectionist measure that steeply raised American tariffs in 1930, supposedly to protect jobs. Many economists believe that it helped deepen the Depression.
The point of his hearings, Mr. Hollings said today, would be "to expose GATT for what it is -- a tremendous danger." He said he could not understand why the Administration waited so long to send the bill to Congress, adding that he had told the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, in April not to "come in here at the last minute with a we've-got-to-save-the-President kind of thing."
Mr. Hollings said "No chance at all" when asked whether he would permit a vote on the global trade accord by his committee before the 45-day deadline.
Technically, there are cumbersome procedures by which a Congressional committee can vote without the support of its chairman. But it virtually never happens because of the power of the chairman to retaliate.
A senior Administration official said today of Mr. Hollings that "we tried to reason with him, but just could not get through.".
The House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, said the President had the authority to command senators to return to session, and permit the House to adjourn for the year, assuming it approved the GATT legislation next week, as widely expected. In the Senate, the majority leader, George J. Mitchell, said he was also committed to doing whatever it took to get the pact approved there this year.
A delay in approving the accord this year is critical because the bill is being debated under the fast-track provisions, which mean that no amendments can be added now that it has been introduced. That fast-track authority expires at the end of the year, and many lawmakers believe that it may not be applied to GATT legislation if it is reintroduced next year -- even though it was negotiated under the fast-track rules. If the measure is reintroduced in Congress without the protection of the fast-track procedure, all 535 lawmakers could conceivably try to amend it.
President Clinton has been rather quiet up to now about the global trade legislation, even though economic diplomacy and the promotion of trade have been highlights of his foreign policy. Today, though, he spoke out strongly in favor of the bill and made clear that he would not allow it to be delayed until next year.
Not only would this be bad for the trade pact's prospects, but it would also be embarrassing for the President to attend the Asian economic summit meeting in Indonesia in November or the Latin American economic summit meeting in Miami in December without the accord in place.
"I will do whatever I can within the law to pass the GATT this year," Mr. Clinton said. "It's important that it pass this year. It's important for the United States and our leadership, our efforts to get others to drop their trade barriers, to open their markets to move forward. We have to set an example here."

HEADLINE: Man in the News: Ernest Frederick Hollings;
A Made-in-America Warrior on Free Trade

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Senator Ernest Frederick Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, knows exactly what he thinks about free trade agreements: he doesn't like them and he never has.
He returned to that theme today, dismissing the pleas of a President from his own party and singlehandedly delaying passage of the most sweeping effort to reduce trade barriers in more than a decade. 
 In so doing, Mr. Hollings only reinforced a reputation he has acquired over the years as a stubborn if unpredictable and sometimes even eccentric lawmaker.
At 72, he is a commanding presence as he strides into committee rooms with his mane of carefully coiffed white hair and his impeccably tailored suits. But with a booming voice and a penchant for occasionally tasteless rhetoric, he has been known to infuriate listeners with blunt words.
Earlier this year, for example, he incurred the wrath of black groups in the United States when he remarked that African political leaders liked to attend global trade meetings because "rather than eating each other, they'd just come up and get a good square meal in Geneva."
And he created a small furor three years ago, amid trade tensions with Tokyo, by boasting that Japan had been pulverized by American atomic bombs. "You should draw a mushroom cloud and put underneath it, 'Made In America,' " he said, while touring a South Carolina factory that made roller bearings.
Supporters of Mr. Hollings say he has been consistent over the years in his views about trade legislation. He has a deep concern, they say, that other countries do not play by the same rules as the United States.
As chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, Mr. Hollings has effectively blocked legislation to enact the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by saying he will demand a full 45 legislative days to consider the measure. That would put a vote far beyond the scheduled adjournment of Congress in mid-October, forcing lawmakers to return after the November elections, if the President so decides, or start the approval process all over again next year.
"I'm not shilling for a single industry," Mr. Hollings said today. "I'm shilling for the United States of America."
Mr. Hollings has long sought to protect textile companies in his home state from the low-priced exports of clothing from Asia and Latin America. He worries at length about the loss of manufacturing jobs in America, and he strongly supports the use of Government money to fuel business development.
But he has steadfastly opposed reducing tariff protections for American companies, arguing that such moves will weaken the country.
He was an ardent but unsuccessful foe of the North American Free Trade Agreement, approved by Congress in November, which reduced tariff barriers among the United States, Mexico and Canada. He has also been a persistent critic of the GATT agreement, and tried to prevent the trade pact from winning "fast track" Congressional consideration.
"These treaties promise more of the same 'free trade' magic that has created $100 billion deficits for the past decade," he wrote in 1991 newspaper commentary, attacking both pacts. "Congress is fed up with playing Uncle Sucker."
Mr. Hollings has labored mightily for legislation intended to improve American competitiveness. This year, he was the principal author of a bill to rewrite the nation's telecommunications laws, which would have made it easier for telephone and cable television companies to compete in each other's markets. That bill, which had considerable bipartisan support and was strongly favored by the Clinton Administration, died last week amid last-minute opposition from the regional Bell companies.
Born in 1922 in Charleston, S.C., Mr. Hollings was graduated from the Citadel, received a law degree from the University of South Carolina, then served in the Army in World War II. Before his election to the Senate in 1966, he served as Governor of South Carolina from 1959 to 1963.
He sought the Democratic nomination for president in 1984, but dropped out after losing several early primaries. In the Senate, he has been involved in many issues, first as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and then as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. Among other things, he was a principal author of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill in 1985, which forced automatic spending cuts if Federal deficit targets were missed.
In the trade battle, supporters of Mr. Hollings say he feels that other governments do not abide by the same free-trade tenets as the United States does. "He really believes that there are competing economies that have developed under different principles," an aide to the Senator said today.
Free-market advocates say Mr. Hollings is simply wrong, and that he is being short-sighted about the true merits of expanded global trade. "Anybody who tries to stop the GATT is acting against the interests of the U.S. as a whole," Carla Hills, the United States trade representative for the Bush Administration, said.
She said Mr. Hollings was merely protecting the textile industry. "It's extraordinary that one man on one sector can deprive the nation of the economic benefits that would flow from this agreement."

HEADLINE: Income Tax Resurfaces in Connecticut Campaign

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 28

 BODY:
It's back.
The debate over whether Connecticut should have an income tax, which might have seemed finished in 1991, when 40,000 shrieking protesters on the Capitol lawn failed to roll back the tax, or in 1992, when the legislature was unable to muster the votes for repeal, has re-emerged in 1994 as an unexpected centerpiece in the race for governor. 
 John G. Rowland, the Republican candidate, who said earlier this year that he believed the income tax, imposed in 1991 during a fiscal crisis, was probably here to stay, has recently staked his campaign on a promise to repeal all taxes on income in the state over five years. An independent third-party challenger, Tom Scott, who led and organized the 1991 protests, has gone one better, promising to do it in four years.
The issue here is not just cutting taxes, though both men hold up New Jersey and Massachusetts as tax-cut role models. What has been proposed is an agenda of wholesale amputation: complete elimination of the single largest category of state revenue, which accounts for more than one-third of all state tax collections.
The question, which generated some of the only sparks in an otherwise lackluster debate in Hartford tonight, is whether a repeal plan is realistic.
Only one state -- Alaska, buoyed by its billions in oil industry revenues -- has ever repealed an income tax. And if it is done, at what cost? Is the income tax really responsible, as Mr. Rowland and Mr. Scott argue, for Connecticut's bumpy low-grade recovery from the recession? And would huge tax cuts jolt economic activity into high gear or simply blow apart the state government?
One of the first hurdles for the new abolitionists would be surviving the ire of the state's biggest business lobby, the Connecticut Business and Industry Association. A traditional supporter of Republican causes, the group strongly supports the tax, arguing that the income tax has actually made the state's business environment better.
A spokesman, Joseph F. Brennan, said that because of the income tax, the legislature has been able to cut the corporate tax rate, overhaul the workers' compensation law and create new tax breaks for business, like exempting computers from the personal property tax. Anything that threatens those benefits, or that would add to the tax burden on business, Mr. Brennan said, would be a threat. "We would be opposed to anything that would focus exclusively on individual tax reductions," he said.
Another issue is how much the income tax is even to blame for the state's economic problems. Nonpartisan economists and budget experts who have looked at the Connecticut situation say that the $1 billion increase in taxes that walloped the state in 1991 when the income tax took hold -- a 22 percent jump in one year -- probably did deepen and prolong the recession, by taking money from people's pockets during an uncertain economic period.
On the other hand, State Labor Department figures suggest that many of the job losses since then have had little to do with the tax structure. Cuts in Federal military spending and turmoil in the financial services industry, especially among the big insurers in Hartford, accounted for much of the employment problem.
Since February 1992, for example, when the state's unemployment rate reached a peak at 8.1 percent, through last month, when it stood at 5.5 percent, about 15,000 manufacturing jobs were lost in the state. But all of that loss, and more, was accounted for in the category of transportation manufacturing, which includes most military contracting in the state. About 19,000 jobs in that sector were lost as Navy submarine contracts and jet engine orders sagged. About 10,000 insurance jobs disappeared over the same period.
One factor that has made it easier to argue for tax cuts now is the changing revenue picture. In 1991, tax collections were plummeting so drastically that an income tax came to be regarded by many state lawmakers as the only workable solution to the budget crisis.
The outlook now calls for a string of surpluses. Bonds sold in 1991 to pay off accumulated budget deficits will be paid off by 1996. Tax collection revenues from income and sales taxes are expected to produce a $115 million surplus this year.
The Democratic candidate for governor, William E. Curry Jr., has seized on the revenue growth numbers in pledging a $1 billion reduction in property taxes, through a dedicated fund system that would rebate state money to towns and cities. The gubernatorial candidate from Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s independent A Connecticut Party, Eunice S. Groark, has said she would lower the sales tax, from 6 percent to perhaps 5 percent.
The other big question is the cost of repeal. Mr. Rowland, in his plan this week, outlined $400 million in savings -- achieved in part through reorganization of state agencies and reductions in borrowing and state employee overtime -- in the $9.4 billion state budget. He said that over five years, half of the $2.6 billion in lost annual revenue from the income tax would be offset by these reductions. The remaining revenue, he said, would result from increased economic activity that would spur revenues from other taxes.
Mrs. Groark, who cast the deciding vote for the income tax as Lieutenant Governor, breaking a tie in the State Senate, has attacked those assumptions. She said that the budget's biggest line item, aid to local towns, could not be cut without forcing up local property taxes, and that Medicaid payments, the second largest budget line, could not be significantly cut without causing sanctions from the Federal Government. A spokesman for Mr. Curry argued that the Rowland plan misses the point, and that high property taxes are the real drag on Connecticut economic activity.
In the debate tonight, Mr. Curry also attacked what he called the vagueness of Mr. Rowland's proposal.
"At the heart of it is a set of mammoth tax cuts," Mr. Curry said. But he said that how the state would pay for those cuts, especially after the first year, was unknown. "None of the revenues beyond that are explained, not one penny of them," Mr. Curry said.
Mr. Scott, for his part, says the Rowland plan is just wishful thinking. Eliminating the income tax, he says, can not be done without breaking a few eggs. In the first year, for example, a Scott administration would eliminate all job training and general assistance welfare, and begin dismantling the State Department of Education.
Both men also do more than restore the status quo ante, calling for income on interest, dividends and capital gains, which was taxed for years before 1991, to be fully tax free.
Steven D. Gold, a researcher at the Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York at Albany, said that abolishing an income tax has been done once in American history: in Alaska, when the Prudhoe Bay fields started pumping crude oil and tax bounty to the state in the 1970's. Gov. Fife Symington of Arizona has also proposed phasing out that state's income tax this year, arguing that with the economy booming, the money is not needed.
Eliminating it in a place like Connecticut, Mr. Gold said, where the recession seems barely to have ended, would be different.
"It could not be done painlessly or easily," he said.

HEADLINE: G.I.'s Take Joy and Relief on the Road

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GONAIVES, Haiti, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The rivets that held the cast-iron Jesus on His concrete cross rusted through months ago, and the Savior tumbled to the ground. Instead of putting Him back on the cross, residents of this poor, sun-bleached seaside city just propped Him up at the base.
The people of Gonaives are impatiently waiting for a different kind of savior. 
 Since Saturday, when United States soldiers first flew in on roaring, dust-whipping helicopters and freed them from the hated army and police here, Haitians have been singing and praising the name of the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Gonaives, one of Haiti's poorest, most repressed cities, is like a terminal patient blessed with a miracle cure.
"It is happiness," said Robert Jean, 33, who has a scar on his neck where, he said, a soldier's bullet passed through. But United States soldiers with the Army Special Forces detachment sent to secure the town say Gonaives is just one of many cities that could explode at any time because the old hatreds have built for so long.
In the last three years, said residents in this city of about 25,000, anyone who even mentioned the name of Father Aristide was jailed and tortured. Their freedom is like rum to them, the people said: They are drunk on it.
Residents have gathered by the thousands around the Haitian Army barracks in the center of the city, and have been peaceful so far, said Maj. Mark O'Neill of the Special Forces. That is a good thing, he said, since there are only about 100 United States troops in Gonaives.
Many of the people, poorer and more insulated than those in Port-au-Prince, had never seen a helicopter except as a distant speck in the sky. For three days they have run cheering to the landing area, a dirt soccer field, then run away again screaming as the rotor sent stinging sand into their eyes. But they laughed anyway.
"There must have been 10,000 people who welcomed us here," said Major O'Neill. "I felt like Montgomery going into Salerno."
Major O'Neill, a square-jawed but smiling officer who looks like he just stepped off a recruiting poster, is proud that his soldiers have made Gonaives a less fearful place. Beatings have stopped, he said, and the jails -- once filled with political prisoners -- have been emptied.
But the American presence has shifted the fear from one people to another: Haitian soldiers keep inside the old yellow barracks they share with the Army Rangers, and seldom walk outside unless accompanied by American soldiers.
The ring of people around the barracks, too peaceful to be called a demonstration, is constant. The people point out individual soldiers who beat relatives, and name Haitian officers who they say ordered the killing of friends.
"They can't lead us anymore," said Jean Remy Dophen, who had two pictures of Father Aristide pinned to his shirt. "The Americans give us security, but we are still waiting for deliverance."
Mr. Dophen said the people in the crowd would love to surge forward and take justice on all the soldiers who persecuted them, but one thing held them back, and it was not the guns of the American soldiers.
"We won't take vengeance," he said, "because Father Aristide told us not to."
One Ranger sergeant said American troops had no intention of firing into the crowd to protect the Haitian soldiers.
"We see people in the crowd, stirring them up," said Sgt. 1st Class George Scott. Today one man walked through the crowd passing out leaflets that showed a man wielding a bloody machete, encouraging people to take control of the city.
"We can't control a mob the size of these crowds," Sergeant Scott said, and we're not ready to start shooting civilians."
The American soldiers are beginning a campaign to defuse the explosive situation in Gonaives, a campaign that is largely public relations.
The Rangers sent emissaries today to meet with religious leaders and ask their help in calming the people, and in identifying the plain-clothes auxiliaries called attaches who may represent the greatest threat to peace.
"We need peace," said the Rev. Max Mesidon, a Catholic priest, "so you must take the guns from the people in civilian clothes."
The Rangers plan to ask the priests to help them identify the attaches so they can be disarmed; it would be the first such partnership between the occupying army and the Catholic Church.
The Catholic hierarchy in Haiti has aligned itself with the country's elite, who backed and financed the coup that toppled Father Aristide on Sept. 30, 1991. But in poorer sections like Gonaives, priests are more likely to be on the side of the poor.
The Rangers, usually in combat, find themselves in the role of peacemaker, but it is essential if they are going to prevent a civil war in this isolated city. "It's p.r.," said Sergeant Scott, who has been trained to establish relations with townspeople to ward off confrontations.
Major O'Neill said there was one other thing the Rangers could do to calm the people of Gonaives, if they could: he wishes the army could distribute food. "These people are hungry," he said.
Many people in the crowd have been afflicted by the United Nations embargo on Haiti and by the internal strife. Although relief aid was exempt from the embargo, corruption and isolation have choked much of the aid here, and the embargo has destroyed the economy.
"If the U.N. would end the embargo, it would help them," said Major O'Neill. "But the army doesn't drive the train."

HEADLINE: Stocks Climb Modestly in Heavy Trading

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Following Tuesday's signal by the Federal Reserve that it would not immediately raise interest rates, the stock market rose modestly yesterday -- its third consecutive day of advancing prices. So far this week, the Dow Jones industrial average has regained about 46 points of last week's 102-point fall.
After rising as much as 28 points, the Dow closed at 3,878.18, up 15.14 in heavy trading. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 2.76 points, to 464.81, and the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 4.64 points, to 760.01. 
 But yesterday's market may have little to do with any change in investor sentiment after the Fed's non-action. The rally was helped by strong demand yesterday at the $11 billion auction in five-year Treasury notes, which helped lower long-term interest rates, and by some optimism about United States-Japan trade talks, which helped lift the dollar against the Japanese yen and German mark. Both developments make stocks more valuable.
Such support for stocks could prove temporary. Forthcoming economic data -- like unemployment, factory-use and consumer price data -- may persuade traders that the Fed will raise interest rates and prompt traders to sell stocks.
Still, data released yesterday by the mutual-fund industry shows that equity portfolio managers have gotten even more money to invest and therefore are under pressure to buy stocks.
During the first eight months of 1994, inflows of new cash into stock funds totaled $93.5 billion, or roughly the annual revenue of Exxon. That is up 12 percent from the 1993 period, according to the Investment Company Institute, the trade group for mutual funds.
But redemptions, or investors cashing out of funds, were up, too, for stocks. That is especially worrisome since the redemptions occurred in a month when stock prices were up sharply and presumably meant that some investors thought prices had peaked.
August redemptions rose 18 percent from the previous month to $11.1 billion. The Dow reached its second-highest peak of this year on Sept. 15.
By contrast, bond fund redemptions leveled off in August, even before long-term interest rates headed decisively from 7.4 percent to 7.8 percent this month. Bond redemptions at $13.6 billion in August were little changed from $13.5 billion in July. Net cash outflow increased, however, probably because bondholders in the previous months had their principal cut sharply.
Stock market analysts worry that as bond yields approach 8 percent, hundreds of thousands of individual investors will pull their money out of stocks and put it into bonds, sending stock prices falling.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange at 330.3 million shares was about 15 percent above this year's average of 287 million shares.
Roughly seven stocks rose for every four that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. Cincinnati Milacron, a machine-tool maker, rose 2 1/2, to 26, for example, after a Merrill Lynch analyst raised her recommendation to intermediate "buy" from "above average." The Andrew Corporation, a supplier of telecommunications equipment, rose 3 3/4, to 48 1/4, after it got a large contract to supply television-broadcast antennas to the Fox network.
The American depository receipts of Telefonos de Mexico, often used by institutional investors as a proxy for the Mexican stock market, fell 1 1/8, to 63 1/4, after a top official of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party was shot and killed.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.50 points, to 256.37, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,401 to 806. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 2.78 points, to 456.20.

HEADLINE: Favorite in Brazil to Stress Private Sector Over State

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Sept. 28

 BODY:
With this country's presidential election only five days away, its front-runner, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, promised today to break up Brazil's longstanding state monopolies and attract foreign investment in oil, mining, telecommunications, and highway and dam construction.
"We have 16 hydroelectric dams paralyzed," Mr. Cardoso told foreign journalists here, and said this tied up the equivalent of $2 billion. 
 "Why not have foreign capital participate?" he said.
Formerly Finance Minister, Mr. Cardoso while in office introduced a plan to curb inflation that has cut Brazil's monthly rate to 1.5 percent in September from 45 percent in June. A new currency was introduced, and prices, wages, rents and contracts were no longer based on the practice of indexing for inflation.
Mr. Cardoso is forecast to win the election on Monday by a margin of seven to nine percentage points, according to polls this week.
Quietly confident of victory, the 63-year-old Social Democrat today offered his clearest vision so far of the future for foreign trade and investment in Brazil, Latin America's largest economy. This is the last major country in South America to remove restrictive barriers to foreign investment in key industries and businesses.
Mr. Cardoso has supported Brazil's recent reductions in tariffs, as part of a free trade policy that is increasing United States exports by 25 percent this year.
"Nafta doesn't frighten us," he said today, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement involving Mexico, the United States and Canada, a pact some Brazilians regard with suspicion.
"We are a continental nation," he continued, noting that Brazil's trade is divided among Latin America, North America, Europe and Asia. "We cannot ally ourselves only in one direction."
Mr. Cardoso held out the possibility of a Western Hemisphere free-trade accord as a final goal, but he said his first priority would be to speed integration with the rest of Latin America, and push for the rapid creation of a South American free-trade zone.
"Manaus needs energy. Why not run a power line from Guri Dam to Manaus?" he said, referring to a proposed power link between Venezuela's largest hydroelectric dam and the biggest city in the Brazilian Amazon.
"Colombia has coal near the coast," he continued. "Why not build a thermoelectric plant in Pernambuco," a city in northeastern Brazil.
Breaking with Brazil's tradition of closed markets, Mr. Cardoso and his campaign advisers have said that such major public projects should be opened to bids from foreign construction companies.
"Either they enter partnerships with the private sector, or there will not be expansion in these areas," he said, referring to companies working in infrastructure development, oil production and telephone service. "We should make the oil monopoly more flexible."
Mr. Cardoso, who served for 10 years in the Brazilian Senate, said that early next year he would seek to change the Constitution, which bars private foreign investment in oil and telecommunications and limits it to minority participation in mining.
A previous attempt to change the Constitution failed in May. But polls predict that the voters will give Mr. Cardoso's center-right coalition three-fifths of the seats in both houses of the Brazilian Congress, enough to amend the Constitution.
Mr. Cardoso has previously indicated that he wants to open the economy. Last week, Brazil's leading business magazine, Exame, quoted him as saying, "Certainly, there is no reason to maintain the state telephone monopoly."
In the interview, Mr. Cardoso added that he would sell the mining corporation Vale do Rio Doce, which is Brazil's sixth-largest state company, with $2 billion in sales last year.
"We are going to speed privatizations enormously," he said.

HEADLINE: Inflation-Wary Investors Are Leaving Bond Funds

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Inflation fears are striking mutual fund investors, who are moving money into gold stock funds while taking it out of bond funds, which have been damaged by rising interest rates.
"Investors are clearly responding to a perceived inflationary environment," Neal Litvack, an executive vice president of Fidelity Investments, said yesterday. He pointed to a survey of investors, done for Fidelity by the University of Michigan, which showed more than 50 percent of those questioned this month think inflation will turn up in the next six months. In recent months, that figure had hovered near 20 percent. 
 At T. Rowe Price Associates, another large mutual fund company, officials reported a surge of interest in its New Era Fund, which invests in natural resources companies and is often viewed as an inflation hedge. Such flows have helped sustain the inflow of money into stock funds, although the flow appears to have fallen off this month from a very strong pace in August, when $14.1 billion poured into stock funds.
At the same time, it appears that the outflow from bond funds, which has been going on since last spring, is increasing amid concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this fall. Figures released yesterday by the Investment Company Institute, a trade group, showed that bond funds suffered a net cash outflow of $2.8 billion in August, and fund executives say the figure has almost certainly worsened this month.
When it comes to fighting inflation, there is a certain chicken-and-egg factor regarding the Fed and the public. The evidence of growing inflation fears could help persuade the Fed it needs to tighten credit further, to help counter those fears. Yet, with little acceleration in the Consumer Price Index, one factor that has helped fan those fears is the Fed's highly publicized previous efforts to raise interest rates to fight inflation.
At Fidelity, Mr. Litvack said that the net inflow of cash into the firm's gold stock fund this month was the first this year. For the industry as a whole, however, such funds have seen net inflows since May.
The cash flow figures include sales and redemptions of mutual funds, as well as net transfers between funds, but they do not include reinvested dividends.
While bond funds now offer much juicier yields than they did when interest rates bottomed last October, investors seem to be focusing more on the principal losses that have come from rising interest rates, which they fear will continue. As a group, bond funds have seen net cash outflows every month since March. And government bond funds have suffered withdrawals in every month since November.
While government bond funds took in a net $5.9 billion in 1993, they have seen withdrawals of $13.7 billion in the first eight months of this year. As a result of those withdrawals, as well as losses from rising interest rates, total assets of government bond funds fell below $100 billion in August for the first time since January 1992; they are down 23 percent from the peak reached in July of last year.
Among stock funds, some managers say that the public has lost its appetite for the riskier funds, and instead has moved either toward funds viewed as inflation hedges or as less aggressive. While most said cash kept coming into stock funds this month, Kemper Mutual Funds said it had seen many withdrawals.
Although stocks have done little this year, the continued inflows have been remarkable. The August figure was the best since February, and the fourth-best month ever. So far in 1994, $93.4 billion has gone into stock funds, leaving them on a pace to break the full-year record of $127.9 billion set last year. Much of that strength has come from international funds, which took in $35.9 billion in the first eight months, just below the 1993 full-year record of $37.8 billion.

DATELINE: Copper Falls After Raising Of Margin Requirements

 BODY:
Copper prices fell yesterday, pulling back from a four-year high set Monday, after the Commodity Exchange of New York moved to decrease speculation by raising the deposit required to buy contracts.
On other markets, gold and soybeans fell. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities fell 0.77 point, to 230.88. 
 The Commodity Exchange increased by sevenfold in two days the amount speculators and commercial copper traders must deposit with their brokers. It took the action hoping to slow the price rise in copper for September delivery. The September contract had risen 6.7 percent since Sept. 13 as plunging inventories forced copper consumers to buy contracts that would deliver copper quickly.
Yet even with the higher deposits prices held steady. The September copper contract fell 0.80 cent, to $1.235 a pound, down from Monday's four-year high of $1.278. Most traders agreed to pay the higher deposits, also known as margins, to secure adequate supplies, analysts said.
"The fact that so many people stayed around meant they had to stay around," said Richard Hirsch, vice president with Deutsche Bank's Sharps Pixley unit in New York. "This is real demand, real consumption. They're not just putting it on the shelf somewhere."
Gold dropped below $400 an ounce as a rise in the United States dollar made the metal more expensive for foreign investors and raised confidence that inflation was not damaging the economy.
On Tuesday, gold prices settled above $400 an ounce for the first time since August 1993 after the Federal Reserve left interest rates intact. Traders were concerned that a growing United States economy would speed inflation without higher interest rates. A higher dollar eased some of those concerns yesterday.
December gold fell $3.50, to $397.90 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange. December silver lost 11 cents, to $5.65 an ounce.
Soybeans fell to their lowest price in almost two years as drier weather allowed a speedy harvest after last week's rain. November soybeans fell 5.75 cents, to $5.485 a bushel, at the Chicago Board of Trade.

Short-Coverings Spur Rise in Treasury Issues

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday, sparked by short-coverings as the dollar strengthened and gold weakened. The rally weathered a strong economic report, helped by talk of some progress in the Japan-United States trade negotiations and a better-than-expected five-year note auction.
The 30-year bond rose 10/32 , to a price of 9613/32 , for a yield of 7.81 percent, down from 7.84 percent. Shorter bill rates were down as well, as demand eased toward the end of the quarter. 
 Kevin McClintock, head of fixed- income investments for Aeltus Investment Management Inc., said the market's performance was much better than he would have expected.
The Commerce Department's durable goods report for August, he said, was largely sloughed off by the market, even though the 6 percent gain was much greater than the expectations of a 3.9 percent rise. However, many traders considered it together with the July decline of 4 percent decline. "My read is that it is further evidence of strong momentum in the economy," Mr. McClintock said. "It's much like a stagecoach that tends to gain momentum and feed on itself if left unrestrained. The Fed in my view has not been overly restrictive. They've picked up the reins and snugged backed some, but have not yanked back. But until they yank back, the coach will gain momentum."
Mr. McClintock predicts the next rate rise will most likely be 50 basis points, as were the last two. "If you ask me if that will be enough, I'd have to say I don't think so," he said. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
"The rate direction bias is upward over the next couple of months," Mr. McClintock continued, "and another Fed tightening is highly likely. A modest Fed tightening is not necessarily good for the bond market, it is the last tightening that it gets that is good for bonds."
Employment, price and industrial reports for September will be released in the next two weeks, giving the Fed additional data to consider.
Traders said Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen in a news conference yesterday before his trip to Madrid added to the positive tone of the market, making some cautious upbeat comments about the dollar and the United States-Japan trade negotiations. He said that a strong dollar was important for the economy and that any trade sanctions against Japan would be narrowly devised rather than broad-based. Analysts thought those comments were consistent with expectations among most market participants that some form of limited progess would emerge from the current trade talks.
Many in the market predicted the Treasury's $11 billion auction of five-year notes would be a much tougher sale since many investors have been reluctant to buy longer maturities in a bear-market environment. But Tuesday's $17.25 billion two-year sale also drew less demand than expected because of the uncertainty about a possible rate rise.
While the Fed's Open Market Committee did not change its policy on Tuesday, market speculation puts the next likely date for tightening as the Nov. 15 F.O.M.C. meeting. Strong data like the durable goods report today, some traders said, add to the risk of tightening.
The 50-basis-point move on Aug. 16, bought the Fed some time to assess the impacts of the five actions to date. But if the economy shows signs that inflationary pressures have not been kept in check, the Fed will have to move quickly to keep its credibility as an inflation fighter intact.
Mr. McClintock said there was good institutional and retail interest in the five-year note. Some desks reported that demand from both sides was above the average of the last 12 auctions. The results were better than expected and the market responded with more short-covering going into late afternoon. The bill sector also enjoyed strong bidding, especially the three-month maturity. The three-month rate fell 21 basis points, to 4.50 percent, from 4.71 percent the previous day.
Even with a new quarter traders expect demand for bills might not altogether disappear simply because they have a defensive value in a bear market.
The following are the results of the note auction:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Yield . . . 7.18%
Low Yield . . . 7.00%
Median Yield . . . 7.17%

The five-year notes mature on Sept. 30, 1999.

HEADLINE: Durables Orders Post A 6% Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Orders for big-ticket factory goods in August made their largest gains since late 1992 as new-model cars and trucks dominated the Census Bureau's monthly tally, suggesting only a modest slowing of the economy.
Although last month's 6 percent jump followed a 4 percent decline in July, analysts said the economy was proving remarkably resilient in the face of efforts by the Federal Reserve to restrain its growth. 
 "The economy's slowing a little, but perhaps not enough" to avoid further Fed increases in short-term interest rates, said Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, an economist with Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "The slowdown is modest at best."
For now, however, the Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach. On Tuesday, its top policy committee met but announced no change in rates.
While automobile manufacturing was responsible for more than half the rise in August, all major categories of orders for durable goods advanced. This included civilian capital goods other than aircraft, a widely watched gauge of business investment, which climbed 1.5 percent, to a level 20 percent above that of August 1993.
Today's report also showed shipments of durable goods, which range from fax machines to ships, rose 6.1 percent in August while unfilled orders eased three-tenths of 1 percent.
The bond market took the latest figures, which were a bit stronger than most analysts had expected, largely in stride. Prices fell initially, raising interest rates, but soon recovered. [Page D9.]Stock prices also rose today, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing up 15.14 points. [Page D10.]
"The industrial sector is healthy, but not accelerating as the August durables report might suggest," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch & Company. Policy makers are seeking to prevent the economy from overheating, thereby presumably keeping inflation at bay.
On Thursday, the Commerce Department is to publish what is expected to be another small upward revision, to about 4 percent, in its calculation of the economy's growth pace in the second quarter. Last month the estimate was 3.8 percent.
The 6 percent climb in orders last month, to $154 billion, was the 11th in 13 months and the biggest since December 1992, the bureau noted.
This summer's statistical gyrations in the automotive industry, analysts said, were probably magnified by the lag in conforming seasonal adjustments to the relatively new industry practice of shutting plants down for two weeks in July for retooling and vacation. Previously, the closings were spread over a longer period that extended into August.
Orders for cars and other transportation equipment soared 19.1 percent for the month, far surpassing the gains of 4.8 percent for primary metals, 4 percent for industrial machinery and equipment, and 1.2 percent for electronic and other electrical equipment.
For capital goods, like engines and communications equipment, the overall rise was 3.7 percent, with military orders up 7.9 percent following a 21.4 percent drop in July, and civilian orders including aircraft up 3 percent.
Not surprisingly, the rise in shipments paralleled orders for durable goods, because the Government regards new orders and shipments for automotive assembly as identical. The 6.1 percent rise in shipments was the fifth increase this year and the biggest since August 1989.
Although backlogs of unfilled orders eased a bit over all, when military and civilian aircraft are excluded, backlogs have been soaring for more than a year, said Ed Yardeni, economist at C. J. Lawrence/Deutsche Bank Securities.

Race and gender data for small-business loans break new ground.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
ANOTHER shoe dropped in President Clinton's campaign to stamp out lending discrimination against poor neighborhoods and minorities, as Federal regulators proposed standards this week for what banks must do to meet obligations that have been law for nearly two decades. But that is hardly the end of the tale. For the proposal breaks new ground in one area -- race and gender discrimination in small-business loans -- that many economists and some regulators think would better be left untouched.
Indeed, Lawrence B. Lindsey, the Federal Reserve governor who helped negotiate the new rules, is in rebellion. "A change in policy of this magnitude is best left to Congress, not to a small coterie of regulators," he said in a statement. 
 In 1974 Congress passed the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which barred discrimination in lending by race, religion and gender. Three years later it added the Community Reinvestment Act, an equally uncontroversial piece of legislation at the time, but a horse of an entirely different color.
In sweeping (if unspecific) language the Community Reinvestment Act required banks to lend within their own communities, an idea that strikes almost everyone other than economists as a matter of equity and common sense. Many of the latter -- among them, Lawrence White of New York University's Stern School of Business -- say banks' real job is funneling capital to its most productive use, whether that happens to be in the next block or the next state.
"Bankers ought to be doing their best for shareholders and depositors," Mr. White argued; if that means the savings of Brooklynites end up in Silicon Valley, so be it. If government wishes to solve social problems with investments, he said, it ought to be up front about bearing the risk.
No one quite knew what was required to meet the act's standards, and the regulators were not much help. Typically, when a bank had a request for a new branch or a merger pending, it would produce a flurry of activity to show that it was community-minded -- much the way television stations show "Buckle Up for Safety" ads when their licenses are up for renewal.
Interestingly, though, Mr. Lindsey, who might best be classified a soft-nosed conservative, thinks the act did little harm and some good. The unmeasurable threat from the regulators, he suggests, served as a check on lenders who would otherwise have been too stodgy or myopic to seek profits in low-income neighborhoods. But neither banks nor community groups were happy with this nonpolicy. And after President Clinton was elected, he vowed to put teeth into the law.
The initial idea was to set specific targets for low-income neighborhood lending. But when push came to shove, the regulators could not come up with a test that could be broadly applied. So they settled for something more than the current policy of muddling through and something less than the President apparently wanted.
The proposed rules fill 100 double-spaced pages. The essence, though, is straightforward: more focus on actual loan performance in low- income areas, less on kaffeeklatsches with community groups. Regulators will retain great discretion in assaying compliance, but they will be under pressure to back their decisions with statistics. And while nobody is dancing in the aisles, the public response has largely been positive.
The same cannot be said, however, for the new data collection requirements on small-business loans, the portion of the new regulations pressed by the Comptroller of the Currency -- which by no coincidence happens to be the bank regulatory agency most closely tied to the White House. Under the proposal, businesses whose stock is not publicly held will be asked to identify the race and gender, by percentage, of their owners.
One problem here, Mr. Lindsey notes, is that the Community Reinvestment Act is supposed to be about geography, not race or gender. Another is that categorization raises practical problems. Is a business owned by a Japanese national a minority? The rule says yes. Is a minority business that is 40 percent black and 60 percent white a minority business? The rule says no.
But the deeper issue, Mr. Lindsey argues, is whether it makes social, economic or political sense to identify businesses as having races and genders. Such classifications are, on their face, offensive to many Americans. And the numbers, he believes, have little potential for providing insight into discrimination, since the criteria for judging the creditworthiness of businesses are far less quantifiable than, say, car loans.
The real mystery, perhaps, is why the data question was tossed into the rule-making. For while there is no evidence that President Clinton favors race or gender quotas in private lending, he is opening himself to the charge. And unlike most of the scars President Clinton bears from playing two years of Washington hardball, this one would be self-inflicted.

House Subcommittee Passes Altered Antitrust Bill

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
Efforts to end the labor dispute that has wiped out the World Series for the first time in 90 years moved further on Capitol Hill today than they have in months of negotiations between owners and players. But a House of Representatives subcommittee that approved a bill dealing with baseball's antitrust exemption and its labor problems altered the bill just enough to raise questions about its effectiveness.
The subcommittee on economic and commercial law, in an overwhelming voice vote, sent to the House Judiciary Committee a bill that would make unilaterally imposed rules, such as the owners' salary cap proposal, subject to antitrust laws. Baseball has been exempt from antitrust laws in all matters since a 1922 United States Supreme Court decision. The partial removal of the exemption would enable the players to challenge a salary cap in court if the owners decided to impose it during the off season. 
 "It's not surprising," Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, said by telephone from Milwaukee. "Jack Brooks said he was going to do this so nothing about it is surprising."
Brooks, a Texas Democrat, is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which is expected to approve the bill today. It was introduced by Mike Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma.
"It's got momentum going now," Synar said. "I have little doubt we will have an overwhelming vote tomorrow. We're putting both sides on notice that Congress will no longer remain silent on the issue."
But before sending it on, the subcommittee amended the bill, eliminating the provision that said if the players union went to court to block a unilaterally imposed salary cap, the cap would be stayed automatically until a decision was rendered.
Donald Fehr, the head of the union, had said he would recommend the players end their strike and return to work if the bill were passed as originally written with the stay provision. After hearing about today's development, he said the bill "could still be a positive step," but he said he didn't know if he could make the same recommendation.
Nevertheless, he said by telephone from Phoenix, where he held a regional players meeting, "I treat it as very encouraging, especially because there was only one dissent."
Hamilton Fish Jr., Republican of New York, voiced the lone "nay" on the bill.
Synar said if the House didn't act on the bill by the end of this session, which very likely will be next week, he would expect it to be one of the first items on the agenda in February or March. Synar himself, though, will not be around to vote for his own bill. He lost his primary race.
The development, however, offered encouragement to authors of a similar bill in the Senate, Howard Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, and Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah.
Metzenbaum said he would try to attach a floor amendment with similar implications to a District of Columbia appropriations bill set for debate on the Senate floor Thursday, although an aide said he may wait.
"It may be better to wait until they get their bill out of committee," the aide said. "They've got a little momentum going. We may go tomorrow afternoon; we may wait a little longer. We didn't want to rush it. And we may just go ahead and use their language."

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN 

 BODY:
Former President GEORGE BUSH and his wife, BARBARA, have a new neighbor in Houston with whom they can talk politics -- if they want to. Secretary of the Treasury LLOYD M. BENTSEN bought a six-bedroom, six-bathroom town house in the Tanglewood district earlier this month from Joseph D. Jamail, according to the deed filed with the Harris County Appraisal District.
The purchase price was not disclosed. The secretary paid "considerably more than $500,000," Howard M. Schloss, a spokesman for Mr. Bentsen, said yesterday. 
 Mr. Bentsen's three grown children, two sons and a daughter, live in Houston, and he wanted a house in a city of his home state that could be reached by a nonstop flight from Washington, Mr. Schloss said. Mr. Bentsen, 73, who made a fortune in insurance and savings and loan associations before running for the Senate in 1970, also has a town house in Washington and a vacation house in Southern California.
His newest acquisition has fueled persistent rumors in Washington that he is planning to retire in the near future.
Mr. Bentsen downplayed the speculation, saying through his spokesman: "It's a great time to be Secretary of the Treasury. I couldn't have written better economic numbers myself."
Then he added, "If you keep asking me often enough, eventually you'll be right."

HEADLINE: Trade Bill Sabotage

 BODY:
Ernest Hollings, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, declared yesterday that he will keep the Senate from voting this session on the trade accord that the Clinton Administration signed with more than 100 other countries last April in Marrakesh, Morocco. This is a craven and destructive bow to the demands of textile firms in his home state of South Carolina, who fear competition from abroad under the accord. If Mr. Hollings is successful, as he well might be, he would thereby delay and possibly block for good approval of a bill that would add $200 billion a year to the U.S. economy.
Mr. Hollings is the main culprit, but the White House was his enabler. It dallied in getting the legislation to Congress. Then it rejected advice to sidestep Mr. Hollings's committee. The danger is that the Senate vote could be delayed until next year, or longer. Delay, in turn, could jeopardize approval here and abroad. 
 The legislative rules that govern the trade accord are known as fast track -- which requires Congress to vote quickly and without amendment. Under the rules, Mr. Hollings's committee has 45 days to deliberate before sending the bill to the floor. But the 45-day period did not begin until Tuesday, when the Administration delivered its bill to Congress, and Congress is scheduled to break for the election campaign in nine days.
The Administration took months to settle upon ways to pay for the bill; it spent precious weeks fighting, unsuccessfully, for a provision to apply fast track to future trade deals. By the time the trade bill arrived at Mr. Hollings's door, he could put off a vote past the end of the session -- in effect nullifying fast track.
Even as late as Tuesday, however, the Administration could have run around Mr. Hollings by removing two nonessential provisions from its bill, thereby denying the commerce committee jurisdiction. But the Administration was not certain the strategy would work and it feared alienating the powerful chairman. With the benefit of hindsight, the White House seems to have erred.
If the trade bill is put off until next year, it might not qualify for fast-track status because the statute expires at the end of the year. That would open up the bill to deal-breaking amendments and parliamentary delay. The loss would be large. For 50 years, the U.S. has led its partners through successful rounds of open trade accords, each one giving a powerful boost to the world economy. The Marrakesh accord would add trillions to world production by dismantling barriers to trade and investment.
The Administration has possible ways, none good, to get the trade bill back on track. It could pressure Mr. Hollings, but that is likely to fail. It could try a quick parliamentary maneuver to grab the bill away from the commerce committee, but the tactic is legally suspect and perhaps politically unrealistic. The fallback tactic, mentioned yesterday by the President, is to keep the Senate in session, at least officially, through elections so that the 45 days elapse and the Senate is forced to vote after elections. This strategy seems feasible, but it would also be ugly -- visibly displaying the Administration's inability to push high-priority bills through a Democrat-controlled Congress just as voters prepare to cast their ballots.
This has been a brutal week for Mr. Clinton. The Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, buried health care reform, blaming obstructionist Republicans. Now, a fellow Democrat knocks down the Administration's second most important initiative, free trade. The Administration unwittingly aided and abetted. But Mr. Hollings has single-handedly jeopardized the economic fortunes of the world for some short-lived, parochial interests.

Fire the Messengers

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
When a President speaks out of both sides of his mouth with the whole country watching, no press secretary's spin can save him. So it's hardly Dee Dee Myers's fault that even some of Bill Clinton's loyal partisans use phrases like "the last straw" to characterize the President's shotgun marriage to the Haiti strongmen formerly known as thugs. The televised images of the thugs' thugs wielding crowbars in Port-au-Prince may overpower any words emanating from the White House for some time to come.
Just the same, who can doubt that Mr. Clinton has the worst public relations of anyone in politics, Dan Quayle included? The President has done more than a few things right, but such is his low estate that even the foolproof tonic of a growing economy won't lift his poll numbers. When Mr. Clinton isn't busy being his own worst enemy, sending forth mixed messages about Haiti or his numerical definition of universal health care, his inept messengers work overtime seeing to it that the good news is garbled as well. 
 This is why Mr. Clinton was right to give Leon Panetta the authority to overhaul the White House staff. But instead of ratifying Mr. Panetta's overdue personnel shuffle, Mr. Clinton botched it -- so much so that he turned poor Ms. Myers into the human correlative of his Haiti policy.
The pattern of the two flip-flops was identical. The White House signaled Ms. Myers's exile in advance as clearly as it had Gen. Raoul Cedras's. At the last minute, Mr. Clinton was persuaded in an end-run -- Ms. Myers usurping Mr. Panetta as Jimmy Carter had Warren Christopher -- to reverse course: Ms. Myers stayed put, as the general did, receiving new respect and, in her case, a promotion. (And even this resolution is provisional, since the White House let it be known that Ms. Myers, unlike the general, will definitely flee by New Year's.)
What prompted the abrupt reprieve was Mr. Clinton's fear that Ms. Myers's departure would look bad for a White House that treats her and other women as second-class citizens. But the President's inability to allow women to flourish in top White House jobs, however lamentable, is irrelevant to the crisis in communications at hand.
Administration achievements now happen largely in obscurity (the May signing of the education bill) while its most inept p.r. schemes (the hapless health care bus caravan) unravel in prime time. In my experience, even simple requests for information are beyond the press office's competence. Why promote a key player in this mess just long enough to do more damage during the high-stakes election season?
Surely the transparent tokenism of Ms. Myers's temporary reprieve will fail to preserve the Administration's waning feminist reputation, any more than the don't-ask-don't-tell compromise placated those who thought Mr. Clinton sold out gays in the military. What the reversal on Ms. Myers has mainly accomplished, besides reinforcing the President's image as a waffler, is to destroy the credibility of the latest White House savior, Mr. Panetta.
The previous savior was David Gergen, engineer of the last press-office upheaval. Mr. Gergen's legacy as a communications guru was summed up in a valedictory interview with Ted Koppel last Friday.
From his perch in the State Department, Mr. Gergen deftly slipped a new knife into whatever remains of Warren Christopher's back by noting that the Secretary had to tear himself away from an Embassy party as the apparently unanticipated Port-au-Prince beatings surfaced on TV. (At least Mr. Christopher, who had attended "Quiz Show" during the Carter-Cedras negotiations, didn't have to be tracked down at "Natural Born Killers.") As for Ms. Myers, Mr. Gergen oozed, "Everybody cares about Dee Dee, everybody loves Dee Dee," in a tone that couldn't have been more patronizing.
The message the departing Mr. Gergen sent was that of an out-to-lunch Administration buffeted by events rather than in charge of them, and of a White House in which every man (and I do mean man) is out for himself.
When the news is this bad, must the Administration always be the first to spread the word?

HEADLINE: If Schools Fail, Don't Blame Disabled Students

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A Sept. 23 news article reports that the Committee for Economic Development, a leading business organization, has determined that public schools are failing to produce graduates who are ready for work in today's businesses. The committee placed part of the blame for this on "inclusion," the practice of educating students with disabilities within regular classrooms. 
 We all agree that many public schools in this country have failed to prepare students adequately for employment. A great number of those schools are in our cities.
But to blame the practice of teaching students with disabilities in regular classrooms doesn't wash. Very few schools in our cities practice inclusion; even fewer did so when the study supporting this report was undertaken. Outside the cities, inclusion is not widely available. Therefore, there is little evidence that inclusion limits the ability of schools to prepare students for work.
Indeed, now that inclusion is becoming more widely available, there is growing evidence that it contributes to learning and preparation for work, for all students. With inclusion, the aids and supports that the student with disabilities is entitled to under law are brought into the classroom to support that student. Those aids, for which substantial Federal funds are available, have a spillover effect for the other students.
Schools that poorly manage most activities poorly manage the education of students with disabilities. They either waste the Federal funds on maintaining separate special education buildings and large bureaucracies, or they "dump" students with disabilities into regular classes without the mandated supports.
Big-city schools have additional problems that spill in from the streets. And teachers' unions, whose priorities are minimizing the time teachers spend teaching, maximizing pay and resisting the demise of special education bureaucracies, have not been helpful in this regard.
The solution to the problem raised by the committee's report is not to pick on those students least able to defend themselves, but to reform the schools, scale down bureaucracies, involve parents and provide for an appropriate level of resources for all students.

HEADLINE: Jeans Makers Flourish on Border

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: EL PASO

 BODY:
Here on the Mexican border, in the world's jeans-making capital, as many workers are cutting and sewing and stone-washing as ever.
In an industry that is among the most vulnerable to Mexican competition, a combination of corporate efficiency, low wages and the prestige of a "Made in the U.S.A." jeans label help explain why apparel employment here has reached a record 20,500 jobs. But they also explain why El Paso is the country's poorest large metropolitan area, with personal incomes only 59 percent of the nation's average. 
 It was not supposed to happen this way. Even the strongest proponents of the North American Free Trade Agreement conceded that the pact would cost 10,000 or more full-time apparel jobs a year in the United States.
But on the outskirts of this city, the VF Corporation opened a new Wrangler sewing plant and distribution center at the beginning of the year, expanding its work force here by 450 jobs.
Skilled sewing machine operators at the bright, air-conditioned building earn $8.50 an hour with full benefits. Many less-skilled workers have been replaced by conveyor belts, computers and machines.
The company considered moving more of its operations to Mexico, where it has been making jeans for discount chains, but decided against it. " 'Made in the U.S.A.' does count for something," said Joe Maxey, the division manager of Wrangler here.
El Paso's apparel revival has a second aspect, however, which is visible off a back alley near downtown. Behind a door left ajar lies the narrow, windowless cinderblock work space of 3NH Fashions. There, 14 workers hunch over sewing machines whose black enamel has been chipped and worn away from decades of use. They earn the $4.25-an- hour minimum wage and minimal benefits, plus a piece rate for those who can keep their bobbins whirring the fastest.
It could be worse, said Jose Armendariz, looking up from the pile of denim skirts he was stitching. A previous employer shut down with no notice, leaving him without two weeks' back pay.
For many local leaders, the apparel industry seems as constraining to economic growth as a new pair of jeans two sizes too small. Besides the low pay, jeans makers drain endless water from a near-desert. The local government has responded with a retraining program to turn El Paso into a center for plastic-injection molding, where workers start at $6 to $8 an hour and can earn $14 or more.
"If a person enters the apparel industry making $4.25 an hour,' said Terry J. Squier, director of the Advanced Technology Center at El Paso Community College, "I don't want to see them stay there.'
It was cheap labor and rising demand in the Southwest that began bringing jeans makers to El Paso in the 1960's. Since then, automation, a nimble fashion sense and global demand for an American label on this most American garment have raised El Paso's output to more than 100 million pairs of jeans a year.
Nationally, however, apparel employment continues to shrink, from an annual average of 1,075,700 in 1989 to an estimated 959,500 this August.
By the late 1980's, the VF Corporation, based in Wyomissing, Pa., was down to 800 workers in El Paso, but since then the local payroll has tripled. Mr. Maxey is as intent on updating the business's reputation as its factories.
"What has always bothered me is the sweatshop image,' he said. At Wrangler, sweat has given way to microchips and steel, with labor now accounting for only 20 percent of production costs.
At the plant, computer-guided slings hanging from overhead rails dump 144 pairs of jeans at a time into truck-sized washers and dryers. Tanks, pumps and pipes automatically feed in the right mix of chemicals for the specified finish.
Sewers and pressers have their place, but they seem shunted to the side of a seven-acre complex, which includes a warehouse that looks ready to run itself. Retailers' sales go by satellite from the stores to Wrangler's headquarters in Greenboro, N.C., where computers then supply a seasonally adjusted forecast of sales. Restocking signals bounce from there to the El Paso warehouse, where conveyor belts and electronic eyes do much of the sorting and carrying.
Even out of the earshot of their managers, workers appear to have few complaints. For Cesar Quinonez, $6.80 an hour to sort jeans was not a bad switch a year ago from parking cars at a restaurant across the border in Juarez for $150 a week, a generous paycheck there.
Wrangler jeans top out at $35, but those made at smaller, far more primitive shops paying lower wages often cost much more when they carry designer labels.
One of the three owners of 3NH Fashions, Pablo Puentes, said his company had worked for Calvin Klein and Guess, among others. Bundles of denim pieces crowding his office were waiting to be stitched into jackets, skirts and pants more redolent of Seventh Avenue than the Santa Fe Trail.
Outsiders driving past the convenience stores and repair garages of his factory's South Side neighborhood, bounded by railroad yards and highway ramps, might not realize they were in the middle of a garment district.
Small contractors -- known locally as talleres de hambre, or workshops of hunger -- still account for a third to a half of El Paso's apparel jobs. Statistics are few, but street talk suggests that lower apparel tariffs under the trade agreement are squeezing the smaller makers most of all because they are competing on labor costs.
At the offices of La Mujer Obrera, which means "the working woman,' the message is succinct: "Halt the exportation of jobs and unemployment!' says a banner, in Spanish, showing a pair of scissors stitched from silvery fabric.
From a garment district storefront, La Mujer Obrera teaches workers about their rights, arranges medical treatment and sues employers for back pay. "Immigrants themselves usually don't complain," said Maria Flores, the group's education coordinator. She lost her own garment job in 1989 after she tore some shoulder tendons.
Besides shorting their workers, some small contractors also try to avoid paying the Internal Revenue Service, La Mujer Obrera organizers say. When the I.R.S. shuts them down, they open up nearby under different company names, sometimes with a relative nominally in charge, the group says.
The Department of Labor is holding garment makers responsible for tens, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars if their contractors fail to provide minimum wages, overtime or, after a shutdown, back pay.
Mr. Puentes readily confirms that smaller shops like his have thin cash cushions. He wants to install modern cooling and a second bathroom for his workers, but added that he was also saving for a few more used sewing machines.
His workers attested to his consistency in paying them but not his concern for comfort. "Pablo won't buy air-conditioning," said Mr. Armendariz, almost loudly enough for the boss to hear.
Mr. Puentes said that small garment makers often go out of business because fashion houses are so slow to send checks. "They squeeze us on the prices, and then they don't pay,' he said.
His costs are low enough and his response to fashion dictates quick enough to keep clients from shifting work to Mexico.
For its future, El Paso would rather take a technological jump ahead of the Mexican labor force. Mr. Squier, who runs the community college training center, said his program had helped attract 29 plastic-injection molding companies to El Paso since the late 1980's.
Now, the area has more than 2,000 workers making a variety of products, like seat-belt components, toys, vacuum-cleaner cases and electrical connectors. Most of these items feed the maquiladora assembly plants owned by American companies just across the Rio Grande.
In a classroom at the training center, under a sign saying "Plastics spoken here," about 16 students were learning enough about electronics, hydraulics, pneumatics and plant organization to be turned loose in what amounts to a practice factory next door.
"It's not something where you just flip a switch and the part comes out," Mr. Squier said.
El Paso's apparel industry is unlikely to expand much further, Mr. Squier said. But injection-molding specialists can always find work, especially those with the skills to make tools and dies, including the metal forms used to mold plastics. Here they can earn more than $40,000 a year.
"Tool and die mold-making isn't a blue-collar career," he said. "It's a gold-collar career. If we brought in a plane with 79 tool and die makers, they would be working here tonight."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 1, 1994, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Thursday about a boom in the jeans-making industry in El Paso referred imprecisely to the number of jobs in the United States that some proponents of the North American Free Trade Agreement said would be lost to Mexico each year. About 10,000 jobs would be lost over all, they said, not just in the apparel industry.

HEADLINE: New Signs of Growth Fan Inflation Fears

 BODY:
The economy showed signs of persistent vigor in Government reports on housing and employment. And the Commerce Department released a revised report on the gross domestic product, showing the economy expanding at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the second quarter, up from an estimate of 3.8 percent.
Taken together, the reports fanned fears that overly rapid growth could revive inflation, and could lead the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates again, perhaps after next week's monthly job report for September, to slow the economy down. 
 Unnerved by the combined force of the data, investors drove interest rates higher and stock prices lower in markets in the United States and in Europe.

HEADLINE: Town 'Devastated' by Loss of Project

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HAYMARKET, Va., Sept. 29

 BODY:
When Mayor Jack R. Kapp reached City Hall this morning, he found the flag at half-staff for the first time since Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis died. He knew many residents of his town were angered and disappointed that the Walt Disney Company had scrapped plans to build a theme park five miles away. But lowering the flag, he decided, was an inappropriate response. So he raised it.
Two hours later, he found it down again. 
 "People around here are devastated," Mr. Kapp said shortly after a post-mortem lunch today with Disney officials. "It's an economic blow to Prince William County. I feel like I've been to a funeral today."
While environmentalists, Civil War historians and citizen groups opposed to the $650 million theme park celebrated Disney's decision to seek another site, many other Virginians bemoaned the economic losses for the region and the potential losses to the state if Disney were to build the park elsewhere.
Before the company selected the site near Haymarket, a town of 500 people about 35 miles west of Washington, the company had considered more than two dozen other sites in the region. Within hours of Disney's decision, announced late Wednesday night, business and civic leaders in Maryland, including Gov. William Donald Schaefer, were expressing excitement over the possibility of competing with Virginia for the project, even though Disney officials indicated today that the site would remain in Virginia.
A 3,000-acre theme park, Disney's America, was to be the centerpiece of an extensive project that would have included a hotel, schools, golf courses, office buildings, shops, restaurants and 2,281 residential units. Historians and environmentalists fought the project, saying it would desecrate nearby Civil War battle sites like Bull Run and increase congestion and air pollution.
In a statement issued after Disney's decision to withdraw, Gov. George Allen of Virginia said he remained committed to a Disney theme park in the state, adding, "I'm pleased the Walt Disney Company shares that commitment."
But now, the shape and size -- let alone, the site -- of any subsequent Disney park are uncertain.
Robert T. Skunda, the Virginia Secretary of Commerce and Trade, said the $163 million incentive package to provide new roads to serve the area around the theme park was "site specific" to the development near Haymarket.
Speaking by telephone from Richmond, Mr. Skunda said that it was now his understanding that Disney planned to build only a theme park on a new site. Any new incentives, he added, "are now subject to negotiation and debate."
Christopher Miller of the Piedmont Environmental Council, which led the fight against the Disney project, said his group had identified 30 possible sites for a theme park in Virginia, Maryland and Washington itself that he said were more suitable than the Haymarket area.
By some estimates, Prince William County expected to gain as many as 19,000 jobs. Kathleen Seefeldt, a member of the county Board of Supervisors and a strong supporter of the Disney project, said the county had expected $11 million to $12 million in new revenue the first year of operation, 1998, and more each year after that.
With projections that the development would pump $47 million a year into the state's economy by 2007, Governor Allen became a strong supporter of the Disney project and last year pushed the incentive package through the State General Assembly as an enticement to bring Disney to Virginia. Just last week, Disney vaulted two obstacles, when the Prince William County planning commission approved zoning changes to accommodate the project, and a regional transportation planning board authorized $130 million for road projects to improve access to the site.
With its bedroom communities to Washington, Prince William County has been growing rapidly for years, reaching a current population of about 240,000, up from 150,000 in 1980. Some county officials insisted that other developers would fill the vacuum created by Disney.
But others worried that the staunch opposition mounted against the Disney project here would deter prospective investors.
"I think this will cause people to look at us a little more carefully," said James H. Mullen, the Prince William County Executive. "With the opposition Disney faced able to claim success, thwarting the efforts of a major company like Disney, other developers will be skittish about moving ahead with their plans and proposals for the same area."
Ms. Seefeldt, the leading supporter of the project on the county Board of Supervisors, predicted that "ultimately the right project or projects would create less opposition." But that was a hard sell to Mr. Kapp and others in Haymarket today.
Sitting in the quiet office of "Welcome Disney," an 8,000-member citizens' group organized to blunt the opposition, Ron Hancock, the group's treasurer, pondered a question he never imagined before Wednesday night. "What does this mean to the town?" he asked. "Whew. A lot of lost revenues and new business. People here are so disappointed, considering we were so close to having Disney's America a reality. Then, for this to happen."
Mr. Kapp, who won a second-consecutive two-year term this year after his appointment to office in 1990, said he was especially disappointed because the town will not get a water line Disney promised to provide. Most people in town use well water, he said, and many of the wells are old and rusting. "A number of people are drinking contaminated water," he said. "Now, I don't know how we can help them."
Disney had mounted a huge public relations campaign to overcome the opposition, but to no avail.
In the end, said James M. McPherson, the Princeton University historian who was a leader of efforts to block the project, "Disney recognized what it was costing them in terms of image, public relations and the potential for a long, drawn-out controversy and lawsuits from environmental groups."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Seeks Funds for New Buyout

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani indicated yesterday that he was looking for money to pay for a broad new severance program to cut the city work force, possibly by turning again to the Municipal Assistance Corporation.
Mr. Giuliani said the idea emerged in a meeting earlier this week with Felix G. Rohatyn, the financier and former head of the assistance corporation. During the meeting, Mr. Rohatyn also pushed a much broader, multiyear scheme for the city to further pare its work force, shed some services and reduce taxes to stimulate the economy -- and in return to get an infusion of borrowed cash to help the city recuperate from the cuts. 
 "Essentially it's a way to finance," Mr. Giuliani said yesterday, "with guarantees that one, there would be a reduction in government; two, that there'd be a reduction in taxes so that you could give the business community a sense that the relocation that is going on will lead to a much better picture."
The Mayor's budget director, Abraham M. Lackman, is planning to meet today with officials of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the state agency created during the 1970's fiscal crisis to borrow on the city's behalf.
The Mayor's comments came as his administration continued to look for ways to close a budget gap of up to $1 billion. Mr. Giuliani suggested that in addition to more cuts in city agencies, he was considering ways of "enhancing revenues," though he did not provide details.
The administration also is negotiating with municipal unions to cut the cost of health benefits by $200 million, a proposal included in the Mayor's original budget that the unions have yet to agree to.
"If we can get that, that would take some of the pressure off," the Mayor said.
Mr. Giuliani cautioned that Mr. Rohatyn's ideas were just being explored, and he indicated that most of what he discussed with Mr. Rohatyn involved drawing up a plan for the new budget in January. But the Mayor also said that some of Mr. Rohatyn's ideas might be useful in finding a way to raise money for a new severance package. The administration has already used $200 million in surplus funds controlled by M.A.C. for a round of severance offers that enticed more than 6,000 employees off the payroll.
The broad outlines of Mr. Rohatyn's proposal were broached two years ago during the Dinkins administration, but were abandoned when credit-rating agencies balked at seeing the city or the M.A.C. get $700 million or so deeper in debt with no guarantee that chronic budget deficits would be cured.
But in an interview, Mr. Rohatyn suggested that the proposal may be more palatable now. "They may have a more credible city government to carry it out," he said of the Giuliani administration.
"If a multiyear plan is considered and if it is rational and logical and has elements of certainty built in and guarantees structural balance, then the financing is something that can be worked out," Mr. Rohatyn said.
In an interview, Mr. Rohatyn repeatedly deferred to Eugene J. Keilin, who succeeded him as chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation.
"It's going to get a very serious hearing," Mr. Keilin said, should Mr. Rohatyn's proposal get to the M.A.C. board. "The Mayor, by the actions he's taken in the first nine months, has proven he's dedicated to cutting the budget."
But Richard P. Larkin, the managing director of Standard & Poor's, the credit-rating agency, expressed skepticism.
"My initial reaction to this kind of scheme is still decidedly negative," Mr. Larkin said. "I'm getting concerned that every time something major is suggested for city government restructuring, it always involves someone else's money or borrowing."

HEADLINE: Harry and Louise And a Guy Named Ben

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MALIBU, Calif., Sept. 23

 BODY:
To some liberals, Harry and Louise symbolize everything that went wrong with the great health care struggle of 1994: a powerful advertising campaign, financed by the insurance industry, that played on people's fears and helped derail the process.
That makes the Malibu office of the agency that created Harry and Louise all the more incongruous. In the oceanfront aerie of Goddard-Claussen/First Tuesday, a campaign portrait of Robert F. Kennedy dominates the hallway, and the walls reflect past clients of a decidedly liberal bent, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, former Senator Gary Hart and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. 
 "That doesn't mean I agree with every idea that every Democrat ever proposed," said Ben Goddard, just a trace defensively. "I think the President made a miscalculation on what the American people wanted and tried to do something that was too much too soon."
Mr. Goddard's shop is still in the thick of the health care battle, working to defeat Proposition 186, which would establish a Canadian-style system of taxpayer-financed health insurance in California. Two years ago Goddard-Claussen handled the opposition to another health-related California ballot initiative, which, among other things, would have required employers to contribute to the cost of their workers' insurance (the so-called employer mandate, which caused President Clinton so much trouble).
Bill Zimmerman, a consultant working to pass Proposition 186, said of Mr. Goddard, "Somewhere along the way, he lost his ideological bearings."
The 51-year-old Mr. Goddard, whose official biography notes that he began his communications career as a disk jockey and still considers himself a liberal, offers no apologies. The $15 million Harry and Louise campaign, created for the Health Insurance Association of America, "made a legitimate contribution to this debate," he said. "We dodged a very dangerous, overwhelming proposal that obviously most Americans did not support."
Mr. Goddard said Harry and Louise had their roots in a comment made by Bill Gradison, president of the insurance group, back in 1993: that the health care debate would be decided by couples sitting around their kitchen tables, figuring out how the various proposals would affect them.
That approach was one of several tested. Others included one using celebrities, and more traditional advertisements outlining problems in the health care system. But from the beginning, the couple at the kitchen table "resonated very powerfully with people in focus groups around the country," Mr. Goddard said.
It was not an accident that Louise was so dominant. Mr. Goddard said the intended audience for the commercials was people who not only voted but also closely followed issues and were likely to communicate with Congress.
Within that category, he added, educated women over 30 appeared to be the most vulnerable part of the coalition for the Clinton plan. They were women "who both had the desire to fix the system but also the intelligence to understand that it had to be fixed right or we could end up with unintended consequences that made things worse," he said. "Women like Louise."
Goddard-Claussen has offices in Malibu; Sacramento, Calif.; Boise, Idaho; Washington, and St. Petersburg, Russia. It describes itself as a full-service public relations, public affairs and campaign management firm and specializes in propositions and referendums; it produced television commercials on behalf of President Yeltsin's referendum on Russia's economic and political future in 1993.
These days Mr. Goddard is deep into the California struggle. After the national debate, he says, he finds that people have much more information, and much firmer beliefs, than one would otherwise expect. "It's unusual that you sit in focus groups and hear people use semi-technical terms like mandatory alliances, premium caps and pre-existing conditions," he said.
He worries that the debate in Washington has left another mark on the California electorate. About one in five, he says, were more willing to vote for Proposition 186 if Congress ended up in a deadlock this year -- to "send a message." In other words, he is coping with the fruits of his success.

HEADLINE: Whitman Says Tax Cuts May Require Four Years

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who has gained national prominence for her firm tax-cutting stand, today took a big step away from her often-repeated promise to cut state income taxes by nearly a third over her first three years in office, saying the cuts may take four years to complete.
The statement, made first in a radio call-in show and later repeated to reporters, quickly drew hoots of derision from New Jersey's Democrats. A good deal of Mrs. Whitman's appeal in the governor's race last year came from her dramatic pledge to roll back the state's income taxes within a strict timetable. Mrs. Whitman did not back off the goal of a 30 percent cut in income tax, only on its timing. 
 Although New Jersey's economy is recovering and state tax revenues are strong, a $2.3 billion shortfall was predicted last week by the state Treasury Department for the budget that begins next July. Mrs. Whitman has directed each of the state's departments to anticipate deep cuts in the 1995-96 budget.
The Governor's current budget, with an income tax cut of 10 percent scheduled to go into effect in January, was balanced by laying off several hundred state workers, by freezing state aid to most municipalities and public schools, by postponing the funding of some retirement benefits and by relying on $1.8 billion in one-shot nonrecurring savings.
The toughest budget cutting is yet to come. So far, Mrs. Whitman has reduced income taxes for 1994 by 5 percent, plus the 10 percent scheduled for January. The remaining 15 percent in cuts will have to come from an already severely shrunken revenue pool.
Unless the Governor and her staff neutralize the predictable partisan reaction, the admission that the centerpiece of the Whitman administration is coming unstuck could undermine Mrs. Whitman's image of invincibility and weaken her hand with New Jersey's public employee unions, which will bear much of the burden of the cuts.
"The depths of the state's problems must be sinking in, so the administration responds with a stall," said the Senate's minority leader, John A. Lynch, Democrat of New Brunswick. "This year, they borrowed against the future to balance the books and that's no plan. What's becoming more and more obvious is that the administration still doesn't have a clue about a fiscal plan."
Mrs. Whitman's tax pledge was widely dismissed as not doable by the Democrats when she first made it during her campaign last fall, but their attacks were deflected by her unshakeable commitment to the plan.
Appearing on the radio station 101.5 FM in Trenton, the Governor was asked, in light of the looming revenue shortfall for the next fiscal year, whether her vow to cut income taxes for most taxpayers by 30 percent over three years was still on track.
"Well, when I made the announcement, I said 30 percent in three years is what we outlined," Mrs. Whitman said, adding that half the goal, 15 percent, has already been enacted.
"The real question that comes," she continued, "and in all honesty we've got to look at it, will we make it in the three years or will it take four to reach the 30 percent?"
Afterward, her staff insisted that Mrs. Whitman has always left the door open to stretching out the cut, which would reduce the state's income tax by a total of $1.4 billion.
"From the moment she became Governor, she's said it might take her full first term," her spokesman, Carl Golden, told reporters this afternoon.
But the Democrats would give no quarter, and they promptly rolled out copies of the Governor's unambiguous pledge to make the cuts in three years.
The timing of today's admission that the Republican Governor's bold tax initiative may take a year longer than promised comes on top of the release yesterday of a very similar tax cut package from George L. Pataki, the Republican candidate for governor of New York.
Throughout his campaign, Mr. Pataki has cited Mrs. Whitman's unshakeable promise to cut taxes to quell the skeptics of his own tax cut promise in New York. Governor Whitman, who was elected last year on the strength of her tax cut promise, has made several campaign trips to New York in support of Mr. Pataki.
Mr. Pataki's plan calls for reducing income taxes by 25 percent over four years.
Mrs. Whitman, after all but conceding that she would need more time to make her cuts, said that the nearly $650 million scheduled to be cut this year and next has already produced an upturn in New Jersey's economy.
"I am committed to the 30 percent precisely because of the impact it has had on New Jersey thus far," she told the radio audience. "We are creating jobs at a record number. We are 50 percent better off than we were at the same period last year."
Joseph V. Doria Jr., the Assembly minority leader, said in a statement, "Governor Whitman's credibility gap is widening, and this won't help her with the other Republican politicians who she has been frequently traveling out of state to campaign for."

HEADLINE: BIG PUSH ON TRADE: REASSURING THE MARKETS;
Tokyo Sanctions Likely; Officials Chat Up Dollar

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
With prospects of a trade agreement with Japan highly uncertain before Friday's midnight deadline, top American officials have been trying to persuade currency traders that if Washington imposes limited sanctions on Tokyo, it need not lead to a plunge in the dollar nor to instability in financial markets.
Such sanctions seemed increasingly likely in the wake of a meeting at the White House today between President Clinton and his senior trade and economic advisers. The President made clear that he was ready for a "get tough" policy, if the Japanese did not agree to American demands to open key sectors of their markets before the deadline of midnight Friday, aides said. 
 But fearful that any sanctions would lead traders to sell dollars and buy yen -- as they did when American-Japanese trade talks collapsed in February -- the Administration took the unusual step of sending several top economic officials to Wall Street to speak with big currency traders and hedge fund managers, who often set market trends.
Traders said several senior Treasury officials and representatives of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had sought in the last few weeks to assure them that if the Administration did impose sanctions on Japan for not opening certain markets, those sanctions would be limited, focused measures. Any sanctions that are imposed would not threaten the overall economic relationship between the two countries, and therefore would not justify sudden, major currency movements, the traders say they were told.
The traders, who asked not to be identified, said they welcomed the contacts because in February they did not have a clear sense of where the Administration was heading. Likewise, they say, the Administration did not have a clear sense of where the big money managers and hedge funds that dominate the global financial markets were heading.
As a result, both the bond markets and the dollar plunged steeply after the trade talks broke down.
"Last February the Clinton people did not understand that they were going to get hit in the head if the Japan talks collapsed," one leading currency trader said, "and we didn't know that they didn't know how we were going to react. Now they have opened lines of communication."
The move is interesting because it underscores the degree to which the balance of power between markets and governments has increasingly tilted in favor of the markets.
In February, the Clinton Administration fell into the trap of being smarter than the market -- that is, the Administration knew what it was doing and was certain that any rational economic actor would understand what it was doing and therefore would not try to sell dollars in the belief that the Administration wanted a weaker currency to deal with Japan's $60 billion trade surplus.
But driven by their own logic, intuitions and investment positions, traders sold dollars against the yen, regardless of whether it seemed economically rational to Washington.
This current round of talks still seems headed for an ambiguous ending -- with some limited agreements in areas, like opening the Japanese insurance market, along with some limited sanctions because Japan did not open markets in autos or glass. Japan's Foreign Minister, Yohei Kono, and Trade Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, were scheduled to arrive in Washington on Friday for one last attempt to reach agreement.
Administration officials said they believed that they could get away with imposing targeted sanctions on Japan, without disrupting global financial markets and putting the dollar on the skids, provided they made clear that the overall economic and political relationship with Tokyo remained sound.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen seemed to be trying to prepare the financial markets for such a move during his news conference on Wednesday. "I think there's a redoubling of efforts on both sides in trying to work out some of the differences insofar as our trade concerns with Japan," he said. "If sanctions are imposed, I would expect them to be with great specificity and go to some of the more egregious areas. I would not expect some overall, broad-based sanctions."
Just in case the markets didn't get it, Mr. Bentsen added: "I want to emphasize the point -- I don't see broad-based sanctions."
Any sanctions would probably involve slapping punitive tariffs on certain Japanese exports to the United States under the Title VII and Super 301 provisions of the Trade Act. Mr. Bentsen's efforts to persuade the markets that such limited sanctions on Japan would not upset the overall economic relationship enough to justify a big currency swing seem to have gotten through.
"My view is that their analysis is right," said Richard Witten, top currency trader for Goldman, Sachs & Company. "The dollar-yen relationship has not moved more than one percentage point for sometime now, and that is almost unprecedented. The big betting all over the world is that the two big guys will find a way to deal with this situation in a face-saving way, not a world-ending way. The details of how they do it almost don't matter. I think most people are basically neutral on the dollar-yen rate. No one seems to have bet big money on a big move."
Anything short of a collapse of the trade talks should, if anything, give the dollar a slight lift, other traders say. Their reasoning is that Japanese market participants and financial institutions will be so relieved that a crisis has been averted that they will be ready to take off some of their hedges and start buying dollars and American debt securities again.

HEADLINE: U.S. and North Korea Announce Pause in Talks, but No Progress

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Announcing a brief suspension of its high-level talks with North Korea after a week of hard bargaining, the United States said tonight that the two sides had made no progress toward carrying out last month's agreement to settle their nuclear dispute.
But the chief American delegate, Robert L. Gallucci, refused to describe the negotiations as deadlocked. He said he would fly to Washington on Friday for consultations and return to Geneva next Wednesday to resume his meetings with North Korea's Deputy Foreign Minister, Kang Sok Ju. 
 "I cannot report that we have made substantive progress in terms of resolving any of the important and complicated issues that divide us," he said of the latest round of talks. "But I think there is interest in both sides in pursuing the discussions."
The somber mood of this week's talks nonetheless contrasted with the optimism raised by last month's framework agreement under which North Korea said it would freeze its nuclear program and implicitly renounced the possibility of building nuclear weapons.
In exchange, the United States said it would help provide North Korea with new light water nuclear reactors to replace existing and planned graphite reactors that yield high levels of weapons-grade plutonium. Washington also opened the door to diplomatic relations and new economic and trade links.
Since then, however, Pyongyang has raised new demands. Specifically, it has asked for $2 billion in compensation and has rejected an American plan under which South Korea would play a central role in financing and constructing the new light water reactors.
North Korea has also rejected renewed demands from the International Atomic Energy Agency that it open all its military installations to international inspection. The United States has said it is willing to be flexible about the timing of these so-called "special inspections," but that they would have to form part of any final settlement.
United States officials said the demand for compensation, the rejection of a South Korean role and the refusal to accept the inspections were preventing further moves to carry out last month's accord.

HEADLINE: BIG PUSH ON TRADE: LINING UP THE VOTES;
Senators Plan Return for Vote On Trade Pact, After Elections

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Democratic senators made plans today to vote on a global trade agreement in a lame-duck session the week after Thanksgiving.
Leaders from both parties said they were sure that when the measure was voted on, it would be approved. But they cautioned that the rules of the Senate were arcane and the opportunities for delay so prevalent that no one could be certain an impasse had been averted. 
 Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, and Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, who has promised to exercise his authority to block the trade pact for as long as he can, agreed today that a vote would be taken the week beginning Nov. 27, other senators said.
President Clinton has promised leaders of other countries that there would be a vote before the end of the year. But the agreement struck today means that vote will not come until after the Nov. 8 election unless Mr. Hollings relents.
The deal was not announced because, as a matter of courtesy, Mr. Mitchell does not make scheduling decisions public before they are cleared with Republican leaders. Most Republicans, however, favor the trade measure.
Congress is supposed to adjourn for the year next week or the week after. But Senator Hollings, the Democratic chairman of the commerce committee and a staunch opponent of the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, announced Wednesday that he would take advantage of rules that allow his committee to spend 45 days on the pact, not counting weekends and holidays, before legislation putting it into effect can be brought to a vote.
With health legislation dead, the trade bill is President Clinton's highest legislative priority for the rest of the year.
The bill would permit the United States to participate in an accord that the country's trade negotiators concluded last December with more than 100 other nations. The pact, the culmination of years of negotiations, would reduce worldwide tariffs by an average of 40 percent, lower other barriers to trade like quotas on certain products, and provide patent protection for the American software, pharmaceutical and other industries. Most other countries are waiting for the United States to act before they formally approve the pact.
The Administration says the accord would produce half a million jobs in the United States in the next few years. It is supported by politicians and economists in the broad middle of the ideological spectrum. But it is opposed by some on the left like Ralph Nader and some on the right like Patrick J. Buchanan.
Today, in a ceremony at the Treasury Department where he signed a bill to allow interstate banking, the President repeated his call for Congress to return after the Nov. 8 Congressional elections to vote on the trade legislation if it could not be handled before the scheduled adjournment.
"We need to be able to continue to be the leader in opening up the global economy to efficiency and to competition and to expansion," he said.
The House intends to vote on the measure next week. The Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley, said today that he had no doubt that it would be approved.
Senator Mitchell said Wednesday that he was prepared to keep the Senate in pro forma sessions to eat up the 45 days and then call all senators back to Washington for a debate and a vote. The period expires Nov. 28, the Monday after Thanksgiving.
At a meeting this afternoon, Senator Hollings told Senator Mitchell that he still intended to block the bill for 45 days but that he would not insist that the Senate remain in session during that period. The two Senators agreed that a vote would be taken after a two-day debate the week after Thanksgiving. Those voting will be the senators now sitting, not the ones elected in November.
Under "fast track" authority granted the President on the GATT legislation, once it is brought up for a vote, it must be approved or rejected after a brief debate, with no amendments allowed.
There has not been a lame-duck session of Congress since 1982. Such sessions have often produced considerable mischief. It was unclear tonight whether this session could be restricted to the trade matter. But the opportunities for dealing with other issues could be limited, since the House will not return.
Earlier today, the Senate Finance Committee, the main committee with jurisdiction over trade policy, approved the legislation, 19 to 0.
"This has to be done this year," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the committee. "Too much is at stake. We can't take the chance of waiting."
The top Republican on the Finance Committee, Bob Packwood of Oregon, predicted in an interview today that Senator Hollings would relent and permit a vote next week. "He won't stick his finger in the eyes of the President and Mitchell," Mr. Packwood said.
But in an interview tonight on the "MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" on PBS, Mr. Hollings said, "I still am determined to use those 45 days."
In a narrow sense, Senator Hollings is concerned with protecting the textile industry in South Carolina from inexpensive imports. But the Senator, who was Governor of South Carolina from 1959 to 1963 and has been in the Senate ever since, has been opposed to free trade for as long as he has been in politics. He maintains that accords like the GATT agreement lead to the decline of manufacturing in the United States and to the loss of good jobs to overseas competitors.
Senator Packwood said that the White House had long been forewarned of Senator Hollings's opposition and that it could have easily constructed the legislation so that the commerce committee would not have had jurisdiction.
Other supporters of the trade measure from both parties agreed with that assessment. Several also said that they could not understand why the Administration waited until the last weeks of the session to send the bill to Congress, a delay that opened the way for Senator Hollings's obstruction.
One Senator said that a White House staff member told him as recently as last week that Mr. Hollings was so close to President Clinton that he could be persuaded to relent in his opposition to the trade bill.
A senior Senate staff assistant who has been working on the issue all year put it this way: "The breath-taking failure of the Clinton White House is its inability to recognize who means 'no' when they say 'no.' When Hollings says 'no,' he's a dead 'no.' "

HEADLINE: Gas Prices Up 5 Cents, With More Increases Seen

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JERICHO, L.I., Sept. 29

 BODY:
Gasoline prices have jumped an average of 5 cents a gallon at most filling stations on Long Island and throughout the New York-New Jersey region this week. They may increase again, perhaps by as much as 25 cents a gallon, in three months when gasoline that has been reformulated to meet new Federal air-quality standards will go on sale, retailers and consumer advocates said today.
Retailers in the region are required to switch by Saturday to oxygenated gasoline, which by Federal law must be sold from Oct. 1 through April 30 to help reduce fuel emissions during the cold winter months. 
 Motorists will be asked to pay still more on Jan. 1, when Federal regulations take matters a step further by requiring that all gasoline sold in the nation's heavily populated metropolitan areas be reformulated to help protect the earth's damaged ozone layer.
While some drivers said today that they did not mind the price increases if the changes would improve air quality, some New York State officials and representatives of gasoline retailers said they were concerned about rising prices.
"Such high, rapid increases could be a jolt to an already troubled economy," said Richard M. Kessel, executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board, who called on the Federal Government to closely monitor gasoline pricing over the next several months "to protect consumers against unfair practices by the oil industry."
"Prices could go through the ceiling this winter," Mr. Kessel said. "We could see regular gas going for a dollar-and-a-half a gallon, yet the supplies of oil and gasoline are plentiful."
Gasoline retailers in New Jersey and Connecticut are also worried about the impact of the price increases, which could be as much as 8 cents a gallon by Saturday, officials said.
The price for regular gasoline posted today at the Turnpike Texaco Gas Station here on the Jericho Turnpike was $1.25, reflecting a 5-cent-a-gallon increase for the oxygenated fuel.
The station served as the setting for a news conference called by Mr. Kessel, Assemblyman Thomas Di Napoli, chairman of the New York State Assembly Consumer Affairs and Protection Committee, and Mary Ann Ragona, executive director of the Long Island Gasoline Retailers Association.
Mr. Kessel said that oxygenated fuel had been on the market for the last two winters and that during each season prices rose by as much as 12 cents a gallon, despite industry projections that the increases would be only 3 to 5 cents a gallon.
"While we laud the goals of the 1990 Clean Air Act, we also must look out for the interests of consumers," Assemblyman DiNapoli said.
Motorists who stopped at the Texaco station said they were unaware that any changes had occurred. They did express concern, though, about whether the oil companies might be using the situation to make additional profits.
"I have no way of knowing whether I'm paying a fair price," said Ellen Lazarus, who with her 4-year-old daughter, Jillian, stopped to fill the tank of her Jeep Cherokee. "I guess paying more is worth it for clean air."
Andy Harris, the owner of the Texaco station and president of the Long Island Gasoline Retailers Association, said his 5-cent-a-gallon increase was based on the cost of his latest delivery. He said that the increase for the consumer would soon be more than 5 cents, because he will likely pay more for his next delivery.
Ms. Ragona said that while gasoline suppliers basically set the price, there was a free market, based on supply and demand, and that consumers could have an impact by "shopping around for the best deal."
There are no industry estimates of the cost of reformulating gasoline. But the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group based in Washington, disclosed earlier this week that an analysis of gasoline futures trading suggested an increase of 6 cents a gallon was coming in January as a result of the new Federal requirement.

HEADLINE: Campaign Trail;
For Cuomo, an Additional Opponent: An Eccentric Millionaire

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is about to learn that it is never wise to make enemies in politics, especially when they have deep pockets.
Abraham Hirschfeld, the eccentric real-estate developer who ran for lieutenant governor in 1986 only to be knocked off the ballot by Mr. Cuomo, is seeking revenge with what he says will be a $1 million advertising campaign against the Governor. 
 The campaign began yesterday with a radio ad on black-oriented stations in New York City featuring C. Vernon Mason, a lawyer. In the ad, Mr. Mason says Mr. Cuomo "dissed Rev. Al Sharpton and his supporters" and ordered a Crown Heights inquiry "that destroyed Mayor Dinkins." Mr. Mason implores: "Skip over Cuomo or cross over. Demand respect."
A similar print advertisement is scheduled to run in black-oriented newspapers next week. In addition, a political action committee (A Better Economy Political Action Committee, or ABE-PAC), formed by Mr. Hirschfeld, will begin a television advertising campaign on New York City stations in the next few weeks that "graphically makes the case that New York is no longer the Empire State," said Jay Severin, Mr. Hirschfeld's media consultant.
Mr. Severin, who typically works for Republicans, said there had been no coordination with the campaign of Senator George E. Pataki, Mr. Cuomo's Republican opponent.
But the Cuomo campaign was not convinced. "It's a sad attempt by the Pataki campaign to deceive intelligent New York voters," said Arda Nazerian, a Cuomo spokeswoman.
Mr. Hirschfeld said yesterday he was motivated largely by his anger at being removed from the Democratic primary ballot in 1986 by Mr. Cuomo's lawyers and at being opposed by the Governor in his efforts to buy The New York Post in 1993.
"Am I mad at Cuomo about '86?" he said. "Yes. Am I mad at Cuomo about The Post? Yes."
But he then called back to amend his statement. "I am not mad at the Governor," he said. "I am not mad at the Governor that he chased me out from The Post."
Mr. Hirschfeld, who said he has contributed $35,000 to Mr. Pataki's campaign, said he and members of his family gave $600,000 to ABE-PAC and that he expected to raise $400,000 more from other sources.
 
Focusing on Abortion
 Speaking of television ads, the Cuomo campaign began airing two new ones Wednesday night that criticize Mr. Pataki for changing his position on abortion rights.
In one of them, a woman asks, "How can you possibly trust a man like that?" The other ad states that Mr. Pataki has repeatedly been supported by anti-abortion groups and received a 100 percent rating from Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition.
Zenia Mucha, the Pataki spokeswoman, said, "George Pataki's pro-choice and Mario Cuomo knows it. But Mario Cuomo's desperate, so he's resorted to lies."
Mr. Pataki has said that he originally favored abortion rights, then changed his stand after the birth of his first child, but now supports a woman's right to choose. He has voted against Medicaid funding for abortions, but he says he could support it if abortions for poor women were accompanied by mandatory counseling about family planning. He also favors parental notification before a girl under 16 can have an abortion.
While the New York State Right-to-Life Committee endorsed Mr. Pataki in several of his legislative races, it refused to do so this year. The Christian Coalition gave him a 100 percent rating last year and an 83 percent rating this year.
 
Trying Nice Now
 A week after Herbert London, the Republican candidate for comptroller, lashed out not only against his Democratic challenger but the head of his own ticket, here he is as the nice Herb.
The London campaign has released two 30-second commercials of Mr. London, to the strains of inspirational music, hugging, grinning, shaking hands and generally being pleasant with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani; Roy G. Innis, director of the Congress for Racial Equality; the bandleader Lionel Hampton, and other grass-roots supporters. The slogan is equally upbeat:
"Herb London for comptroller. No wonder the hard-working taxpayers of New York are smiling again."
 
On Debates, No Debate
 With none of the bickering and posturing that usually accompanies the scheduling of debates, the candidates for state attorney general have agreed on three forums. The first will take place in New York City, tentatively on Oct. 9. The others are scheduled on Long Island and Buffalo (the respecitive political bases for the Democrat, Karen S. Burstein, and the Republican, Dennis C. Vacco). Those dates have not been set.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Fears Spread To Bourses

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The old adage that when America sneezes, the world catches a cold applied with special force in financial markets yesterday. New data that the American economy was more vigorous than thought chilled the already depressed European stock and bond markets. Like their counterparts in the United States, investors feared a new wave of global inflation, stoked by the powerful American economy.
Of course, there were local factors at work, too, in the overseas market declines. But it was the United States, with word that housing sales were unexpectedly robust and that second-quarter growth was even stronger than first estimated, that added the extra push downward in Britain, France, Italy, and, most importantly, Germany, Europe's largest economy. 
 Investors and traders feared that the American Federal Reserve would seize on the new economic data as evidence of resurgent inflation, raise United States interest rates and further sour global bond markets. United States and European stock traders, although there were exceptions, followed the lead of their bond markets.
Bond and stock prices fell further in Europe than they did in the United States. Share prices have been dropping slowly all month on many European bourses. American prices dropped sharply more recently.
"The reality of higher rates is just seeping into Europe," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company. Todd Clark, senior director of equity trading at Mabon Securities, seeking to explain the relatively gentle drop for United States share prices yesterday, said. "We already had a nasty hiccup last week,"
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 23.55 points, to 3,854.63, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 fell 2.58 points, to 462.23. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 0.67 point, to 759.34.
In percentage terms, the Dow fell 0.61 percent and the S.& P. 500 fell 0.56 percent. By contrast, Europe's markets plummeted more than twice as far. Britain's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Index fell 1.51 percent; France's CAC-40 Index dropped 1.51 percent, and Italy's Mibtel Index fell 1 percent.
Germany's DAX index fell 2.8 percent, much of it in after-hours trading when the American housing and gross domestic product data were released. But German stocks' decline was already well under way before then.
The Bundesbank announced yesterday that it would leave interest rates unchanged for at least two more weeks, leading to speculation that the central bank's next move would be to raise rates after a steady series of rate cuts. At the same time, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's lead in German opinion polls was dropping, calling into question the ruling party's ability to win the Oct. 16 national elections.
The Japanese financial markets, which are essentially quiet when Western markets are open, are likely to react more to the fate of United States-Japan trade talks that are scheduled to conclude today, analysts said.
There seemed to be optimism in Japan, based on statements by Lloyd Bentsen, Secretary of the Treasury, that broad United States trade sanctions against Japan could be avoided. But United States inflation worries could eventually hurt Japan, too.
Stocks were higher early today in Tokyo. At the midday recess in trading, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was up 45.21 points, or two-tenths of 1 percent, at 19,660.33. What first moved the American markets, at 8:30 A.M., Eastern time, was the gross-domestic product growth figure of 4.1 percent in the second quarter, up from 3.8 percent, in the August revision. About an hour and a half later, the Commerce Department reported that August sales of single-family homes rose 9.7 percent, instead of the 1.7 percent decline expected by Wall Street.
"But if I were a trader, I wouldn't buy or sell on the basis of this housing survey," said James R. Solloway, director of research at Argus Research, an investment advisory firm. He cited the relatively few companies polled for the survey, which leads to high volatility, despite the Government's seasonal adjustment of the data.
Declining stocks outnumbered advancing stocks by 1,262 to 874. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above average, with 305.4 million shares changing hands, about 6 percent above this year's average of 287 million shares.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.22 points, to 255.15, but the American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.27 point, to 456.47.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 26 fell, led by the Aluminum Company of America, which fell 1 3/4, to 85 3/4. Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, a total of 286 fell, led by AT&T, which fell 3/4, to 53 7/8.

HEADLINE: Health Care Battle In California Turns On State Insurance

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

 BODY:
The great health care battle of 1994 may have sputtered to a close in Washington. But if some advocates of a health care restructuring have their way, the struggle will simply shift to the states, in the tradition of many long-haul social crusades, bubbling up in places as improbable as an art-filled, affluent home high in the hills over Hollywood.
There, on a balmy night last week, an earnest group of actors, doctors and assorted other professionals gathered to discuss the pros and cons of managed care and health maintenance organizations versus a state-run, Canadian-style system of taxpayer-financed health insurance. The session had its Hollywood moments. "Say we get an acting job in New York," one woman asked. "How would we be covered?" 
 But the tone was exceptionally policy-minded and the purpose exceedingly political. Organizers say that about 50 such house parties are held each week to raise money and spread the word for Proposition 186, an initiative on the ballot this November that would make California the first state to create a Canadian-style, or "single payer," system.
Nothing would give the proposal's advocates greater pleasure than to have California do what the nation could not: to pass something far more sweeping than even a Clinton-style restructuring, to prove that despite the deepest convictions of the political establishment, the drive for a health care overhaul is alive and well far from the deadlocked Congress.
"Citizens are suffering a case of reformus interruptus," said Steve Hopcraft, a spokesman for Californians for Health Security, the coordinator for groups backing the initiative. "We spent two years telling them there really is a problem and we've got to change it, and now we're telling them we can't change it."
The effort to pass this initiative is a decidedly uphill fight. But win or lose, Proposition 186 is a case study of the rough new politics of health care as the battle moves to the states, just as the abortion struggle did in the 1980's.
In some ways, the fight in California has picked up right where Washington left off. The opponents of Proposition 186 have hired Goddard-Claussen/First Tuesday, the media consultant that created Harry and Louise for the Health Insurance Association of America, and they are using many of the same arguments that proved so effective in the national debate.
"I think we have a good chance of defeating it," said Allan Zaremberg of the California Chamber of Commerce. "The public doesn't want the government to run their health care system."
Advocates of Proposition 186 counter by declaring that here in the land of managed care and H.M.O.'s, the public is becoming tired of having its system run by profit-minded insurance companies.
In Washington, most of the major Democratic plans were a mix of market changes and government intervention, and thus came under fire from both the left and the right. Proposition 186 seeks no such ideological straddle. It would largely eliminate the role of private health insurance in California and replace it with a state-administered insurance system covering every resident.
The system would be financed by a $1-a-pack tax on cigarettes, an employer payroll tax ranging from 4.4 percent to 8.9 percent and new state income taxes equal to 2.5 percent of taxable income for individuals and an additional 2.5 percent for those with incomes over $250,000. (That is on top of California's current income tax, whose top rate is 11 percent.)
A state legislative analysis estimated that the proposal would raise $40 billion to $50 billion a year in new taxes.
Advocates emphasize that this would replace all premium payments and provide a generous, and secure, package of health benefits, including such expensive services as long-term care. They say that Californians would still have their full choice of doctors and that the doctors themselves would be freed from the second-guessing of managed care plans preoccupied with the bottom line.
Supporters of a single-payer system, which would be run by an elected health commissioner, also believe that with private insurers eliminated as middlemen, vast sums could be saved on administrative overhead.
Against this earnest organizing, the opposition has unleashed an argument that is simple, well honed from the national debate and already on the airwaves. "Believe me, we know health care reform is critical," a nurse says in one television spot. "But Proposition 186 isn't the reform we want. One eighty-six will force most of us to give up our private health coverage and push us into a government-run health care bureaucracy -- controlled by an elected politician, not a doctor or a nurse."
Critics also argue that the initiative would have a devastating impact on the state's economy, placing on small business a harrowing burden that would cost thousands of jobs. They say the benefits promised are far too generous to be covered by the financing in the initiative, thus raising the possibility of ever larger tax increases or even delays or denial of some care.
They also warn that out-of-staters would come flocking to California for its health coverage. (The initiative specifies a two-year residency requirement for long-term-care benefits but would make residency requirements for other care a matter for the State Legislature to decide.) And they say that no matter what the deficiencies of the current system, turning it over to the state government -- and to an elected official, to boot -- would be preposterous.
A survey conducted Sept. 13-18 by the Field Institute, a leading California pollster, found that voters' awareness of the single-payer initiative was growing -- but so was opposition. Fifty-eight percent said they had heard something about the proposition; 20 percent said they were inclined to vote yes, 28 percent said they were inclined to vote no, and 10 percent said they were undecided. After voters were read a description of the single-payer initiative, the opposition rose to 53 percent, with 30 percent supporting and 17 percent undecided.
Findings like those alarm many advocates of health care restructuring, who fear that Proposition 186 may be setting them up for a one-two punch, making 1994 the year that major health initiatives failed both nationally and in the nation's most populous state.
"I personally wish that it hadn't come so quickly after what I think was a very negative national debate," said John Rother, legislative director for the American Association of Retired Persons, whose state affiliate is supporting Proposition 186. "I think we need time to remake the case for health care reform."
A case can also be made that the initiative is simply out of synch with the leaner, more cynical politics of the 1990's, when many polls show people more interested in putting limits on elected officials than on expanding their duties. None of the major candidates for governor or senator have endorsed Proposition 186. According to the polls, the hot initiative on the California ballot this year is Proposition 187, which would deny most government services to illegal immigrants.
Its advocates acknowledge that Proposition 186 may be ahead of its time, but just barely. Managed care and managed competition, in which cost-conscious health plans regulate care and compete vigorously for patients, are offered as a panacea in much of the country and certainly have their true believers in Congress and the White House. But they are already a reality for many in California, and they are creating a backlash among doctors, driving some of them to take a fresh look at the single-payer concept as a means of giving them more independence.
"There's no other issue that's crossed specialty lines, age lines, demographic lines, so much as this anger at what they see as intrusion and the compromising of health care by these plans," said Danielle Walters of the California Medical Association. The association is not supporting Proposition 186 but is studying the general concept of a Canadian-style system as well as other alternatives, she said.
The proposition does have support from labor, health groups like the California Nurses Association and various other organizations. Mr. Hopcraft, of Californians for Health Security, said that the supporters hoped to raise $3 million to $4 million and would schedule their television advertising for the last few weeks before the election but that they expected the opposition to outspend them by 10 to 1. Richard Wiebe, a spokesman for the Taxpayers Committee Against the Government Takeover, the opponents' coordinator, asserts that its budget is only about $8 million and that spending will probably not reach even that.
The single-payer advocates, in the tradition of guerrilla movements, hope to prove that they were badly underestimated. The struggle is hard, however. With money for paid advertising short, getting news coverage is crucial, and organizers say it is difficult to compete in California with O. J. Simpson and Heidi Fleiss.
Still, Bill Zimmerman, a consultant and strategist for Proposition 186, was sanguine in an interview last week. "We're people with a long view," he said. "If we lose, the issue isn't going away, and the need isn't going away." He added with a smile, "And strange things can happen with these initiatives."
The health care wars, in other words, rage on.

HEADLINE: BIG PUSH ON TRADE;
Yeltsin Visits Seattle, a Good Market

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Sept. 29

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia stopped off in Seattle today at the end of his American visit, playing up the one part of the country where trade between the United States and Russia has moved well beyond the talk-and-dream phase.
Washington, the state most dependent on trade and home of the Boeing Company, a leading exporter, has the largest concentration of companies doing business with Russia of any state, according to its trade officials. 
 From apples to dairy products, potato chips to microchips, the Pacific Northwest has seen a sixfold increase, to nearly $200 million annually, in the amount of trade with Russia over the last five years.
And in Russian East Asia, American business leaders are laying the foundation for a huge new source of timber and fishing products. Products from the region are seen as replacements for the dwindling natural resources in the Pacific Northwest.
But numerous problems remain, and Mr. Yeltsin, in a passionate speech before 800 West Coast business leaders here today, tried to allay many of the fears. Repeating a message he told President Clinton earlier this week, the Russian President said: 'We don't need help. I'm not here with outstretched arms." What Russia needs, he said, is investment of all sorts.
The Russian President called for a free-trade zone between his country and the United States, similar to what the North American Free Trade Agreement has created among the United States, Canada and Mexico. Asian leaders made the same appeal at their summit meeting here with President Clinton last November.
"Why is it believed that we are still painted red?" asked Mr. Yeltsin, who rose to political prominence as the Communist Party boss of Moscow.
In a pitch for investment, Mr. Yeltsin told the American business people that Russia's inflation rate had dropped to 4 percent, from 25 percent, and that business fears of Russian organized crime were overblown.
"Yes, you were afraid of political instability, but today, let me assure you, we have achieved political stability," Mr. Yeltsin said.
But for some of the bigger American companies that sent representatives to hear Mr. Yeltsin, government chaos remains a real problem, as do currency flucutations and high tariffs. The Weyerhaeuser Company, the world's largest timber concern, which is based in Tacoma, has put its fledgling operation in Russia on hold after running into numerous problems.
"We planted a million and half trees there, and hoped to do some harvesting of their timber, but it's a real tough place to do business," said Frank Mendizabal, a Weyerhaeuser spokesman. "The question is: who owns the resource? Almost every time we go back there, we're dealing with somebody new."
But another timber concern, the Global Forestry Management Group of Portland, Ore., announced plans this week to develop extensive logging and exporting operations in Russian East Asia. The consortium plans to convert an old naval base in the port city of Sovetskaya Gavan to an export dock. Using what it says are environmentally sound logging methods, the consortium plans to cut as much as 100 million board feet of timber a year from a million acres of leased land in Russia. The timber would be sent to 10 mills on the West Coast of the United States.
The Pacific Northwest and Russian East Asia have a "special link," Mr. Yeltsin said today. "Now it is time to cooperate on some real dramatic business."
Mr. Yeltsin's visit recalled the historic links between Russia and the Northwest via the Pacific Ocean, links that are starting to pay off in trade. Seattle is the mainland American city closest to Russian territory, excluding those in Alaska. It takes less time to ship goods from Russian East Asia to Seattle -- about 10 days by ship -- than it does to Moscow, which can take three weeks by rail.
As a result, some Russian companies have started to use Seattle as a convenient supply center for their own ventures in Russian East Asia.
The relationship that this part of the country and Russia first established during the cold war is another reason business projects are now bearing fruit, officials say. Seattle played host to the Goodwill Games in 1990, a sort of mini-Olympicss between the United States and the Soviet Union. Some of the Seattle organizers of the games are now running companies selling everything from groceries to pharmaceuticals in Russia.
To help minimize the investment risks, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a Federal agency, announced plans this week to offer up to $550 million in support of American companies with ventures in Russia. Companies in the Northwest, including a fish-processing concern, a telecommunications venture and an equipment-leasing company, are receiving a large share of those subsidies.
Boeing executives envision a market for $60 billion of airplanes in Russia and other former Soviet republics over the next 20 years. Mr. Yeltsin toured a Boeing plant today, but he did not publicly address the company's complaints about the high tariffs that have so far kept the world's largest airplane manufacturer out of Russia.
Total two-way trade between this region and Russia is still relatively small, at less than $200 million. By comparision, Washington state had $6 billion of exports to Japan last year, and $2.2 billion to China.
But the growth potential is enormous, business leaders say. Mr. Yeltsin, in his cheerleading address, not only reminded them of the potential, but of how far the two regions had come.
"As I told the governor, at least 10 strategic missiles used to be trained on Washington state," Mr. Yeltsin said, to strained laughter. "We have taken those missiles off target."
Seattle was the only city outside New York and Washington on Mr. Yeltsin's tour, before he flew back to Russia tonight.

HEADLINE: Chrysler Chief's World View: Place to Sell, Not Build, Cars

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SIENA, Italy, Sept. 29

 BODY:
In boom years for the automobile industry, the Chrysler Corporation has used its surplus cash to build more factories and invest in everything from aircraft companies to foreign competitors. When hard times hit, it found itself closing factories, selling businesses and losing money.
Today Chrysler, the most profitable of the Big Three auto makers, outlined a cautious, go-it-alone strategy for international growth that it says will assure profit even when the domestic market turns sour. 
 While Chrysler has been rumored as a potential partner for everyone from Volvo of Sweden to Fiat of Italy, Robert J. Eaton, the company's chairman and chief executive, rejected the idea of joint ventures. He talked with American and European journalists at a retreat here before the Paris Auto Show, discussing Chrysler's corporate strategy.
Mr. Eaton also said he had no plans to buy any auto maker outright. He would add factories abroad, he said, only in countries that demand it as a condition to sell vehicles within their borders.
"We think of ourselves as a regional company with an international viewpoint," Mr. Eaton said, citing BMW as a model. "We also think we're about the right size, so we don't plan on growing very much."
With North America as a development and manufacturing base, Chrysler hopes to increase its sales overseas by 20 percent a year, to about 300,000 by the turn of the century. Its primary vehicles for sales abroad will be Jeeps and mini-vans, Mr. Eaton said, modified to meet the regulations of foreign markets, not consumer tastes.
The Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation are trying to more closely link their foreign and domestic operations, to cut vehicle-development costs and to expand into new markets, particularly in Asia. Chrysler is not so ambitious. "We expect to be only a niche player" in foreign markets, Mr. Eaton said. "We don't have any volume goal or penetration goal."
A major concern for investors -- and one reason Chrysler stock has slipped so far from its peak in January of $63.50 a share -- is that unlike Ford and G.M., Chrysler has negligible sales abroad. By contrast, when the auto cycle turned down in the United States, G.M. and Ford have benefited from recovery in Europe.
But Mr. Eaton argued that Chrysler has cut costs deeply enough to remain profitable even in a downturn. Its break-even point -- the number of vehicles it must sell to offset its costs and begin making money -- is down to 1.6 million units, compared with 1.9 million units in the late 1980's, the company says. In addition, James D. Donlon, Chrysler's controller, said the company had identified a further $8 billion, from absenteeism to warranty costs, it is trying to eliminate.
Chrysler, like other auto companies, thinks that auto-sales cycles on different continents are slipping into sync as economies become interdependent. As a result, Mr. Eaton said, Chrysler would gain little from building factories abroad but would incur costs.
To some extent, the company is making a virtue of necessity. Having ignored foreign markets for years, it lacks not only foreign manufacturing structure but also expertise to exploit such markets aggressively, Mr. Eaton acknowledged.
That has not stopped the company from trying in the past. In the 1960's Chrysler bought several small European auto makers like Simca, in a bid to enter European markets. During its financial crisis in 1978, it sold them to Peugeot.
Chrysler is now making mini-vans at an Austrian factory run through a joint venture with an engineering company, Steyr-Daimler-Puch. It has contracted with the same company to begin assembling Grand Cherokees there, starting on Tuesday.
The auto maker has been negotiating with China to assemble mini-vans there, and has been pursuing nine other possible manufacturing operations in South America, India and elsewhere. The investments required would range as high as $1 billion for the Chinese plant, but the company said none of the operations was critical.
"We're perfectly willing to walk away from every single one of them," Mr. Eaton said.
Chrysler, he added, intended to bring out some new types of vehicles, though he would not describe them. He did say that Chrysler would not make a more expensive luxury car than its current LHS model, because the luxury market was already too crowded.
Mr. Eaton said Chrysler was aiming for double-digit annual productivity increases from its main blue-collar work force, but was only getting 6 percent to 7 percent now. Chrysler expects 50 percent of those workers to retire by 2000.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Government Securities Prices Fall

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Government securities were pulled down yesterday by economic data that hinted strongly at future inflation pressures, raising the specter of an interest rate rise that could come sooner than the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting in November.
Despite the day's first dose of data -- the final revision to the second- quarter gross domestic product figures -- bond prices held up well. But the steadiness was short-lived as prices for bonds immediately fell under the weight of the August new- home sales, which were much stronger than expected. Those statistics were considered by some as confirmation that the economy is not weakening, and inflation pressures are a threat down the road. 
 The 30-year bond fell 9/32 , to a price of 964/32 , for a yield of 7.84 percent, up from 7.81 percent on Wednesday. Rates were higher as well for bills of shorter maturity, amid concern by investors as to where the rates will be at least three months from now. The three- and six-month bill rates both rose 6 basis points, to 4.55 percent and 5.21 percent, respectively. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Some economists note that the bond market has repeatedly underestimated both the strength of the economy and how high bond yields could go. Behind speculation about the timing of any other rate rise by the Fed is concern by traders about just how many other tightenings it will take before inflation is offically ruled under control.
The gross domestic product figure was revised up slightly to 4.1 percent, from the preliminary estimate of 3.8 percent. A Reuters survey of economists showed expectations of 3.9 percent growth.
Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, saw the revised figure as confirming that growth during the quarter was dominated by inventory accumulation.
Most of the upward revision, Ms. Schaja felt, was caused by farm inventory accumulation that was stronger than estimated.
New single-family home sales for August rose 9.7 percent, to 703,000 units, much higher than expected and higher than the 641,000 in July. The rise in August was the largest since September 1993, when it was 14.1 percent.
Analysts said the July data were revised down to 641,000 from 664,000 and that may have made the August increase look more impressive than it was. The South, a key region for growth, fell 4 percent.
Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist for the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh, yesterday regarded new-home sales as the number with the greatest market impact, "for at least today."
Mr. Hoffman noted that the market did not like the home sales number since it rose despite higher mortgage rates this summer. And it was contrary to what home builders had been saying -- that traffic was down and that mortgage applications were down.
"The market was interpreting that the strong homes sales number could hasten the day the Fed will raise the funds rate," he said.
Ms. Schaja thought the home sales suggested that the five interest rate increases enacted by the Fed since the beginning of the year may not be enough to stabilize the housing sector.
While traders have been calculating how soon the Fed will move again, the home sales may cause the market to start thinking a rate rise could occur before the November meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making arm. "But not before the release of the employment report, inflation data and retail sales for September due out by mid-October," Mr. Hoffman said. He said he expected that the Fed would want to see and digest the most recent data before deciding.
In addition, the Fed will watch the dollar and commodity prices, including the price of gold on a daily basis, as companion elements to the monthly economic numbers.

HEADLINE: Growth Alone Won't Assure Jobs, I.M.F. Tells Rich Lands

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MADRID, Sept. 29

 BODY:
A sustained world economic recovery will not significantly lower high unemployment rates in the industrial nations unless their economies become more flexible and open to market forces, the top official of the International Monetary Fund said today.
Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, said at a news conference here that "inflation could still destroy the recovery" unless major countries devised an appropriate strategy for prolonging the current economic upswing. 
 Mr. Camdessus spoke as finance ministers from around the world converged in Madrid for an annual meeting that also marks the 50th anniversary of the Bretton Woods agreement that created the I.M.F. and the World Bank.
For the first time in this decade, the monetary fund has raised its economic growth forecast for the industrial nations, and declared the recent period of recession and slow growth over.
In its latest World Economic Outlook, compiled every six months, the fund predicts that the industrial economies will grow at an annual rate of 2.7 percent this year and in 1995, compared with its previous forecast of 2.4 percent and 2.6 percent for those years.
The world economy as a whole is now expected to grow 3.1 percent this year and 3.6 percent next year, returning to the average growth rate since 1973.
Mr. Camdessus said he would ask the finance ministers to approve a package of new measures that would include the creation of a further $50 billion worth of special drawing rights -- S.D.R.'s in international financial shorthand. The certificates, which supplement gold and hard-currency reserves, were first issued by the International Monetary Fund in 1970.
Almost half of that would be set aside for former Communist and developing countries that are short of hard-currency reserves.
British and American monetary officials said they would press for a more modest allocation of new S.D.R.'s, which would still favor countries short of cash. The United States, Britain, Germany and Japan maintain that there are adequate reserves worldwide, and fear that issuing new S.D.R.'s would stoke inflation.
They agree that something should be done to increase the monetary reserves of the former Communist countries, which have recently joined the I.M.F. These nations were not members when drawing rights were last issued in 1983.
Britain has begun a separate initiative here to ease the debt burdens of the very poorest countries by selling some of the $40 billion worth of gold now owned by the monetary fund. The money raised from the sale of the gold would be invested and the income used to finance easier repayment terms for those countries' foreign debts.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Copying Stocks and Bonds, Dollar Edges Downward

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar edged mostly lower against other leading currencies yesterday, weakened by declines in the American stock and bond markets.
The dollar's value also eroded because of persistent anxiety over whether the United States and Japan would reconcile their key trade differences by a weekend deadline. 
 Traders attributed much of the dollar's weakness to declines in stock and bond prices, which resulted from rising fear of inflation in an ebullient economy. Drops in the stock and bond markets signal weaker demand for dollars from foreign investors.
The dollar fell to 98.58 yen in late New York trading yesterday, from 98.96 yen on Wednesday. Currency dealers described trading as light ahead of tomorrow's expected announcement as to whether the United States and Japan have reached any meaningful agreement in their trade disputes.
"It's just a waiting game right now," said Earl I. Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. "Many people think it's going to go down to the midnight deadline." The Clinton Administration has threatened to impose sanctions against Japan unless the two sides reach an agreement by midnight tonight.
Traders were "a little less optimistic" about prospects for an agreement, Mr. Johnson said.
Many dealers believe that without a breakthrough on trade, the United States will push to make the dollar even weaker, which would hurt Japan's exporters by making their products more expensive in the American market.
The dollar was also weaker against the German mark yesterday, falling to 1.5485 marks from 1.5527 on Wednesday.
In other currency trading in New York yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.2855 Swiss francs, down from 1.2876 on Wednesday; at 5.2852 French francs, down from 5.2930, and 1,557 Italian lire, down from 1,561. The British pound rose to $1.5780 in New York, from $1.5740 on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Face-Off or Batter Up: 2 Sports With Similar Objectives in Mind

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Hockey and baseball terminology don't mix. In baseball, to cite a couple of examples, players use a ball and bat and score runs; in hockey, they use a puck and a stick and score goals. But labor disputes have brought the lexicons of the two sports closer together. Negotiations have created terminology common to both. Try tax plans and disincentives, for example.
The National Hockey League is on the brink of joining major league baseball in its shutdown mode. Unless a last-minute agreement alters the league's plans, Commissioner Gary Bettman plans to lock out the players by postponing tomorrow's scheduled start of the 1994-95 season. Baseball players have been on strike for 50 days, matching the length of the 1981 strike, the longest work stoppage in professional sports history. 
 Like their baseball counterparts, the N.H.L. and its union are discussing tax proposals as a means of creating a revenue-sharing pool to be used to bolster the sagging finances of lower-revenue teams. Like their baseball counterparts, they can't agree on the type of tax plan or the rate of tax to be applied to team payrolls.
There is one difference. While the N.H.L. has placed its tax plan on the bargaining table and even has changed its proposal once or twice, baseball's club owners have talked about a payroll tax only in private conversations with union officials and player agents. They have not made a formal proposal.
They have refrained from taking that step because they then would lose the option of unilaterally implementing their coveted salary-cap proposal if they decide to declare an impasse in their negotiations. When an employer declares an impasse and can legally defend it, he can implement only his last proposal.
But the managements of both sports acknowledge that their proposals provide elements that would serve as disincentives for teams to give players the kind of escalating salaries they have created, though more recently in hockey than in baseball.
In the last formal bargaining session in the baseball dispute, three weeks ago today, Stan Kasten, president of the Atlanta Braves, said the owners received a clear message from the union. "We were told that any feature that resulted in disincentives to signing would not be acceptable," Kasten said.
In one of his first comments at a news conference in Toronto yesterday, Bob Goodenow, the hockey players' labor leader, said, "We're definitely opposed to a system that imposes limits on players' earnings."
But it's the idea of a limit on salaries that sends the terminology of the two sports into divergence once again, at least in the view of N.H.L. officials. Despite the union's public position to the contrary, hockey officials say their proposal is not a salary cap.
"A cap is a prohibition on spending and a prohibition on player acquisition and, in some cases, a prohibition on player retention," Jeffrey Pash, the N.H.L.'s senior vice president and general counsel, said in an interview yesterday. "This system is none of those. Our proposal to the players explicitly states that there is no limit on what a team can pay a player or what it can have for its payroll."
League officials also say that, privately, a union official has said the union is satisfied that the league's owners do not seek a cap. But at his news conference, Goodenow said, "We find their proposal to be a cap on salaries." Speaking by telephone from Toronto last night, and specifically addressing the view of league officials, he said, "We have not indicated that to them."
Baseball management's proposal calls for the players to receive 50 percent of the clubs' revenues, which would be translated into an average club payroll that could be exceeded only by 10 percent. It is a system similar to the one that exists in the National Basketball Association and the National Football League.
"We're doing something different from the other sports," Pash said. "Our latest proposal basically cuts in half the amount of tax."
The hockey owners initially proposed a system that would have created a two-tier tax. If a team exceeded the average payroll by any amount up to 10 percent, it would pay into the revenue-sharing pool an equal amount, $1 for $1. For any excess beyond 10 percent, the tax would rise from 100 percent to 200 percent, $2 for every $1.
The proposal now on the table still centers on an average payroll, which is called the deductible. For each $250,000 above the deductible, a club would be assessed a 5 percent tax, up to a maximum of 125 percent for the excessive payroll amount.
As an example, the Rangers had a 1993-94 payroll of $20,172,000, a shade under Detroit's league-leading $20.2 million. The deductible would have been $14 million, the average payroll. The Rangers would have exceeded that figure by $6,172,000, making their "marginal contribution rate" the full 125 percent.
Their so-called contribution would have amounted to $3,965,000, or 19.7 percent of their total payroll. League officials say theoretically no club would be assessed more than 20 percent, but they acknowledge a higher rate could emerge depending on a team's payroll and the deductible.
Jerry Hausman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a consultant to the union, told the players that the system, with its many tax brackets and its steeply graduated rates, would give teams the "incentive both to cut their taxes dramatically by slashing salaries and to release veteran players."
The result, Hausman said, would mean little money raised for low-revenue clubs. The tax plans, he added, are "not intended to raise a pool of money for small-market clubs but they will have essentially the same effect as a salary cap."
The union, meanwhile, has proposed taxing payrolls and home gate receipts of the 16 highest-revenue clubs. Both taxes would be 5.5 percent and, the union says, they would raise about $40 million for low-revenue clubs.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
In Video Films, a More Intimate 'Reality'

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
Although the experimental film world has produced thousands of quirky personal statements, it is probably safe to say that nothing quite like Obitani Yuri's video movie "The Hair Opera" has been seen before. The one-hour work, which is to have two showings next week as part of the Third New York Video Festival opening today at Lincoln Center, consists of this Japanese artist's filmed correspondence with a fellow artist, Yosufu Kosuzu, who incorporates the pubic hairs of men she has slept with into her work.
So love-smitten that he periodically breaks into soaring operatic arias, Mr. Yuri woos Ms. Kosuzu in a series of ardent 8-millimeter filmed declarations of his passion in which he confesses his obsession with her body hair. He even provides her with her own 8-millimeter camera so she can respond to his messages. After several replies from Ms. Kosuzu, who dismisses him as a pervert, he breaks into her apartment while she is asleep, wakes her up and eventually wins her affection along with permission to shave parts of her body for the camera. 
 Considering that it is a crude home movie, "The Hair Opera" is a surprisingly rich work. It blends comedy, romance, musical parody, sexual politics and esthetics into an endearing love story, which despite its kinkiness ends up seeming positively wholesome.
How much of "The Hair Opera" is autobiographical and how much is fiction is impossible to gauge. The movie's technological crudeness lends it a cinema verite authenticity that would be missing in a more sophisticated film, so the viewer is tempted to take it as a filmed event of real-life performance art. But what does that mean exactly?
 
Offbeat and Oddball
 Errol Morris's "Interrotron Stories," which is to be shown tomorrow and Sunday, raises similar questions. The program consists of three episodes of an "Unsolved Mysteries"-style television series. Made with a device called the interrotron, which allows a subject to look into the camera and into the interviewer's eyes simultaneously, it weaves dramatic re-creations and interviews into a deadpan spoof of reality-based television.
Is the California murder case described in the episode "Parrot May Have the Answer to a Killing" an actual event? Probably not. But the story of a parrot who witnessed a murder and keeps repeating an incriminating protestation by the victim has just enough credibility to make you wonder.
The festival, which continues at the Walter Reade Theater through Oct. 8, includes enough of this sort of oddball work that it qualifies as the avant-garde arm of the New York Film Festival, of which it is a stepchild. Work after work suggests that the video movie, no matter how closely related it may seem to mainstream films, is a much more personal medium that inspires a kind of trust in its content that conventional movies rarely do. Although it's tempting to assert that if movies are dreams, then video is reality, it is never that simple.
Peggy Ahwesh and Margie Strosser's video "Strange Weather," which focuses on the lives of four crack addicts -- three young women and a man -- who share an apartment in Miami, is another entry that has a strong feel of documentary reality. As the characters ramble on about their chemical and sexual adventures, and whine over the phone to their parents for more drug money, the video compiles a devastating picture of young lives adrift that recalls Andy Warhol's "Chelsea Girls." Contributing to the ominous atmosphere are actual television news reports about the approach of Hurricane Andrew.
But although "Strange Weather" looks and feels like a documentary home movie, it is really fiction. It is also the most substantial of three short videos being shown in the program "The Philosophical Toy: Pixelvision Triumphant," which is to be shown on Oct. 6 and 8. All three videos in the program use scenes shot with a plastic video camera for children that has only one-tenth of the number of dots as a regular television. The video's coarse, grainy look and lack of focus add to its aura of realism because everything that is shown looks and sounds unplanned and undoctored.
 
For High-Definition TV
 By no means are all of the works being shown as odd as "The Hair Opera," "Interrotron Stories" and "Strange Weather." On the other side of the technological coin, the festival is presenting a program, "Turbo Video: High-Definition Television" (Oct. 7 and 8), featuring four short videos made for high-definition television. The most spectacular is Kit Fitzgerald's "Painted Memories, Spider's Garden," a ravishingly beautiful visual tone poem, with music by Peter Gordon, which explores relationships between painting and nature with a rhapsodic sensuousness.
Also on the "Turbo Video" program: Mark Rappaport, who deconstructed scenes in Rock Hudson movies to uncover their gay subtext in his witty documentary "Rock Hudson's Home Movies," turns his attention to film noir in "Exterior Night," a much more formal investigation of Hollywood film iconography. The work's most technically striking moments are sequences in which contemporary actors shot in color appear to step out of scenes from old black-and-white detective films.
 
By Jean-Luc Godard
 In between these technological poles are everything from straightforward serious documentaries to weird fun and games. Amos Gitai's "In the Land of Oranges" is the first chapter of a four-hour documentary examining Israeli and Palestinian reactions to the recent peace agreements. Much of the work focuses on workers in a kibbutz that employs Palestinian laborers. The jumble of conflicting passions and economic problems does not offer an encouraging view of future Arab-Israeli relations.
Among the festival's most challenging works is Jean-Luc Godard's many-layered video collage "The Children Play Russian." This meditation on movie history and esthetics, and the crumbling of the Iron Curtain includes many witty images of the stampede of Western mass culture and commercialism into contemporary Russia. It devotes special attention to "Anna Karenina" and its metaphoric meanings both for the director and for Russian society.
As wildly dissimilar as many of its parts may be in style and intention, the festival makes a strong case for the video movie as an art form with a markedly different set of esthetics from mainstream movies. Where film confers a kind of monumentality on its subjects, the video movie tends to reduce whatever it shows to everyday size. That reduction is partly to do with television's traditional associations with living-room reality. For nearly 50 years, television has been a part of the family. But it also has to do with scale. Once a face is blown up into a larger-than-life image on celluloid, it loses its everyday qualities.
But why, even when blown up, do video images not seem especially mythic? Although their usually lower visual resolution is one reason, more important is the relationship between artist and technology. What we think of as movies are large-scale collaborations in which every shot is carefully planned, set up and filmed in a laborious process that entails shooting take after take.
The video movie is not a collective vision but a personal home movie shot with equipment that is portable and that can poke into places a stationary 35-millimeter movie camera cannot readily go. Judging from works shown in the festival, the do-it-yourself technology of video making is having the same impact on cinema that portable, easily programmed musical instruments have had on pop music. The easier it is to make, the more personal and spontaneous its tone.
But does more personal and more spontaneous guarantee greater realism or truthfulness? Superficially, yes. You don't need makeup and fancy lighting to shoot a documentary or home movie. But as this year's Video Festival makes abundantly clear, video movie "reality" is so easy to fake that it really is one more captivating illusion in an artistic hall of mirrors.

HEADLINE: The C.I.A. Club Needs a Cleanup

 BODY:
Surely Congress has had enough of evasion and self-protection from the Central Intelligence Agency. Yet there was the C.I.A.'s Director, James Woolsey, telling the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday that he had let those responsible for one of the agency's worst security disasters off lightly because it was all the fault of some vague "systemic failure." Not one of those who allowed Aldrich Ames to hold a variety of sensitive posts while spying for Moscow was fired or demoted.
Mr. Woolsey's failure to clean house underscores the need for an independent commission to examine the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies and to rethink their roles. The C.I.A. itself is clearly incapable of the job. 
 In his go-easy-on-the-culprits crackdown, Mr. Woolsey sent letters of reprimand to 11 officials touched by the Ames case. Six had already retired and one is about to. The four that remain may simply have their next promotions delayed. Such high-level officials as Ted Price, director of clandestine operations, and Burton Gerber, Deputy Inspector General, will keep their jobs.
So now the same clubby culture that was blamed for letting Mr. Ames flourish at the C.I.A. despite obvious signs of his deceit and unreliability has shown comparable leniency toward his negligent superiors. Senator Dennis DeConcini, chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, is right that it will take "dramatic reorganization to change the culture, the good old boys' club" that promoted Mr. Ames and gave him sensitive posts.
The best hope for a thorough review lies with a new commission being established by Congress. But with the White House hesitant and the C.I.A. downright hostile, it is disconcerting to learn that Senator John Warner, who first conceived of the commission as a way to blunt criticism of the C.I.A., remains confident it would not "slash and burn" the agency. Some slashing may be just what's needed, as Senator DeConcini's comments suggest.
Disbanding the agency is not realistically on the agenda. If the U.S. did not have a C.I.A. it would have to invent one -- to coordinate intelligence-gathering and analysis and perform more disinterested assessments than the armed services and the State Department.
However, the commission could usefully assess not only the agency's internal culture but also what changes are needed in its missions now that the cold war is over. That will require looking at the entire intelligence apparatus. The C.I.A.'s $3-billion budget is but a fraction of the $28 billion a year the U.S. spends on intelligence.
Rival agencies do almost everything the C.I.A. does. The State and Defense Departments collect and assess intelligence. The armed services run covert operations. The F.B.I. has expanded its role in counterintelligence. Other agencies operate spy satellites and process what they photograph and overhear. That makes a turf war likely. But if the commission merely redraws bureaucratic boundaries, it will have failed.
The commission needs to reorient U.S. intelligence for the next century by answering basic questions: Should the U.S. spend more on spies or rely primarily on open sources like press reports and broadcasts? Does it need all the spy satellites it now has? Should the State Department be given responsibility for political and economic assessments? Could these tasks be farmed out to think tanks and academic contractors? Does the U.S. need all the covert operatives it now has?
Above all, the commission should start with the premise that the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies need correction, not coddling.

HEADLINE: CUOMO CRITICIZES PATAKI TAX PLAN

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said yesterday that State Senator George E. Pataki's plan to slash income taxes would inevitably force the state to cut aid to New York City and other local governments, in turn causing local officials to raise property taxes "through the roof" to pay for the lost assistance.
Mr. Cuomo's comments seemed aimed partly at driving a wedge between Mr. Pataki, the Republican candidate for governor, and local political leaders, particularly New York City's Mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican who has withheld any endorsement of Mr. Pataki. 
 Yesterday, Mr. Giuliani echoed the Democratic Governor's concerns that deep tax cuts could force local governments to either raise local taxes or cut services. But he said he might support the tax cuts if Mr. Pataki could show him how the state would compensate for the lost revenue by reducing its many demands on local governments. Those demands include housing the homeless and paying some health care costs for the poor.
In imposing that condition, Mr. Giuliani pushed any endorsement of Mr. Pataki further into the future since the Mayor said Mr. Pataki had yet to provide that explanation.
In presenting his tax cut plan, which includes reducing the top tax rate by 25 percent in four years, Mr. Pataki said the cuts could be paid for through a combination of revenue from a growing economy and some belt-tightening by the state. No cuts in aid to local governments would be needed, he said.
But yesterday, Mr. Cuomo, joined by some economists and Wall Street financial analysts, greeted Mr. Pataki's assumptions with deep skepticism. They said that even if his projections for 6 percent annual revenue growth proved correct, steep annual increases in an array of government programs would make a painless cut in spending impossible. They said deep cuts in aid to local governments, which makes up about 70 percent of the $34.2 billion state budget, would be virtually unavoidable if the Pataki tax cuts occurred.
"This is a Republican by the name of George telling you to read my lips," Mr. Cuomo said at a campaign stop in Buffalo. "I mean, how many times do they have to do it to you?"
Mr. Cuomo has proposed a far smaller package of tax cuts worth $1.5 billion a year. He said he would cut income taxes and a state utilities tax but has yet to release the details.
Felix G. Rohatyn, a Cuomo ally and former chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, said the Pataki plan "could have a truly devastating impact" on New York City's precarious financial condition, as well as on the state's.
Mr. Pataki said that even with his cuts, which would reduce state revenues by $5.6 billion a year by 1998, the state budget could be balanced by holding state spending to the rate of inflation, about 3 percent this year. Yesterday, his campaign also released a list of possible spending reductions, including consolidating agencies, not filling one-third of all vacant state jobs, reducing services for prisoners and reducing supply purchases, which were estimated would save $823 million a year.
"We will not cut local assistance, we will not impose new mandates on local governments that we don't pay for and we will not in any way cut state taxes by shifting the burden either to the mayor, the county executives, to local governments or to schools," Mr. Pataki said in Syracuse yesterday.
Several economists and Wall Street analysts said that making cuts in the state bureaucracy alone could not pay for Mr. Pataki's tax cuts because most of the state's spending is aid to local governments for schools, Medicaid and welfare. Those programs have traditionally risen at rates faster than 3 percent a year; Medicaid alone has been at double-digit rates for years.
"Unless some way is developed to not simply increase the local burden, what you're going to have is tax shifting from the state to localities," Peter D. Salins, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, said on New York 1 News last night. "It will make the state look better, but it will make the localities look worse."
Michael Brooks, senior municipal credit analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said Mr. Pataki's plan, if approved by the State Legislature, might jeopardize the state's ability to improve its bond rating, the lowest in the nation. "If you make a tax cut of this magnitude, you're going to adversely affect the credit of the state," he said.
The proposal also came under fire from a group representing mayors, which said income tax cuts in the 1980's led to cutbacks in state aid to local governments totaling $1.9 billion. It said those aid reductions had caused local governments to raise property taxes by an average of 10 percent each year for the last five years to cover their rising costs.
"One must not forget that the last cut in state income taxes was financed on the backs of local governments," said Edward C. Farrell, executive director of the New York State Conference of Mayors.
Under attack, the Pataki camp found itself on the defensive yesterday in explaining how its candidate could finance the proposed tax cut. When the plan was announced on Wednesday, Mr. Pataki's campaign aides produced a document that the $5.6 billion tax cut would be paid for out of $11 billion in future savings.
But yesterday, that cushion disappeared as the experts who worked on the plan conceded that their official projections would barely produce the $5.6 billion needed and might even fall short of that.
Democrats and outside fiscal analysts said there was little evidence supporting Mr. Pataki's proposal. Frank Mauro, director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a labor-supported group that often opposes tax cuts, said that the assumptions underlying the plan were deeply flawed and that the plan would leave the state government at least $2 billion short if it were fully in effect in 1998.
Republican officials on Long Island, where support for Mr. Pataki runs strong, also raised concerns about his tax plan.
"I have to be cautious, as do my colleagues, that reductions in state taxes are not a charade, in the sense that they pass those tax burdens along to our local real-property-tax payers," said Thomas S. Gulotta, the Nassau County executive.
Herbert London, the Republican candidate for state comptroller, expressed similar concerns. But Mr. London, who had criticized Mr. Pataki for not releasing the plan earlier, praised his proposals yesterday as "significant breakthroughs."
In campaigning, Mr. Pataki has talked of not just cutting the personal income tax but also eliminating a business tax, known as the corporate surcharge, next year. But yesterday, in an apparent shift, his campaign said he could not promise to eliminate the surcharge in 1995. The tax is scheduled to be phased out by 1997.
"He has said he wants to eliminate it next year, but his priority is to do the personal income tax," said Zenia Mucha, Mr. Pataki's campaign spokeswoman.

 CORRECTION:
A chart on Friday about State Senator George E. Pataki's proposal to cut New York's state income tax misstated one example of the tax prospects under existing law. After the last stage of a tax reduction that is to be completed by April 1, 1996, a taxpayer earning $13,000 would get a refund of $590, not $509.


GRAPHIC: Thomas J. Marine, a partner at Price Waterhouse who heads the firm's Multistate Tax Consulting Practice, compared what families at a number of income levels would pay under State Senator George E. Pataki's tax cut proposals with what they pay now. The result would be an across-the-board tax cut, he said, because it is not a complex plan.
Graph: "CLOSE-UP: What Pataki's Tax Cut Would Mean"
 Senator Pataki is "basically dropping the rates" and going from five or six brackets to two, he said, and giving tax credits of $200 per dependent. That amounts to $120 to $160 of tax savings, compared with the current $1,000 deduction per dependent, he said, so big families would realize a substantial savings under the Pataki plan.
 Credits reduce taxes dollar for dollar, while deductions reduce income and the actual dollar savings depend on the tax bracket. A person in the top New York bracket would save $78.75 with a $1,000 deduction.
 Table shows how Pataki's plan would affect the taxes of various gross income groups. (pg. B6)

HEADLINE: Economy Is Strong, Data Show

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Fresh signs of persistent economic vigor emerged today as the Government published upbeat reports on housing and employment, while raising for a second time its estimate of total output during the spring.
Another official report showed stepped-up inflation for imported goods, reflecting, in part, the decline of the dollar. 
 Taken together, the various figures fanned fears that overly rapid growth could revive inflation, and could lead the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates again, perhaps after next week's monthly job report for September, to slow the economy down.
"It looks like the economy's snapping back," said Joshua N. Feinman, an economist at Bankers Trust. He added that the Fed's inaction on rates when it met to consider raising them two days ago could prove short-lived.
Although none of today's reports was particularly compelling on its own, the combined force -- all in the same direction -- was enough to push interest rates higher and thereby depress the stock market.
"The system, I think, is generating economic growth that is still well above the 2 1/2 percent that is supposed to be the trend" over the long term, said Richard Aspinwall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan.
First-time claims for unemployment benefits, which analysts had expected to rise a bit, fell 11,000 last week to 310,000, the lowest level of the year, the Labor Department reported.
More importantly, this fit a pattern of unmistakable improvement in recent months; the four-week claims average eased to 322,000 for the period ended on Saturday.
The buoyant labor market, analysts said, has helped blunt the impact that rising interest rates have had on housing. Conventional mortgages command about two percentage points more than they did at their lows last autumn.
Today, the Departemtns of Commerce andHousing and Urban Development reported that sales of new single-family homes climbed 9.7 percent in August, paced by a huge, although statistically suspect, jump in the Northeast.
This advance, the strongest since September 1993, was also better than expected and included gains in all four major regions but the South. Sales were revised downward for July, but that revision was nearly offset by an upward adjustment for June.
The increase in the Northeast was an eye-popping 82.1 percent, but this was from a much lower level than other regions, and analysts said it was undoubtedly a fluke.
Nationally, sales were 703,000 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, with 102,000 in the Northeast (up from 56,000), 117,000 in the Midwest (up from 113,000), 217,000 in the West (up from 194,000) and 267,000 in the South (down from 278,000).
The report on gross domestic product showed output of goods and services expanded at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the second quarter. A month ago the pace was thought to have been 3.8 percent; the initial estimate, made in late July, was 3.7 percent.
The biggest factor in the latest update was higher business inventories, much of it farmers' holdings of cattle. But while the second quarter is now seen to have been eight-tenths of a point stronger than the January-March period, when the growth rate was 3.3 percent, analysts note that much of the strength consisted of goods produced but not yet sold. This implies that there will be a significantly lower gain, perhaps only half as much, in the quarter that ends Friday, as inventories are worked off.
The fixed-weight price index for gross domestic purchases was revised back to the 3.2 percent inflation rate that was initially reported in July. Last month it had ticked up to 3.3 percent.
But evidence mounted today that inflation has picked up in recent months. The Labor Department found that the price of imported goods other than oil surged six-tenths of 1 percent for the second straight month, double the average advance during the period of March through June.
This partly reflected the dollar's decline in world currency markets, which means that more American currency is needed to buy a quantity of foreign goods or services than previously.
The American Business Conference, a group of chief executives at middle-sized companies, predicted today that the final three months of the year would be marked by "continued growth, although at a slower pace and accompanied by early warning signs of inflation."
And a survey of 3,000 executives by the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation found that prospects for higher sales, profits and hiring during the fourth quarter "decreased moderately" with economic growth "one notch slower by the end of the year."
Today's housing report showed that builders' inventories of new homes would last 5.7 months at the August sales pace, down from 6 months at the end of July.
The median new home price for last month's sales was $134,000, the departments found, up from $125,000 in July. This, analysts cautioned, undoubtedly reflected a change in the mix of homes changing hands, as well as price appreciation.
