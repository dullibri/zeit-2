HEADLINE: Big New Trade Gap Deepens Clinton's Political Problems

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit set yet another record in May, despite remarkably strong exports, compounding a political problem for the Clinton Administration, which is trying to portray its string of trade agreements in Asia and North America as its greatest foreign policy success.
The Commerce Department said today that the deficit was $11.4 billion for the month, just slightly above the April deficit but more than $1 billion higher than many economists expected. President Clinton's economic advisers, increasingly attuned to the politics of the monthly statistics, said that a close look at the figures demonstrated the economy's continued strength. 
 Still, the trade deficit with Japan, which declined slightly from the April level, is running 8 percent ahead of last year's pace, when it reached an annualized $66 billion, a record at the time. Similarly, the gaps with China and Mexico continued to widen sharply.
The Administration's fear is that the deficits with the biggest American trading partners will be easy grist for the Republicans next year. The automotive trade agreement with Japan reached late last month has come under sharp criticism from Republican contenders for the Presidential nomination, and in the aftermath of Mexico's economic debacle late last year, there has been carping in both parties about the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mr. Clinton is still trying to quell periodic rebellions in his own party over his advocacy of free trade, and today, Representative Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon cited the most recent figures in a letter to House members calling for a commission to re-examine trade policy. Specifically he opposed an expansion of the North American trade pact; this fall, the White House will try to gain accession to the agreement for Chile.
The Commerce Department figures showed that exports of goods and services in May totaled $64.8 billion, and imports were $76.2 billion. In almost every key category, both imports and exports rose: Semiconductor exports, for example, were up nearly 11 percent for the year to date, to $25.46 billion, but imports surged 43 percent from a lower base. Similar trends apply to autos and auto parts.
The best light that the Administration can place on the figures is that exports continue to rise strongly despite trading partners' problems. Canada's economy is in the doldrums, Japan has been unable to lift itself out of recession, and Mexico, seeking to restore itself to financial health, has vastly reduced the consumption of foreign-made goods.
The problem is imports, which rose 1.1 percent in May. Economists had expected a drop because of the weakness of the dollar and a presumed cooling of the American economy. Instead, for the fourth time this year, imports set a monthly record.
"I really don't see this as a political problem because when you look at the imports, they are all the kind of capital goods that show that manufacturers are still buying and expanding," said Jeffrey E. Garten, Under Secretary of Commerce for international trade. "That is exactly what you want to see."
But if the trend continues, and most economists think that it will until early next year, the widening deficits will grow increasingly difficult to explain. The Administration would obviously like to see a decline over the next few months, so it could declare that the succession of market-opening agreements are beginning to work.
Some probably are working. There are signs that exports of flat glass to Japan are on the rise, after an agreement reached last fall. In a speech this week to the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan, Ambassador Walter F. Mondale said, "Sectors that were once the hottest points of contention are now showing the highest growth rates." Mr. Mondale cited the sales of American beef in Japanese supermarkets and semiconductor sales to Japanese electronics concerns.
"When we reached an agreement to open the cellular phone market in the Tokyo-Nagoya corridor a year ago last April, we were greeted with sharp, acrimonious resistance," he said, but now Motorola, which pressed the complaint, "has about a 25 percent share of the cell-phone handset market."
Today, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, made the case that there were small signs of progress in the Administration's most prominent other Asian trouble area: China. In May, the American deficit with China rose to $2.22 billion, or half the monthly deficit with Japan. The deficit for the first five months of the year totals $9.23 billion, and exports and imports are growing 25 percent a year. That presages continuing economic tension, at a time that disputes over human rights and China's suspected export of missile technology have greatly worsened relations.
"Clearly our trade deficit with China will go on for some time," Mr. Kantor said. "But the pace of growth in the deficit is narrowing, and that gives us some reason for optimism."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 24, 1995, Monday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Wednesday about the United States trade deficit in May referred incorrectly to the ranking of the $11.4 billion deficit. It was a record, but only for the period since January 1992, when the Government changed the way it calculates the figures. While it is hard to compare the new calculations with earlier ones, other Government statistics indicate that the monthly deficit was consistently larger in 1986 and 1987 than in recent months.

HEADLINE: About Real Estate;
A Los Angeles Tenant For I.B.M.'s Extra Space

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 18

 BODY:
The Los Angeles Unified School District has become an unexpected beneficiary of efforts by the International Business Machines Corporation to consolidate its worldwide operations.
I.B.M. has tried for two years to find a subtenant for one-quarter of the 45-floor building on Grand Avenue that bears its name. After engineers found the school district's decades-old business office unsafe, the district recently agreed to a $35 million lease in the I.B.M. building. 
 Brokers say the deal, which will initially cost the district a below-market annual rate of $8.50 a square foot for 273,559 square feet, shows how some tenants are driving bargains in markets where recession has curbed demand for space.
I.B.M. has 500 employees in the building and needs just 125,000 square feet. The company, in an effort to cut costs, has been consolidating its operations, leaving the equivalent space of 20 high-rise buildings vacant last year.
Brokers and school officials say I.B.M. is paying around $32 a square foot on a lease that expires in 1999. Some building tenants are paying as much as $39 a square foot, according to executives involved in the negotiations. I.B.M.'s willingness to subsidize the district's rent shows the lengths some lessees will go to reduce their losses.
"A big tenant in today's market is hard to come by," said Peter Johnston, a senior vice president of Maguire Thomas Partners, the building's developer. Maguire, I.B.M. and JMB Realty are equal owners in the building.
When the I.B.M. building was completed in 1983 at a cost of $180 million, the company occupied 600,000 of the one million square feet in the South Tower, as it is known. The tower is part of the two-building Wells Fargo Center. The center's development is credited with helping revitalize the city's central business district. Nearby are luxury high-rise condominiums and the city's contemporary art museum.
Since 1989, eight new high-rise office buildings have opened their marble-lined lobbies, glutting downtown with 7.8 million square feet of new space. Takers have been few as a deep recession forced cutbacks by traditional downtown tenants.
Given market conditions in downtown, I.B.M.'s negotiating strategy is understandable. In the year's first half, the area's vacancy rate stood at 24 percent and average lease rates in prime office buildings were $18 a square foot. Nearly eight million square feet is unoccupied, including more than one million feet that tenants want to sublease to others.
The 24 percent vacancy rate compares with vacancy rates of 12.8 percent in midtown Manhattan, 18 percent in Chicago, and 9.2 in San Francisco. The only major metropolitan area with a higher rate is Dallas at 33.9 percent, according to CB Commercial, a real estate brokerage firm.
The school district's lease was signed in February and 1,000 of its business service employees began to move uptown in May from a 1913 building on San Pedro Street near the garment center. The district has 56,000 employees.
In December, nearly a year after the Northridge quake, engineering reports confirmed that the district's business service office lacked lateral support and would be unsafe if a moderate quake struck nearby. Improvements would cost $17 million and take a year. The district's board members wanted employees out quickly.
"'We had blown off this building because we were concerned it was too expensive and we were concerned about image," said Robert Niccum, the district's director of real estate.
A three-way competition for the district lease helped drive down lease rates, said Lynn Williams of Cushman Realty, which represented the district.
So did the district's willingness to use I.B.M.'s space as is, without high-priced tenant improvements, Ms. Williams said. Paint and carpeting alone can add $10 a square foot to a lease and can soar to $60 in an unimproved building, she said.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Says Economy's Low May Be Past

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, gave a favorable portrayal of the economy's health to a House panel today, which some traders in the financial markets viewed as making further interest-rate cuts unlikely soon.
His comments, while open to conflicting interpretations, contributed to big early-afternoon selloffs in the bond and stock markets. 
 A little less than a month ago, Mr. Greenspan had warned a New York audience that the economy seemed to be facing the increased risk of a modest recession. Today, by contrast, he said that "more recent evidence suggests that we may have passed the point of maximum risk."
Ever cautious, Mr. Greenspan added, "But we have certainly not yet reached the point at which no risk of undue economic weakness remains."
Economic growth is likely to resume in the coming months and continue into next year, the Fed chief told a House Banking subcommittee in his semiannual report to Congress on the state of the economy. The risks of inflation have faded, he said, banks are in sound financial condition to lend, businesses and consumers are optimistic, and companies' inventories of unsold goods appear to have dwindled. All that, he said, should lay the foundation for renewed expansion after a pause in the second quarter.
"Going forward, of the several credible outlooks, the most probable is for an upturn in the growth rate of final sales and real gross domestic product over the rest of this year, and a moderate pace of expansion next year with the economy operating in the neighborhood of its potential," Mr. Greenspan said.
But he also left the door open to further interest-rate cuts if inflation remained subdued. "As I noted in my February testimony," he said, "easing would be appropriate if underlying forces were clearly pointing toward reduced inflation pressures in the future."
A lot of financial analysts and traders had been more pessimistic about the economy's health, and thought until today that Mr. Greenspan might follow up the interest-rate reduction two weeks ago by again lowering rates in August or September to help maintain economic growth. But his ambiguous statements today left many disappointed.
"The market is selling off in part because of what he didn't say rather than what he did say," said Sung W. Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. "We were all looking for some encouragement from Chairman Greenspan that there would be further cuts in interest rates."
Other analysts thought that Mr. Greenspan gave no clear signal at all about the future course of interest rates. They contended that the bond market overreacted by falling sharply, followed by a steep slide in the stock market.
"Chairman Greenspan's testimony was quite in line with expectations," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers. "He didn't promise any further reductions in interest rates, but in no way could he do that."
In yet a third view, a few analysts said that Mr. Greenspan, despite the performance of the financial markets today, had signaled in his testimony on inflation that more interest-rate cuts could be on the way. The Fed chief's comments "certainly suggested a scenario that would lead to additional rate cuts in the coming months," said John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers.
On July 6, the central bank's interest-rate-setting panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, cut one of the short-term rates it controls by one-quarter of a percentage point, the smallest of its rate-reduction options. Some Democrats on the House Banking subcommittee said today that it should have gone further.
"While raising or lowering interest rates a little sends a signal, perhaps at this point we need more than a signal," said Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts.
But the Republican majority greeted Mr. Greenspan's testimony in terms bordering on reverence.
"The summation of anyone listening to what's occurred today just underscores the imperative need for a professional, competent, independent Federal Reserve system," said Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, the Banking Committee chairman, "and without it, I think stability in this country and around the world would be substantially lessened."
Mr. Greenspan refused to discuss specific tax policies or spending cuts under consideration on Capitol Hill, but he did urge Congress to balance the budget and hinted that the Fed might adjust its policies if significant steps were taken.
"Clearly, the Federal Reserve will have to watch this process carefully," he said, "and take the likely effects of fiscal policy into account in considering the appropriate stance in monetary policy. But there is no doubt, in my judgment, that the net result of moving to budget balance will be a more efficient, more productive U.S. economy."
As usual, Mr. Greenspan avoided questions about the future path of specific markets like the bond, foreign exchange or gold market. But he did point out beneficial side effects of the rise this year in stock and bond prices.
"The positive implications of the rally in financial markets for household debt-service burdens and wealth, and for the cost of capital to business, augur well for spending on consumer durables, on housing and on plant and equipment," he said. He did not speculate on how, if at all, a sustained fall in financial markets might affect the pace of spending and overall economic growth.
Reflecting the consensus of the Federal Open Market Committee, Mr. Greenspan predicted that the economy might grow at a rate of 1.5 percent to 2 percent for all of 1995, and 2.5 percent next year. He estimated that consumer-price inflation would run in a range of 3.125 percent to 3.375 percent this year and slow to the range of 2.875 percent to 3.25 percent next year.
And he forecast that unemployment would rise from 5.6 percent last month to somewhere between 5.75 percent and 6.125 percent by the fourth quarter of this year.

HEADLINE: President Shows Fervent Support For Goals of Affirmative Action

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
Four months after hinting that he might scale back Federal preference programs based on race and sex in the face of Republican demands to end them, President Clinton today issued a ringing reaffirmation of the goals and results of affirmative action, saying it has been good for America.
"Affirmative action has not always been perfect, and affirmative action should not go on forever," Mr. Clinton said in a speech at the National Archives. "It should be changed now to take care of those things that are wrong, and it should be retired when its job is done. 
 "I am resolved that that day will come, but the evidence suggests, indeed screams, that that day has not come. The job of ending discrimination in this country is not over." [Excerpts, Page B10.]
Administration aides said the White House had concluded not only that most such programs had worked well, but also that the political risks of tinkering with them now far outweighed any benefit Mr. Clinton might gain in new support from moderate voters. In particular, they said, it became apparent that the programs benefited not just minorities but also women, whose electoral support the President needs.
The White House portrayed the President's speech today as the latest in a series of recent efforts to find common ground on divisive issues like Federal spending, violence on television and prayer in the schools. Though his talk was low-key, he made no apologies for his views.
"We should have a simple slogan," Mr. Clinton said, in what seemed a rhyming nod to Jesse Jackson, who has been harshly skeptical of any effort to diminish affirmative action. "Mend it, but don't end it."
Though affirmative action had bipartisan support when programs were begun 25 years ago, Republicans were quick to criticize the President today as defending the status quo. "He should have said end it; you can't mend it," said Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a Presidential hopeful who is seeking to roll back his state's affirmative-action programs. The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, who agreed Tuesday to delay consideration of a bill to curtail affirmative action, perhaps until next year, renewed his vow to introduce legislation "to get the Federal Government out of the group-preference business."
Several of the prominent civil rights and political leaders in the President's invited audience this morning suggested he would gain by standing his ground on an issue that has long been one of his central concerns as a post-civil rights era Southern politician.
Mr. Clinton ordered all Federal agencies to review their affirmative-action programs and eliminate or reshape any that impose a quota, create a preference for unqualified people, foster reverse discrimination or continue after their anti-discrimination purposes has been achieved. And he sketched plans for a new program that would set aside some Federal contracts for individuals, regardless of race or sex, if their businesses or employees were located in poor areas.
But the President proposed no elimination of any program, drew back from any suggestion that affirmative action needed profound rethinking and stood foursquare against arguments from Republicans and conservative Democrats alike that such programs had outlived their usefulness.
He imbued the 45-minute talk with personal history, recalling that the poll tax and segregated schools and washrooms were a facts of life in his Arkansas youth and that improvements did "not happen as some sort of random, evolutionary drift" but thanks to hard work, legal challenges and personal courage.
"I think his speech will help him tremendously at the grass-roots level," said Myrlie Evers-Williams, chairwoman of the National Association of Colored People and the widow of the Medgar Evers, the civil rights leader who was assassinated in Mississippi in 1963. "He has shown policies that I think the public will appreciate, and determined not to waver. It was a brave speech."
Mr. Jackson, who got a telephone briefing on the speech from Mr. Clinton on Tuesday, said today that the President "set a good moral tone for the country" and "spoke to America's hopes and not its fears." He complained, though, that the Administration's review took so long that while Mr. Clinton "was in the stands reviewing and reflecting, the opposition was on the field scoring points."
The moderate Democratic Leadership Council, which which has long urged phasing out affirmative action in favor of broader economic development efforts, was less effusive. Its president, Al From, said, "I hope the President's speech today is the first step in this direction."
For his part, Mr. Clinton gave "angry white men" their due, acknowledging that "some people are honestly concerned about the times affirmative action doesn't work, when it's done in the wrong way."
Mr. Clinton vowed that when the Administration found such cases, it would fight them in court, by filing reverse discrimination suits if necessary. "Most of these suits, however, affect women and minorities for a simple reason: because the vast majority of discrimination in America is still discrimination against them."
At another point he said: "Let me be clear about what affirmative action must not mean and what I won't allow it to be.
"It does not mean, and I don't favor, the unjustified preference of the unqualified over the qualified of any race or gender. It doesn't mean -- and I don't favor -- numerical quotas. It doesn't mean, and I don't favor, rejection or selection of any employee or student solely on the basis of race or gender without regard to merit."
George Stephanopoulos, the senior Presidential adviser who supervised the review of preference programs for the White House, said the President had determined not to single out any particular program for change or elimination pending the completion of detailed new guidelines by the Justice Department instructing agencies on compliance with a recent Supreme Court decision, Adarand Constructors v. Pena, that imposed strict new limits on race-based preference programs, requiring that they be narrowly tailored to remedy past discrimination.

HEADLINE: 200 California Students Jeer Bid to End Affirmative Action

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 19

 BODY:
A boisterous group of 200 University of California students hissed, booed and waved placards during an emotional meeting here with a dozen members of the university's board as they debated proposals to eliminate affirmative-action policies at the university's nine campuses.
The proposals are scheduled to come before the full 26 regents on Thursday at a formal meeting presided over by Gov. Pete Wilson, who has said he approves of terminating policies that use race, sex, religion or national origin as a criterion for admission to the university, as well as for hiring and contracting. 
 The proposals would require the university administration and the faculty senate to suggest substitute criteria that would allow admissions officers to consider matters like an applicant's socioeconomic status.
This afternoon's meeting was called by the university in the hope of defusing the issue, but student leaders and followers of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has been here for several days, promised even more vigorous demonstrations, including a "sing-in" led by Mr. Jackson at the regents meeting on Thursday.
Speaking in a format that permitted three-minute speeches and questions to the regents, a number of students deplored what they said was the intrusion of politics into the debate over affirmative action.
Robin Haaland, a third-year law student at the campus in Hastings, said: "I have been shocked and disgusted by the political maneuvering by Gov. Pete Wilson. He's coming here because of his own political agenda. This is about politicians taking advantage of people's fears about an unstable economy and people's racism."
He was vigorously cheered, but several regents, most of whom are appointed to 12-year terms by the Governor, defended Mr. Wilson's position.
A distinct minority supported the resolutions, but speakers taking that position were greeted with boos and the pumping up and down of signs reading "LIES!"

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Clinton Talk on Affirmative Action

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's speech yesterday at the National Archives on Federal affirmative-action programs as recorded by Federal News Service, a transcription company:
In recent weeks, I have begun a conversation with the American people about our fate and our duty to prepare our nation not only to meet the new century but to live and lead in a world transformed to a degree seldom seen in all of our history. Much of this change is good, but it is not all good, and all of us are affected by it. Therefore, we must reach beyond our fears and our divisions to a new time of great and common purpose. 
 Our challenge is twofold: first, to restore the American dream of opportunity and the American value of responsibility; and second, to bring our country together amid all our diversity into a stronger community so that we can find common ground and move forward as one.
More than ever, these two endeavors are inseparable. I am absolutely convinced we cannot restore economic opportunity or solve our social problems unless we find a way to bring the American people together. To bring our people together, we must openly and honestly deal with the issues that divide us. . . .
Our search to find ways to move more quickly to equal opportunity led to the development of what we now call affirmative action. The purpose of affirmative action is to give our nation a way to finally address the systemic exclusion of individuals of talent, on the basis of their gender or race, from opportunities to develop, perform, achieve and contribute. Affirmative action is an effort to develop a systematic approach to open the doors of education, employment, and business development opportunities to qualified individuals who happen to be members of groups that have experienced long-standing and persistent discrimination. . . .
When affirmative action is done right, it is flexible, it is fair and it works.
I know some people are honestly concerned about the times affirmative action doesn't work, when it's done in the wrong way. And I know there are times when some employers don't use it in the right way. They may cut corners and treat a flexible goal as a quota. They may give opportunities to people who are unqualified instead of those who deserve it. They may in so doing allow a different kind of discrimination. When this happens it is also wrong, but it isn't affirmative action, and it is not legal.
So when our Administration finds cases of that sort, we will enforce the law aggressively. The Justice Department files hundreds of cases every year attacking discrimination in employment, including suits on behalf of white males.
Most of these suits, however, affect women and minorities for a simple reason: because the vast majority of discrimination in America is still discrimination against them. . . .
I am resolved that that day will come, but the evidence suggests, indeed screams, that that day has not come. The job of ending discrimination in this country is not over. That should not be surprising. We had slavery for centuries before the passage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. We waited another 100 years for the civil rights legislation. Women have had the vote less than 100 years. We have always had difficulty with these things, as most societies do. But we are making more progress than many people.
Based on the evidence, the job is not done. So, here is what I think. We should, we should reaffirm the principle of affirmative action and fix the practices. We should have a simple slogan: mend it but don't end it.

HEADLINE: China's Plans to Make Family Car Are Receding, Official Says

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 19

 BODY:
China's "family car" project, an idea that got Western auto makers salivating when they were invited to submit prototypes last year, is likely to be delayed until well into the next century, a senior Chinese official said today.
In the first public comments on the family car by a senior member of China's car bureaucracy since last fall, Huang Fuheng, general manager of the China National Automotive Industry Sales Corporation, said that making family cars salable would be a "very long and very complicated" process. 
 "It's going to be 10 or 15 years before a family car becomes feasible in China," Mr. Huang said in an interview. "It's a complicated process, not something that we can do in a day."
When Beijing held an exhibition for 20 leading foreign car makers last September, some officials suggested China would choose a single model, and could start producing them within five years.
Ford Motor Company recommended a model from its Fiesta line in Europe. Mitsubishi of Japan offered a mini-van while General Motors pushed a Corsa model from Adam Opel, its German subsidiary.
But Chinese auto officials fell silent after the exhibition, causing confusion among car makers. Mr. Huang's comments, coming shortly after an internal Government meeting on the family car project, indicated that car officials are divided about how to proceed.
"There are some people in our planning departments who favor a single model," Mr. Huang said. "My idea is that the family car should not be done in one factory, or in one model. There are several different kinds of cars needed in China."
He also conceded that it would be hard to meet the original demands set out by Chinese car bureaucrats: that it will be modern, with air-conditioning and anti-lock brakes, be fuel-efficient and cost less than $10,000.
"If you make a car that's too old a model, no one will want it; if you make it fully modern, it will be too expensive," he said.
The vast majority of the 1.4 million vehicles made in China last year were trucks; passenger cars totaled only 250,000, and most of those were purchased by Government work units, which can afford a $30,000-$50,000 sedan for their senior officials.
Chinese officials said last year that they want to consolidate the domestic market -- now composed of 120 or so small, inefficient plants making trucks -- into a handful of large companies that can push total production to 3 million by 2000, with more than a million of them cars. By 2010, they said, China should be producing 8 million vehicles, making it the world's second-largest auto market, after the United States.
Their comments, and China's booming economy persuaded several foreign auto makers that it was time to enter the Chinese market seriously. Yet the market they are entering is plagued by a poor supply network, an inexperienced labor force, and high tariffs that limit imports of autos and parts.
Foreign auto executives said today that Mr. Huang's comments clarified a situation they had already begun to sense: that priority is likely to be given to building a car component industry, and that plans for several new passenger car projects will be pared down.
"The family car is definitely way down the line," said Stephanie Hallford, a Ford executive in China. "For him to say that is not really out of context from what we've understood."

HEADLINE: A Restoration Is Announced For 42d Street

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

 BODY:
The resurrection of 42d Street took a critical step forward yesterday as a Toronto-based production company announced plans to transform two historic buildings into one state-of-the-art theater to be used for large-scale musical productions.
By combining the two theaters, the Lyric and the Academy, the company said it plans to create a 1,850-seat venue that will be used for the type of big, lavish musicals that in recent years have driven the growth of ticket sales on Broadway. 
 The company, Livent Inc., is the producer of the Tony Award-winning musicals "Show Boat" and "Kiss of the Spider Woman."
The opportunity to return the rundown theaters to their original use arose after city and state officials failed to reach an agreement with the entertainment company Viacom, which wanted to turn the theaters into music production studios for its MTV operations.
Viacom refused to comment on why it could not reach an agreement, but a company spokesman said Viacom was considering other sites on 42d Street and the surrounding area.
Livent's chairman and chief executive, Garth H. Drabinsky, said he had been interested in the property for several months and that when Viacom's option expired in May, "We seized the moment."
Mr. Drabinsky, an entrepreneur known for his showmanship and expensive taste, asserted that with Livent's as-yet unnamed theater and the Walt Disney Company's plan to restore the New Amsterdam Theater across the street, "The two most significant venues for musical theater will be on 42d Street."
Disney is expected to announce today that it has completed terms with the city and state to undertake a $34 million restoration of the New Amsterdam, a 92-year-old theater with glorious Art Nouveau detail and a fabled history.
Disney is expected to use the theater to present extravagant productions like its "Beauty and the Beast," which is playing at the Palace Theater. Livent's production of "Show Boat," a lavish revival, has been running at the Gershwin Theater since last October.
Under the terms of a tentative agreement signed with the New 42d Street, the nonprofit organization overseeing the rehabilitation of many theaters on the street, Livent has a nine-month option on the two theaters and will spend that time completing terms of its lease and seeking necessary design and landmark preservation approvals from the city.
Livent and New 42d Street officials refused to reveal the amount that the company is expected to invest in the project, but Mr. Drabinsky cited, as a guideline, the company's recent restoration of the 2,200-seat Pantages Theater in Toronto, which cost about $17.5 million in United States dollars. "That will give you a ballpark of where we are," he said. "We intend to do the same kind of faithful restoration."
Cora Cahan, president of the New 42d Street, said the plan did not call for any public subsidies, such as in the case of Disney, which is expected to finance about 75 percent of the New Amsterdam's costs with low-interest loans provided by the city.
But other theater executives expressed some skepticism about the Livent plan. Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn, the owner of five Broadway theaters, said that while there is a real need for theaters with large stage space and enough seating to produce and support costly musicals, making a profit from the two theaters could prove difficult.
"There's desperate need on Broadway for exactly what he's getting," Mr. Landesman said of Mr. Drabinsky. "That will be the most sought-after venue in the city, but at what cost? We've all been looking at 42d Street, and we can't see any configuration that works economically."
Small Broadway playhouses are plentiful, and some are vacant. However, the ones large enough to house big musicals are in short supply, and those that do exist are booked with long-running engagements. "Phantom of the Opera," for example, has been running at the Majestic Theater since 1988.
Driven by such popular musicals, Broadway attendance has continued a four-year climb, hitting its highest level in 12 years during the 1994-95 season, according to the League of American Theaters and Producers, an industry trade group.
The Lyric and the Academy both have landmark status. The new combined theater will incorporate historic elements and detail, according to Livent, which said it would release architectural renderings of the project within the next 60 days. Both theaters have facades on 42d and 43d Streets, and under Livent's plan, the primary entrance will be the lobby of the Lyric, on the north side of 42d, just west of Times Square. The 42d Street Academy entrance would be used for ancillary theater purposes, and the facades of both theaters, on both streets, will be restored consistent with their original character.
The Academy, originally known as the Apollo, was built in 1920 by the Selwyn brothers and played host to such performers as W.C. Fields, Ethel Merman and Jimmy Durante. In 1987, it was renamed the Academy, and since then it has been used mainly for pop music concerts.
The Lyric, however, has been closed to the public for the last few years and was last used for motion pictures. It was built in 1903 by the composer Reginald De Koven. The Shubert Brothers built their empire inside the Lyric, with their offices upstairs and their productions onstage. Unlike in the Apollo, much of the Lyric's original interior has been destroyed.
The New 42d, set up in 1990 by the city and state, has responsibility for overseeing the rehabilitation of six theaters on the street. Its first project, the New Victory Theater, will be a nonprofit operation dedicated to young people; it is scheduled to open in December. "We are literally bringing this fabled street back to the future," Ms. Cahan said.

Broad Selloff Hits Treasury Issues Hard

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices tumbled yesterday in a broad selloff after comments by the Federal Reserve chairman dashed any remaining hope for another cut in interest rates this summer.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 19/32 , to 10921/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, surged to 6.86 percent, from 6.76 percent on Tuesday. The long-bond yield is at its highest since May 23. Prices of shorter-term maturities also fell sharply, with the yield on the two-year note rising to 5.86 percent from 5.80 percent. 
 The selloff came after the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, told a Housing Banking subcommittee that the risks of both inflation and a recession had faded and that he expected a moderate expansion next year. His optimistic assessment of the economy suggested that the Fed would break with its recent practice of using more than a single rate cut to renew the economy's growth, traders said.
"People are perhaps not so sure we're guaranteed that anymore," said Patrick Retzer, who manages the $68 million Heartland U.S. Government Securities Fund in Milwaukee.
Many traders had still been expecting a rate cut in August since July 6, when the Fed lowered its target for overnight bank loan rates a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.75 percent. Treasury prices, however, have been lower since a report on Friday showed surprising strength in retail sales, throwing cold water on those expectations. That report and other recent data have indicated that the economy has not slowed as sharply as previously thought.
In his testimony yesterday, Mr. Greenspan said more rate cuts would be appropriate if "underlying forces were clearly pointing toward reduced inflation pressures in the future." Still, the Fed chief gave no hint he expected to be cutting rates again soon.
"It's not that the market doesn't like what he's said, it's more what he didn't say," said Matthew Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston.
The prospect of Treasury auctions and a deluge of new corporate bonds is also pushing yields higher, traders said. The Government will sell about $194.2 billion of securities, including 30-year bonds, in the next four weeks, according to MMS International.
"If the corporate supply continues, that is a lot to digest," said Mark Sauvigne, a trader at Chemical Securities. Companies sold more than $82 billion since early April to lock in lower borrowing costs as interest rates plunged to their lowest level in about a year.
The recent rise in bond yields probably will not deter companies from selling more bonds at what are still "relatively low borrowing rates," said Bob Auwaerter, who manages $7.5 billion of fixed-income securities at the Vanguard Group in Malvern, Pa.
RJR Nabisco Inc. led four companies selling $1.35 billion of bonds yesterday. It sold $650 million worth of bonds, 30 percent more than originally planned.
The two-part sale included $400 million of six-year notes priced to yield 8.043 percent, or 187.5 basis points more than the six-year Treasury note. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Also sold was $250 million of 12-year notes yielding 8.819 percent, or 241.9 basis points more than the 10-year Treasury note.
In other corporate sales, the First Data Corporation of Hackensack, N.J., a credit card processor, sold $200 million of 10-year notes, and the Vesta Insurance Group of Birmingham, Ala, sold $100 million of 30-year bonds.
Among asset-backed sales, Federated Department Stores and the Advanta Corporation sold a total of $1.15 billion of repackaged credit card loans.
In the junk-bond market, Paging Network Inc. sold $400 million of 12-year notes, or 60 percent more than originally planned.
In the municipal market, New Jersey obtained its lowest 20-year borrowing cost in almost 20 years in its auction of revenue refunding bonds for the state's Transportation Trust Fund Authority. Lehman Brothers won the bidding on the bonds and re-offered the 2015 maturity at a yield of 5.8 percent.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
For First Time in Two Years, Quarterly Net Falls at Ford

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., July 19

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company reported its first quarterly decline in profits in more than two years today, attributing the decline to the softening economy and the weak dollar.
Ford warned that at least the next quarter was also likely to be weak compared with last year, as the company writes off expensive new factory equipment and reduces production to introduce new cars and trucks, including the new version of the Ford Taurus. 
 But, applauding the Federal Reserve's decision to lower interest rates, Ford said it expected auto sales and the economy to rebound during the rest of the year, and then to continue growing slowly at least through 1998.
During the three months ending in June, Ford earned $1.57 billion, or $1.45 a share, down 8.2 percent from $1.71 billion a year ago. The results were below analysts' expectations, and some said today that they could not figure out why the company had disappointed them.
Shares of Ford fell 87.5 cents, to $30.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Ford, the No. 2 auto maker behind the General Motors Corporation, had a mixed quarter. Although its sales of cars and trucks slipped in terms of numbers worldwide, its total sales and revenue climbed an impressive 7.8 percent, to $36.4 billion. Ford attributed the increased revenue to buyers' decisions to opt for more expensive, if fewer, versions of cars and trucks.
Buyers choosing more expensive, and more expensively equipped, vehicles would generally mean more profit, since the company makes far more money on an Explorer sport utility, for example, than on an Escort subcompact car.
But in fact Ford's after-tax profit margins on auto sales worldwide shrank during the quarter, to 3.7 percent, from 4.3 percent a year ago, accounting for its decreased earnings.
Ford said that the lower volume of sales over all caused the drop-off, by leaving the company with fewer sales over which to spread out its fixed costs.
Further, Ford buys many parts, including big-ticket items like engines, from Japan and Germany. As a result, it said, the relative weakness of the dollar substantially drove up its costs during the quarter. David N. McCammon, Ford's vice president for finance, said currency fluctuations cost the company $125 million in the quarter.
But auto industry analysts said those factors were not enough to account for what they called surprisingly weak margins. "I was extremely disappointed," said Jack Kirnan, auto industry analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York. "There is something fundamental in the cost structure that I can't put my hands on that is allowing this deterioration to occur."
High product development costs, he said, could be eating into Ford's profits. Further, Ford may be equipping its vehicles with more expensive features than buyers will pay for, he said, preventing the company from raising prices high enough to offset the new costs.
David M. Garrity, auto industry analyst at Smith Barney, said he had expected to see better profits at Ford in part because it sold a higher proportion of light trucks in the quarter. But increased competition in that market segment may be starting to cut into profits. "Perhaps this quarter gives us an early indication of that," he said. "I was certainly looking for better margins, and was to some extent not satisfied with their explanation."
While Ford's sales were slightly low in the quarter, they did not fall as far as the industry's, and so the company gained market share. Ford finished the quarter with 26.2 percent of the car and truck market in the United States, compared to 25 percent a year ago.
Ford had to offer higher rebates and other incentives to customers to sell those vehicles. Incentives rose to an average of $760 a vehicle in the quarter, compared to $550 a year ago.
That change was far less drastic than the one reported on Tuesday by the Chrysler Corporation. Its average incentive jumped to $1,035, compared with $610 a year ago. Chrysler's earnings fell 85.9 percent in the quarter, to $135 million. The General Motors Corporation is expected to report its earnings on Thursday.
Without specifying the amount, Ford said today that its Mexican operations, with sales down 55 percent, were losing money because of the devaluation of the peso. "The market is a disaster," Mr. McCammon said.
Overseas, Ford's European operations turned in a strong quarter. Profits there almost doubled, climbing to $319 million from $167 million.
Mr. McCammon said interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve probably accounted for the sharp slowdown in auto sales during the first half of the year, which confounded the company's expecations. "The interest rate effect was probably greater than we realized," he said. But, he added, "I don't consider this all bad," since by restraining robust demand in the short term the Federal Reserve may have cleared the way for several years of modest growth.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
When it comes to farm subsidies, the G.O.P. walks a narrow line.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
THE most effective political salesmen often work on the thinnest margins. Consider the Congressional Republican leadership, which must walk a narrow line between new-fashioned, take-no-prisoners conservatism that intrigued voters in 1994 and old-fashioned, scratch-my-back coalition politics.
On the one hand, Republicans are committed to balancing the budget by 2002. On the other, they are as dependent as Democrats on interest groups that favor welfare -- in their case, corporate welfare. Perhaps nowhere is the contradiction as vivid as in the struggle over farm policy, a 60-year-old machine for increasing the incomes of favored farmers at the expense of taxpayers and consumers. 
 Cuts seem almost inevitable: the budget committees in both the House and Senate are asking farmers to spill blood along with other interests. The big question, suggests Edward Hudgins, director of regulatory studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, is whether the retreat will be purely tactical. "Farm lobbies are going to fight to preserve the underlying system," he predicts, accepting defeat on the size of subsidies rather than the fundamental character of the program.
Not so long ago, few questioned the notion that farming was too risky and too important to be left to the vagaries of free markets. Indeed, the need for a firm helping hand from Washington had a certain plausibility during the 1930's, when a quarter of Americans still scratched out a living on little farms and the Depression left farmers awash in commodities that could not be sold for prices that covered costs.
But that plausibility has been stretched ever thinner as farms consolidated and farming grew more efficient. Today the typical "family" farmer commands millions of dollars worth of land and machinery, and uses commodity futures markets to reduce the risks of price fluctuations.
The New Dealers who let the farm regulation genie out of the bottle probably could not follow the intricacies of the 750-page law that currently determines the price of milk, the output of walnuts, and the type of sweetener that ends up in Mountain Dew. But they would certainly sympathize with the underlying logic of using regulation to augment farm income.
For some key crops like wheat and cotton, farmers are paid the difference between a "target price" and the market price. For others Washington raises prices directly by limiting both production and imports. "It is a Federal crime to sell peanuts without a license," Mr. Hudgins says.
Growers of dozens of varieties of fruits and vegetables have been encouraged to create legal cartels, with the power to force individual farmers to destroy "excess" output. And since all this means that farm commodities are pricey, Washington follows the European Union's strategy of heavily subsidizing exports to keep them competitive in world markets.
Surprisingly, the opening shot in the war on what Karl Zinsmeister, an agricultural specialist at the American Enterprise Institute, calls "farm socialism," came from Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana. Mr. Lugar, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee and a Presidential hopeful, wants to eliminate export subsidies and trim "deficiency payments" linked to target prices. All told, he would cut $15 billion from a business-as-usual budget likely to cost $41 billion.
But the farm lobbies quickly went to work on the House and Senate budget committees, persuading them to recommend cuts of just $9 billion and $5.5 billion over five years, respectively. The idea, it seems, is to delay the mother of all battles over farm regulation until 2000, when the balanced budget deadline looms.
One may well wonder whether "later" is just another word for "never." For example, while Representive Dick Armey, the House majority leader, has railed against the sugar, tobacco and peanut programs, the fact that they cost the Government nothing -- consumers simply pay more because supply is artificially limited -- makes them far less vulnerable than the big-money subsidy programs, notably corn.
What's more, Mr. Hudgins notes, much of the political sentiment against subsidies comes from the correct assumption that the lion's share of benefits goes to large farmers. If the farm lobbies changed tactics, permitting narrower subsidies targets and making alliances with environmentalists who want to take land out of production, they might be able keep the system of regulation intact.
But Mr. Zinsmeister remains optimistic that revolutionary change is at hand. Diversification of the rural economy, he notes, is blurring the focus of farm-state Congressmen. And as a result, he says, the once-omnipotent farm lobby is on the verge of becoming a "nine-pound gorilla."
Equally important, Mr. Zinsmeister says, many farmers who viewed subsidies and the restrictions that came with them as a necessary evil are now ready to embrace free markets. "They resent being singled out," he argues. "But with everybody's goodies going," he predicts that farmers will bow to the inevitable.

HEADLINE: Defending Affirmative Action

 BODY:
In near-evangelical tones, President Clinton made the moral, legal and practical case yesterday for the embattled cause of affirmative action. It was a sermon the nation needed to hear from a President who can only be helped by exhibiting a strong core of principle. Instead of the aimlessness that has marked so many White House efforts, this speech offered the zest and forthrightness promised by the Bill Clinton of the '92 campaign. Gone, too, was the hair-splitting accommodationism of the recent speech on school prayer.
In an address notably free of apologies and political trimming, Mr. Clinton asserted that "when affirmative action is done right, it is flexible, it is fair, and it works." Instead of running for cover on specious claims of favoritism for minorities and women, Mr. Clinton met the critics straight on. "Let me be clear," he said. "Affirmative action has been good for America." 
 Indeed it has, as Mr. Clinton made clear by reviewing the history of employment and educational discrimination that the right wing's phony new egalitarians want to obliterate with a national dose of historical amnesia. Mr. Clinton forcefully asserted that the record of the past 30 years shows -- "indeed screams" -- that "the job of ending discrimination in this country is not over."
He was tactically smart to promise to correct practices that discredit affirmative action by, for example, cracking down on fraud perpetrated by contractors who put up a false front of minority status. By not getting tangled up in buzzwords like "quotas" and "preferences," Mr. Clinton was able to promise reform that would improve, not undercut, the crusade for fairness.
He assigned Vice President Gore the task of devising Federal contract systems that target economic disadvantage as well as race and gender, using the Federal purse to help areas that also contain concentrations of minorities.
No one could doubt, of course, whom the President had in mind when he condemned those who "use the anxieties of the middle class" to divide the nation over race and gender. As if called by name, two Republican candidates for his job spoke up with predictable churlishness. Gov. Pete Wilson of California lamely parodied the President, saying he should have "ended, not mended," affirmative action. And the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, ever fearful of being out-toughed by one of his party's bully boys, took the floor to say he would soon be introducing a bill to repeal affirmative action programs.
Mr. Clinton made effective use of last month's Supreme Court decision subjecting Federal contracting outreach programs to severe judicial scrutiny. Rather than kill the programs, he said, the Court had laid down a rigorous test based on a compelling public interest, a test he said he would apply. He pledged that his Administration would support only programs that avoid rigid quotas and reverse discrimination, advance only qualified workers and end when they have accomplished their purpose.
Plainly Mr. Clinton has calculated, correctly, that a platform of equivocation would do him no political good. There was hardly any point in trying to please those angry white men said to be abroad in the land by pretending not to believe in the principle of integrating the workplace.
Yet the political dopesters were predicting that this President might well inflict a little pain on minorities and women just to show his toughness to conservative critics. Instead he hinted that he perceived more good will and less anger in the racial majority than some politicians thought.
For the President's generous view of public opinion alone, for addressing the hoped-for sense of justice, there is reason for gratitude. Mr. Clinton took the high road, and the nation can hope he has accurately discerned a magnanimity that will let affirmative action live.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Soybeans, Silver and Copper Set The Pace as Commodities Fall

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Commodities with strong links to the stock and bond markets -- including soybeans, silver and copper -- took their cue from Wall Street's plunge and fell sharply yesterday .
Soybeans are sometimes viewed as an investment barometer among raw physical commodities, while silver and copper are heavily used by industry. 
 In addition, declines in lumber, cotton, energy and livestock prices helped drive the Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities down 2.78 points, to 231.43.
The declines in the financial markets were precipitated by comments by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, that indicated the Fed would not cut interest rates again this summer.
Weather forecasts calling for cooler, wetter weather in the Midwest also helped push down soybean prices, which leaped early this week after a record-breaking heat wave wilted crops.
"The forecast has cooled down," said Fred Gesser of Weather Express Inc. "This is a pretty big flip from yesterday and the day before."
 July soybeans fell 18.25 cents, to $6.17 a bushel, at the Chicago Board of Trade.
Silver prices tumbled sharply to new two-week lows as the selloff in stocks and bonds prompted traders to unload positions in metals as well.
On the Commodity Exchange of New York, the September silver contract settled 13.2 cents lower at $5.213 an ounce after earlier touching a low of $5.07.
Gold, which is sometimes viewed as a refuge from paper assets, also declined. August gold fell $1.70, to $388.40 an ounce, on the Comex.
 September copper fell to a low of $1.34 a pound, before recovering slightly to close 3.85 cents lower at $1.3475 a pound.
Lumber prices weakened after the Commerce Department released a disappointing housing starts figure for June. Housing starts last month fell one-tenth of 1 percent, while traders had expected a slight increase.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, September lumber dropped the daily limit of $10, to $278 for 1,000 board feet.
Prospects for an excellent cotton crop drove down October cotton the maximum 2 cents, to 75.67 cents a pound, on the New York Cotton Exchange.
Crude oil prices ended lower in reaction to slightly bearish weekly inventory data. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, August crude oil declined 2 cents, to $17.33 a barrel, and August gasoline fell 0.89 cent, to 52.69 cents a gallon.

BANKAMERICA CORP. (BAC,N)

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The BankAmerica Corporation said yesterday that earnings rose 23 percent in the second quarter, helped by its acquisition of the Continental Bank Corporation and a surge in lending revenue.
BankAmerica, the nation's second-largest banking company, earned $645 million, or $1.56 a share, up from $525 million, or $1.33 a share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier. The results surpassed Wall Street forecasts of $1.49 a share. 
 But while total revenue jumped 15 percent, to $3.3 billion, much of the growth came from its acquisition of the Continental Bank of Chicago in September.
BankAmerica, based in San Francisco, plans to focus on wringing more revenue from its existing businesses rather than join a wave of retail bank mergers and acquisitions, said Lewis Coleman, chief financial officer. "We are nervous of the longevity of retail branch banking and find the prices expensive," he said.
The second-quarter results showed how BankAmerica had put behind it problems with bad loans from the recession of the early 1990's, analysts said.
"I think they had been in a no-growth, or slow-growth, mode for so long," said Larry Vitale, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company. "Now that the clips have been taken off their wings, they can go out and make some loans."
BankAmerica posted a 19 percent surge in consumer and commercial lending in the quarter.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts a Steep Decline As Stocks and Bonds Tumble

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against many leading currencies yesterday as American stocks and bonds had a second consecutive day of steep losses.
The declines in the securities markets heightened concern that foreign investors would cut their stakes in American assets and sell dollars as a result. 
 Bonds and stocks tumbled after Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, made his semi-annual report to Congress and cast doubt on the prospects for another cut in interest rates anytime soon.
"It's been a tough day for stocks and bonds, and that can be chalked up to expectations for no further rate cuts," said Wayne Grigull, director of foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch in New York. "The concern about capital flowing out of the country has taken its toll on the dollar."
Ordinarily, an indication by the Fed chief that interest rates would not be cut would bolster the dollar since the prospect of steady or higher rates often helps the dollar by making dollar-denominated deposits more attractive.
Indeed, the dollar initially rose on Mr. Greenspan's comments. Many currency traders had been expecting another rate cut this summer ever since the Fed pushed short-term interest rates lower by a quarter of a percentage point on July 6.
When stocks and bonds tumbled, however, the dollar followed. The speed of the dollar's decline suggested investors were less wary about possible central bank intervention than they had been after the Fed and the Bank of Japan staged a surprise dollar-buying spree 12 days ago, traders said.
"The market's willing to sell off dollars swiftly, indicating they're not as concerned about intervention," said Michael Faust, international portfolio manager at Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser in San Mateo, Calif.
In New York trading, the dollar slumped to an eight-day low of 86.85 yen before settling at 87.32 yen, down from 88.40 yen on Tuesday. Traders speculated that the Fed might have bought dollars for yen on behalf of the Bank of Japan, muting the dollar's slide against the yen. The Fed and the Treasury declined to comment on their activities in the foreign exchange market.
The dollar fell as low as 1.3722 German marks, its lowest since May 9. It was last quoted at 1.3754 marks, down from 1.3899 marks on Tuesday. The British pound rose to $1.5985 from $1.5946.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Caterpillar's Income Shows 34.6% Gain

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc. said yesterday that earnings rose 34.6 percent in the second quarter, fueled in part by strong demand for its machines and engines in the United States..
The company said, however, that it expected lower demand in Japan, and cut its outlook for sales growth in Canada and Australia for the remainder of the year. Demand in the United States may also decline if the economy slows, it said. 
 Caterpillar earned $323 million, or $1.62 a share, compared with $240 million, or $1.18 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Although the results were higher than Wall Street's expectations of $1.57 a share, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research, some analysts were disappointed
"Although their $1.62 a share was an excellent performance versus $1.18 a year ago, the consensus was working with a number around that range," said Barry Bannister, an analyst with S. G. Warburg. "This is an environment where coming in around consensus is not good enough."
Shares of Caterpillar fell $2.25 yesterday, to $69.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Ill., manufactures earthmoving, construction and materials-handling machinery as well as diesel and natural gas engines and turbines and electric power-generation systems.
Sales of Caterpillar equipment in the United States rose 13 percent, to $2.05 billion during the quarter. Sales outside the United States increased 20 percent, to $2.01 billion, with gains in Europe, Asia, Canada, Australia, Africa and the Middle East.
Caterpillar said worldwide dealer inventories rose from a year ago and were in line with current selling rates. American dealer inventories are slightly higher than normal, it said.
The company said that a yearlong strike by the United Automobile Workers union had no impact on its business in the quarter.
Donald Fites, Caterpillar's chairman and chief executive, said that the company continued to improve productivity in its manufacturing operations.
Such improvements, including a $1.8 billion plant modernization program begun in 1987, have helped bolster Caterpillar's earnings. These benefits, however, are not expected to offset sluggish demand, though, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Come to Singapore and Debate the Issues

 BODY:
To the Editor
William Safire (column, July 10) claims Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong of Singapore has "seized a three-year-old invitation" from Williams College to "be used as a powerful symbolic tool in Singapore" (quoting a Williams professor). 
 But Mr. Goh does not need any "symbolic tool." After the college twice invited him to receive an honorary degree, he agreed in March 1994 to go in 1995. This was well before the Christopher Lingle and Flor Contemplacion issues arose.
Mr. Safire has got his facts wrong. Chewing gum does not attract a $1,000 fine, nor does "sharing a marijuana cigarette" "invite the death penalty" in Singapore. And it was Philip Bowring, not Christopher Lingle, who alleged "dynastic politics" in Singapore.
Next, how could the International Herald Tribune have been "humiliated" when it could have contested the legal action of Singapore's ministers, and shown that what it published was true or otherwise fair comment and therefore not defamatory?
Mr. Safire blames the I.H.T.'s lawyers for being "too cozy" with the ruling party. But the I.H.T. was free to engage any leading Queen's Counsel from Britain to cross-examine Mr. Goh, Lee Kuan Yew, and Lee Hsien Loong and demolish their character and testimony.
Mr. Safire again attacks the integrity of the Singapore judiciary. But the 1994 world competitiveness report by the Geneva-based World Economic Forum rated Singapore ahead of Hong Kong, Sweden, Britain and the United States in public confidence in the fair administration of justice.
Francis Seow, described by Mr. Safire as "exiled to Harvard," is a fugitive from justice. He resigned as Singapore's solicitor general in 1971 after improperly exercising his authority over a police investigation. In 1973, he was suspended from legal practice for conduct the court held "wholly deplorable and dishonorable to his profession."
To evade trial for income tax fraud, he produced false medical certificates, signed by doctors procured by Asia Watch, to deceive the courts and his counsel, including his own British Queen's Counsel.
In the last 15 months Mr. Safire has repeatedly criticized Singapore. This time he has attacked Mr. Goh personally. Mr. Goh has therefore asked me to invite Mr. Safire and George T. Crane, who according to Mr. Safire is organizing a "serious, educational counter-award ceremony" at Williams College, to debate with Mr. Goh the issues Mr. Safire has raised.
The debate will be at the National University of Singapore and will receive full international media coverage. Singapore Airlines will be privileged to fly Mr. Safire and Mr. Crane as distinguished guests to Singapore.
This is a serious invitation for a serious purpose, to give Singaporeans a chance to hear American liberals present their case in person on what is wrong in Singapore. American students in Williamstown do not need this exposure. They have it all the time.

Singapore's Fear

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In our last episode about Singapore, we learned that students and faculty at Williams College, an academic bastion of liberalism in Massachusetts, were objecting to the school's plan to honor the Prime Minister of that rich, repressive, anti-American regime.
Evidently Goh Chok Tung, the puppet who is keeping the Prime Minister's seat warm for one of Dictator Lee Kuan Yew's sons, became fearful at the revelation in this space that he may be confronted on his great day by the exiled Singaporean dissident Francis Seow, now a fellow at Harvard Law School. 
 Supporters of academic freedom at Williams want to arrange a debate between Goh and Seow. The trustees, who recently voted (8 to 7) to stick with the embarrassing invitation, hope the college's mistake in honoring repression can be rectified by having such a debate.
But dictator Lee wants Goh to avoid it at all costs. How to duck the dissident without appearing craven?
Result: A left-handed invitation has been extended to me and the Williams "no-Goh" organizer to come to Singapore to debate Mr. Goh. (The all-expense-paid invitation, in a letter to The Times that I hope runs today, is only "to" that island state, but presumably it is not intended to be one-way.)
The letter-writer claims that chewing gum is no longer subject to fine, and that minor drug trafficking no longer draws the death penalty, though those contemplating such crimes would be ill advised to rely on the unsupported assertion of a flack.
The press aide touts the Singapore judiciary -- Lee appointees who corruptly hand down libel judgments decided by the dictator -- as rated ahead of the U.S. in the Geneva-based World Economic Forum's "Competitiveness Report." I checked; this survey is limited to wealthy business executives, most of whose idea of fair justice is the horsewhipping of uppity stockholders. In that poll, China's justice was equated with America's.
The tip-off that Singapore's invitation is a ploy to avert debate at Williams is in the flack's vilification of Francis Seow as "a fugitive from justice" and a tax cheat.
Mr. Seow was the leader of the Law Society, whose crime was to resist the dictator's moves to crush press freedom; even worse, he dared to best Lee Kuan Yew before a parliamentary select committee.
In 1988, the espousal of human rights by this former Solicitor General earned him an arrest and 72 days of torture vividly recounted in "To Catch a Tartar: A Dissident in Lee Kuan Yew's Prison" (a 1994 Yale Center book you'd better not be caught with in Singapore). After the dictator's secret police accused him of being in cahoots with American intelligence and rigged a phony tax prosecution, Seow chose freedom over more torture.
No wonder Goh is so eager to duck his nemesis at Williams. For an Asian politician to debate a white American pundit in front of a hometown Asian crowd is a set-up for a local racist triumph. But for an Asian dictator's front man to face a respected Asian attorney in a free country -- an opponent who can cite chapter and verse of political repression, and tell of torture from personal experience -- that's debating on a level playing field. It would be like China's Li Peng facing Harry Wu.
So here's my answer: In poker terms, I will see Singapore's bid and raise it.
I would be pleased to engage in a one-on-one debate on universal values. But it's no fun to go up against anybody's "stooge," as Mr. Goh recently complained he is so frequently called. I'm ready to debate Lee Kuan Yew himself, and the dictator only.
The venue? A nation under the rule of law -- not Singapore, and not in front of an audience selected for me of Lee's relatives, cane-wielding thugs, Serbian generals, B.N.L. bankers, Packwood accusers and the Saddam Hussein Fan Club.
Since Dictator Lee admires the work of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, where we have both spoken in recent years, a debate at the next Davos meeting would be accessible to an unintimidated press.
How about it, Mr. Lee? My one proviso: that your man Goh also agrees to debate Francis Seow, the Singaporean opponent your uptight regime obviously fears most, at Williams college this fall.

HEADLINE: Drop in Starts of Multifamily Housing Hurt June Home Building

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
New home construction slipped in June, but the decline was entirely in multifamily housing, the Government said today. Construction of single-family homes rose 3.9 percent.
Lower mortgage rates had been expected to increase demand.
Over all, housing starts fell one-tenth of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.26 million units a year last month, after declining four-tenths of 1 percent in May, the Commerce Department said. The agency revised the May rate up to 1.26 million units from the 1.24 million reported previously, which also raised the June level. The June rate, however, was still below the 1.29 million expected by Wall Street economists. 
 Weakening overall starts was a 13.4 percent drop in starts of multiple-unit housing in June to a rate of 251,000 buildings.
But construction starts for single-family homes, which are about 80 percent of total starts, rose 3.9 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.01 million units, after hitting a two-year low in May, the department said. Starts of single-family homes are a key measure of consumers' willingness to take on long-term financial commitments.
Economists were also encouraged by a pickup in permits granted for future housing starts. They rose 2.3 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.27 million units after being unchanged in May.
 "Today's numbers tell us that the housing recovery has begun, but it's only going to be a modest recovery," said David Berson, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae.
 Construction starts fell in most of the country except the Midwest, where they rose 9.6 percent. They fell nine-tenths of 1 percent in the South, 7.8 percent in the Northeast and 3 percent in the West.
 In the first half of the year, housing starts were running 11.1 percent behind their 1994 pace.
Housing starts had been expected to rise as much as 4 percent in June, on the assumption that lower mortgage rates would bolster demand. A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, which was above 9 percent at the beginning of the year, was 7.41 percent last week, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
Still, the National Association of Home Builders' index -- compiled from a monthly survey of builders -- rose for the third consecutive month in June and suggested for the first time since September that more builders were optimistic than pessimistic about their prospects.
 Helping to fuel their optimism was a sharp 19.9 percent jump in sales of new homes in May and a decline in their inventory of unsold homes to 5.6 months worth from 6.9 months.

HEADLINE: U.S. Asks European Talks on Grain Tariffs

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
The United States is seeking quick consultations with the European Union to try to reverse a change in the way the Europeans assess tariffs on grain imports, President Clinton's trade representative, Mickey Kantor, announced today.
The Clinton Administration says that a new way of calculating tariffs will impose a new barrier to grain imports, resulting in additional duties of $14 to $25 a metric ton. Mr. Kantor said this violated rules of the World Trade Organization. From 1991 to 1993, the European Union countries imported approximately $400 million of grain annually from the United States. 
 The trade office's filing today follows an announcement Tuesday by Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman that the United States would seek to return to the old formula for calculating tariffs.
The World Trade Organization was created as the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Its rules on agriculture took effect July 1.
At European Union headquarters in Brussels, the agricultural spokesman, Gerry Kiely, responded that "what we are doing is totally compatible with W.T.O. rules." He added that the Europeans would contest the case at the trade organization, though he seemed to leave the door open for compromise.
Canada has also requested consultations on the issue, Mr. Kantor said. Australia, which exports wheat and rice to Europe, is considering a complaint. Grain-trade analysts expect Brazil and Argentina to file, too, as their soybean exports would presumably be harmed by higher tariffs.

HEADLINE: Industrial Flotsam Elevated to Art

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SLESIN 

 BODY:
LIKE waves at the shore, decorating styles of the last decade -- English country, cozy cottage, Art Deco, Old World and New Age -- have risen and receded, leaving their gentle traces on our sensibilities and on the pillows in many living rooms. But these trends, with their feeling of fantasy and escape, have not enthralled the photographer Jan Staller.
For nearly 35 years, Mr. Staller, whose professional focus is the ruins of the man-made landscape (its remote streets and decaying piers, the crumbling West Side Highway, New Jersey landfills, abandoned chemical plants and construction sites after hours), has been attuned to one muse only: 20th-century industrial design, whether in the furniture of masters like George Nelson and Charles Eames or in the myriad anonymous objects that were once an intrinsic part of the machine age. 
 "I'm more interested in the era we're moving out of than the era we're moving into," he said.
A few months ago, Mr. Staller moved into what he called his "dream house" in Greenwich Village and began displaying his artifacts in rooms whose minimalist style and meticulous attention to detail are right on the pulse of a modern sensibility. Ten years ago, the style was called high tech. It has evolved into a less austere version of the industrial esthetic -- call it high-tech redux or industrial romanticism. It incorporates not just the early-20th-century relics but still-in-production objects and one-of-a-kind art pieces that are forged, welded, polished and cast out of metal, of course.
Alongside his apocalyptic photographs -- including some of nuclear test sites in Nevada -- Mr. Staller has arranged his inventory of more than 100 domestic objects -- the "quintessential objects," he calls them, because they embody intriguing design and utility. These items are the industrial antiques of our time and, for Mr. Staller, the ones that should be preserved. "The silicone age that came after the industrial age is pretty dull and principally putty colored," he said.
The cameras, cast-metal toy cars and trucks, early flashlights and compelling old machines like a 1920's megawatt meter that came from a power plant in Philadelphia are packed into display cases from Duralab, a Brooklyn maker of scientific and medical cabinetry that comes in a wide variety of sizes and colors. (The Duralab cabinets in Mr. Staller's kitchen cost less than $15,000.) Simplicity, economy and durability aside, what appealed to Mr. Staller was the fact that they came from an institutional source.
He found just the right spots for his Eames chairs, Le Corbusier sofa and Philco television set, as well as the lamps and tables he designed from aluminum, copper or bronze. Luckily, he is not one to move furniture around in the middle of the night. The dining table top is a sheath of polished copper that weighs 375 pounds.
Even the mops and brooms, the sleekest of their kind, are perfectly lined up in an alcove off the kitchen. "I'm very picky," Mr. Staller said.
The 3,000-square-foot, three-story mid-19th-century brick building has an oblique view of ships passing on the Hudson River, a terrace shaded by a tall tree and a garage where Mr. Staller parks his green Land Rover.
That setting might be just enough perfection for most New Yorkers. But not for Mr. Staller. The renovation of the building was as meticulous and detailed as everything else in his life. The spaces, restructured with the help of Richard Lewis, a New York architect, and Deborah Staller, an architect and Mr. Staller's sister-in-law, became the palette for Mr. Staller's lifelong romance with all things industrial.
THAT passion explains the corrosion-resistant bright yellow electrical outlets in the kitchen, yards of Duralab laboratory cabinets in "eyerest" green that hold socks and underwear in the bedroom, the outdoor table made from a vintage Esso sign and the art piece de resistance: a footboard on which broken gears and bearings are cast in bronze. "The idea was based on some sort of industrial fossil," Mr. Staller said.
Three drive-in-movie speakers have been transformed into intercoms with the aura of African masks, and an explosion-proof cast aluminum telephone from the late 1950's sits regally on the counter in the bedroom. "It came from a mine or gasworks, where any sparks were insulated from the atmosphere," Mr. Staller said. "I thought it was a beautiful object, sort of like an orthopedic shoe, don't you think?"
Mr. Staller's rather unusual esthetic sense has its roots in his childhood. For a few years, infatuated with wiring devices, he collected switches and outlets and wanted to be an electrician.
His father, Erwin Staller, a developer of shopping centers on Long Island and an architecture and design enthusiast, also subscribed to photography and "shelter" magazines. And the basement, equipped with a radial saw and a turning lathe, made furniture-making a family affair. While Erwin Staller sculptured tables out of large pieces of rough-edged wood, inspired by the work of George Nakashima, his son was prolific in the area of salad bowls and candlesticks and once made an elaborate walnut floor lamp with a turned base and stem.
"My parents would raise their eyes and say, 'If only you could put that effort into your schoolwork,' " Mr. Staller said. He would send for free samples of floor coverings and plastic laminates. Later these samples of mass-produced materials would join the discarded meters and gauges and a large ampersand, all found at flea markets and in dumpsters.
During his teens, Mr. Staller went to a boarding school in Vermont, where he declared his future career as an industrial designer. It was not to be his exact fate. But the appeal of high tech, the industrial style that flowered in the early 1980's, never diminished. It found a niche in both his work and his home, with its cement walls, bare wood floors and unadorned fireplace (in which a toy train sits alone on the hearth, looking like the subject of a painting by Magritte). The windows are framed by plain, even satisfyingly dull green curtains. "I call them motel drapes," Mr. Staller said.
"Normally the architect has to fight with the client to give him nice details," Mr. Lewis, the architect, said. "In this case, Jan was the force behind the special details."
Take the footboard of the bed. The 200-pound, roughly half-inch-thick panel is a bronze casting of broken gears and bits of machinery collected by Mr. Staller. They appear imbedded in steel, "as if some machinery had gotten smashed and burned, then found in mud or tar and partially revealed," he said.
The footboard, Mr. Staller added, is reminiscent of "the industrial celebrations in the paintings and reliefs" at Rockefeller Center.
"But that imagery was in celebration of some kind of idea of a smoothly running machine," he continued. His imagery is one of disarray that mirrors the forbidding feeling of his photographs.
He has even asked himself if this end-of-the-civilized-world imagery is appropriate for a bedroom, never mind the time and expense it took to come to fruition. The bed, he acknowledged, is really quite impractical. "I guess that makes my work either art or folly," Mr. Staller said. "I only hope I live with more of the former and less of the latter."

Deciding if It's Time for Kindergarten or Time to Wait a Year

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
SUSAN MILLAR PERRY decided to give her child that extra push in life by holding him back.
When her son, Nick, was just a toddler, Ms. Perry began to agonize over whether to delay his entry into kindergarten by a year, until he was nearly 6. She consulted with friends and his preschool teachers at the West Side Montessori School in Manhattan. She received conflicting advice from a neighbor who acted as a sort of Greek chorus, telling her one day to hold him back, then changing her tone to advise that the current wisdom was to push him forward. 
 In recent years, early-childhood educators have increasingly frowned on the practice of delaying kindergarten for a year, usually until the child is 6 rather than 5. But while most experts agree the strategy does not really help in the long run and might even be harmful, it remains ever popular.
"It is typically done with the best of intentions, but it is a misguided approach," said Barbara Willer, a spokeswoman for the National Association for the Education of Young Children, an organization of early-childhood educators and child-care providers, based in Washington. "Parents who do it are concerned that their children aren't ready or will somehow benefit from being held out a year. But the research is pretty clear that there are no long-term positive effects, and there may in fact be negative effects. Our basic recommendation is to fix the school program, not the child."
Experts say the practice is particularly widespread among more affluent parents who can afford the luxury of paying for an extra year of preschool. And boys tend to be held back more than girls. Experts saw a rise in the practice in the early 1980's, when widespread curriculum changes sent more academic work and testing down to first grade and even kindergarten.
"Because boys develop a little more slowly than girls, people believe that they are more at risk," said Lorrie A. Shepard, a professor of research methods and statistics at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
But the presumed advantages are typically wiped out by third grade, many experts say. And Ms. Shepard said she could point to no hard evidence that the youngest child in a class will achieve less in the first place.
"Able kids are just as able, whether they are just barely 5 or fully 6," she said. "It's the kids who are not very academically able and young that show up in these trend lines as the most disadvantaged in kindergarten class. A lot of parents are misinformed that their kids are at a disadvantage, but they do it anyway."
Ms. Shepard and another professor, Mary Lee Smith, researched programs that gave children an extra year to prepare for school and found no educational gains. In their 1987 study, 40 children from extra-year classes were compared with 40 from schools that did not offer such programs. When both groups had finished first grade, the extra-year students showed a one-month advantage in reading scores but no difference in math or in ratings of things like maturity. Parents also reported that the extra-year children had poorer attitudes toward school.
Some who study child development suggest that delayed school entry is inevitable in an educational system that has become too rigid and structured in the early grades and ignores the intellectual growth rates of individual children.
David Elkind, a professor of child study at Tufts University, sees some rationale in the practice of holding back, even if it means that some older children will have a competitive edge over younger classmates.
"As a general rule, I think it is undemocratic, but I think you have to do what is in the best interest of your child," said Mr. Elkind, who is also an author. "Because the system isn't working properly, should you punish your child? It's a dilemma."
In New York City, where competition is fierce to get into private schools and those public schools that require entrance exams, holding children back is an exceedingly common practice and is even quietly preached by some schools, educators and parents say.
"As slots for private schools in middle and high schools are getting more competitive, parents see holding back as an edge," said Carmen Farina, the principal of Public School 6, a consistently top-scoring school on the Upper East Side. "A child going to an interview will be more verbal at 13 than 12. It is seen as an advantage for advanced grade placement. As they get older, it will hold them in great stead."
Ms. Perry, the editor in chief of Longevity magazine, admits that she and her husband, David, an advertising art director, had archly competitive motives in deciding to hold back Nick, who starts first grade at the Cathedral School in Manhattan this fall.
"This is a competitive world, and this is a competitive city," she said. "I was thinking ahead for middle school, for grade school and where he was at that moment in time."
Delayed entry is also known by experts as red-shirting, from the school athletic tradition of holding promising young players -- in red shirts -- on the bench for a year while they grew. Delaying kindergarten took firm hold in the early 1980's as various education commissions exhorted schools to place more emphasis on back-to-basics academics and improved achievement on standardized tests. Kindergartens began to look more like first grades, and many 5-year-olds couldn't do the work. Anxious parents were increasingly advised to have their children wait. So, many schools created extra-year developmental programs.
But in recent years, the nationwide trend of schools' setting their own policies on the subject appears to have diminished somewhat, as influential educational groups have argued against holding children back, said Sharon Lynn Kagan, a senior associate at the Bush Center in Child Development and Social Policy of Yale University.
"We are acknowledging that schools need to be ready for all children of various levels and abilities," Ms. Kagan said. "We are seeing more emphasis on school change and getting schools ready rather than getting kids ready."
Even though the practice may be declining in the nation as a whole, it thrives in certain middle-class communities, said Elizabeth Graue, an education professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. She has studied delayed school entry from an anthropological perspective.
While there are no definitive numbers, she says she has found that the more educated parents are, the more likely they are to hold their children back. "It's people who have the economic resources to be hooked into certain groups," Ms. Graue said, adding that she disliked the practice.
These parents get advice from preschool teachers, pediatricians and others. They read parenting magazines. "In working- or lower-class neighborhoods, parents assume you bring your child in when they're 5," she said. Whites are also more apt to do it than parents in other ethnic groups, she said.
Even though parents assume delayed entry will save children from later failure, Ms. Graue said she had interviewed children who were unhappy about not being with classmates their own age. Some think they are "bad," and some refuse to celebrate their birthdays because they don't want anybody to know they are older, she said.
At the same time, parents of older children are demanding that kindergarten teachers use more advanced curriculums that include things like workbooks and specialized reading materials, she said.
"It makes it hard for the children who came to school when they were supposed to, at age 5," she said. "You have these big 6-year-olds wanting fancier things."
In Westport, Conn., where children are unloaded at the Christ and Holy Trinity preschool from Saabs, Volvos and vans, Margaret Taylor, a real estate lawyer, and her husband, Peter Gillespie, also a lawyer, enrolled their son Colin in a transitional kindergarten program called the 5's.
The couple were worried that their son lacked the necessary emotional maturity for school. The special program, which has mostly boys, allowed Colin to delay his entry into regular school for a year without being labeled a repeater. He attended the 5's kindergarten at the preschool, then went again to kindergarten in the public schools, where he was among the oldest in class.
Ms. Taylor said the decision to place Colin in the 5's was based on careful thinking. The boy, now 9, is studious, but also a worrier who gets upset if he does not understand a problem. "I felt he would be disadvantaged by being the youngest child," she said.
She and her husband made their decision based on things they had noticed about their oldest son, Jeffrey, whom they did not hold back. He is a confident and relaxed boy who just finished seventh grade as one of the youngest in his class. Even though Jeffrey is academically successful, his mother is worried about subtle things, like how he lags in social skills and sports. She said he also struggled with increased homework and with organizing himself in the fifth grade, when he entered middle school. "He was constantly losing stuff," his mother said. "I don't think he had matured enough."
Ms. Taylor said the family had decided not to hold back their youngest son, Ian, a self-assured, outgoing boy whose April birthday will place him in the middle of his kindergarten class.
Along with many educators, Ms. Taylor thinks it is a shame parents are allowed to manipulate children's school careers so directly. "It is out of hand," she said. But even so, she added, "you don't want to think of your child struggling year after year."

"China?" he said, his eyes widening. "I'm a foreigner in that country. It's not my country. A lot of their language, I don't even understand their meaning." 
 With those few words, the 40-year-old professor of political science summed up a question that dominates every element of life in Taiwan, from domestic politics to foreign policy: What is the national identity of this island?
"That's the biggest issue," Mr. Chen explained. "I don't deny that there are 10 percent of the people here who want to unite with China at any cost. But the great majority of us identify ourselves as Taiwanese. So we have to ask ourselves: Are we Chinese, or are we Taiwanese? Are we in Taiwan a country, or are we part of China?"
Officially, the Government of Taiwan still says this island is a province of China. But the Government is also doing all it can to create a de facto independence for the island by fostering new political, economic and cultural links with the world.
In particular, Taiwan's new-found economic strength and nascent democracy have infused the Taiwanese with a sense of individual identity. It has even become popular here for politicians -- in what was heresy in the days when Chiang Kai-shek dreamed of reconquering the mainland -- to call for an outright declaration of Taiwan's independence.
But Taiwan's seeming march toward sovereignty faces a huge obstacle: It is furiously opposed by China. Beijing regards the island as a renegade province that must rejoin the motherland, and it has responded to Taiwan's tentative steps with talk of military invasion and threats to sever relations with any country too accommodating of Taiwan's aspirations.
The United States and virtually all other countries recognize China's claim over Taiwan, the "one China" policy that is imbedded in treaties and resolutions. For China, the decision by the United States to allow the ostensibly private visit of Taiwan's President last month -- a departure from American policy -- provoked a diplomatic crisis.
But for this island's 21 million people, the strands that bind Taiwan to China have frayed, and for many they have long since snapped.
"The reality is that Taiwan does not belong to the People's Republic of China," said Shih Ming-te, the leader of the Democratic Progressive Party, the country's largest opposition party. "The P.R.C. never governed Taiwan, not even for one day. For the last 50 years, there have been in reality two independent countries on either side of the Taiwan Strait."
Mr. Shih, like most people here, said independence is not simply an aspiration; it is for all practical purposes reality. Starting in the era of Chiang Kai-shek, who claimed to be the true leader of China right up to his death in 1975, Mr. Shih's calls for independence kept him in prison for more than 25 years, until 1990.
Today he is in Taiwan's legislature and his party, with its public stance for independence, poses the most formidable threat so far to the governing Nationalist Party.
Six months ago, for the first time in Taiwan's history, an opposition politician was elected Mayor of Taipei, the capital. Sitting in his cavernous office in the gleaming marble-clad City Hall, the new Mayor, Chen Shui-bian, surveyed his metropolis of 2.7 million people spread beneath his window. He is also the first native Taiwanese since 1949 to be Mayor of the city.
"We people in Taiwan are different from the people on the mainland," he said. "And Taiwan's future will be decided by its 21 million people."
While that population still suffers strains between the Taiwanese majority who was here before Chiang arrived in 1949 and the island's million or so Chinese who are descended from his followers, it has increasingly and deliberately forged an identity distinct from that of China.
Today even the Nationalists have gradually moved away from their identification with China and things Chinese. Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui, himself boasts of his Taiwanese roots, and outside Taipei he is more likely to speak the local Taiwanese dialect than the Mandarin dialect favored by Chinese from northern China. In Taiwan's schools, textbooks that devoted most of their pages to China are being replaced by books focusing on Taiwan.
"How can China claim Taiwan is a province of China?" said Hansen Chien, a member of the Nationalist Party's central committee. "It's ridiculous." But he warned, in a reflection of the ambiguous state of nationalist party policy, that encouraging discussions of independence or declaring Taiwan's independence from China would court disaster.
"That puts our people in immediate danger," he said, citing China's promise to attack the island if it tries to establish itself as a sovereign state. "But in reality the Republic of China is independent," he said, using Taiwan's formal name.
There has been no explicit declaration from the Taiwan Government of a move toward independence, an act the Government still regards as precipitous and unnecessarily inflammatory. Instead, the Government tries to demonstrate the island's distinction from China in political, economic and social spheres.
The most visible sign of this ambiguous, sometimes contradictory policy is Taiwan's continuing effort to regain admission to the United Nations, from which it was ousted in 1971 when the mainland took over the China seat. In June, Taiwan even made a public pledge to donate $1 billion in aid to developing countries if it gained admission to the world body. China, which as a Security Council member has the power to keep Taiwan out, is furious about the efforts to join and most United Nations members, including the United States, reject the idea.
There is much about Taiwan that seems Chinese. Gargantuan neon signs of Chinese ideographs march down broad streets announcing restaurants, shopping malls, book stores. But here, the ideographs in their full forms hark back to traditional China, not the land of Communism, where written Chinese ideographs have been simplified, drained of all historical resonance.
Though its cities are bursting with entrepreneurial ambition, China eschews politics, a free press and the clamor of public debate. Here, there is a feeling of having made it, of needing a rambunctious press, and of thirsting after a debate over the future.
"We're the first independent licensed radio station," said Hsu Lu, the general manager of the Voice of Taipei. "We don't broadcast government propaganda. We want to tell people how things are and listen to what they have to say."
Her station, one of a growing number, grew out of the spread of underground radio stations, which were militantly anti-Government and, importantly, broadcast in the Taiwanese dialect. Last year, when the Government tried to shut down the underground broadcasters, taxi drivers went on strike, forcing the Government to back down.
"That could never happen in China," said Ms. Hsu.
Much of Taiwan's sense of identity and purpose comes from its extraordinary economic growth. In two decades Taiwan has managed to transform itself from a backwater into one of the dominant economic presences in Asia, with the world's 19th-largest economy.
And with economic power has come a surging confidence that buttresses Taiwan's claim to a greater stature in Asia and fuels increasingly aggressive moves toward international recognition.
"Taiwan is now the second largest investor in the region after Japan," said Wu Rong-i, president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, a private economic research group. "We should play a more important role in the region."
As Taiwan has pumped up its economic muscles -- the per capita gross national product will be about $12,640 this year, four times what it was a decade ago -- it has embraced tumultuous democratic politics unknown in the Chinese-speaking world.
Later this year, voters will elect a new legislature, one in which the hold of the Nationalist Party is likely to be broken for the first time. Next March, for the first time in Taiwan's history, candidates for the country's presidency will be popularly elected.

Appeal Against Confrontation

TAIPEI, Thursday, July 20 (Reuters) -- President Lee Teng-hui called on China today to give up its "ideological confrontation." His plea came two days after Beijing announced missile tests near Taiwan.
"We sincerely hope Beijing's authorities give up ideological confrontation to open a new age of peaceful competition by Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits," Mr. Lee said in a speech to a government seminar. He did not directly refer to the planned missile tests, which are to begin on Friday 85 miles north of Taiwan.
"Only mutual respect will gradually achieve Chinese reunification under the goals of democracy, freedom and equal distribution of wealth," he added.

HEADLINE: With an Abortion Vote and a Budget Cut, House Republicans Counter Clinton

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
The House voted today to abolish abortion coverage for Federal workers who are the victims of rape or incest, overturning one of the earliest of President Clinton's policy decisions.
And ending Congress's traditional hands-off policy on the White House budget, the Republican-controlled House cut $41 million from Mr. Clinton's request for the Executive Office for the 1996 fiscal year, including all money for the Council of Economic Advisers, a major Presidential advisory group. 
 Democrats failed in a series of attempts to make the abortion bill less restrictive, and they did not mount a floor fight over the cuts to the Executive Office budget. But they vowed that the battle would continue on the floor of the Senate, which has yet to take up the issues, and during committee meetings to reconcile what are certain to be differences between the chambers.
Republicans also used the debate to deliver a pointed political message to the Administration on the Mexico bailout plan. By a vote of 245 to 183, the House approved an amendment that would bar the Administration from using the Exchange Stabilization Fund "for the purpose of bolstering any foreign currency."
Although it did not mention any nation by name, the measure was clearly directed at Mr. Clinton's bailout plan for Mexico. The President turned to the Exchange Stabilization Fund for a $20 billion loan to Mexico earlier this year after Congress balked at a plan to rescue the peso. Today's votes came during consideration of a $23.2 billion appropriations bill for the Treasury Department, the United States Postal Service, the Executive Office of the President and various agencies, which passed by a vote of 216 to 211.
The abortion measure would prohibit the Government's health plans for Federal employees from covering abortions, except in cases when a woman's life was at risk. The Government pays for about three-quarters of the health plan for each employee, and the worker pays the balance. Under the bill, no insurance money from a federally subsidized program, including the employee's contributions, could be used to pay for an abortion except when a woman's life was at stake.
"Congress has no right to forcibly compel taxpayers, many of whom share my strong belief in the rights of the unborn, to pay for elective abortions," said Representative J. D. Hayworth, Republican of Arizona.
Opponents made similarly broad arguments against the measure.
"Eliminating this right for one group of women just because they happen to work for the Federal Government is discrimination, pure and simple," said Representative John W. Olver, Democrat of Massachusetts.
About two-thirds of private health plans cover abortion services.
The abortion measure restores to law what had been policy for a decade under the Administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Mr. Clinton had expanded the abortion policy to cover cases of rape and incest, which are believed to account for about 1 percent of all abortions.
On the appropriation for the Executive Office of the President, the House allowed $267.3 million, which was $43.3 million less than Mr. Clinton had requested and $41.1 million less than the current budget.
Congress has oversight of all discretionary spending, including the White House budget, but it has traditionally honored Presidents' requests for the Executive Office.
Few major offices within the White House escaped some kind of cut. The allocation for the National Security Council was $6.5 million, $189,000 less than in 1995; the Office of Policy Development, which advises the White House on domestic policy, received $3.9 million, a cut of $1.1 million, and the Office of Management and Budget was given $55.4 million, which was $2.3 million less than its current budget.
The President's salary -- $250,000 a year -- did not change.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Tempest in a Dugout, Starring McDowell

BYLINE: By Claire Smith 

 BODY:
Jack McDowell, as we all know by now, has remarkable dexterity with the digits. The Yankee right-hander can toss the most universally understood obscene gesture with the best of them and not let a camera miss it, as he proved in a remarkable show of bad humor Tuesday night.
The Yankees, the team that employs him to be a tasteful human being as well as a winning pitcher, will take his money, $5,000 of it, because of the foul tempest McDowell stirred after the White Sox, his former team, drilled him with 13 hits and nine runs in four and two-thirds very ugly innings Tuesday. 
 As he walked to the dugout, McDowell gestured to the crowd at Yankee Stadium with the middle finger of his right hand. And although the hometown team gathered itself long enough to defeat the Kansas City Royals, 5-2, yesterday, removing some of the sting of the humiliations of the day before, McDowell remained a major story, and not just because of his lack of etiquette. For now the Yankees, adrift near the bottom of the American League East, must wonder if McDowell was right for this club in the first place.
Remember, when the Yankees first started sniffing around for a big-game pitcher, a search dating back several years, McDowell was but one of a number of tantalizing possibilities. Randy Johnson of the Mariners was another. So was Andy Benes of the Padres.
Fortunately for McDowell, he's no Andy Benes, a hard-luck story who went from July 1994 until June 16 without winning. Unfortunately for the Yankees, McDowell is also no Randy Johnson. No one in major league baseball is; the Mariners' 6-foot-10-inch intimidator has a 10-1 record and a major-league leading 168 strikeouts.
The most dangerous digit in a Randy Johnson game is the index finger the Mariners catcher puts down to call for an unhittable fast ball. Johnson routinely punches out 10-plus hitters a game, even against teams like the Yankees who snort and swear at his antics and swing from the heels in vain attempts to do damage.
A couple of years ago, when that potential was still mostly untapped, the Yankees could have reeled Johnson in. The Mariners were fishing for prospects. Names such as Sterling Hitchcock, the winner of yesterday's game who is now 4-6, popped up. So did that of Bob Wickman, the invaluable middle man in the Yankees' bullpen. And Russell Davis and Gerald Williams, young hitters who to this day cannot carve out regular roles here.
Buck Showalter, the Yankee manager, knows he could make himself crazy thinking about the what-ifs and what-might-have beens. "But I don't, because I know for a fact that the deals talked about weren't in the best interests of our organization," he said. "I don't even remember what they were at the time, but I trust the people who make those decisions."
They are, after all, the same people who made the decisions to sign Jimmy Key and Wade Boggs, to acquire Paul O'Neill and Mike Stanley.
"We always seem to harp on the deals not made as opposed to the deals that were made," Showalter said.
True, economic considerations have made the team wary about picking up big contracts. And Johnson is due to make $5.75 million next year, $6 million the next and has a $6 million option for 1998. But the Yankees have money. And didn't they just sign an outfielder named Darryl Strawberry for $850,000 even as the owner admitted that no one knew if he could still hit? And didn't the club sign arbitration-eligible McDowell to a $5.4 million contract this year?
Undoubtedly, McDowell will want or seek similar figures next year. Question is, should the Yankees give it to him? You judge.
McDowell needed six victories in his last eight games to improve his record to 7-6. The drubbing Tuesday was one of his uglier games this year, but not the only ugly one. His earned run average of 4.78 offers proof of his inconsistency and struggles.
This cannot be what the Yankees expected. It certainly is not what they needed in light of the loss of the club's top pitcher, Jimmy Key. That absence would put pressure on even former Cy Young winners like McDowell. And, the pitcher admitted yesterday: "I'm sure it is. I've gotten blown out of the water. Every four or five starts I get blown out of the water."
Showalter said: "I still think he can turn it around, because of his track record, his stick-to-itiveness and his competitive nature. Jack's not a guy who will wallow in self-pity. He's going to keep coming right back at you."
From here on, though, the team obviously must not only gauge the pitcher's ability to win, but also his ability to deal with New York. If one bad outing can have him flinging fingers, then his emotional makeup comes into question.
"What happened the other night surprised me somewhat because this is a guy who has tremendous respect for the game and the people who went before him," Showalter said. "But from the competitive standpoint, it doesn't surprise me. He gets frustrated with the lack of success, just like everybody else. He's not some iron horse."
Right now, the Yankees don't need an iron horse. They just need a horse. If it is not Key or Johnson, it must be McDowell. He might not win big with Miss Manners. But he is getting paid to win big with the Yankees. Even Jack McDowell's five seconds of fury didn't hide the fact that he has not yet done that.

HEADLINE: In Battle Over Public Lands, Ranchers Push Public Aside

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: KETCHUM, Idaho

 BODY:
The high alpine country near the grave of Ernest Hemingway is some of the prettiest public land in America, with its flower meadows, wild horses and views of the tallest mountains in Idaho. Signs inform visitors that it is a land of "many uses," overseen for the public by the Federal Bureau of Land Management.
But Congress is now poised to grant ranchers virtual control over this and almost every other part of the 270 million acres of Federal land where grazing permits have already been issued. People who hunt, fish or hike say the concept of sharing the use of public lands is being shoved aside for a small special interest. 
 In the heart of the Idaho mountains northeast of Sun Valley, for example, the computer billionaires William Hewlett and David Packard, two of the richest men in America, graze their cattle on nearly 100,000 acres of Federal land that adjoins their 15,000-acre private ranch.
It is not the picture that Western senators have in mind when they evoke the lone cowboy trying to make a go of it against meddlesome Federal bureaucrats. But this ranch, because it is in the middle of a prime recreation and wildlife area, is at the center of a struggle over who controls land that is supposed to be owned by every American.
The Federal land, critics say, will essentially become a private domain for cattle owned by Mr. Hewlett and Mr. Packard under a bill that Congress is likely to pass this summer. And the ranch, which has some of most sublime mountain scenery in the West, has been a source of continual problems.
Many of the small creeks on the property are denuded of brush because of overgrazing, say the Federal officials who monitor the cattle operation. A spring that flows into a stream where the Government has spent millions of dollars trying to restore salmon was overrun with more than 600 cattle in early July, a violation of Federal guidelines. Salmon need clean, cold water to survive -- both of which are affected by heavy upstream cattle grazing.
If the Public Rangeland Management Act, which the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee passed on Wednesday, is enacted, the co-founders of the Hewlett-Packard Company would no longer have to contend with critics in Idaho who have waged a 20-year fight to keep their cattle from polluting streams and overgrazing high elevation grasslands, the critics say.
The bill would also set a fee -- about one-fourth of the rate charged by private landowners -- that could force taxpayers to subsidize grazing well into the next century, according to figures compiled by the Department of Agriculture. The fees would be higher initially than the present rates, but would be much lower over the long run than those proposed by the Clinton Administration. These provisions have led some conservative critics to label the bill "cowboy socialism."
Ranchers, both rich and poor, say they are tired of outsiders from the Federal Government and from environmental groups telling them what to do with cattle on public lands. They say that they are the true environmentalists and that the livestock bill would simply let them take care of the business they know best.
The grazing legislation, sponsored by Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, would affect nearly one-eighth of all the land in the United States. It is a response to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's effort to tighten regulations on the open range, a move that drew wide criticism from ranchers.
Last year more than 68 million people visited public lands -- most of them in the West -- that are overseen by the Bureau of Land Management, a branch of the Department of the Interior. There are about 22,000 ranchers with permits to graze cattle on land managed by the bureau.
Although their numbers are small, the ranchers have the upper hand in Congress for the first time in decades, and they are pushing the Domenici bill, which they say would lock in their advantage for decades.
"It's over," said Dave Nelson, who manages the Hewlett and Packard cattle on what is called the San Felipe allotment in Idaho. "The environmentalists have lost, and all they can do now is take pot shots."
In recent years, environmental groups like the Nature Conservancy have been trying to bid on public lands, with the intention of restoring it or allowing only a minimal amount of grazing. Ranchers fear that such groups are slowly chipping away at their livelihood.
Senator Domenici said his bill, which has wide support among Western senators, would free ranchers who use public lands from heavy regulation.
"In essence, we are calling for an end to the battle and the realization of a stability that will allow a historic way of life to continue to flourish in this modern world," he said.
The larger fight is the age-old debate over the role of the cowboy in the West. In 1993, when the Clinton Administration tried to raise grazing fees and insist on tighter regulations, it was attacked for waging a "war on the West" -- a criticism that continues to haunt it. For that reason, Administration officials say, President Clinton may be reluctant to take on the livestock industry again.
But that has not stopped officials in the land management agencies from attacking the livestock bill as a giveaway to a powerful special interest.
"This bill takes the public out of public lands," said Mike Dombeck, acting director of the Bureau of Land Management. "It returns land management to an era of single use at taxpayers' expense."
Here in Idaho, Federal officials have been working for years to force Mr. Hewlett and Mr. Packard to keep their cattle out of streams and fragile meadows. The officials say the Domenici bill would make it impossible to enforce the most basic of regulations.
They say the land here has improved over the years, but only because they have used their enforcement powers to get the ranchers to comply with environmental laws.
If hunters or backpackers abuse the land -- by burning, camping or killing wildlife in an off-limits area -- they can be immediately fined. But under Senator Domenici's bill, a rancher could consistently violate the standards of care for the land, and it would take "up to 23 years" to get them to change, said Maitland Sharpe, an assistant director of the Bureau of Land Management.
Most ranchers who use public lands comply with regulations and genuinely care about the shape of the range, Mr. Sharpe said. But about 5 percent do not cooperate, and the bill would give them "a unique authority" to do what they want, he said, adding, "This bill takes public lands and turns them into something very close to private ranches."
Ranchers say they can do without much public involvement. In the past, criticism from sportsmen and environmentalists has so hampered their operations that it has made it hard to keep public-land ranches going, many ranchers say.
"The range is not as bad as a lot of these B.L.M. guys and environmentalists say it is," said Mr. Nelson, who runs the San Felipe allotment. Mr. Hewlett and Mr. Packard, both in their 80's, seldom get out to the ranch anymore, he said. Neither responded to requests for an interview.
Robert Stephens, Mr. Packard's son-in-law, said in an interview that the family has tried to be good stewards. "You won't find two stronger conservationists than David Packard and William Hewlett," he said. "If they thought their actions on that ranch were hurting salmon, they would want to do something about it."
On a tour of the land, cattle were seen in areas where they were not supposed to be -- trampling in small springs that flow into creeks that are spawning grounds for the salmon. Other creeks were dry, their banks ripped apart by erosion. There were groves of dead aspen and willow, which dried up when the water table sank from overgrazing, Federal officials said.
The damage is so severe in some areas that "it will take geologic time for it to recover," Mr. Sharpe said.
Mr. Nelson said some of the streams' banks had been destroyed by flash floods in which upland grazing was not a factor. And he conceded that cattle should not have been trampling and defecating in the springs that flow into a salmon-spawning stream. Within days of the reporter's visit, the cattle were moved.
"The cows that go in there do some damage, I won't deny that," Mr. Nelson said. "But they're only in those areas a few days out of the year. You'd be surprised at how quickly the damage can be restored."
He added, "We're very proud of that range. If we didn't have cowboys out there taking care of it, this and other public lands would fall into pretty bad shape."
Paradoxically, the Senate bill, and a similar measure proposed in the House, comes as free market economics is driving all but some of the wealthiest public-land ranchers out of business. Beef prices have fallen by 40 percent in the last year alone.
Without support from the Government, which provides roads, water and forage to ranchers for little or, in some cases, no fees, many cattle operations would leave public land, some experts believe.
The Senate bill would "create and sustain a land-use monopoly that is anathema to American values and harmful to the West," Karl Hess, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, wrote in a recent essay.
But Senator Domenici and the livestock industry backing the bill say that ranchers need protection from other groups that oppose grazing on public land.
For that reason, a new provision has been written into the bill that would prevent everyone except ranchers and adjacent property owners from having a significant say in in how the land should be managed. "Without this change, persons who are not directly affected would be allowed to challenge management decisions affecting individual grazing permits and leases," Mr. Domenici wrote in a June 30 memorandum to other senators.
"In other words, me," said Linn Kincannon of the Idaho Conservation League, the state's oldest conservation group. "They're trying to prevent people like me from having any say in what goes in this huge section of public land in my own backyard."
Ranchers say some of the strongest critics do not care about the land, but simply want to drive cattle out of the area. "Our major concern is the very small percentage of the American public that wants to turn these lands into their so-called natural state," said Bob Sears of the Idaho Cattle Association.

HEADLINE: In House, Tirade on China, but a Vote to Keep Trade as It Is

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
The House railed long and fervently today against China's arrest of Harry Wu, China's use of prisoners as factory workers, China's sale of missile blueprints to its allies and China's use of forced birth control.
But given the opportunity, it declined to show its displeasure in unmistakable fashion: by revoking China's preferred trading status with the United States. 
 It was either the triumph of sweet reason over emotion, as graybeards in both parties said, or a cave-in to multinational corporations and their hired influence-peddlers, as both left-wing Democrats and right-wing Republicans asserted.
By common agreement, it was the narrowest escape yet for advocates of unfettered trade with China, including the Clinton Administration and the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill.
By a deceptively large margin of 321 to 107, the House voted to kill a resolution that would have revoked China's status as a "most favored nation" in trade with the United States. Federal law demands that Congress review China's standing every year, and the Chinese have clung to their designation every year since the two nations opened economic ties in the 1970's.
But the House renewed the most-favored privilege only after it ordered the White House, by an even more lopsided 416-to-10 vote, to establish a Radio Free Asia and to report on its handling of major American grievances against the Chinese. That measure was a compromise between the advocates and opponents of China's preferred trading status.
Leaders on both sides said they had served notice that both parties were not merely unhappy with the Administration's reluctance to punish China for unacceptable acts, but outright distressed by the fact that China runs a vast trade surplus with the United States even as it ignores American protests over its behavior.
"Part of what we're doing is sending a message to China, and part is about the Administration," said Representative Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat who favors revoking China's trade status, but agreed to the compromise legislation instead.
In truth, "most favored nation" status is not all that preferential; most nations enjoy the privilege. But not having it is a distinct disadvantage to an exporting nation: the tariff on sweaters and shoes shipped to the United States would leap from 6 percent to 60 percent, for example, and the levy on Christmas tree lights from 8 percent to 50 percent.
Officially, the White House took no position on the compromise bill. But its drafters said the Administration lobbied behind the scenes on its behalf, seeking to avert an uncomfortably close vote on revoking China's preferred trading status.
The White House was trying to find a way for Congress to vent its frustrations without forcing a change in Mr. Clinton's decision last year to separate human rights issues from trade relations.
After the vote this afternoon, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative and one of the officials who pressed Mr. Clinton to extend most-favored-nation status last year, said that balance had been achieved. "This signals the impatience of Congress and the Administration for China to begin to act responsibly globally and at home," he said today. But he said, "It also indicates we are ready to engage in political and economic terms."
Mr. Kantor contended that China would receive "a clear message" from the Congressional vote. Clearly, however, China may get another message: No matter how much it provokes Washington on the human rights front, Mr. Clinton has gone so far in keeping commerce and politics separate that Beijing need not fear a return to the old policy.
China would suffer from tariff increases if it lost its most-favored-nation status. Its trade surplus with the United States has ballooned from about $7 billion five years ago to an estimated $40 billion this year, second only to Japan.
Because of just that, politicians of all stripe find most-favored-nation status a tempting target whenever Chinese behavior falls below American -- or international -- standards.
Congress's majority of free-trade advocates and foreign-affairs moderates has always prevailed in the fight over China's trade standing, aided by a lobbying effort by aircraft makers, petrochemical companies and other firms with nascent business in China.
Last fall's Republican ascendancy brought a flock of economic populists into Representative Peter DeFazio's opposing camp. Mr. DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat, has campaigned vigorously against China's favored status. And although Republican leaders insist they would have won an up-or-down vote on the issue, they elected instead to strike a deal with the anti-China forces.
The legislation passed today censures China for a range of military, trade and human-rights offenses and orders the Clinton Administration to report every six months on how it has addressed them. It also would give the Administration three months to begin broadcasting pro-democracy programs into China. Representative Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, a Democrat against most-favored-nation status, said she and many other opponents come from districts where "people are victims of declining wages and economic power in this country."
Noting that millionaires comprise more than a third of the Senate and about a fifth of the House, she added: "The people who are paying the price for this aren't represented here."

HEADLINE: Third World Migrants Risk Hell for a Dream

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: GYOR, Hungary, July 18

 BODY:
With dreams of a safe and prosperous life in a faraway country, Williappan Ratnarajah sold his family home in war-racked Sri Lanka and paid a casual acquaintance $10,000 to smuggle himself and his younger brother to Germany.
The months-long journey from Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital, to Moscow through Kiev and Bucharest ended in horror last week when his brother, Salam, 24, was one of 18 Sri Lankans who suffocated to death in the back of an airless, padlocked container abandoned on the hot plains of Hungary. 
 Mr. Ratnarajah, 28, survived with 18 others in a second container, attached to the same truck. They had managed to punch a tiny hole in the metal roof during what was to have been their journey to the promised land.
The tragedy was the latest illustration of the sudden surge of trafficking of illegal immigrants into Western Europe, and then often on to the United States, from Asia, Africa and the Middle East through the now porous borders of the former Communist bloc.
Experts calculate that people-smuggling, a business increasingly run by international crime syndicates, reaped up to $1 billion last year.
For the Sri Lankans who survived, the last leg of their trip turned out to be nearly 48 hours of hell.
"When we started they gave us a small container of water and some bread," said Mr. Ratnarajah, tears creeping down his cheeks, as he recalled their last starting point in a forest on the edge of Bucharest, Romania. "We thought the truck would stop for water but it didn't and the water ran out after a short time."
The truck driver ignored their desperate but gradually weakening bangings for help on the walls of his container adjacent to the driver's cabin, he said. "We stopped twice," he recalled. "I'm not sure if it was a border but the driver just came out and said: 'Don't shout, don't shout. Police.' "
Perhaps the driver realized that his charges were dying; perhaps he decided he couldn't make it through the border to Austria. But, according to the Hungarian police, he pulled up here at 3 A.M. last Friday about 20 miles shy of the Austrian border.
He unlocked the first container with Mr. Ratnarajah and 18 others, all of them nearly unconscious, and told them they were in Germany. The next day, the police said they found the truck with blood oozing out of the second container.
Inside were 18 bodies, including that of one woman. Hungarian medical examiners said the dead were all healthy people aged between 18 and 30 and they had died of asphyxiation in soaring summer temperatures over a period of 24 hours.
The Sri Lankans, which included a fairly well-to-do shipping clerk from Colombo and an unemployed young man, took what law enforcement officials describe as a typical route. Many of them flew from Colombo to Moscow on 10-day student visas. They were then kept in safe houses and were closely guarded as they were moved by "agents" from country to country in the former Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe.
They also paid fairly typical prices: whatever the agents decided they could afford.
Mr. Ratnarajah, who worked as a driver in Sri Lanka, said he met a countryman he called Rajah at a roadside restaurant near his hometown, Matale, in February. "He had a lot of passports and tickets in his hands," he recalled. "I asked what he was doing and he said he was sending people to Germany and if I wished he could send me too. He demanded $10,000."
Threatened with being drawn into the civil war in Sri Lanka, Mr. Ratnarajah said his mother was anxious for him and his brother to leave. Three days later, he handed over the cash. "He said within 10 days he would send us to Germany."
With 18 other Sri Lankans the two brothers flew to Moscow, where they stayed in a house for about a month, he said. They were then escorted by train to Kiev for another month or so and then on to Moldova, and then to Bucharest. They were accompanied in their travels by a Sri Lankan called Kumar who made sure they never ventured outside for long or by themselves.
"My brother and I wanted to go back to Sri Lanka, but we didn't have a proper visa for where we were so we were afraid to go to the police or to go back," Mr. Ratnarajah said. He was looking forward, he said, to the refugee camp in Germany where "Rajah" had told him he would be given 10,000 German marks and after that a job.
Another survivor, Sasthi Kumar, a 26-year-old shipping clerk, said he sold part of his wife's dowry for $3,000 and paid Rajah. On the pledge that his wife would be able to join him, he flew to Moscow with another Sri Lankan and traveled through the same capitals.
"We met each other on the bus going from Bucharest to the forest where we got on the truck," Mr. Kumar said.
Maheswaran Devendran, 24, worked in a restaurant in Moscow for two years, before he met up with the Sri Lankan agents. He paid $800, the cheapest rate, from his savings in Russia. In Romania, he said, he was stripped of his gold chain and watch by one of the agents. "I was told: 'Not good to wear, give me,' " he said of his jewelry. "I was alone, so I'm frightened. So I give it."'
Two of the Sri Lankans who were taken by bus from the Bucharest safe houses to the forest to board the ill-fated truck refused to get on, Mr. Ratnarajah said.
And according to him, two of the agents, Rajah and Kumar, were on their way to Germany and were among the 18 who suffocated with his brother.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Compaq Earnings Rise 17%; Apple Net Income Down 25%

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
The Compaq Computer Corporation yesterday reported second-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street analysts' estimates and helped restore some measure of calm to the market for technology stocks.
But Apple Computer Inc.'s earnings for its fiscal third quarter -- reported after the stock market had closed -- fell far short of estimates, and its shares fell in after-hours trading. 
 Analysts had expected Apple to earn 90 to 95 cents a share; not counting one-time gains, it earned 80 cents. Apple stock had closed up $1.5625, at $47.0625, in Nasdaq trading. But the stock fell sharply after hours, to $43.
Compaq had been expected to earn 85 cents; it earned 90 cents. Its stock rose $3.50, to $48.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.
"Compaq had a very good quarter, with revenues and earnings both above estimate, and inventories down sequentially," said Todd Bakar, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist. Apple "is not shipping as many units as many of us thought they would," he said, noting production difficulties on some models and a shortage of Power PC chips. "They say they have the demand; they go into this quarter with a big backlog and hopefully they can take advantage of that," he said.
In contrast to the cautionary words from the Microsoft Corporation, which prompted the two-day selloff of technology shares, Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's president and chief executive, sounded a note of optimism in his outlook for the second half of the year.
"So far this year, we've seen solid, and really better-than-expected, market growth worldwide," Mr. Pfeiffer said in a telephone interview. "All indications are this is likely to continue," he said, citing the continued strength of the United States economy, stability in the European market and phenomenal growth in personal computer sales in Japan.
Compaq, based in Houston, will broaden its range of computers using the Intel Corporation's Pentium microprocessor, including the addition of a portable machine, and will improve the multimedia capabilities of its Presario consumer line, Mr. Pfeiffer said. He said the company would have machines in stores loaded with Microsoft's Windows 95 when the new operating system is shipped on Aug. 24.
For the second quarter, Compaq earned $246 million, or 90 cents a share, up 17 percent from $210 million, or 78 cents a share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 40 percent, to $3.5 billion from $2.5 billion.
Apple said that shipments of the company's Power Macintosh products more than doubled from the comparable quarter a year earlier and that the number of shipped Power Macintosh computers and upgrade units totaled more than two million units since its introduction in March 1994. But supply constraints that have hampered Apple in recent quarters continued, dragging down earnings.
For its fiscal third quarter ended June 30, Apple earned $103 million, or 84 cents a share, compared with $138 million, or $1.16 a share a year earlier.
But the 1994 quarter included a $127 million credit as a result of lower-than-expected costs from restructuring. And the most recent quarter included a $6.1 million credit after an additional adjustment of expenses. Without those adjustments, Apple earned $99.2 million, or 80 cents a share, up from $59.5 million, or 50 cents a share.
Revenues rose 20 percent, to $ 2.58 billion from $2.15 billion.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
G.M. Rise Bucks Quarter's Auto Earnings Trend

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 20

 BODY:
If they ever played Broadway instead of Wall Street, the Big Three auto companies might consider calling their act The Perils of Pollyanna.
With their widely varying second quarter earnings reports this week, they demonstrated the danger in their business of excessive optimism.
The Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, which had breathlessly predicted robust sales this spring, built too many cars and trucks and watched their earnings slide in the second quarter as they ladled out rebates and other incentives to entice indifferent buyers. 
 Today, the General Motors Corporation, widely teased in the industry last year for its relatively gloomy outlook, reported an 18 percent gain in earnings -- exceeding analysts' expectations. G.M.'s conservative production schedule paid off. Its average incentive per vehicle actually fell in the three months ending June 30.
Now, perhaps chastened, all three companies are predicting a mild but sustained recovery in sales, and in the economy in general, over the next two quarters and beyond, thanks partly to the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates earlier this month.
"I think the soft landing scenario is playing out," J. Michael Losh, G.M.'s chief financial officer, said. "Ninety-five reminds us a lot of 1984."
In 1984, he said, demand trailed off after a run-up in interest rates; after rates subsided, buyers returned and provided the industry with several strong years.
In fact, G.M. now has the highest estimate for total sales this year: 15.3 million cars and trucks, just down from last year's 15.4 million.
Although they are all optimistic -- cautiously so, thank you -- about next year, no one is predicting sales in 1996 except Chrysler, which is calling for 15.5 million. Just six months ago, it was predicting 16.8 million sales in 1996.
To some extent, G.M., with its sober prognostication, made a virtue of necessity last year. Its plants were already straining to keep up with demand, so it had good reason to hope for modest growth at best.
But, perhaps because G.M. did not count on strong growth to bail it out, it has continued to focus on cutting costs in its factories and in its purchases of parts and materials, judging from its earnings report today.
Despite a falloff in sales, profit margins in G.M.'s core North American automotive operations continued to widen -- in stark contrast to the deteriorating margins reported by Ford on Wednesday and highlighted in critical reports by auto stock analysts today.
Investors seized on the distinction between the companies, bidding G.M. stock up $1 on the New York Stock Exchange. In active trading, Ford shares slipped $1.125 a share to close at $29.
Mr. Losh attributed G.M.'s improved margins to two factors: reduction in material costs, because of G.M.'s efforts to consolidate its purchasing to exploit economies of scale; and improved manufacturing productivity, which among other savings resulted in lower overtime costs.
"A plant last year might have been struggling to get out their daily product in eight hours, and maybe they worked an extra half hour of overtime," Mr. Losh said. Now, he said, such plants are hitting their targets without overtime.
Strange as it may sound, from an investor's perspective G.M. may look more attractive because it is less efficient than Ford or Chrysler. Already far leaner than G.M., Ford and Chrysler cannot wring savings as easily from their operations.
Because G.M. is making more money on declining sales, many analysts believe it may be best positioned among the Big Three for earnings growth, although it is far from done with its turnaround.
"Volume down, profits up -- it's another piece of information that the company's effort to rebuild its automotive operations is working," said Phil Fricke, auto industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. "For the second quarter in a row, G.M. has looked a lot better than Ford."
In a critique today, Nicholas Lobocarro of S. G. Warburg & Company predicted that Ford's margins would continue to suffer. Ford, he said, is replacing its cars and trucks with new models that are more expensive to make because they have higher "content." That is, they have upscale features like clever air-filtering systems and fancy touches like an unusual console in the new Taurus sedan. Ford is hoping such vehicles will fetch higher prices, as high quality Japanese cars do.
But, Mr. Lococarro wrote, "We are skeptical that all of the higher content costs will be paid for by the consumer (especially on the car side of the market), since the current consumer appears to be very price conscious."
G.M., he noted, is pursuing the opposite strategy, offering the "best value" by building low-cost vehicles. "While it is premature to decide which strategy will translate into greater long-term profitability," he wrote, "investors will likely focus initially on the strategy guaranteed to cause greater short-term costs -- Ford's."
But G.M. may be running into difficulties of its own. It finished the quarter with more cars and trucks sitting unsold on dealers' lots than either of its competitors, which could portend higher rebates and other incentive costs in the third quarter.
"We're reasonably comfortable with the inventory level," Mr. Losh said. "But we'll have to see what happens in the market."
Meanwhile, by biting the bullet and offering heavy incentives, Chrysler has cut its dealers' inventories to levels far below those of its competitors. With its new model mini-van now widely available, it may be poised to rebound in coming quarters.
For the quarter, G.M.'s earnings climbed to $2.3 billion or $2.39 per share, compared with $1.9 billion last year, or $2.23. Wall Street had been expecting about $2.25 a share in the latest quarter. G.M.'s revenues rose 9.3 percent, to $44.1 billion.
On Wednesday, Ford reported its profits slipped 8.2 percent, to $1.57 billion. On Tuesday, Chrysler reported its earnings fell 85.9 percent in the quarter, to $135 million. As a group, the auto companies made $3.9 billion in the quarter, down 13.3 percent from last year.

Treasury Prices Show Little Change

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended little changed yesterday, after a sharp decline on Wednesday.
The recent consolidation in the bond market has been fueled by concern that the economy has not slowed enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates for a second time this summer. On July 6, the Fed cut its target for overnight bank loan rates by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.75 percent. After that move, many traders had expected to Fed to push rates lower when its policy-making committee meets next in August. 
 Now some market participants fear that this year's powerful rally may have run out of steam.
Traders and investors "want to be told the Fed is going to cut in August," said Mark Taborsky, who manages $280 million in bonds at Abacus Financial Group in Chicago. "Unless they're told that, yields might go" as high as 7.1 percent next month, he said.
Bruce Hillyer, a trader at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company in Chicago, said: "You've had a watershed shift in psychology. The bull market's over for quite some time, and nobody wants to be the last one out the door."
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond edged up 1/32 yesterday, to 10920/32 , leaving its yield unchanged at 6.86 percent. The price of the two-year note was also unchanged for a yield of 5.88 percent.
The Treasury, meanwhile, auctioned $18.29 billion in 52-week Treasury bills yesterday. The average discount rate was 5.38 percent, up from 5.22 percent at the last auction on June 22. It was the highest rate since bills averaged 5.54 percent on May 25.
Bonds recovered from early declines yesterday after investors sought to buy securities at some of the highest yields in months.
"With the long bond pushing towards 7 percent and inflation easing towards 3 percent, bonds are starting to look attractive," said David Capurro at Franklin Resources in San Mateo, Calif. Mr. Capurro, who manages $520 million of bonds, said he bought 10- and 15-year Treasury notes yesterday.
Despite the recent rise in yields, corporate treasurers are still selling debt because borrowing costs remain lower than they were earlier this year.
"For the next couple of weeks, it'll still be an active calendar," said Mike Allen, an investment banker who helps arrange corporate bond sales at CS First Boston.
The Banc One Corporation and United Companies Financial sold $700 million of bonds yesterday.
Banc One, the banking company based in Columbus, Ohio, sold $600 million of bonds, 20 percent more than planned, in two parts: $300 million of 10-year notes priced to yield 7.09 percent, or 69 basis points more than the 10-year Treasury note, and another $300 million of 30-year bonds at a yield of 7.838 percent, or 97.8 basis points more than the 30-year Treasury bond. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
United Companies Financial, an insurer and mortgage lender based in Baton Rouge, La., raised $100 million by selling three-year notes. The notes were priced to yield 7 percent, or 103 basis points more than the three-year Treasury note.
In other trading, Michigan sold $180 million of bonds yesterday.
Merrill Lynch & Company won the bidding on the bonds due 1996 through 2015 at yields lower than those on comparable existing securities. The Michigan bonds due in 10 years were priced to yield 5 percent, or 5.13 percent, according to Bloomberg Fair Value analytics.
The sale came just two days after Moody's Investors Service Inc. raised the credit ratings on $6.15 billion of Michigan's publicly traded debt to AA from A1.

Don't Kill the C.E.A.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
The Council of Economic Advisers helped persuade President Kennedy to cut taxes and thus spur a recovery -- a decisive case of applying the theories of John Maynard Keynes to public policy.
The council warned President Johnson that he would ignite inflation if he persisted in paying for the Vietnam War by borrowing rather than taxing -- advice he ignored with disastrous consequences. 
 The council steered President Nixon away from lavishly expensive subsidies for supersonic air travel and President Bush away from underwriting the development of advanced television technology that would soon have been obsolete.
The council advised President Clinton to downsize his monster health-care plan. He rejected that counsel, and watched as health-care reform went down the drain.
By anyone's standards, the C.E.A. has dispensed more good advice than bad over the years. Yet despite its solid record and modest size, it has now been abolished by the House, which intends to apply the council's puny $3.5 million budget to deficit reduction. That is a poor decision, and the Senate should reverse it.
The council consists of three economists and an eager staff, most of whom are on temporary loan from universities. It provides Presidents with professional analysis of public policies that is not available anywhere else in government. True, there are dozens of economists scattered throughout the Federal Government. But they are for the most part advocates, representing their cabinet secretaries or vested interests. The council has one client, the President, and one constituency, the consumer. It is the only disinterested voice the President hears.
The council has attracted distinguished members. James Tobin, a Nobel laureate, served on the Kennedy council, whose staff included two more Nobelists, Robert Solow and Kenneth Arrow. Joseph Stiglitz, on many short lists for a future Nobel, serves now. Professional integrity has driven members to oppose their boss when necessary. Martin Feldstein publicly attacked oversize deficits, though he served President Reagan.
The council has also been farsighted. In the Kennedy era, apart from the general tax cut, it designed a novel tax credit for business investment. Michael Boskin, chairman of President Bush's council, pushed for market-based environmental policies that provided companies with financial incentives to fight pollution. The Bush council also pushed for auctioning the broadcast spectrum so that taxpayers could pocket some profit. But mostly the council naysays, telling Presidents that their latest fad, or Congress's, will backfire.
I do not come to this debate without bias. As a graduate student in the 1970's, I was stirred by Professor Solow's descriptions of the heady 1960's, when economists traveled from Cambridge, Mass., to preach the gospel of Keynes. A decade later, it was obvious that economists possessed few macroeconomic answers. But I remain committed to the proposition that professional analysis can save the country from multiple disasters.
The G.O.P attack on the council is doubly ironic. First, the C.E.A. has usually sided with Republicans who prefer markets to bureaucratic controls. Second, it is the Republicans who are pushing the economist's favorite tool, cost-benefit analysis. Senate Republicans might keep one fact in mind. If the council steers a President away from one rotten decision -- just one -- it will have made up for its measly annual budget in perpetuity.

COCA-COLA CO. (KO,N)

 BODY:
The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that profit rose 18.5 percent in the second quarter, meeting Wall Street expectations, as its international sales grew strongly.
The world's biggest soft-drink maker, based in Atlanta, said net income rose to $898 million, or 71 cents a share, from $758 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 13.7 percent, to $4.94 billion from $4.34 billion. 
 Worldwide volume, measured in terms of cases of Coke, Sprite and other brands, rose 10 percent, with volume outside the United States up 11 percent. Coke sells concentrate to bottling companies, which then sell the cases. The company generates about 80 percent of its earnings outside the United States.
Coke's biggest volume increases included a 45 percent jump in Brazil and a 37 percent gain in China. In Mexico, volume rose 1 percent, depressed by the poor economy.
The biggest setback came in the crucial market of Japan, where case sales fell 3 percent. Among the factors Coke cited for the decline were the slumping Japanese economy and the weather. The decline in Japanese volume was mitigated by the yen's rise against the dollar.
In the United States, volume rose 6 percent.
In discussing the results, Roberto C. Goizueta, chairman and chief executive, said, "Sprite, a 34-year-old brand, is the fastest-growing major carbonated soft drink in America, and Coca-Cola Classic continues to record significant volume gains." (Bloomberg Business News)

Future Is Cloudy for U.S. Festival

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: DENVER, July 20

 BODY:
The summer gathering of the nation's developing athletes in Olympic-related sports, the Olympic Festival, begins a 10-day run on Friday and faces an uncertain future on a crowded sports calendar.
The festival, which features 3,500 athletes from around the country competing in 37 sports, began in 1978 and was designed to be held in the three years between Summer Olympics. But growing costs, such as the need to construct velodromes, have made the festival an expensive proposition for host cities, which cannot sign corporate sponsors that compete with the official sponsors of the United States Olympic team and the Summer Games. 
 The lack of elite athletes, who have discovered an explosion of international competitions in the summer, also has put a strain on ticket sales.
The festival, which remains popular with the governing bodies of sports who seek to develop their athletes for later participation in the Olympics, has been scaled back to twice every four years. The next two will be held in 1997 and 1999 at sites to be determined. Further alterations are certain to be recommended on Saturday during a meeting of the executive committee of the United States Olympic Committee.
Several options are possible, such as reducing the number of sports, inviting international athletes and reducing the festival to once every four years.
"We're trying to balance the economic realities with the popularity of the event with our national governing bodies," said Mike Moran, a spokesman for the U.S.O.C. "Each year, it's costing cities more. Having to build facilities may limit the number of cities that can host this. So we have to re-examine things without stifling the growth of our athletes."
Dallas, Phoenix, Seattle and Richmond have expressed interest in being hosts for the 1997 and 1999 festivals, but the format will be decided before the host city is named, Moran said.
"We'd like to define it and let the cities know what they're dealing with," Moran said.
Organizers of the 1995 festival have spread the events among sites in Denver, Colorado Springs and Boulder. Ticket sales and corporate funding had been lagging in recent weeks as organizers worried that they could not meet their $11.9 million budget. But, at a news conference on Tuesday, organizers said the cable firm of Tele-Communications Inc., based in the Denver suburb of Englewood, had committed $150,000 to the festival.
With a recent boost, the total in ticket sales has reached $1.5 million out of a forecast $2.4 million, said organizers, who hope to earn a small surplus with walkup ticket sales and additional funds from concessions and parking.
The equestrian events have been canceled because of the outbreak of an equine viral disease.

Koreans Seen Buying More U.S. Concerns

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 20

 BODY:
Just as the Japanese are licking their wounds from ill-fated investments in American companies, the Korean giants are starting to buy in.
The announcement by LG Electronics on Monday that it would purchase a controlling stake in the Zenith Electronics Corporation for $350 million was only the latest of a recent spurt of investments in well-known American consumer-products and high-technology companies by South Korean conglomerates. 
 In February, Samsung Electronics bought a 40 percent stake in AST Research, a personal computer maker, for $378 million. It has also bought or invested in six smaller mainly start-up high-technology companies in The United States in the last two years.
Late last year, the Hyundai Corporation spent more than $300 million to buy a microelectronics division from AT&T. The year before it spent $150 million to buy 40 percent of Maxtor, a Silicon Valley disk-drive maker.
And experts predict the acquisition binge will continue as the giant Korean conglomerates, known as chaebol, seek to gain new technologies and increase their sales outside South Korea.
"It's just a natural extension of their empire-building impulse," said Stephen Marvin, chief of research for Ssangyong Securities in Seoul. "The chaebol now have the means to buy overseas companies, and they see the need to broaden their geographical operations."
To be sure, all the South Korean purchases amount to just a fraction of what the Sony Corporation or Matsushita Electric Industrial spent on their ill-fated acquisitions of Hollywood studios. The Korean acquisitions have not gained the same level of attention, or generated the same backlash, in the United States as the Japanese purchases of film studios or investments in highly visible property like Rockefeller Center.
Still, the Koreans are investing for the same reasons as the Japanese did -- to gain technology or entry into new markets, or even because they are caught up by the glamour of Hollywood.
Cheil Food and Chemicals, South Korea's largest food company and part of the Samsung Group, agreed in April to spend $300 million to acquire an 11 percent stake in Dreamworks SKG, the new entertainment company started by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen.
The United States is not the Koreans' only target. Samsung raised eyebrows in Japan by buying two Japanese concerns -- the Lux Corporation, a maker of audio equipment, and the Union Optical Company. It is rare for Japanese companies to be acquired.
The Korean companies realize that they must gain a more international perspective in order to compete. The Samsung Group is sending 500 young executives each year to live in foreign countries without having to work, just to learn the local language and culture. The people sent to the United States are allowed to travel by air only once. The rest of the time they must go by car, bus or train to get a closer look at the country.
The Koreans are building as well as buying overseas. Both Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Electronics recently announced plans to build billion-dollar semiconductor factories in the United States, their first chip plants outside South Korea. The Koreans are also putting up factories in China and other low-cost Asian nations.
The electronics companies can afford their purchases because they are part of huge conglomerates with interests in everything from shipbuilding and construction to automobiles and financial services. The conglomerates benefit from the strong Japanese yen, which makes competing Korean automobiles and television sets relatively cheaper on world markets. The resulting export boom has contributed to South Korea's strong economic growth -- about 8 percent annually.
But the electronics companies themselves have come into the money because of their huge success in the computer memory-chip business. Samsung Electronics has become the world's largest supplier of dynamic random access memory chips, the relatively low-cost semiconductors that perform short-term memory functions in computers. Hyundai Electronics and LG Semiconductor, which is 60 percent owned by LG Electronics, have also become major producers.
The three companies had combined chip revenue of $8 billion last year, up from $3 billion two years earlier, according to Dataquest, a market research firm. Analysts say profit margins are as high as 30 percent because a chip shortage has kept prices high.
Despite their success in memory chips, and in consumer-electronics products, the South Korean companies are not that technically advanced.
Many of the components and production equipment they use to make chips, videocassette recorders and other products come from Japan, so that the nation's trade deficit, mainly with Japan, balloons when the economy booms. And South Korea has not developed much technology in areas like computers or multimedia products.
"As far as existing consumer electronics are concerned, we are competitive enough," said Lee Hun Jo, chairman and chief executive of LG Electronics, formerly known as Goldstar. "But for multimedia products, we need more technology." LG hopes to get technology for high-definition television and multimedia from Zenith.
Acquisitions allow for technology to be obtained more quickly than if Korean companies tried to develop it themselves. "In a more high-tech area like multimedia, we think indigenous technology development is not the best way," said Paik Man Gi, director of the industrial technology planning division at South Korea's trade ministry.
Even in semiconductors, the Korean companies need to expand beyond memory chips. That explains Hyundai's purchase of what was the NCR microelectronics-products division of AT&T.
Korean companies, which have long been focused on their home market, also lack the brand names and marketing skills of the Japanese. Samsung could not succeed in the world personal computer market because of those deficiencies. But buying a stake in AST will help give it the distribution it needs.
The chaebol are also under pressure from the Government, which is trying to limit the influence over the economy of these huge family-owned companies by making them divest themselves of some operations.
So far, though, the campaign to curb the chaebol has not borne much fruit. Still, the chaebol themselves see the need to become more competitive overseas, in part because their protected home market is being slowly opened. They are modernizing, giving more latitude to professional managers instead of founding-family members.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Are Highest in 3 Years

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new unemployment claims jumped last week to the highest level in nearly three years, the Government said today, pointing to residual weakness in the job market.
Initial claims for state unemployment pay in the week that ended last Saturday rose by 18,000, to 417,000, the highest since 418,000 in the week ended Sept. 19, 1992, the Labor Department said. 
 It was the first time claims have pushed through the 400,000 level since January 1994, and the increase exceeded private economists' forecasts for claims of 368,000 in the latest week.

A BRIDGE OF LONGING
The Lost Art of Yiddish Storytelling
By David G. Roskies
419 pages. Harvard University Press. $37.50.
In the 1880's, Sholom Aleichem, the beloved storyteller of the doomed kingdom of Eastern European Yiddish life, edited and published "The Jewish People's Library," a handsome literary almanac that included stories by the best Yiddish writers of the time. In David G. Roskies's view, the almanac was a landmark in Jewish culture, but not for the reason it might seem most natural to assume. 
 To most of us, probably, the stories of Aleichem, I. L. Peretz, Isaac Meir Dik and, more recently, Isaac Bashevis Singer, sing of the very essence of the Eastern European Jewish tradition. They incarnate, it would seem, authenticity itself, an eccentric, spiritually rich and materially threadbare way of life that has since, of course, disappeared. But Mr. Roskies, who teaches literature at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, lays out a more complex and interesting theory in "A Bridge of Longing," an ambitious, learned, sometimes difficult study of two centuries of Yiddish literature.
In his view, the mere fact that the world described by the Yiddish writers is widely taken to be authentic is proof of how successful those writers were in what he calls "creative betrayal," an effort by a group of "modern Jewish revolutionaries, rebels and immigrants" to "salvage for a nontraditional audience forms of the culture assumed to be traditional."
"The Jewish People's Library," for example, was a landmark not so much of an authentic tradition as of an invented one. The rabbis, those avatars of high culture, stuck to Torah and Talmud and saw stories about the folk as devices for simple people and women. But the rabbinical tradition, challenged by migration and the 19th-century movement known as Haskala, or enlightenment, was in crisis. And so the Yiddish writers mixed old and new in a new cultural creation aimed at a revival of faith and identity.
The paradox is that the invented culture was so convincing that for succeeding generations it passed for the real thing. "Wherever there are people who look to Yiddish as an authentic expression of yidishkayt," or East European Jewish culture, "it is to these artifacts that they first turn," Mr. Roskies writes.
He lays out his theoretical position at the beginning of an extended exploration of the lives and work of major Yiddish writers of Poland, Russia and the United States who fixed in the minds of later generations the image of the shtetl, the rural Jewish ghetto, as an abode of tragicomic quaintness, homespun philosophy and redemptive religious faith. He begins with Rabbi Nahman of Bratslav, the Hasidic preacher who turned to storytelling "when all else failed."
"It was to rouse those remaining followers from their spiritual slumber, to reconsecrate them to the arduous task of redemption in a world alive with evil and tragedy, that Nahman began telling stories," Mr. Roskies writes. "By bridging Hebrew and Yiddish, the scholars and the folk, mythic past and historic present, Reb Nahman invented a new form of Jewish self-expression."
"A Bridge of Longing" ends with portraits of writers from the scattered world of Yiddish literature -- in America, Australia and Israel -- after World War II and the Holocaust. In between are intellectually luxuriant essays on what might be called the canonical Yiddish writers, from Peretz to Singer.
There are winding, thickly forested passages in Mr. Roskies's book in which the ordinary reader might lose track of the theme. Here and there are bits of gluey jargon from the world of academic literary criticism: phrases about the mediation of binary oppositions, symbolic landscapes, multidetermined mythic figures and mimetic realism. One wishes that Mr. Roskies were, in the spirit of his subject, more plainspoken. Still, he has produced an often brilliant scholarly volume that will help rescue the "lost art of Yiddish storytelling" by explaining what it really was.
The tradition was, as Mr. Roskies explains, often saved by those who already appeared furthest from it. Mr. Peretz, for example, was a struggling urban lawyer, arrested in 1899 for supporting a workers' strike, who turned to Yiddish folklore rather than the orthodox rabbinic teachings to forge a new secular Jewish identity. He turned the dying shtetl of the end of the 19th century into "an ideal setting for fantasy and heroism," and in so doing, Mr. Roskies writes, transformed himself into "the master architect of Jewish modernism."
If it was remarkable that a secular lawyer could reinvent the shtetl, then, as Mr. Roskies puts it, it was "nothing short of miraculous" that Aleichem, the best loved of the Yiddish folklorists, was a stockbroker from the mostly non-Jewish city of Kiev. Sholom Aleichem was the pen name of Solomon Rabinovitch, a well-heeled, cosmopolitan disciple of Gogol, whose most celebrated character, Tevye the Milkman (world-famous as the truculent but affectionate father in the Broadway musical "Fiddler on the Roof"), embodied the Yiddish cultural revolution.
"The mature artist found in Tevye, in the Bible-quoting dairyman, a way to explore life's ironies," Mr. Roskies writes. "And the main irony is this: In a closed and crumbling world with scant intellectual resources, offering the most paltry economic and social rewards, a philosophical giant can exist, and persist."
Tevye, in this sense, becomes a kind of Jewish everyman, but also the perfect emblem of Mr. Roskies's theme of the invented tradition that came to seem more authentic than the tradition it subverted. With his rough-hewn eloquence and relentless, common-sense logic, Tevye represents fortitude and faith in the face of a world of "undeserved catastrophe." Mr. Roskies calls him "the figure of a comic Job." As such, he writes, Tevye "embodies the 'folk' without access to power, politics or the press, but with the ability to protest its innocence and to demand redress."

HEADLINE: Tax Fraud: Two Baseball Legends Say It's So

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
Duke Snider and Willie McCovey, two baseball Hall of Famers whose images of power and dignity still sparkle for generations of the game's loyalists, pleaded guilty yesterday to Federal tax fraud charges, saying they had knowingly failed to report thousands of dollars earned by signing autographs and participating in sports memorabilia shows.
The two slugging legends, who had spent their physical primes playing under the bright lights of stadiums across the country, yesterday stood under the ordinary glare of the fluorescent ceiling lights in Federal Court in Brooklyn, where they raised their right hands, swore oaths to tell the truth, and pronounced themselves criminals. And so for the first time, the stars from the game's gilded age were enveloped in a crime that up to now has involved players only from its more troubled present. 
 The 69-year-old Mr. Snider, a couple of Brooklyn neighborhoods removed from the site of Ebbets Field and his glory days with the Dodgers as the Duke of Flatbush, when he hit 407 home runs in 16 seasons, admitted that he had conspired with the promoters of a 1989 sports memorabilia show in Atlantic City not to report a $10,000 payment for his appearance.
The former center fielder, wearing a gold DUKE wristband and a Hall of Fame ring on his right hand, also said he had failed to report more than $100,000 in income from memorabilia shows and promotional appearances from 1984 to 1993. Mr. Snider, who signed a cooperation agreement with prosecutors, is to avoid any jail time.
Mr. McCovey, who is 57 years old and walks with the aid of a cane, pleaded guilty to having failed to list nearly $70,000 in income from 1988 to 1990. Mr. McCovey did not sign a cooperation agreement. The former San Francisco Giants first baseman, who hit 521 home runs in his 22 seasons of major league baseball, was paid $33,000 in cash at the same 1989 Atlantic City show attended by Mr. Snider, and that was part of the income for which he failed to pay taxes. He faces one to seven months in jail.
"We have choices to make in our lives," a contrite Mr. Snider said in a brief exchange with reporters outside the courthouse. "I made the wrong choice. I was knowledgeable. I was aware of the crime I was involved in. And I made the wrong choice. I hope the effects of it won't hurt baseball that badly."
The guilty pleas yesterday were two of the stranger shocks to hit baseball lately. Plagued by poor attendance, ill will resulting from last year's strike, and disaffection over the actions of surly millionaire owners and players, the sport now has to confront the fact that even its most benevolently remembered heroes of the past are capable of money-driven criminality.
"We are very saddened by this," said Bud Selig, the acting commissioner of baseball. "It's a bad day for the game."
The admissions of guilt, however, are unlikely to affect the Hall of Fame status of the two. Jeff Idelson, a spokesman for the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., said: "There's nothing in the bylaws or the rules" about ejecting people from the hall for criminal convictions.
Prosecutors and Internal Revenue Service agents yesterday all but promised there would be more people entangled by the investigation. Charles T. Franssen, chief of the I.R.S.'s criminal investigation division, said, "Investigations of the sports memorabilia industry are nationwide in scope, and can be expected to include promoters and ballplayers and others."
The sports memorabilia industry has mushroomed in the last 15 years, and experts estimate that mass-autographed merchandise now is a $500 million business. Much of that business, which includes athletes selling their names on home-shopping channels and through mail-order catalogues, is still done at trade shows, where athletes often sign cards, bats, balls and photographs for fixed prices. Many athletes, both current and former stars, have long chosen to be paid in cash at many such shows.
"The problem of this underground economy is serious," Mr. Franssen said.
The 1989 card show in Atlantic City apparently was a colossal success for players, promoters and fans, and, it now appears, for prosecutors, too. The show -- produced by Michael Bertolini, a Staten Island man who was a partner with Pete Rose in Hit King Marketing, and William Hungach, a Brooklynite -- brought together the 11 living players to hit at least 500 career home runs, and also included Pete Rose, Tony Perez and Mr. Snider.
"It seemed like the dawn of a new era in the memorabilia business," said Greg Goldstein, an executive with a card company and a former collector who attended the show.
Yesterday, prosecutors declined to say whether more of the players involved in the show would be indicted, but did not rule out the possibility. Robert Fink, an attorney for Mickey Mantle, said yesterday that while Mr. Mantle had been investigated as part of the inquiry into the Atlantic City show, he was convinced no charges would be brought against Mr. Mantle.
Both Mr. Bertolini and Mr. Hungach have previously pleaded guilty to charges involving their roles in the show, and law-enforcement officials said Mr. Hungach and Mr. Snider were cooperating in the continuing investigation.
"If prosecutors pick any of these shows and go after it, they are going to turn up much of the same kind of stuff," said John L. Pollok, Mr. McCovey's lawyer. As for Mr. McCovey, who walked out of court yesterday without speaking, Mr. Pollok said, "He's humiliated."
Both Mr. Snider, one of the more cherished New York players of his era, and Mr. McCovey, who served as a community relations official with the Giants after his playing days, appeared deeply embarrassed inside the Brooklyn courtroom. Both wore eyeglasses and read their plea agreements without questions. The two men, who both were inducted into the Hall of Fame in the 1980's, spoke only once, and they exchanged difficult smiles.
Outside, Mr. Snider, who once said he never made more than $46,000 a year as a ballplayer, chuckled slightly when he was asked if he really believed a Brooklyn jury would have convicted him of anything. He said there were "a lot of reasons" why he had taken the money and not reported it over the years. He said he had heart bypass surgery in 1987 and had been concerned about the financial welfare of his wife.

HEADLINE: Companies Reach Deal for Renewal In Heart of 42d St.

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

 BODY:
After 15 years of false starts and dashed hopes, a marathon effort to revitalize 42d Street turned an important corner yesterday as a group of entertainment companies and developers announced plans to open glittering attractions along the shadowy strip that was once the heart of American theater.
Nearly 100 years after enterprising theatrical producers like Oscar Hammerstein and Florenz Ziegfeld began developing glorious and ornate theaters just west of Times Square, the Walt Disney Company said it was firmly committed to anchor the next millennium of entertainment on the street. 
 In addition to Disney's plan to bring its trademark family-style amusement to Manhattan, Madame Tussaud's, the London wax museum, and American Multi-Cinemas, a nationwide chain of movie theaters, also announced that they had reached agreements to develop attractions on the block. Along with other recent -- though still tentative -- deals for the renovation of two other theaters and construction of a hotel, the new announcement means that most of 42d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues is committed for redevelopment.
If Disney's commitment provides the linchpin for the urban renewal project's success, then the musical fantasy "Beauty and the Beast" could go down in history as the savior of 42d Street. While generous government subsidies helped lure Disney executives, their interest in the New Amsterdam was sealed by the musical's long-running success at the Palace Theater on Broadway. The company now says it is set to begin work within a month on its $34 million restoration of the New Amsterdam Theater.
"The future of 42d Street has arrived," said Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Project, a unit of the New York State Urban Development Corporation. That agency and the New York City Economic Development Corporation have been working jointly since 1980 to rehabilitate the block. "This wonderful, complicated and sometimes tortured block has seen so many twists and turns over the last century," she said. "With this array of entertainment uses, the next 100 years are off to a great start."
But many questions still hover over the street that in recent decades came to be known as "the Deuce," a slick nickname that evoked images of the hustles, scams and lurking danger for which 42d Street gained infamy. While there are firm agreements on some projects -- the restoration of the New Victory Theater is nearing completion -- there are still several vacant properties and major issues involving others that must be resolved.
A plan announced earlier this week to restore the Lyric and Academy theaters left many developers wondering how Livent, the Toronto-based theatrical production company that plans to combine the two adjacent buildings into one large musical theater, can make the expensive project profitable. A plan by the Prudential Insurance Company of America and Park Tower Realty to build four office towers in the area has been put on hold until the market for office space rebounds. The financing must still be arranged for a $303 million hotel and entertainment complex proposed by Tishman Urban Development Corporation for the northwest end of that section of the street.
"The question is, will the economics of the marketplace allow those projects to proceed?" said Abby Hamlin, an executive vice president of Weiler Arnow, co-owner of property on the southwest side of the street. "A lot of exciting momentum has been created and this is an important moment," she said. "Now there's a lot of hard work to do."
Disney, whose initial interest in the project spawned a groundswell of inquiries from other entertainers, is already planning to open with a new musical inside the New Amsterdam by spring 1997. Unlike the other companies considering projects on the street, Disney was enticed with big government subsidies, largely in the form of city-financed low-interest loans that will cover about 75 percent of the company's cost.
"Disney was the bell cow," said John S. Dyson, Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development. "They were the first ones that got everyone else into the fence."
Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief executive officer, was unable to attend yesterday's rapidly organized announcement, but was reached by telephone aboard his corporate jet. "This is really going to happen," he marveled. "Even I'm surprised."
Even as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki joined a stage full of corporate executives and public officials in front of the 92-year-old New Amsterdam Theater to announce the agreements, a scantily clad peep show model sat in a second-floor window down the block, eating her lunch -- unfazed by the people who spilled into the street and slowed traffic to get a look at the dignitaries on stage.
The event almost didn't happen. At 2:30 A.M. yesterday, negotiations between Disney and public officials had reached an impasse and broke off without an agreement. Later in the morning, talks resumed, and while the two sides continued to parry and thrust over the final details of their pact, hasty planning for the announcement forged ahead. Earl C. Voelker, American Multi-Cinema's senior vice president for business development, flew in from Buenos Aires, where he was exploring new business opportunities, and Andrew Tansley, executive director of the Tussaud's Group, arrived from London.
Media kits suggested the changing cast of characters who have worked on the 42d Street project over the years. On the folder, a strip of black tape was stuck over the name of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. And since just about everyone involved in the project wanted his or her role noted, the kits contained 25 pages of nothing but press releases from all the various companies and public constituencies.
Despite the last-minute hitches, the deal with Disney was all but sealed last week, when word leaked out that city and state officials had secured letters of intent from American Multi-Cinemas and Tussaud's. Before it would agree to go forward with the New Amsterdam restoration, Disney had wanted the city to entice two more entertainment companies to the block.
This spring, after Tussaud's parent company, Pearson, lost a bitter battle to purchase the white marble One Times Square building, city officials seized the opportunity to make the London entertainer a part of its 42d Street development. Clay B. Lifflander, president of the city's economic development corporation, telephoned crestfallen Tussaud's officials and urged them to come back and consider looking at the 42d Street site, which includes the old Empire, Harris, and Liberty Theaters.
Under the deal's terms, American Multi-Cinemas, based in Kansas City, Mo., and Tussaud's, a top London attraction with 2.6 million visitors a year, will occupy space in a 335-square-foot retail and entertainment complex that will be developed by Forest City Ratner, a Brooklyn-based firm. The project is expected to cost $150 million to develop, and Tussaud's will invest $30 million to create its high-tech wax exhibits, while American Multi-Cinemas is expected to spend $25 million to create the city's largest multiplex, with 25 screens and 5,000 seats.
The construction on the Forest City Ratner complex is expected to generate 1,600 jobs and $6.6 million in city tax revenues over two years, city officials said. After it is completed, they said, the complex will provide 2,800 jobs and $15 million in tax revenues for the city.
In addition to the New Amsterdam and tentative plans to stage entertainment inside the proposed hotel complex, Disney said it would also open a Disney store on the southwest corner of the intersection of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue.

Utility Discounts Permitted

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed a bill into law yesterday that will allow the Board of Public Utility to offer discounted rates to certain retail customers. The Governor said the bill was designed to attract new businesses to New Jersey and persuade others not to relocate. Consumer groups had opposed the bill, singling out a provision that will give the utility board more latitude in setting rates on a case-by-case basis. This part of the legislation "opens the floodgates for utilities to increase the cost of electric service in New Jersey," said Curtis Fisher, program director of the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group Citzen Lobby.

HEADLINE: Admissions Change Will Alter Elite Campuses, Experts Say

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 21

 BODY:
 While the state's Republican Governor, Pete Wilson, hailed as a "historic achievement" the elimination of affirmative action at the nine-campus University of California, academicians expressed concern today that minority enrollment at the system's elite Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses would decline significantly.
By a vote of 14 to 10, the university's governing Board of Regents, many of them appointed by Governor Wilson and his Republican predecessor, George Deukmejian, late Thursday struck down the use of race, sex, religion, color or national origin as criteria for admission to the university. A parallel measure on hiring and contracting passed 15 to 10. 
 Mr. Wilson, who is seeking the Republican nomination for President, has made his opposition to affirmative action a fundamental part of his campaign.
Ward Connerly, the black businessman and regent who proposed the resolutions to terminate the preference programs, has argued that affirmative action has outlived its usefulness and now undermines achievement by blacks.
The measures require the Regents to adopt supplemental criteria for admission or hiring that replace membership in a racial or ethnic group with evidence of disadvantage, like "an abusive or otherwise dysfunctional home, or a neighborhood of unwholesome or anti-social influences."
Mr. Connerly said today that until these measures were in place, it would be impossible to know the impact of the dismantling of affirmative action, which the university has had in various forms since 1965, when it began an educational-opportunity program for disadvantaged students.
"We shouldn't make policy on how many blacks or Hispanics get admitted," he said. "That's what got us into this trouble in the first place."
Andrew Wong, a supporter of the Connerly measures and the president of Berkeley's graduating class last month, said, "If they decide on a geographical criterion looking for inner-city kids, or if they decide to spend more time with each application and look for obstacles overcome and potential growth, that will help the minorities."
But experts who have looked at the issue say the abandonment of affirmative action is certain to reduce the number of black and Hispanic students and increase the number of Asians at the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses. In 1994, Asians admitted to Berkeley had a mean grade-point average of 3.95 (out of 4.0) in high school; whites had a 3.86; Hispanic students had a 3.65 and blacks had a 3.43.
Charles Ratliff, deputy director of the California Postsecondary Education Commission, an independent state agency that provides information about higher education, said his organization's study of 20,000 California high school graduates in 1990 found that the removal of race and ethnicity as criteria would mean that many fully eligible black and Hispanic students would be denied admission to campuses of their first choice.
The university guarantees a place for any student who meets the minimum standards of the least-competitive college among the system's eight undergraduate schools.
"Since Berkeley and U.C.L.A. are the most popular schools," Mr. Ratliff said, "their student populations are increasingly going to contain more Asian and white students and fewer blacks and Latinos, if prior academic achievement is the primary basis for selecting each freshman class."
Margaret Heisel, the director of outreach, admissions and student affairs in the university president's office, said the university itself reached the same conclusion in a study released in May.
"The study showed," Ms. Heisel said, "that if you take out race in the admissions criteria and rely exclusively on socioeconomic factors, a great amount of ethnic diversity disappears. African-American are reduced by 40 to 50 percent, Chicano-Latino by 5 to 15 percent, Asians make a gain and whites remain constant."
The statistical validity of the university's study has been challenged by State Senator Tom Campbell, a Republican ally of Mr. Wilson.
For himself, Mr. Wilson said that he rejected the position that the number of black and Hispanic students at Berkeley and U.C.L.A. would greatly diminish."The belief that some parts of the population can't make it is demonstrably false," he said on Thursday.
The Regents, whose meeting continued today, also faced a barrage of criticism organizations and individuals including the National Organization for Women and Walter Massey, the retiring University of California provost and a former director of the National Science Foundation.
Charles Schwartz, a Berkeley professor-emeritus of physics who addressed the Regents today, likened their action to the adoption of a loyalty oath by the Regents in the 1950's.
"That action showed that the Regents were a conduit for political intrusion into the university," Mr. Schwartz said. "Some faculty left, others were fired and the academic reputation of the university suffered immensely. Now people are wondering when it's going to happen again."
The alumni representative to the Regents, Ralph C. Carmona, who opposed the measures, said it would be difficult to recruit outstanding scholars because the impression that the Regents surrendered to political pressure from the Governor may have "irreparably harmed" the university.
Mr. Wilson responded indirectly by replying: "I think many academics believe that this is the greatest educational institution in the country."
 
RESOLUTION
 
Changing Affirmative Action
Following are excerpts from the University of California Board of Regents' resolution on dismantling affirmative-action plans within the university system, as adopted on Thursday.
 
 ON ADMISSIONS Effective Jan. 1, 1997, the University of California shall not use race, religion, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin as a criterion for admission to the university or to any program of study.
Effective Jan. 1, 1997, race, religion, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin shall not be the criterion for admissions in exception to U.C.-eligibility requirements.
The president shall confer with the Academic Senate of the University of California to develop supplemental criteria for consideration by the Board of Regents. . . . In developing such criteria, which shall provide reasonable assurances that the applicant will successfully complete his or her course of study, consideration shall be given to individuals who, despite having suffered disadvantage economically or in terms of their social environment (such as an abusive or otherwise dysfunctional home, or a neighborhood of unwholesome or anti-social influences), have nonetheless demonstrated sufficient character and determination in overcoming obstacles to warrant confidence that the applicant can pursue a course of study to successful completion, provided that any student admitted under this section must be academically eligible for admission.
Because individual members of all of California's diverse races have the intelligence and capacity to succeed at the University of California, this policy will achieve a U.C. population that reflects this state's diversity through the preparation and empowerment of all students in this state to succeed rather than through a system of artificial preferences.
 
ON BUSINESS PRACTICES AND EMPLOYMENT Effective Jan. 1, 1996, the University of California shall not use race, religion, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin as a criterion in its employment and contracting practices.
The president of the University of California is directed to oversee a systemwide evaluation of the University's hiring and contracting practices to identify what actions need to be taken to ensure that all persons have equal access to job competitions, contracts and other business and employment opportunities of the university. A report and recommendations to accomplish this objective shall be presented to the Board of Regents before Dec. 31, 1996.

U.S. Drops Demand For More Microsoft Papers
The Justice Department abandoned its demand for more documents from Microsoft, but said it was continuing its study of Windows 95 and Microsoft Network and implied that it would decide whether to file a suit within the next several weeks.
 In a two-paragraph letter, the Government said it had become apparent that it would have to rely on information already available if it wanted to make a decision before Aug. 24, which is the official introduction date for Windows 95. [Page 35.]
 
Blinder Comments Lift Yields, Dow Closes Unchanged
The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to 6.96 percent, from 6.86 percent, as prices tumbled in a late afternoon selloff. Traders took comments by the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan S. Blinder, to mean there would not be another interest rate cut this summer. [45.]
 
The Dow industrials ended a roller-coaster week unchanged, at 4,641.55, as the expiration of stock and index options came to the market's rescue in late trading. For the week, the Dow lost 67.27 points. The Nasdaq index, which had also been whipsawed during the week, rose 1.20 points yesterday to 961.77. Technology stocks were mixed. [37.]
 
The dollar rose against the yen as traders continued to be wary of dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan in an effort to weaken the yen. The dollar rose to 88.52 yen and also climbed to 1.3856 marks. [36.]
 
Senate Passes Budget Cuts
A revised $16.4 billion package of current-year budget cuts won final approval in the Senate. President Clinton said he would sign the bill, which restores some cuts made to education, job training and environmental programs. The $16.4 billion is the largest midyear budget cut in history. Most of the reductions come from such programs as aid to low-income people, youth and education. [8.]
 
Poor Reviews for Bank Deal
The proposed merger between Corestates Financial and the Bank of Boston was greeted coolly by investors and analysts, as the shares of both companies fell. Some investors moved to block the deal, which the boards of both banking companies were expected to approve at meetings tomorrow. [37.]
 
Smokeless Tobacco Suit Filed
A lawsuit accusing five makers of smokeless tobacco of trying to addict young people and damaging their health is expected to be filed in Federal court in Wichita, Kan. The suit has the potential of involving about 30,000 state residents and could cost the companies more than $1 billion if it is successful. [35.]
 
Coram and Lincare Call Off Deal
Coram Healthcare and Lincare Holdings ended their agreement under which Coram was to have acquired Lincare. The deal was valued at $1.4 billion when it was announced in April. But Coram's stock price has fallen about $10 since then, forcing down the value of the takeover to $537 million. [47.]
 
Esmor Center Criticized
An investigation by the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service has found that an immigration prison in New Jersey, run by Esmor Correctional Services, was run like a secretive fief where guards preyed on immigrants. The immigration service said it would not renew its contract for Esmor to run the center. [1.]
 
D'Amato Seeks to Block Bailouts
Days after the House of Representatives passed an amendment aimed at cutting off the bailout funds for Mexico, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said he would introduce similar legislation in the Senate intended to prohibit the President from acting on his own in the future to rescue a country on the brink of bankruptcy. [34.]
 
Los Angeles Times in Cutbacks
The Los Angeles Times announced the end of several innovative sections of the newspaper and the elimination of 150 news-gathering positions. The paper's editor, Shelby Coffey 3d, noted, however, that the paper would have the country's largest news staff, more than 1,100, even after the cuts. [6.]

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Times Cuts Sections and Staff

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 21

 BODY:
In what the newspaper's editor, Shelby Coffey 3d, called one of his toughest days in journalism, The Los Angeles Times announced today the folding of several adventurous sections of the paper and the elimination of 150 news-gathering positions.
"But it should be noted," Mr. Coffey said in a memorandum to the staff, "that even with these difficult reductions, we retain the largest editorial staff in America, over 1,100, with a budget of over $110 million a year for news gathering." 
 The cuts were made, as Mr. Coffey told staff members at a morning meeting, to try to avoid "crashing through the red line" into financial deficit because of the fast-rising costs of newsprint and the painfully slow recovery of the Southern California economy.
"Publishing is a business and journalism isn't," he said in an interview afterward, "but we are inextricably tied together, and if we are not succeeding on the publishing side, we can't be a journalistic success."
The staff reductions today were part of a plan to eliminate 1,750 jobs throughout the various publications of the Times Mirror Company, including 750 jobs that were lost with the closing of New York Newsday on Sunday.
Reporters and editors heard the news at simultaneous departmental meetings at 9:30 A.M. and then returned to their seats to wait to hear whether they were losing their jobs.
"There're literally people sitting at their desks, staring into space, waiting to be tapped on the shoulder," said a reporter, speaking on the condition that his name not be printed. "It is so grim because we are all in the same room, and you are in front of your friends and someone is going to come by and say, 'Hey, let's have a chat,' and everyone's going to know what happened."
Mid-level editors were briefed on Thursday on how to break the news to their reporters, one editor said. Pairs of editors were to summon those employees who were losing their jobs and offer to refer them to job-placement counselors. Employees were offered $3,000 to help in their job search, and severance packages ranged up to one-year's pay for employees with 10 years' seniority.
"I'm sure some of the people on the list did not see this thing coming," the editor said. "I was shocked when I saw the list."
Two plainclothes security guards were posted outside Mr. Coffey's office as a precaution, newsroom employees said. Around the building, some people wept, some hugged each other, some buried themselves in work.
The elimination of 150 "full-time positions" in the news department was accomplished by the layoffs of 73 full-time staff members as well as 80 part-time and 23 temporary employees. The newspaper eliminated 230 jobs earlier this year and plans to let go another 300 non-newsroom employees by the end of the year.
"Virtually all sections, from foreign bureaus to polls to copy messengers, will be impacted," Mr. Coffey said in his memorandum about today's cuts.
He said the newspaper would concentrate on its core mission to provide strong news, analysis, investigative and literary journalism in its main paper. Reporters said no full-time employees were cut from the metropolitan staff.
In large part, the cutbacks were accomplished through the elimination of eight special sections that had been part of the paper's expansion in urban and suburban areas and in Washington.
Nuestro Tiempo, the paper's Spanish-language weekly with a circulation of 400,000, will close, along with City Times, the weekly inner-city section that was inaugurated in response to the racial and social issues raised by the 1992 riots.
At one newsroom gathering this morning, some reporters questioned Mr. Coffey about the implications of reducing service to minorities in this fast-changing city. He responded that other sections of the newspaper would have to work harder to cover these issues.
In his own message to the staff, the publisher, Richard T. Schlosberg 3d, said, "Plans are under way to provide much of the news and advertising from these sections in other formats."
In addition, the newspaper will eliminate a section that has served the affluent Westside as well as three inserts serving the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County.
The highly regarded weekly foreign news section, World Report, was also eliminated because, an editor said, it attracted little advertising. The Sunday Magazine survived, though there had been continuing reports that it would close.
The newspaper also discontinued its Monday-through-Friday Washington edition, which was inaugurated in 1992 and was a symbol of the paper's ambitions to be a national voice with impact in Washington and New York. Mr. Coffey said that the newspaper would be available on the East Coast by air mail and that a small number of copies would be delivered to offices by air freight.
As employees waited to learn their fate, and some reminisced about the days when people traveled first-class and expense accounts were never challenged, one writer buried her head behind her files and tried to work on a story.
"By 12, I figured everybody was done and I hadn't been fired," the writer said. "I came out from behind my desk and said, 'It's over?' like, 'I'm clear?' and an editor shook hands with me and said, 'We survived.' "

HEADLINE: Ernest Mandel, 72, Is Dead; Marxist Economist and Writer

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

 BODY:
Ernest Mandel, a Marxist economist at the center of a debate on free speech and academic freedom during the Nixon Administration, died on Thursday at his home in Brussels. He was 72.
Dr. Mandel died of a heart attack, said his wife, Anne. 
 Dr. Mandel won an international reputation in the 1960's and 70's for his writings, most notably a 1972 book, "Late Capitalism," in which he argued that class struggle was affected by long economic waves of 20 to 40 years, rather than by shorter economic cycles.
But he gained a measure of prominence in the United States not so much for his unconventional economic views but because Attorney General John N. Mitchell denied him a visa in 1969, against the advice of Secretary of State William P. Rogers.
The Attorney General acted under a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, popularly known as the McCarran Act, that barred visas to those who "advocate the economic, international and governmental doctrines of world Communism" and "who write or publish any written or printed matter advocating or teaching the economic international and governmental doctrines of world Communism."
Dr. Mandel at the time was editor of the weekly leftist journal La Gauche. He had been granted visas in 1962 and 1968, and had violated the conditions of his second visit, apparently unwittingly, by addressing a group that was asked for contributions for the legal defense of French demonstrators.
When Mitchell denied him a visa in 1969, Dr. Mandel was defended by several American scholars, who noted that he had spoken out against the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, and that he was not a member of the Communist Party. The visa issue was widely debated in American newspapers, to the apparent surprise of Dr. Mandel.
"It shows that public opinion in the United States is very much alive to the dangers that threaten our basic freedom," he said.
In March 1971, a Federal Court in New York voted to void Mitchell's decision, declaring that the United States could not bar a visitor who preached "anarchistic" doctrines. But on June 29, 1972, the Supreme Court ruled, 6 to 3, that Mitchell had acted within his discretion in denying the visa.
Ernest Mandel was born in Frankfurt. His family moved to Antwerp, Belgium, when he was a child. During World War II, he was a member of the Belgian Resistance. He was arrested three times and eventually sent to a work camp.
Since 1940 Dr. Mandel had been a member of the Socialist Fourth International, which was founded by Trotsky in the 1930's to promote world revolution. After World War II, Dr. Mandel led the Fourth International's Belgian section.
His revolutionary ideas brought Dr. Mandel into frequent conflict with the authorities, and he was banned at various times from entering France, Germany, Switzerland and Australia.
Dr. Mandel's last major work, "Power and Money," was published in 1983.
He is survived by his wife.

HEADLINE: Roller-Coaster Takes a Rest; Dow Doesn't Change at All

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Ending a roller-coaster week, blue-chip stocks ended unchanged yesterday as the expiration of stock and index options came to the market's rescue in late trading.
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended at 4,641.55, unchanged from Thursday's close. 
 The average, which had surged on Monday, lost 50 points on Tuesday and followed with a loss of 57 points on Wednesday, although that was up from its low point for the day, when it was down 134 points.
 For the week, the Dow lost 67.27 points. The big losses Tuesday and Wednesday created fear that the market was beginning a long-awaited correction, but it eked out a small gain, 12.68 points, on Thursday.
 "After two days like Tuesday and Wednesday, the market needed to do a bit of calming down and digesting," said Thom Brown, managing director at Rutherford, Brown & Catherwood.
 The two-day drop appeared to burst a speculative bubble that has lifted the technology stocks for so long, and investors were taking defensive positions with consumer growth and basic industry stocks, analysts said.
 "When you get a shake-up in the market based on the speculative area being hit, the money that comes out of that goes into the basic industries," Mr. Brown said.
 The Nasdaq index, which had also been whipsawed during the week, rose 1.20 points yesterday to 961.77.
 In the broader market, advancing issues edged out declines, 1,191 to 1,040, on heavy trading of 431.8 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
 The exchange said the weekly trading volume of 2.002 billion shares was the second-busiest ever, surpassed only by the 2.299 billion shares traded in the week that ended on Oct. 23, 1987, which included the Oct. 19 stock market crash.
 Analysts said yesterday that a late burst of buying at the expiration of stock and index options reversed a late decline that had been prompted by a jump in long-term interest rates.
 "When bonds hit the skids it spilled over into stocks," said Gregory Nie at Kemper Securities. "But there was obviously a buy-side bias to the options expiry."
 The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 112/32 , to 1088/32 . Its yield climbed to 6.96 percent from 6.86 percent at Thursday's close.
 Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers Global Economic Advisers, said the stock market looked fragile as it closed out a turbulent week.
 "But the bond yield is at the high end of the trading range, and the equity market is moving toward the lower end of its fair value range," he said. "It may present a buying opportunity."
 Among the basic-industry group, the Aluminum Company of America rose 1/8, to 55, and Du Pont was up 5/8, to 70 1/8. Gillette rose 1/2, to 42 7/8, and McDonald's rose 3/4, to 38 5/8.
 Westinghouse topped the Big Board actives list, falling 1/8, to 13. The company and CBS met in New York yesterday to discuss a possible deal whereby Westinghouse would buy CBS for less than $83 a share, a source close to the negotiations said. CBS gained 3/8, to 75 1/4.
 Technology stocks were mixed. Apple Computer fell 35/16 , to 43 3/4, after announcing disappointing third-quarter earnings Thursday, and Microsoft fell 4 1/8, to 92. I.B.M. slipped 1/2, to 103 5/8, but Compaq, which announced unexpectedly strong earnings on Thursday, rose 3/8, to 48 7/8.
 Motorola gained 2 3/4, to 76. Motorola "got knocked down on Tuesday and Wednesday and was not overvalued like all the other techs," Mr. Brown said.
 The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 0.08, to 553.62. The American Stock Exchange index rose 3.69 to 514.55.
 The New York Stock Exchange Composite index of all listed common stocks rose 0.31, to 296.67. The average share was up 4 cents.
 In Japan, stocks ended higher yesterday. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 135.67 points, or eight-tenths of 1 percent, at 16,589.09, after trading within a range of 16,481.80 to 16,613.06.

HEADLINE: Hopes for Rate Cut Fade, and Bonds Drop

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices tumbled yesterday in a late afternoon selloff prompted by comments by a top Federal Reserve official that quashed any hopes of another cut in interest rates this summer.
 The vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan S. Blinder, who is considered one of the Fed officials most likely to favor cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy, said in an interview yesterday that "the probability of a recession is lower in mid-July than it was in the middle of June." 
 Mr. Blinder's remarks aggravated concern among bond investors that the economy's growth was not feeble enough for the Fed to push short-term interest rates lower any time soon. After the Fed cut its target rate for overnight loans by a quarter of a percentage point on July 6, many traders had expected the Fed to push rates lower when its policy-making committee meets next in August.
 "If you take out the prospect for any near-term Fed easing, there's less of a carrot to look forward to," said Steven Saslow, executive managing director at HSBC Securities in New York.
 Denny Niedringhaus, who manages $150 million of bonds at Southwest Bank in St. Louis, said, "If the economy is going to achieve a soft landing, then maybe we've seen the low in yields and this whole move is over."
 "A lot of people will be throwing in the towel on this market," he said, and that could push bond yields as high as 7.25 percent by Labor Day.
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 112/32 , to 1088/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.96 percent from 6.86 percent.
 The price decline, however, came on low trading volume that exaggerated the move.
 Many traders had already ruled out another rate cut, particularly after the chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, told a House Banking subcommittee on Wednesday that the risks of both inflation and a recession had faded. Bond prices fell after his testimony.
 Still, Mr. Greenspan noted, "We have certainly not yet reached the point at which no risk of undue economic weakness remains."
 And Mr. Blinder said yesterday that an apparent recovery in economic growth did not mean that the risk of recession had vanished, adding that he was "open minded" about further interest rate reductions.
 In the corporate market, National City Bank sold $225 million of bonds yesterday. It was the only large sale of investment-grade corporate debt yesterday, as some companies reassessed their borrowing plans after this week's rise in interest rates.
 National City, a unit of the National City Corporation, a Cleveland-based commercial bank, sold $225 million of bonds in a five-part sale.
 The notes, due on July 15, 2010, have a 7.25 percent coupon and were priced at 99.67 to yield 7.287 percent, or 76.7 basis points more than the 10-year Treasury notes. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 The notes are rated A1 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 Repsol International Finance B.V., a unit of the Spanish oil company Repsol S.A., plans to sell $300 million of 10-year notes in the days ahead, according to MCM Corporate Watch, which tracks sales of fixed-income and other securities.

HEADLINE: New Rules Cut Estate Taxes For the Inheritors of Houses

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 21

 BODY:
A little-noticed provision in the Pataki administration's new budget gives residents of the state a substantial break on estate taxes, allowing heirs not to pay tax on the first $250,000 of the value of an inherited home.
For taxpayers who own houses as their primary assets, the change -- tucked away among approximately $600 million in income and business tax cuts passed in the budget last month -- could more than triple the worth of assets that heirs could inherit without paying state taxes. The heir of a person with a primary residence valued at $250,000 and an estate worth another $250,000 will now pay $7,500 in inheritance taxes, $12,000 less than under the old rules, the State Tax Department said. The change affects heirs other than surviving spouses, who pay no inheritance taxes. 
 Several lawyers who specialize in estates said the new law would benefit heirs of large and small estates, although the greatest proportional gain would go to the estates of middle-income earners.
One motivation for making the change was to discourage wealthy New Yorkers from moving to states with lower estate taxes, Pataki officials and other Republicans said. But several lawyers said the change did not go far enough in making New York, which has among the highest estate taxes in the nation, competitive with other states.
Thirty-one states, including New Jersey and Florida, have estate-tax rates that equal a credit the Federal Government allows for state inheritance taxes. New York, however, charges more than that credit in many cases, and critics said the new tax break was not enough relief.
One such critic is Albert Kalter, a Manhattan lawyer and chairman of the estate and gift-tax committee of the Bar of the City of New York. "These are sort of Band-Aid approaches by the Legislature to raise the exemption to a level that is really not appropriate," Mr. Kalter said. "New York State has not confronted the issue."
The change was hammered out during last-minute, closed-door negotiations between legislators and the Governor, which is one reason it has received little notice before now. It applies only to primary residences. Several lawyers who handle estates said today that the measure was so obscure they had not heard of it. Others said the law was too new to have been invoked much so far, although it went into effect on June 8, after the budget was passed.
This was the second year that the Legislature tinkered with estate taxes. Last year, lawmakers raised what is known as the unified credit, to $115,000 from $108,800, which effectively means that estates worth less than that amount are not taxed. They also eased inheritance taxes on family businesses.
The new provision was not part of Gov. George E. Pataki's original budget presentation in February; it was added in April by the Senate Majority Leader, Joseph L. Bruno, as part of the Republican Senate's package of smaller tax cuts. Unlike most of those proposals, which were aimed at specific industries, the estate-tax cut had no visible constituency and was largely unnoticed or ignored by journalists, trade groups and lobbyists.
"I have not seen it, to my embarrassment," one lawyer in Rochester said today, echoing the chagrin of several estate lawyers. "This is a little alarming to me."
Mr. Bruno said today that his original proposal was to make New York conform to Federal law, which does not tax the first $600,000 of an estate. Mr. Bruno said the Governor supported that idea.
"The thing is that people in New York move to Florida because the estate taxes are substantially different, and that is not productive to the economy of this state," Mr. Bruno, a Republican of Rensselaer County, said today.
But Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said he had argued during budget talks that the state could not afford the Republican proposal, which he said would have cost the state more than $100 million. The law that passed will cost $60 million, the State Budget Division estimates. Mr. Silver also said he wanted to direct the tax reduction toward more middle-income earners, a goal shared by Mr. Bruno and Pataki officials, even as they wanted to go further.
The new $250,000 limit easily covers most homes in most areas in the state, with notable exceptions in some neighborhoods of Manhattan and in Westchester County, where the median house price in May was $373,000. The median prices in other parts of the state were $170,100 in Queens, Nassau and Suffolk Counties; $108,000 in the Albany area; $88,849 in Syracuse, and $92,755 in Buffalo.
Joshua S. Rubenstein, an estate lawyer with Rosenman and Colin in Manhattan, said the provision would most help the heirs of people who owned their homes and had modest savings, less than about $115,000. For people with estates up to $1 million, he said, the provision would make New York State's estate taxes roughly equal to those in states like Florida.
Someone with a $10 million estate, he said, would pay about $50,000 less in estate taxes than before, but that person would still pay about $325,000 more than would be required by a state like Florida.
"It may actually be a good incentive for middle-class people to hang around" in New York, Mr. Rubenstein said. "It probably isn't going to do anything to induce the extraordinarily wealthy to stop making their money in New York and then retiring to Florida, Texas or Arizona."

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW YORK;
A Family's Ancestor Was a City's Architect

BYLINE: By Michael T. Kaufman 

 BODY:
AS the small bus pulled up to a tollbooth of the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge, Edward Embury, who had come here from Denver, shouted to the driver, "Hey, just tell the guy my grandfather designed this bridge; maybe he'll give us a discount."
Mr. Embury was telling the truth. His grandfather Aymar Embury 2d had indeed designed the bridge. Moreover, all but one of the 13 other passengers aboard were also related to the architect, who died in 1966 at the age of 86. 
 None of this, however, should sway a toll taker. Quite rightly she unsentimentally demanded and received $6, probably thinking the remark from the bus was just another of the wise-guy comments she is paid to endure. What did she know about Aymar Embury 2d? What, indeed, do any of us know about him?
It turns out that he not only supervised the design of the Whitestone, he also oversaw plans for the Triborough, the Henry Hudson and the Marine Parkway Bridges. He planned the Central Park Zoo, Orchard Beach, huge swimming pools and parks. During years of Federal Works Projects Administration construction, while he served as chief architect for Robert Moses, he did as much as anyone to bind the city together and to help it dig its way out of the Depression.
With a silhouette that changes like flowing lava, this is a tough town for architects to get and keep respect. Are there many among us who can name more than five architects who have helped shape the best-known skyline on the planet? But the people on the bus were aware and admiring, unabashedly proud of what their ancestor had wrought. They had first thought of the tour last May, arranging to come from many parts of the country to meet at the Central Park Zoo.
"WOW, this is neat," Philip Embury Jr., 4, a great-grandson of the architect, said as the group walked past the seal basin. Without fidgeting too much, he listened as Adrian Benepe, an official of the Municipal Art Society who guided the visitors, explained that the zoo was designed in just 16 weeks and built in just eight months.
"Can you imagine that now?" asked Mr. Benepe, who is himself remotely related to Mr. Embury. "At the height of W.P.A., there were 2,000 architects and engineers working night and day on projects in armories. They slept on cots."
The group moved on to Bradhurst Avenue and 146th Street in Harlem to the Jackie Robinson swimming pool. It was called the Colonial Park pool when Aymar Embury designed it.
"This is like a castle," said Edward Embury, Philip's 9-year-old brother. "It's got towers." It also has a crenelated facade and a vaulted entrance like the Alhambra. Anyone could see that the neighborhood youngsters splashing in its waters liked it fine. "I'd heard about what my grandfather accomplished all my life, but it's great to see people still enjoying his works," said Dorothy Embury Staats, a high school math teacher from Princeton who was 13 when the architect died.
Back on the Parks Department bus, the group crossed the Triborough, the city's chunky aorta that Embury designed, stopping at the Robert Moses Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority Building, which he also designed. In the lobby hangs a plaque with a profile of the architect. The family members took photographs of one another as they stood sideways next to the plaque, debating which of them had the Embury nose.
They advanced to Flushing Meadows Park and the building Mr. Embury designed as a permanent structure for the 1939 World's Fair. It was the original home of the United Nations and now houses the Queens museum and an ice skating rink. It also has a scale-model panorama of all of New York City, which won rave reviews from one of the youngest tour members. "The best thing is the little airplanes coming in and taking off," said Alexander Benepe, who is going into the third grade. "They light up in the dark."
The group stopped briefly to watch and lament the demolition of Mr. Embury's Aquacade theater. As they headed toward the Bronx, Edward Embury pointed to the Whitestone Bridge and said that his grandfather's designs always emphasized how things worked. He said that what appeared to be ornamental elements are lines revealing the tensions within the structure. He also remembered how his grandfather scorned some of his modernist contemporaries.
"You know how he referred to Frank Lloyd Wright? He called him 'No Closets.' "
THE last stop was Orchard Beach, where the beach house needs paint but still looks like the Trocadero in Paris, its curvilinear facade enclosing majestic steps to form a proud pavilion for an economically battered people in need of hope. None of the visitors had been there before, though a few were raised in Greenwich, Conn., which is, geographically, close by. They walked up and down the beach, happily looking at the thousands who, without ever having heard of Aymar Embury, were still obviously enjoying what he had conceived more than 50 years earlier.

HEADLINE: 5 Fish Dealers Face Eviction From Market

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
Using its new powers to regulate the Fulton Fish Market, the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Guiliani moved yesterday to evict five wholesale fish dealers, including two companies that are owned by relatives of purported Mafia figures.
Randy M. Mastro, the Mayor's chief of staff, described the evictions as "a significant step in the administration's drive to improve the market's business operations" and said the dealers had to clear out by the end of the month. 
 He added that the city was still reviewing the backgrounds of many of the approximately 40 merchants in the lower Manhattan market and that the city might revoke the leases of some of them.
Joseph L. Forstadt, a lawyer for three companies facing eviction, denounced the action by New York City officials as "bizarre" and said the dealers might sue to be reinstated on the ground that their constitutional rights were violated. Mr. Forstadt asserted that the city had refused to renew a lease for one of his clients, Alphonse Malangone Jr., the owner of the Cape Cod Seafood Company, solely because his father was suspected of being a capo in the Genovese crime family.
"It is absolutely outrageous that Mr. Malangone Jr. is made guilty by his relationship with his father," Mr. Forstadt said.
The other company that faces eviction because of suspected Mafia connections is Preferred Quality Seafood. Thomas Gangi, an officer in Preferred Quality is the son of Rosario Ross Gangi, who Federal and city law-enforcement officials have identified as the Genovese family's boss in the market.
The company's office at 109 South Street was closed yesterday, and Thomas Gangi, who has an unlisted home telephone number, could not be reached.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Mastro said the five wholesalers had been ordered to leave because they had declined to submit sufficient background information. But he would not say whether the suspected organized crime links had anything to do with the city's decision.
The evictions are the first concrete outgrowth of a campaign by the city to rid the Fulton market of organized-crime influence and to improve business conditions. For more than 40 years, law-enforcement and city officials have acknowledged that the market was dominated by the Genovese family, but all previous efforts, including a drive by Mr. Giuliani when he was the United States Attorney in Manhattan, have failed to rid it of mobsters and corruption.
The market is an important cog in the city's economy, generating about $1 billion a year in sales, salaries and related businesses. More than 800 people work full time loading, unloading and selling about 125 million pounds of fish and seafood every year. The country's largest wholesale seafood, it is mainly on city property on South Street extending from Fulton Street to Peck Slip.
Mr. Mastro also said that the city signed leases yesterday with the last of three trade associations representing most of the dealers. The leases with the associations call for gradual increases that will give the city total rents of $2 million in June 1998 compared with about $260,000 in annual rents that the merchants had paid since 1982.
Some dealers had threatened to leave the city over the rent increases and the new regulations, but in the end the trade associations agreed to the new leases. The full licensing and registration regulations calling for extensive investigations of the companies that unload and load supplies will take effect in September.
Mr. Forstadt represented the South Street Sidewalk Association, a group of 21 wholesale dealers who are the main tenants on the west side of South Street between Fulton Street and Beekman Street. Earlier, the city had obtained group leases with associations in the two main buildings on the East Side of South Street that are known as the Tin Building and the New Building.
The rents for the Sidewalk Association dealers will rise from about $80,000 this year to $650,000 a year on June 1, 1998, Mr. Mastro said.
Mr. Forstadt complained that the rent increases were excessive but said the Sidewalk Association had little choice but to accept the terms. Its option of moving out of the city were dashed, he said, when the other merchants' groups agreed to the city's terms.
"This will cause significant increases in the cost of fish to consumers," he asserted. "You can't ask these businesses to pay 10 times more in rent and not add that to what they have to charge."
But Mr. Mastro said the increases were "fair and long overdue." He said that the city's efforts to end mob extortions and cartels at the market would result in more competition and lower operating costs.
The other dealers whose leases were not renewed are S & M Fish Company, 102 South Street; ABC Fillets, 102A South Street, and J-Seafood, 103 South Street.
Mr. Forstadt said that Salvatore Macaluso, the owner of S & M, was planning to sue the city over age discrimination. The lawyer said that Mr. Macaluso, 66, had reduced his business activities because of his age and that the city had refused to renew his lease because his sales was too low.
The owners of J-Seafood, the lawyer said, were living outside the city and did not want to renew the lease.
ABC Fillets, which is not a member of the Sidewalk Association, was closed yesterday and telephone calls to its office were unanswered.

HEADLINE: Nation's Oldest Fun Park To Get a Brand New Look

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: BRISTOL, Conn.

 BODY:
For three summers, Lake Compounce has opened for just a few days in efforts to save its title as the nation's oldest continually operating amusement park.
Now, thanks in part to $18 million in state bond financing, the 300-acre amusement park not only has reopened for the entire summer, but also may remake itself into a year-round theme park. But as it begins investing $35 million in new rides and attractions, the park faces the challenge of winning back patrons put off by the failures of two management companies over the last decade, a time when other amusement parks prospered. 
 The park's largest hurdle may be the damage to its reputation from its past problems, said Susan E. Mosedale, director of association relations for the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions. "It does depend on the public," she said. "A development company can do everything right and still not succeed."
The park's private owners, including two local businessmen, and state economic development officials say that the $35 million investment is what Lake Compounce has needed all along. On one side of the two-mile lake for which the park is named, the owners are planning to build a water park with more than a dozen splashing rides; across the lake, a new $8 million roller coaster with a dizzying view will be built atop a small mountain.
These additions will complement the older, main park, which has a carousel listed on the National Register of Historic Places, a 100-year-old ballroom overlooking the lake and one of the first electric roller coasters in the country.
A new management company, Funtime Inc., is marketing Lake Compounce as family fun, with everything from kiddie rides to attract parents of young children, to rock-climbing to pull in teen-agers, to ballroom dancing for the older crowd. Eventually, Lake Compounce hopes to have more than a million visitors each year.
State officials approved the financing because they believe the park could boost the local economy and eventually repay the state investment. They also wanted to preserve a historic amusement park.
But Frederick A. Gelsi, a state representative from Enfield, said he sees the Lake Compounce project as a risky venture that would not have received state financing 10 years ago, when public officials were less desperate for ways to boost the state's economy.
"This thing hasn't been making money in all these years," said Mr. Gelsi, who voted against the $18 million the state agreed to bond for the project. "I just couldn't see how pouring more money into it was going to make it work."
Lake Compounce is still a long way from its attendance goals. A weekday visit in late June found at most several hundred visitors; Funtime managers said that more than 16,000 people visited the park during the four-day Fourth of July weekend, a figure they seemed satisfied with.
"We're not looking at this summer as a make-or-break summer," said Thomas R. Clay, marketing manager for Funtime. "This is a first step. It's going to take six or seven years before people in the region recognize us as a major park."
Both state and park officials say that Lake Compounce's earlier problems were caused more by its management companies than by a lack of public interest in the park.
After investing some $28 million in the park, the first manager, Hershey Entertainment, backed out in 1987 because of a change in corporate policy.
A second manager, Joseph Entertainment, a concert promotion company, then lost the sympathy of Bristol residents by presenting noisy rock concerts that clogged local roads. The company went bankrupt in early 1992 because of its other holdings, Mr. Clay said.
Anthony P. Brescia, senior regional manager for the State Department of Economic Development, said Funtime's plans seem "cohesive and sensible and reachable." The state bonding is contingent upon the park owners investing $7 million of their own money and securing a $10.3 million bank loan for the project.
Premier Parks of Oklahoma City has announced plans to buy the stock of Funtime, which had sales of $51 million in 1994. Funtime, based in Cleveland, owns three parks, including one associated with the Columbus, Ohio, zoo.
Many residents of the area remember going to Lake Compounce as children and are rooting for the park to succeed this time. Kathryn Petruzzello of Southington, who was at the park with her family recently, said she had such fond memories of the park that when it closed in the 1980's, she made her husband climb the fence to take pictures.
"We almost got arrested," her husband, Michael, said, teasing her.
Mrs. Petruzzello said, "There are a lot of people in the area who remember it and who are invested in having it stay open. It sort of has its own little fan club."

State bond financing may help the owners remake the 300-acre park into a year-round attraction with features for people of all ages. The $18 million in bonds was issued because state officials hope the investment will help the local economy grow and eventually be repaid. (Steve Miller for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
D'Amato Seeks to Limit Foreign Bailouts

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
Days after the House of Representatives passed an amendment aimed at cutting off the bailout funds for Mexico, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato said today that he would introduce similar legislation in the Senate that would prohibit the President from acting on his own in the future to rescue a country on the brink of bankruptcy.
 Mr. D'Amato, the New York Republican who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and an outspoken opponent of the Mexican bailout, has tried and failed in the past to cut off much of the $20 billion that the Clinton Administration drew from a special Treasury Department account for loans and guarantees that backed Mexican securities. 
 The proposal he is now floating, while not expected to interfere with the current disbursement, would effectively seal off the option of drawing funds from that account again. It appears likely to pass in some form.
 By the time the new Government budget goes into effect on Oct. 1, Mexico will have already drawn down most of the American bailout money that it needs. The House amendment, which passed earlier this week, was a less direct attack on the use of the bailout fund. Neither proposal would take effect until the new budget year.
 The announcement by Senator D'Amato came after he abandoned an attempt to block a key Administration official in the Mexican bailout, Lawrence H. Summers, from being promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. He is currently the Under Secretary for international finance.
 At a confirmation hearing today, Mr. D'Amato accused Mr. Summers of describing Mexico's financial health last year in glowing terms, even though internal Treasury memos show that he and other officials had become increasingly alarmed about the country's trade deficit and heavy borrowing. Mr. Summers served as the principal architect of the bailout.
 "Key Administration officials, including Secretary Summers, were not candid and forthcoming about the true condition of Mexico's economy in 1994," Mr. D'Amato said, repeating accusations he has made before. "He and other Administration officials repeatedly painted a rosy picture of the Mexican economy. That picture was distorted and not accurate and not true."
 The Senate Finance Committee, however, approved Mr. Summers overwhelmingly. Only Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader and the leading candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, and Senator Frank Murkowski, the Alaska Republican, joined Mr. D'Amato in voting against the nomination.
 In retrospect, Mr. Summers said, he would have issued statements that "left less room for ambiguity" in describing Mexico's economic condition last year. He said he should have separated Mexico's long-term financial prospects -- which he maintains are good -- from the country's short-term problems, which Treasury documents were describing in somewhat dire terms.
 Earlier this year Mr. Summers told a Congressional committee that any public comments casting doubt on Mexico's prospects last year could have touched off mass flight by investors -- exactly what happened in December, when the peso went into a free fall.
 "There has not been and will not be any attempt to deceive," Mr. Summers told the committee.
 The proposal by Mr. D'Amato, which he said he would submit next week as an amendment to an appropriations measure, would bar the President from drawing on the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund to help foreign nations, unless the amount is less than $1 billion or the time period is less than six months.
 Mr. D'Amato, saying he was "open to negotiation" on the amount and the time limits, said his overall objective was to "fix the fund so it can't be used as the President's piggy bank." The fund is ordinarily used to smooth out exchange-rate fluctuations, though it has been used dozens of times to make short-term loans to foreign countries. None of those loans, however, were anywhere near the size of the Mexican bailout.
 The Administration's use of the fund earlier this year to sidestep Congress was widely criticized on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers of both parties, however, expressed relief that the President's move allowed them to avoid a vote on the Mexican bailout issue. The D'Amato bill could prove popular because it allows members of Congress to have it both ways, voting against Mexican-style bailouts without actually threatening Mexico's financial stability.
But Administration officials hope that time will cool such passions. "I don't think there has been any presentation of the good things the fund has done," a senior Administration official said.

HEADLINE: Proposal Puts S.& L.'s Into Banks' Realm

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
Much of the remaining distinction between banking and savings institutions would be effectively ended under plans that the Clinton Administration is discussing with Congressional Republicans and financial executives, people involved in the negotiations said this evening.
 If carried out, the plan would lead to the consolidation of the separate deposit insurance funds, one now backing banks and the other supporting savings and loans. 
 In advance of a consolidation, the proposal would also require the nation's savings institutions to pay a one-time $6.1 billion assessment to restore the financial health of their industry's insurance fund. And banks would begin shouldering part of the $793 million a year in interest that savings and loans are paying in connection with the bailout of their industry in the 1980's.
 Bankers and savings executives have been forced to the bargaining table by severe troubles in the savings industry's deposit insurance fund, which has very low reserves to protect against any further failures.
 A fourth element also under discussion would create a single legal charter and regulatory framework for banks and savings institutions alike, they said. But there are problems with going that far because the rules that savings institutions operate under allow, within limits, certain activities like insurance sales and industrial ownership, that are prohibited to banks.
 Industry executives said the negotiations were proceeding briskly. "We may very well be on a very quick path to a solution of the S.& L. situation that involves the end of the S.& L. industry as a separate industry," said Edward Yingling, the chief lobbyist for the American Bankers Association, an industry trade group.
 Several Federal officials who insisted on anonymity also said that a deal appeared to be close. But other officials warned that nothing under discussion was set in stone. Jonathan Murchinson, a spokesman for the Treasury Department, said no final decisions had been made.
 "We haven't firmed up our stance on many issues" related to the troubles of the deposit insurance funds, he said.
 Carly A. Austrian, an official with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which is largely independent of the Administration, confirmed that a merger of the savings industry fund and the bank industry fund was under review. "The merger is certainly under discussion but there's nothing definitive on the details yet," she said.
With the ranks of the nation's savings institutions badly depleted by failures during the late 1980's, a regulatory merger of the two industries would be likely to force savings and loans to turn themselves into banks. Originally created to insure a source of money for home mortgages, savings institutions lost most of their advantage over banks when Congress scrapped regulations in the late 1970's that had required banks to pay depositors an interest rate a quarter of a percentage point below the rates offered by savings institutions.
 One of the few remaining distinctions is that savings institutions are required to put a slightly higher proportion of their assets into real estate loans. But while banks and savings institutions still tend to focus on quite different business clients, the formal differences -- particularly as they affect consumers -- are no longer so clear cut.
 One force pushing savings institutions to go along with the idea is that many would like to escape the taint associated with savings and loan institutions since the costly Government bailout of the 1980's. Indeed, many savings institutions have already changed their names and begun calling themselves banks. But legal obstacles have prevented them from changing their charters and switching to the banks' deposit insurance fund.
 Mr. Murchinson of the Treasury Department said that agreements had been reached for the savings institutions to be assessed a one-time fee to bolster their deposit insurance fund and for other financial institutions to share the burden of the annual interest payments now exclusively borne by savings institutions.
 Brian P. Smith, the policy director at America's Community Bankers, the savings industry's trade group, said a consensus had emerged in favor of a $6.1 billion assessment in which each savings institution would be charged 85 cents for every $100 of deposits.
The heavy fee would mean that 50 or so of the nation's 1,750 savings institutions would fall below current Federal standards for minimum capital, an institution's cushion against losses, Mr. Smith said. The capital of a handful of institutions would fall so low that they would be subject to automatic closing under current Federal regulations. Mr. Smith said the industry wanted Federal regulators to promise to show restraint in closing these institutions.
 As of March 31, the savings industry fund had only 28 cents for every $100 of insured deposits while the bank industry fund had $1.22. Federal law specifies that once an industry fund has $1.25 for every $100 of insured deposits, the deposit insurance agency should drastically reduce the premiums that it charges to banks or savings institutions covered by the fund.
 The agency is now preparing to reduce rates so sharply that banks will be able to offer depositors close to an extra quarter of a percentage point in interest and still earn the same profits. With the savings industry fund not expected to reach the Congressionally mandated level until the year 2002, savings industry executives have been worried that savings institutions will no longer be able to compete. They have warned of possible further failures that might eventually require another bailout by taxpayers.
 The issue is particularly difficult to resolve because the savings industry fund is also required to pay $793 million a year until 2019 on Government bonds issued in the late 1980's to reimburse depositors of some failed savings institutions. Banks have been reluctant to shoulder part of this burden by merging the two funds, but their resistance has weakened in the last week, said the people involved in the negotiations.

ZENITH ELECTRONICS CORP. (ZE,N)

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The Zenith Electronics Corporation said yesterday that its loss for the second quarter widened on sluggish sales of color televisions and lower prices, combined with higher material costs.
The earnings report was released as LG Electronics Inc., the South Korean manufacturer whose products are sold under the Goldstar name, said that it had formally begun its bid to acquire a 57.7 percent stake in Zenith for more than $350 million. The deal for Zenith, the last American-owned television manufacturer, was announced on Monday. 
 Zenith, based in Glenview, Ill., said its loss widened to $45.3 million, or 97 cents a share, from $8.4 million, or 20 cents, in the quarter a year earlier. The results include a pretax charge of $18 million to eliminate 200 jobs and realign distribution systems.
Zenith said sales of televisions to dealers were lower. The company also said it was hurt by inventory reductions and inflationary cost increases for certain materials.
The company said sales of set-top boxes and data modems for the cable television industry were up slightly. The devaluation of the Mexican peso helped earnings, but wages for Mexican employees rose and television sales there fell.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Advances Against Yen On Bank of Japan Intervention

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the yen yesterday as traders continued to be wary of dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan in an effort to weaken the yen.
 Analysts estimate that the Bank of Japan has bought as much as $1 billion a day in the last two weeks. In line with its usual policy, the central bank did not comment on its activities in the foreign exchange market. 
 "It's the Bank of Japan that's initiating this dollar-buying interest," said Jeffrey Yu, senior currency dealer at Sanwa Bank in New York. "They'll probably continue to sell yen until the dollar's at 90 yen or a little bit higher."
 Gains in the dollar were pared after the American stocks and bonds slumped late in the day, rekindling concern that foreign investors would bail out of American assets and sell dollars. Steep declines in stocks and bonds on Wednesday dragged the dollar sharply lower.
 "We'll have to watch stocks and bonds," said Earl Johnson, foreign exchange adviser at Bank of Montreal/Harris Bank in Chicago. "If they continue to slip that'll be a negative for the dollar."
 In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 88.52 yen from 88.13 yen on Thursday. The dollar climbed to 1.3856 German marks from 1.3817 marks. The British pound advanced to $1.5960 from $1.5958.
 The Bank of Japan has been seen buying dollars persistently since it acted in concert with the Federal Reserve to bolster the dollar on July 7, traders said.
 That bout of dollar buying caught many traders off guard because the central banks purchased dollars when the dollar was rising, a departure from recent practice.
 "It's been a very clever intervention strategy," said Amy Smith, senior currency market analyst at IDEA, a consulting firm. "They're buying dollars on the way up, buying them covertly. They're trying to create the illusion that there's some real demand for dollars out there."
 The yen's 12.4 percent rise against the dollar so far this year has made Japanese exports less competitive and helped smother a long-awaited economic rebound.
 "Japan has a whole bunch of problems, notably a recession problem and a banking problem," said Andrew Hodge, vice president at Bank Brussels Lambert in New York. "The yen is the one problem they can fix most easily."
 A Bank of Japan official confirmed that the central bank would like to see the dollar rise to 90 yen and beyond to relieve pressure on the nation's ailing economy.

HEADLINE: Where the Thrills of Old Keep Coming Round

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL; Peter Passell writes about economics for The New York Times.

 BODY:
THE VIEW OF THE WESTERN Pennsylvania hills and the rusting mills lining the Monongahela River could hardly be better. But the perch leaves something to be desired: I'm dangling from a steel cable, 200 feet above the pavement.
The idea of the Skycoaster, the hottest ride at Kennywood Park, just east of Pittsburgh, is to simulate bungee jumping. And I've just remembered that bungee jumping was pretty far down my to-do list, just behind swimming the Bosphorus. 
 But it's too late to back out now. On the count of three, I pull the rip cord and plummet toward the crowd below. Fractions of a second before a hard landing, the cable miraculously wins the battle with gravity, hurling me in an arc like the weight on a great pendulum. Brain-numbing fear instantly gives way to euphoria: I'm flying!
A few glorious swings later, giggling hysterically, I am plucked from my harness by one of the well-scrubbed college kids who operate the rides at what is probably the best traditional amusement park in America -- and, along with Playland, in Rye, N.Y., one of only two to be named a National Historic Landmark.
What to try next? The Steel Phantom: No other roller coaster in the world is faster (80 m.p.h.) or has a longer drop (225 feet) drop. Kennywood always has an eye out for a spot in the Guiness Book of Records.
In fact, I long for a respite from rapid acceleration, and I have a good excuse. This, after all, is supposed to be a stroll down memory lane, a visit, decades later, to the amusement park of my youth.
The Little Dipper, the world's tamest roller coaster (but never too tame for me) is gone. So is the 180-by-357-foot Sunlite swimming pool, which sprang an unpluggable leak in 1973. It seems the foundation was riddled with weak spots, evidence of the hubris of the builders who dared to pour concrete on a hillside honeycombed with abandoned coal-mine tunnels. But almost everything else is as I remembered.
The miniature railroad still chugs through kitschy tableaux of Pittsburgh's history, offering occasional glimpses of the picnic grove where I downed egg-salad sandwiches and Vernor's Ginger Ale with cousins. No sane child, of course, would willingly eat home cooking when junk was available. And, of course, Kennywood obliges. While the open-air cafeteria now offers salads and fat-free yogurt as a concession to mom, the park still specializes in cotton candy, corn dogs, funnel cakes and thick-cut fries made from fresh potatoes.
But back to the nostalgia trip. The Auto Ride, with its snazzy, two-tone 1930's-style racers that careen along a twisty wooden track, is still a joy for 8-year-olds of all ages. And The Old Mill, a slightly moldy tunnel of love, is no doubt still a great place for what was then called "petting." (I never dared.)
Noah's Ark, the fun house defiantly constructed just after Pittsburgh's great flood of 1936, remains open for business -- though the air jets that lifted the girls' skirts are gone. No, Kennywood is not trying to be politically correct; it's just that hardly anyone wears skirts these days.
The Penny Arcade has been polluted by video games that cost a quarter. But one cent still gets you a foot massage or an analysis by the Love Tester. (It rates your "sex appeal," on a scale running from "cold" to "uncontrollable." I managed only a "flirtatious.")
Best of all, the merry-go-round, where by first grade I graduated from the motionless benches to full-fledged wooden horsemanship, is still pumping out tunes on a wheezy Wurlitzer band organ. Tony Sacramento, who has operated the carousel for 59 summers (with time out to fight the Nazis), is mighty proud of the 50 jumping horses and 1,500 lights. "Don't miss the carving on this little beauty," he exclaims.
Kennywood's owners, members of the Henninger and McSwigan families who have run the park since 1906, obviously share Tony's enthusiasm for icons of a gentler age; they've kept in service a half-dozen rides found nowhere else on the planet. Indeed, just about everyone agrees that Kennywood's main claim to fame is its lovingly preserved wooden roller coasters.
The Jack Rabbit, built for the princely sum of $50,000 in 1921, is the oldest in the park and arguably the most beautiful. A unique 70-foot double dip follows the hilly contour of the site. I tried it and -- surprise -- I liked it. What had been agony in childhood was now just a pleasant thrill, a heightened awareness of living that lasted far longer than the ride.
Ditto for the Racer, a 1927 coaster that offers the novelty of a genuine contest between two strings of cars. I thought the Racer, with its clanging machinery, creaking 2-by-4's and hard, heavily banked turns, was a bit of a brute compared with the Jack Rabbit. But, perhaps because riders fit snugly in the cars, it is considered a good roller coaster for novices.
Nobody makes that claim for the Thunderbolt, built as an act of faith in 1968 when the owners of most amusement parks were desperately seeking themes to compete with Disney or selling their land for tract housing. It is long, fast and sneaky-mean. Or so I am told: I never had a chance to try it because the gods answered my secret prayers with a thunderstorm. What I do know for sure is that the Thunderbolt triggered a national renaissance in roller coasters and secured Kennywood's solvency.
Neither that strategy nor its success should be surprising: Kennywood has always offered a combination of nostalgia and cheap thrills that has never gone out of style for long. Opened in 1898 as the people's weekend destination in the country by one of Pittsburgh's 13 trolley companies, it gradually added a dance hall, boating on the pond, circus-style acts and, of course, rock 'em, sock 'em rides. Today, Kennywood is handsomely landscaped, squeaky clean and unobtrusively policed, freeing it from the vague sense of menace that sent suburbanites scurrying from other old-fashioned amusement parks.
New rides are added sparingly: "We've avoided the arms race" that drove up costs at the theme parks, explains Carl Hughes, the chairman of Kennywood. Indeed, the latest addition, a group of old-fashioned rides, including the hand-painted Bavarian Wave Swinger, could have fit nicely in fin de siecle Europe. It is a grand version of the flying-chair ride found at every traveling carnival, gentle fun with just enough illusion of danger to evoke squeals from the younger passengers. "We work hard to preserve the base," Hughes adds -- the kids who are introduced to Kennywood before they become jaded on computer-age toys.
Kennywood is a low-key alternative to the plastic-fantastic worlds of Disney, Universal and Six Flags that just keep on selling and selling and selling. And Pittsburghers, bless them, have clung to memories of simpler times and simpler pleasures.

A Biography of the Drug That Changed the World.

ALL too often, contemporary discussions about work and family sound like a stuck needle, endlessly replaying heartfelt but circular arguments about mother love, father indifference and flextime. In "Kidding Ourselves: Breadwinning, Babies, and Bargaining Power," Rhona Mahony sounds a welcome discordant note. Her radical proposition: Not until as many men as women want to stay home with the kids will women achieve real economic equality.
To the sometimes mushy emotional world of family roles and responsibilities, Ms. Mahony brings the gimlet eye of the economist and game theorist. A lawyer and journalist by training, she argues convincingly that it is babies who handicap women in the drive for equality -- or, more accurately, the fact that women choose and are forced to take on more of the care of babies than men, resulting in lower salaries and lagging careers.
In lively, lucid prose, well laced with humor and illuminating examples, Ms. Mahony shows how American women's conscious and unconscious choices have weakened their bargaining power at work and at home. By taking fewer science and mathematics courses and pursuing fewer graduate and professional degrees, she says, women are unknowingly insuring that theirs will be the lesser income, easier to forgo than their future mates' when they are discussing how to divide child care, often putting themselves on a "mommy track" of care-giving that "lasts a lifetime" as parents age and grandchildren arrive. Women also tend to "marry up" -- choose partners who are older and earn more money than they do -- or at the very least "marry across," choosing men of comparable education and achievement.
Through four hypothetical case studies -- of a traditional and a nontraditional marriage and two "transitional" ones -- Ms. Mahony shows how choices like these accumulate and how women might make different ones. Her book offers the clearest explanation to date of a phenomenon that has troubled many couples: time and again even ardent feminists, whose marriages were egalitarian before children appeared, become saddled with a second shift of virtually full responsibility for housework and the kids.
Much of the debate has focused on helping mothers who want to spend more time with children: extended family leave, job sharing, better part-time work. But one of Ms. Mahony's many original contributions is her insight that these benefits, while important, may end up undercutting women: having less income at work and more flexibility at home, they start out doing more of the child care. The early patterns often freeze in place and last forever. If women assume more child care responsibility from the beginning, they not only become the experts, making it harder for fathers to feel competent, but they have a head start in attachment to the baby, making them more willing to sacrifice their careers for their children.
Ms. Mahony gives practical advice about how to reverse these trends, offering specific suggestions she calls BATNA's -- best alternatives to a negotiated agreement. Her tone is so reasonable and matter-of-fact that it almost disguises how revolutionary her prescriptions are -- and how alien they will probably seem to readers. But she argues that negotiating does not have to strip marriages of love, loyalty or even religious faith, and that compassionate and spiritual impulses help bring about a fairer division of labor at home.
More women, she says, especially the well-educated, high-earning ones, should consider the virtue of "marrying down," to musicians, artists or others who earn less money, work more flexible hours and might be able to take on more child care. New mothers should leave their husbands alone with their infants for long stretches, so they learn how to take care of babies and to compensate for most mothers' head start in attachment. Most startlingly, she envisions a future in which many more men will switch roles completely with women and become full-time homemakers while women become breadwinners.
I fear that the theorist in Ms. Mahony -- who shares child care with her husband, a professor at the Stanford Business School -- sometimes underestimates the power of emotion to muddy the rational vision of a more just family life that she outlines. The problem for her dream of real economic equality is that many women passionately want to spend more time with their children, even at the possible cost of careers and egalitarianism at home. Her path requires a degree of vigilance and self-awareness, and an understanding of what choices to make at what times, that elude many, men and women alike. Nonetheless, "Kidding Ourselves" is a groundbreaking book that should shove the debate onto a different, provocative plane.
If Rhona Mahony tells us where American families are and where she wants them to go, Elaine Tyler May's "Barren in the Promised Land" and Bernard Asbell's journalistic account "The Pill" tell us where they have been.
IN "Barren in the Promised Land: Childless Americans and the Pursuit of Happiness," Ms. May, who teaches American studies at the University of Minnesota, documents a continuing American obsession with reproduction and shows how this public embrace of childbearing has inflicted anguish on childless women across the centuries. They were branded as witches in colonial times and shirkers by 19th-century eugenicists anxious for breeding stock, and called frigid in psychological case studies in the 1950's; many are now supporting the fertility and adoption industries. Ms. May has some historical perspective on debates that continue to bedevil society, but her text is episodic and occasionally repetitious, and it doesn't really consider how these conflicting trends and interpretations relate to American culture.
"The Pill: A Biography of the Drug That Changed the World" harks back to a time not so long ago when childbearing irrevocably followed sex, and to the fury that was unleashed when the birth control pill offered so many women freedom from that linkage. Combining some original research with a heavy reliance on secondary sources, Bernard Asbell, a journalist, tells the dramatic story of how two women financed the creation of an easy, all but foolproof birth control method, and of the ensuing scientific and moral repercussions. His prose, however, is breathless, and he has a tendency to compress so many issues that his book borders on superficiality.

BYLINE: By Laurel Graeber 

 BODY:

D-Day, June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II
By Stephen E. Ambrose. Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $16.
Drawing on 1,200 oral histories, the author examines the strategy behind the landings at Normandy and re-creates the scene where Allied troops triumphed, but at a terrible cost. Last year our reviewer, Raleigh Trevelyan, wrote, "The descriptions of individual ordeals on the bloody beach . . . make this book outstanding." 

THE RAGE OF THE VULTURE
By Barry Unsworth. Norton, $12.
Earlier novels by this British author, who was a co-winner of the Booker Prize in 1992 for "Sacred Hunger," are now reappearing in print. This one focuses on Robert Markham, a British Army captain attached to the legation in Turkey in 1908. Markham uses his position to seek both absolution and vengeance for a personal tragedy that sprang from the nation's ethnic hatreds. The novel is "a beautifully honest story . . . and I admire Barry Unsworth very much for having told it so scrupulously and vividly," Thomas R. Edwards said here in 1983. Norton has also reissued STONE VIRGIN ($11), Mr. Unsworth's tale of a 15th-century Italian madonna statue that exerts a strange hold over a British art restorer. Writing in these pages in 1986, Katha Pollitt commented that if she ever visited Venice, she would fully expect to see the statue "smiling down at me from a church front." She added, "And if I don't, I'll be disappointed indeed."
THE GULF CONFLICT, 1990-1991: Diplomacy and War in the New World Order
By Lawrence Freedman and Efraim Karsh. Princeton University, $18.95.
The authors analyze the escalating problems that led to United States intervention in the Persian Gulf, concentrating on the gambles taken by both sides. "It is unlikely that there will be a better balanced or more comprehensive chronicle," H. D. S. Greenway said in the Book Review in 1993. The issues of the gulf war are among the many subjects covered in THE POLITICS OF DISPOSSESSION: The Struggle for Palestinian Self-Determination, 1969-1994, by Edward W. Said (Vintage, $15), a collection of previously published essays, dialogues and articles about the Middle East. Last year our reviewer, David K. Shipler, found the writing "vitriolic," but praised the author's "provocative and justifiable assaults on American caricatures of Islam and Arabs." A vision of a region free from hostilities infuses THE NEW MIDDLE EAST, by Shimon Peres with Arye Naor (Owl/Holt, $14.95). Mr. Peres, Israel's Minister of Foreign Affairs and winner of the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize, proposes an eventual economic confederation of Israel and its neighbors. His words "are especially poignant on the Palestinians," Clyde Haberman said here in 1994.
A MAP OF THE WORLD
By Jane Hamilton. Anchor/Doubleday, $12.
Having endured devastating losses when she was a child, Alice Goodwin has found respite in the dreamlike universe of her imagination and in the quiet reality of rural Wisconsin. But both refuges betray her. The novel "lays out an exciting human drama against a setting so vividly realized that you can almost smell the loamy soil," Bill Kent wrote in the Book Review last year.
OLEANDER, JACARANDA. A Childhood Perceived:
A Memoir
By Penelope Lively. Harper Perennial, $10.
This is as much a meditation on the sensibilities of the young as it is a chronicle of Egypt in the 1930's and 40's, when the author found happiness despite rumblings of war and her British parents' impending divorce. Readers will feel grateful "for having been shown tantalizing glimpses of a vanished exotic world," Francine Prose said in these pages in 1994.
LIVE FREE OR DIE
By Ernest Hebert. Hardscrabble/University Press of New England, $16.95.
Darby, N.H., is the setting for this book, the fifth and final in the author's series about the fictional New England town. Here Frederick Elman, a young bridge painter and poet, falls in love with a woman from a wealthy, disintegrating family. In 1990 our reviewer, Marianne Gingher, said, "To feel encompassed by a novel -- to sense that you've actually set foot in its terrain -- is very rare indeed." The same publisher has restored to print Mr. Hebert's first novel, THE DOGS OF MARCH ($14.95), whose protagonist is Frederick's father, Howard, a barely literate laborer. "By turns tormented, funny, poignant and appalling, he lodges in the memory," Michael Mewshaw wrote here in 1979.
REBELLIONS, PERVERSITIES, AND MAIN EVENTS
By Murray Kempton. Times Books/Random House, $16.
These are the subjects of the journalistic pieces gathered in this book, which reveal the author's vivid enthusiasm for radicalism and the underdog during his long career. "His faithfulness and his considerable achievement are certified by this generous collection," Walter Goodman said in the Book Review last year.
THE COLLECTED POEMS OF FRANK O'HARA
Edited by Donald Allen. University of California, $18.
Only 40 when an accident ended his life in 1966, Frank O'Hara left numerous poems highlighting the improvisational intensity of the streets and art world of New York. "The pleasures of the 'Collected Poems' confirm his place," Herbert A. Leibowitz wrote here in 1971.
A FATHER'S STORY
By Lionel Dahmer. Avon, $5.99.
The parent of Jeffrey Dahmer explores haunting questions: How did the innocent baby he remembers become a vicious serial killer? And how was he himself at fault? Calling the book "remarkable," our reviewer, Will Self, said last year, "I can think of no better place to begin the much-needed examination of the dark side of our natures." LAUREL GRAEBER

HEADLINE: DEATH ON THE CNN CURVE

BYLINE: By Lisa Belkin; Lisa Belkin is a contributing writer for the Magazine. Her last article, "Kill for Life," about abortion protesters, appeared in October 1994.

 BODY:
IT WAS FAME that killed Robert O'Donnell, killed him as surely as that shotgun blast he fired into his brain on a dark, dusty, West Texas road, miles and years away from the thing that made him famous in the first place. Technically, it was the bullet that did it -- a .410 shell, the kind his mother kept at the ranch house to shoot rattlesnakes and warn trespassers. It certainly wasn't an accident. You can't shoot yourself in the mouth accidentally with a .410. The barrel is too long. And it wasn't someone else's doing. He left three notes, lined up side by side by the coffee table, two to his two boys and one that simply said, "No help from nobody but family."
So it was the bullet, or depression, or his willful trigger finger that caused his death, this spring, at the age of 37. But the reason he did it, and the reason no one who knew him was surprised, that is where the fame comes in. Eight years earlier he had saved a little girl's life, as the whole world watched, and, for a while, he was the center not only of his small universe, but of the real, known universe, the new one that sees everything simultaneously on CNN. There was a parade, countless television appearances, a letter from the president, a handshake from the Vice President, a made-for-TV movie. But eventually, the cameras went away, the world's attention moved on and he was left alone -- a man so changed by fame that he no longer belonged in his world, but not changed enough that he could leave that world behind. 
 O'Donnell was not the only one. The little girl's parents moved her out of town, to a three-bedroom house that they never could have afforded before she was rescued, to hide from the world that embraced them so hard they couldn't breathe. Eventually, they were divorced. Others who helped to save the child -- O'Donnell was just the most visible of hundreds -- found themselves drinking, or in marriage counseling, or in legal tangles, all because of the fickle, seductive, burning spotlight.
"It was the greatest moment of Robert's life and it was the worst thing that ever happened to him," said his mother.
Most of all, it is a cautionary tale for a time when Capt. Scott O'Grady, plucked from enemy territory in Bosnia, leaves his hospital bed to appear live with Larry King, and an Oklahoma surgeon, after spending an hour amputating a woman's leg to free her from the rubble of a bombed Federal building, emerges to spend a week giving almost nonstop interviews. In the days before he died, Robert O'Donnell, like most of the rest of the country at the time, was tuned to the coverage of the Oklahoma City rescue effort on television. He had wanted to go to Oklahoma himself, to try to do something to help, maybe to be a hero again, but he didn't have enough money for the trip. He was quiet while he watched, his mother remembers, but, after several hours he said something she will never forget. Pointing to a wide shot of the rescue workers, he shook his head and said, "Those people are going to need a lot of help for a very long time."
EVEN IF YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE ROBERT O'Donnell's name, odds are you know what he did. He was the paramedic who snaked himself down a tomblike tunnel and freed 18-month-old Jessica McClure, who had got stuck 22 feet underground in an abandoned water well.
He was at work the morning of Oct. 14, 1987, when he first heard about the ongoing rescue, and since he was assigned to the other side of Midland, he had no reason to think it would have anything to do with him. His was an ordinary life at the time. He was 1 of about 50 Midland firefighters with paramedic training, a job he enjoyed but easily left at the end of the day. He was married to the blond, effervescent Robbie Martin, whom he fell for in high school, and together they had Casey, then 7 years old, and Chance, 3. On weekends he coached Casey's soccer team, and played for hours in the yard with both his boys. Once or twice a month he was blinded by a migraine, and he would spend the day in bed, with the shades drawn to block the light. He raced motorcycles. He favored Dr. Pepper and Copenhagen chewing tobacco. There was nothing about him that the world would be likely to notice.
By the morning of Oct. 15, Jessica was still trapped in the well, and Robert, who had just gone off duty, thought he could help. He drove to the rescue site on Tanner Street, through a neighborhood of tiny houses and tiny yards, a neighborhood where people lived because they could not afford other parts of town. He had to circle for a while before he found a place to park, because a small city had sprung up along the normally quiet streets. He then made his way by foot to 3309 Tanner, past the television satellite trucks, the telephone company installers adding extra lines, the contortionist from Dallas who hoped to squeeze himself down the well. Tucked in a corner of the nondescript backyard was a black metal pipe, three inches poking up from the ground and eight inches in diameter, small enough to all but wrap your hands around, and, incomprehensibly, big enough to swallow a little girl. Around that pipe were the people and equipment assigned to monitor and maintain Jessica: a hose delivering oxygen, another blowing heated air, a microphone from a local oil safety company. Andy Glasscock, a police officer and one of the first rescuers on the scene, spent most of the three days lying on his stomach and listening for sounds from that microphone, hearing Jessica sing nursery rhymes to herself, call for "Mama" and cry. Glasscock, craggy-faced with tobacco stains on his teeth and more than a little steel gray in his thick mustache, cried himself, as he thought of his own small children. "How does a kitten go?" he would call down into the darkness, and he held his breath until he heard her say, "Meow."
By the time O'Donnell arrived, volunteers also had dug a shaft parallel to the one that held Jessica, one barely wide enough to hold a grown man and a drill, and 29 feet deep. The next step was to create a cross-tunnel, but the five feet of rock separating the shaft from the well proved to be so hard that it rapidly dulled diamond-tipped drills. Even with improved machinery, progress came at the rate of an inch an hour. The drills and jackhammers bounced off the stone, as if hitting steel. Men were dragged out exhausted from the effort.
They weren't the only ones exhausted. Looking over the shoulders of the group monitoring Jessica, and the group trying to reach her, were the reporters. The ones who arrived earliest, mostly from local newspapers and television stations, were only a few feet away from the two holes, just on the other side of the weatherworn wooden fence. Those who came next quickly realized they needed ladders, and those who came later brought even higher ladders.
Once territory was staked with a ladder, it had to be protected. Leaving for the bathroom meant risking a prime spot, unless you found someone to guard your ladder while you were gone. For blocks around the site, neighbors filled every available coffeepot and left them on their front stoops for the reporters, along with boxes of doughnuts, sandwiches and cold drinks. Some let strangers with press passes use their showers, sleep on their couches, borrow their telephones. The ones who arrived near the end had no hope of actually fitting into the yard or seeing anything firsthand. They sat in nearby living rooms and watched events unfold on television, then called their editors with updates that were really unnecessary since their editors were also tuned to CNN.
Robert O'Donnell inched through the crowd in the backyard, found his chief and offered his assistance. He did not leave that yard again until 8 o'clock the following night, and, when he did, he left a part of himself behind.
"I think if he could have, if he had it to do over again," his brother Ricky would say, after Robert's funeral, "he would have stayed home and let somebody else help that kid."
But it wasn't somebody else. It was Robert O'Donnell. At noon on the third day, the drillers stopped, the reporters clung to their ladders and everybody watched as O'Donnell, with a mining light strapped to his head, was lowered by a cable harness down the shaft. He was chosen because he was tall and thin -- 6 feet, 145 pounds. He didn't mention he was also claustrophobic. He lay down on his back and wriggled head first through the cross-tunnel, with his arms out in front of him. The air was wet and sticky, and within moments he was bathed in sweat. It was like trying to slither through a tightly wrapped sleeping bag, he would tell reporters later.
He inched to the end of the tunnel, until he could look up at the shaft that held Jessica. Only the first few feet were lined with the pipe that protruded up into the yard; the rest was raw rock wall. One of Jessica's feet was dangling down toward Robert, but the other was out of his sight, wedged near her head, so she was almost in a split. "Juicy, I'm here to help you," he said, using the nickname her parents had told him to use. He asked her to move her leg and she did. Satisfied that she probably had no overwhelming spinal injuries, he started to tug on her foot, but she didn't budge. She was wedged in too tight, and he did not have enough room to maneuver. He cursed. He prayed. He became resigned to the fact that he would have to leave so that the diggers could widen the tunnel. He promised her he would come back.
He almost wasn't allowed to make a second try. Doctors on the scene worried that he was "too distraught," but he insisted. When he reached the end of the tunnel again, he coated the walls near Jessica's dangling foot with K-Y lubricating jelly, and started pulling, moving her a fraction of an inch at a time. Finally, he gave one last pull and she was lying in the tunnel with him, nose to nose.
"You're out, Juicy," he said, then maneuvered her out of the tunnel and into the shaft, where Steve Forbes, another fire department paramedic, waited with a backboard used to immobilize accident victims who might have hidden injuries. O'Donnell had worked with Forbes countless times before, and considered the quiet, unassuming Forbes a friend, although, they would soon learn that, in many fundamental ways, they were very different.
Steve and Jessica were lifted from the shaft, up the 29 feet toward the waiting world. She reached the top, wrapped in gauze, and was immediately surrounded. A local photographer, standing in the basket of a cherry picker borrowed from the local telephone company, took the photograph, the one that won the Pulitzer Prize. All three networks interrupted their regular programming to cover the moment. "Live and direct from Midland, Texas," said Dan Rather. "Jessica McClure is up. She's alive. What a fighter."
O'Donnell stayed in the tunnel for a few moments, collecting himself. "I was totally exhausted," he would say. "Totally elated, too. I've saved other people's lives before, but they'll never be anything like this again."
When he emerged, church bells were ringing all over Midland. The phone in his home was ringing, too. The first call was from a radio station in New York City, and, every time he finished an interview and put the receiver back in the cradle, it rang again. That night he developed a migraine; his wife, Robbie, pulled the telephone plug so he could sleep. When he woke up the next morning and plugged the phone back in, it began ringing immediately.
MIDLAND IS A CITY OF 100,000 PEOPLE IN the middle of nowhere. Even its name speaks to its remoteness -- a land roughly midway between El Paso and Fort Worth, about 300 miles from each. Nature made it dry and flat, with rust-colored earth and a white-blue sky. Man has not embellished it much. It is a sprawl of fast-food restaurants, gun shops, places that sell pickups and places that fix them. It is perfectly in character to find a sign in the lobby of the police station asking, "Please do not empty your tobacco residue in the water fountain." If not for the oil, there would be no one in Midland. They certainly don't stay here for the scenery.
By the 1970's, oil prices started to rise, quadrupling to $40 a barrel, and in the early 1980's, Midland boasted of having the country's highest density of millionaires. There were as many private jets at the airport as there were commercial ones, the locals liked to boast, and it became a challenge to do simple things, like get an appointment with your dentist, because the dentist was likely to have gone off to drill for oil. By the mid-1980's, however, the price of oil began its free fall, and Midland went down with it. O'Donnell, who had been a draftsman for the City Service Oil Company, now defunct, went to work for the fire department, and felt lucky to have found the job.
In October 1987, the oil bust meant Midland's economy was depressed, and so were its people Then a little girl fell down a well, and the thing they knew how to do best -- bore down into the ground and bring something precious back up -- that was the one thing that needed doing. The primary goal, of course, was to save one little girl. But as the hours passed, the drama developed a deeper symbolism, a mythology only loosely related to fact. And in the weeks and months afterward it would transform from a simple good deed into a legend, until it began to feel like they saved all of Midland, maybe even all of Texas, when they saved Jessica McClure.
Not quite 40 years before Jessica McClure fell into an abandoned well, another little girl, 3-year-old Kathy Fiscus, did the same thing in California. She was running a race with her sister and her cousin in a field in a suburb of Los Angeles in 1949 when she slipped into a 14-inch-wide hole and became trapped 95 feet underground. Her cries, too, could be heard from the surface and there was a mammoth rescue effort -- 132 volunteers worked for two days, while more than 5,000 people came to watch. Finally, after 49 hours, Kathy Fiscus was found dead. Apparently she died a few hours after her fall.
The story of Kathy Fiscus was worldwide news in 1949. Newspapers in London and Stockholm held their editions until her fate was known. Radio reporters brought word from the scene in hushed, dramatic voices. Thousands huddled around black-and-white sets watching KTLA-Channel 5, the first TV station in Los Angeles. But the difference between then and now was a difference of immediacy and numbers. Thousands watched for word of Kathy Fiscus, and what they saw was someone telling them what had happened, not showing them what was happening, since the perfection of the live TV remote was well in the future. Millions watched Jessica McClure, and they saw events as they happened. During the last minutes of her rescue, 3.1 million households were tuned to CNN alone. Those millions of people felt they were there. In a way, they were there. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a moving picture is worth many times that, and a live moving picture makes an emotional connection that goes deeper than logic and lasts well beyond the actual event. "Everybody in America became godfathers and godmothers of Jessica while this was going on," Ronald Reagan told Jessica's parents, Chip and Reba (Cissy) McClure, in a telephone call shortly after the rescue. He placed the call from Nancy Reagan's hospital room, where she had just told she had breast cancer. She refused to leave her room for her biopsy, she told Chip and Cissy, "until I watched her come up."
This was before correspondents reported live from the enemy capital while American bombs were falling. Before Saddam Hussein held a surreal press conference with a few of the hundreds of Americans he was holding hostage. Before the nation watched, riveted but powerless, as Los Angeles was looted and burned. Before O. J. Simpson took a slow ride in a white Bronco, and before everyone close to his case had an agent and a book contract. This was uncharted territory just a short time ago, and it was left to the McClures, Andy Glasscock, Steve Forbes, Robert O'Donnell and the besieged city of Midland, Tex., to figure out how to handle it.
It was a lot to handle. Suddenly everyone wanted to give things to Jessica. She spent 36 days in Midland Memorial Hospital, undergoing six surgeries for severe forehead and right-foot wounds, eventually having her smallest toe removed, and all her doctors -- the pediatricians, general practitioners, vascular surgeons and orthopedic surgeons -- donated their time. The rest of her bill, about $50,000, was paid by anonymous donors. During her stay, the hospital received an average of 50 calls an hour. Her room, the hallway outside her room and, eventually, the entire hospital, were filled with stuffed bears, elephants, balloons, flowers and baskets of fruit. The Walt Disney Company sent a 5-foot-tall Winnie the Pooh, along with an invitation to visit Disneyland as their guest. The Federal Express box that brought the bear was signed by Fedex employees at every stop along the way. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and his wife, Matilda, sent a stuffed beaver, which is New York's official animal. When the toy store found out who it was for, they donated a Garfield the Cat.
A well-wisher in Vienna sent a chocolate cake. Someone closer to home shipped Jessica a custom-made water bed. A Shar-Pei puppy, which she named Shirley, was also a gift. She received enough clothing to last until she was 5. She was invited to the Vatican, for an audience with the Pope, to throw out the first ball at the Texas Rangers' home opener, and to Washington to be the Grand Marshal of the National Independence Day Parade.
Money poured into a trust fund established for her at a Midland bank, an account that today is estimated to be worth more than $700,000 by people close to the family, although the McClures have never officially released a figure. The Reagans sent an undisclosed amount. Jeanne Yate's third-grade class in Wellston, Okla., sold birdseed for 50 cents a bag and sent Jessica $421. Chip McClure tried to keep a computerized list of all the mail, and eventually it exceeded 60,000 names.
While Jessica was still in the hospital, Midland held a parade, to honor her and all the people who helped rescue her. They called it "A Salute to Jessica's Heroes." Between 35,000 and 40,000 people lined the eight blocks of downtown -- more than one-third of the city's population. Past her window rode the 400-plus people who had a part in her rescue. No one, it seems, was left out. O'Donnell rode with Forbes on top of the ambulance that brought Jessica to the hospital. Cherry pickers from the telephone company carried the directory assistance workers who fielded the onslaught of calls to the city. The drilling rig that first dug the parallel shaft was on display in the parade, as were the thermal-imaging camera used to watch Jessica while she was in the hole, and the vibraphone used to listen to her. A flatbed truck followed, filled to overflowing with stuffed animals. At a ceremony after the parade, the McClures gave autographed pictures to all 400 volunteers, and let them take their pick from the truckload of toys. Robert chose a bear for Casey and a smaller stuffed animal for Chance.
The attention heaped on the McClures trickled down to the central players in the rescue. Andy Glasscock was seen in the Michael Jackson video "Man in the Mirror," which included flashes of major news events. Forbes and O'Donnell each received a wall full of citations and plaques, and O'Donnell was asked to serve as a judge for the "G.I. Joe Search for Real American Heroes," and to attend the White House awards ceremony for that program. Not only was he a guest when Oprah Winfrey brought her show to Midland but he also sat next to her at the press conference beforehand. He was invited to speak at so many firefighter conventions around the country that he developed a slide presentation. Forbes and O'Donnell and their wives were flown to Los Angeles to appear on the television program "3rd Degree," where a celebrity panel tries to guess what two seemingly unrelated individuals have in common. The panelists knew immediately who they were.
A 4-foot-by-6-foot plaque was hung on the wall of the Midland Center, a bronze rendition of the Pulitzer Prize-winning photo, with O'Donnell's likeness added, even though he was underground when the picture was taken. An area a few blocks away was renamed "Volunteer Park." At the actual site of the rescue, an iron plate was welded over the pipe, with the inscription, "For Jessica, With Love From All of Us." In an emotional ceremony, the rescuers, including O'Donnell, planted a redbud seedling surrounded by a ring of lavender chrysanthemum over the refilled parallel shaft.
I FIRST MET ROBERT O'DONNELL WHEN THINGS were starting to get ugly. The earliest, most visible sign that the euphoria was crumbling came in early spring, when the rescuers, tantalized by competing offers from movie producers, formed two rival associations. One, called the McClure Rescue Association, was made up of public employees including O'Donnell, who was the president, Steve Forbes, and the chiefs of the fire and police departments. The other, the Jessica McClure Rescuers' Association, was made up of 37 volunteers, the ones who brought the equipment and the brute strength to the operation. Each group had its own set of bylaws, with rules about what percentage of the vote was required to admit a new member, and what percentage of any eventual profits the various members would get. Each also had its own lawyer. And each agreed on three things: that it was a shame that they had to fight like this, that their group's story was the story and that they were interested only in the quality of the movie; it was the others, they said, who were interested only in the money.
I had moved to Texas in November 1987, a month after the rescue, to cover the state as a correspondent for The New York Times. It wasn't only the rescuers who were caught up in the mythology then; the press corps was pretty proud of itself, too. In Houston, where I was based, it was a badge of valor to have survived the grueling coverage, and local reporters who had flown from Houston to Midland spoke with feigned nonchalance of how, after more than two days without sleep, they would start seeing flashing lights and moving shapes that were not really there.
So when the heroes began squabbling, it was big news. I called O'Donnell, who was eager to talk. He gave me the lists of everyone in his organization, along with their telephone numbers, and he asked his lawyer to fax me copies of the contracts they had received from producers.
When we met briefly in Midland the next day, he was genial and excited, and seemed savvy in the ways of reporters. He spelled his name several times, offered that he was comfortable with a tape recorder should I prefer it to a notepad and spoke slowly, in quotable fragments, when I chose to use a pen.
"I hate to see it split the rescuers like this," he said. "But our story is the real story -- we were the major players. I want the best movie. One that my great-great grandkids can see."
The other group, he said, met every Tuesday night in a banquet room of the downtown Hilton, and, by all accounts, stood around and yelled at each other. Knowing that, I had arrived on a Tuesday. He offered to come along to that meeting with me, saying that many of the members of the volunteer group knew him, and, even though they were at odds at the moment, maybe he could help smooth my way and make some introductions. I wasn't nearly as confident as he that he would be received as a calming presence, and tried to talk him out of the idea, but, as it happened, we never found out. Those in charge of the meeting canceled it at the last minute because they had heard that an "infiltrator" was planning to "disrupt" their proceedings. Robert? Me? They weren't specific.
Robert was disappointed with my article, which described the in-fighting in detail and quoted people who used words like "childish" and "greedy." He called me in my office in Houston to explain that he was really just trying to protect the integrity of Jessica's story. I think he really believed that. I heard from him four times, that I remember -- to announce that a blue-ribbon mayoral commission had selected a producer for the movie and that both groups would abide by the choice; to say that the actor Whip Hubley had been hired to play his role; to advise me of the date that the movie would be broadcast, and to ask if I knew a book agent who might help him sell his autobiography.
AS THE RESCUERS loudly turned on each other, much of Midland was, more quietly but just as nastily, turning on the McClures. When their daughter fell down a well, they were just two kids -- she with an outgrown shag haircut, he with aviator sunglasses and a wisp of a moustache. They were 16 when they were married, both sophomores in high school who would drop out soon after. (Eventually Cissy earned her equivalency diploma.) Cissy was a day-care worker in her sister's in-home child-care center -- the home with the pipe in the yard. Chip was a house painter. Suddenly the cameras were following their every expression as they stood clinging to each other in the tense backyard.
When it was over, Chip and Cissy tried to do the right thing. They took out two full-page ads in the months after the rescue, thanking everyone for everything. They granted interviews in their three-bedroom home in a new housing development outside of Midland, and the resulting articles chronicled the new possessions that came with fame. There were 30 stuffed animals on Jessica's bed, readers learned, along with 10 small handmade pillows. Her closet was crammed with fancy dresses (the pictures accompanying one article showed Jessica in yards of red velvet and white lace, next to the Christmas tree), play clothes and pajamas. "This is the kind of room you always dream about your child having," Cissy said.
With that, the rumor mill of Midland began to destroy that which it had created. And the rumors would reach as far as my office in Houston. Since the public had given Jessica all those things and all that money, they felt they had a right to talk about how it was spent. The fire chief, James L. Roberts, who helped organized the rescue, said: "They got mad at them because they were human." So Chip and Cissy gave more interviews, to bat at the whispers and innuendo.
"They're spending all of Jessica's money," the stories went.
No, Chip and Cissy said, the trust was under the control of a local bank and could not be spent on anything but her basic welfare until she was 25.
"They paid cash for that house," was the word over lunch at the country club, news delivered with one raised eyebrow.
Yes, Cissy said, $30,000, so that Jessica could "live a middle-class life."
"I heard they bought a Rolls-Royce and a Mercedes," people who had never met the McClures confided to other people who had never met them.
No, Cissy said, just a new Thunderbird and a new pickup, to get them around now that they lived miles from town.
"What kind of mother leaves her child alone like that?"
One who has to go inside, like mothers do all over America, Cissy said, to answer the telephone.
"I heard Cissy's being investigated by some agency."
She was. By the Texas Department of Human Services, Bureau of Day Care Licensing, who sent a letter saying that "there is reason to believe the child's injuries and the time spent in the well are the result of negligent supervision by child care provider Reba McClure." But no charges would be filed, a spokesman for the department said, because "the lady has been penalized enough by the horrible experience."
There were stories everywhere of how the fame had gone to the McClures' heads. "We were over at Denny's one day, soon after it happened, when she came in," says Marie Petronella, who still lives two doors down from the house with the well, and was out front with a garden hose on a recent June morning, trying to resuscitate her baked, shriveled grass. "There was a wait, and she looked at the guy and says, just like that: 'Do you know who I am? I'm Jessica's mother.' I said to her, 'If it wasn't for a whole lot of other people, you wouldn't be anyone's mother.' "
And everywhere there were rumors that the McClure marriage, shaky to begin with, was near collapse. "I read in The National Enquirer that I was having an affair with Jessica's mother," says Andy Glasscock. "It didn't help their marriage situation a hell of a lot, things like that." The couple divorced in 1990, and each has since remarried. "Chip was there for me more than anyone at the time," Cissy said in an interview with The Midland Reporter-Telegram. "And people think otherwise, but we're not at each other's throats."
The McClures were not the only ones feeling this downside of fame. Robert O'Donnell's co-workers began to call him "Robo-Donnell." They were tired of hearing about the rescue, annoyed that the world had bestowed on him an unfair share of the credit and angered by his hopes -- ones that never materialized -- that he could translate his moment of fame into something grander.
He never did find a book agent. And when the television movie finally aired, in May 1989, he was scheduled to work that night, and he had to beg his colleagues to switch shifts so that he could watch someone play him on TV. More than once, his chief, James Roberts, remembers calling O'Donnell into his office and warning him to climb off the pedestal before he fell. "You can't make a living as America's hero," he recalls saying. "Life goes on. Go on with yours."
Glasscock's marriage almost dissolved in the months after the rescue, because, he says, he began to believe he truly deserved the attention. "I became the Andy Glasscock," he says. "It really is an intoxicating thing. I was thinking: 'Hey, I'm somebody, I'm on TV. I'm in the newspapers all over the world.' My wife had a 6-day-old baby, and I'm jetting off to Cancun, Mexico, for hurricane relief. I jetted off to Hollywood to watch them make the movie. I didn't take my wife, I took my partner."
While O'Donnell and Glasscock were inflated with self-importance, Steve Forbes was feeling trapped. With each interview, each award, he felt as if he were giving away pieces of himself. Like Aboriginal tribes who believe that a photograph can steal the soul, he worried that soon there would be nothing left. He stopped returning telephone calls from the press.
"It reached a point where I said 'no more,' " he told me one recent afternoon, breaking his silence briefly to talk -- uncomfortably, and with an awareness of the irony -- about why he had imposed that silence in the first place. "There finally came a point where I had no family time. My family's real important to me. I'm not going to go out of my way to help someone get their story. It was taking away my life."
Eventually, the McClures, too, stopped talking about Jessica, and both Cissy and Chip refused to be interviewed for this article. Cissy told the Associated Press several years ago: "I know everyone loves her, but I love her too, and I just want her to be a kid like all the other kids she goes to school with. If we keep writing the baby Jessica story, my child will never be normal."
By all accounts, their approach worked. Jessica, friends and neighbors say, is a happy, feisty, active 9-year-old girl, whose hint of a limp and whisper of a scar are the only signs of what she went though.
"She's a wonderful little girl who needs to be left alone," said her grandmother, asking me, politely but insistently, to please go away.
"She rides her bike up and down the block and she has a dog," says Glasscock, who lives on the same block as Jessica. "She's just a normal kid. Her life is back to normal."
Glasscock says his life, too, is back to normal, but only because he went for counseling, at his wife's insistence. "She said: 'We can go to see a counselor, or we can go our separate ways,' " he says. "So I go bouncing in there, like I was Mr. Cool, and he pretty well says, 'She's right, you're a jerk.' And after we go through counseling for a while I figure out, well, I really am a jerk." He took down the rescue memorabilia that had all but covered his office, boxed it up and put it in the attic. He kept one item, and hung it on the wall at home -- the photo of the rescue that the McClures autographed.
But Robert O'Donnell couldn't seem to get past his past.
"Robert was stuck in a rut," Glasscock says. "He couldn't let it go. It got to the point where when you saw him coming, you went the other way."
Robbie O'Donnell agrees: "He would introduce himself to people, and wait for them to recognize him. If they didn't, sometimes they did, but usually they didn't, he would say, 'You might recognize my name because. . . . "
Eventually, his migraines came daily. Probably not coincidentally, so did thoughts of the rescue. "He said it went through his mind everyday," says his mother, Yvonne Poe, a sad, tired woman with a Texas-size shock of platinum hair. "Being down that hole, getting her out. And he said, 'Mom, I can't stop it, I don't know what to do.' "
One of the things he did was turn to prescription painkillers. He was often so sedated that he could barely speak. Robbie would test him before he got in a car with the boys, by asking him a few questions. If his speech was slurred she would take away the keys. He knew he was taking too many of the pills, Robbie says, and more than once, he tried to stop. "One day he threw them all away," she says. "But then he started taking so much aspirin that his stomach bled." Soon he was using the more powerful drugs again. "He was so sedated on the stuff he could not function," Robbie says. "I don't know how he went to work and drove an ambulance."
In April 1991, the medication cost him his marriage. Robbie asked him to move out at 4 o'clock one morning, after she woke up to find him passed out, fully dressed, with nearly all the lights on throughout the house, and all the doors unlocked and wide open. Then, in August 1992, the medication cost him his job. He had passed out at work early that year, and was taken by the department to a rehabilitation hospital, where he stayed for 30 days. A few months later, he was thought to be slurring his words at work, and, rather than take a drug test, he quit. "It was either quit or be fired," his mother says. "The rumor was that they were going to get rid of him one way or the other."
Yvonne's weary eyes flash at the suggestion that her son was addicted to drugs. Robbie, less angrily, but equally adamantly, says she doesn't think so either. "He wasn't a drug abuser, he just had those migraines," Yvonne says. "If he had something he could take, he would take it."
"The fire department felt he was abusing his drugs, which he wasn't," Robbie says. "He was just trying to find help with his migraines. And, I think, when he was taking that stuff, it would relax his mind and maybe he wouldn't think about that stuff that was bothering him."
Shortly before losing his job, O'Donnell moved 20 miles east of Midland, to Stanton, to live with his mother and stepfather, who raise cattle out there. If his moments of fame had given him visions of a grand future, they probably did not include this. What was once red paint on the ranch house is now blistered by age and wind. Beside the front door are a collection of steer skulls, bleached chalk white by the sun. Directions to the house give an idea of its remoteness: "Make a left at the stop sign," Yvonne says. "Drive 15 miles to the next stop sign. Then, in about a mile, we're the only house on the right."
For a year, he sent resumes to fire departments all over Texas. Four dozen of them. Included on those resumes was a list of the awards he had won because he rescued Jessica McClure. "He never heard back from a one of 'em," Yvonne says.
In the summer of 1993, he took a job with the Texas prison system in Huntsville, driving prisoners back and forth from the hospital. Christmas Eve he took too many pills, his mother says, and called home, almost too drugged to speak. She called the Huntsville police department, who broke into his apartment and took him to another rehabilitation hospital, where he remained for two days. Although he took some courses in an effort to become a drug counselor, he didn't work again until April of this year -- just days before he would kill himself -- when he began a training program with an asbestos-removal company in Lubbock.
He bought a new Ford pickup for the drives back and forth from Lubbock, a deep tan color, with a coppery stripe along the side. He seemed excited by the second chance. "He talked about how I would bring the boys up there for the weekend, and we could meet halfway and maybe have lunch or something," Robbie says. "It seemed like the bad stuff was in the past."
But then, on April 19, the past intruded onto the present. The inescapable scenes of the Oklahoma City rescue were eerily similar to the ones that, for years, had been filling O'Donnell's head. A race against time. Victims trapped in tight, unreachable spaces. Firefighters carrying wounded babies. He was watching television in his bedroom on the night of April 23, and he came into the living room, where Yvonne was folding the laundry, to ask her where she kept her shotgun shells. "He said he heard a snake out side," Yvonne says, "which is not unusual at our house." But a search of the yard with his stepfather found no sign of a snake. Yvonne went back to sorting the laundry, and Robert came out looking for the shotgun again. "It's O.K. where it's at," she told him. "There's no snake." Soon she carried his cleaned clothes into his room, and found him putting on his boots. The dog was growling, he told her, maybe at that snake. Yvonne opened the back door for him, to prove there was no rattler. Then she went to her own bedroom and went to sleep.
It was past midnight when she woke up and noticed that Robert's light was still on. When she went to turn it off, she saw he wasn't in his room. His new pickup was gone. The shotgun was gone. On the floor next to the coffee table were three pieces of paper, torn off a notepad, and laid out side by side. The first said, "No help from nobody but family," Yvonne says. "I didn't have to read the other two."
The family drove around all night, looking. It was the county sheriff's men along with Robert's younger brother who finally found him, at 8:30 the next morning, about 15 miles from his mother's home. He had pulled down a small ranch road, past the big stock tank, up into the mesquite trees, where he parked and shot himself in the mouth. Before he did, he took off the straw hat he always wore, the one his younger son loved, and wrote "To Chance" in black marker on the lining. It was a birthday present for his son, who would turn 11 the next month.
WHEN I FIRST HEARD OF Robert O'Donnell's death, the name was familiar, but I couldn't recall exactly which rescuer he was. Later, when I learned more of the details of his death, I was saddened by my first reaction. Here I was, one of the group of people whose attention was his goal and his curse, and I couldn't even place his name. Over the next few days, with the specter of Oklahoma City making every moment seem newly urgent, that sadness turned to a discomfort that came uncomfortably close to guilt. I learned long ago that to feel responsible for the aftermath of a story would make it impossible to do what I do. The new reality is that fame can come instantly to anyone, but, in the modern technological test tube, whether it creates a fizzle or an explosion depends upon the chemical with which it is mixed.
"I have a lot of people out there," said James Roberts, O'Donnell's fire chief, gesturing past the door of his airy office, where a photograph of himself with George Bush hangs on the wall over a single news clipping about the rescue. "I could line up 50 of them and I could tell you which ones would give you the interview and which ones would not. I could tell you which ones would seek out the publicity and which ones would not. Back in 1987, almost every day, I would give Robert O'Donnell a list of reporters who wanted to talk to him, and I'd give the same list to Steve Forbes. One of them would put it away and not take a second look at it. The other one would call every reporter on that list."
There were hundreds of men and women at the rescue. A handful of those lost their way. One never found it again. Not much of a toll, until you start to do the multiplication. In today's wired, cabled, satellite-linked world, with countless television stations and grand plans for countless more, there will be limitless lists like the ones James Roberts handed Robert O'Donnell. More news programs making more regular Joes into heroes, more talk shows needing an endless array of guests to revolve through their chairs, more and more lives to be fed to the insatiable machine. Thousands of people seeking the camera, or being sought by it. Some people will take it for the ephemera that it is, and, eventually go back to their lives. Others, like Robert O'Donnell, will try to, but fail.
Pensive for a moment, Chief Roberts lifts the latest copy of Fireman's Journal, with another familiar photograph on the cover -- a firefighter carrying the limp, bloodied body of 1-year-old Baylee Almon from the wreckage of the Federal building in Oklahoma City. The kind of hero O'Donnell wanted to go to Oklahoma to be. He stabs at the picture with his index finger. "I could tell him a thing or two," he says. "Boy, could I tell him."
There is a new fence around the backyard that made Midland famous, one that is more difficult to peer over, because people do still come to peer. Until recently, maps to the site were available to tourists at the front desk of the downtown Hilton. Cissy's sister moved out of the neighborhood years ago, and the house, worth about $23,000, has had three owners since then.
The infamous well is still there, of course, capped with its permanent message of victory and love. But the lush circle of chrysanthemums died years ago, says Maxine Sprague, who lived next door during the rescue, and still lives there now. "Nobody took to watering them," she says. The redbud tree was cut down sometime after that, also dead from thirst. All that remains is a sinkhole of parched dirt, dotted with a few brownish weeds.
There was no article about Robert O'Donnell's death in his hometown newspaper. There was only a longer-than-average death notice on the obituary page, giving a brief sketch of his life and listing the time and place of the funeral. "We didn't do much on it," said Gary Ott, managing editor of The Midland Reporter-Telegram, as he guided me toward the paper's McClure files.
"I didn't think it was big news," Ott explained. "What did he have to be depressed about? I could see if he found her down there dead, and he was haunted by that the rest of his life. But this was a success."
Hundreds of people came to the funeral. Some were men who used to consider one another friends, but who had grown apart since the battle over the movie rights. Steve Forbes was a pallbearer. Cissy was there with her father, and Chip came with his new wife.
As she walked back to her car, Robbie noticed a magazine photographer standing a distance away from the gravesite, taking pictures with a zoom lens. "Why do they have to be here now?" she said, loud enough to be heard by the photographer. "That's what started it all for Robert in the first place."
"Ma'am," said the photographer, who was now within arm's distance, "I'm just here doing my job." Then she hitched her camera onto her shoulder, and turned to walk away. With an anger Robbie didn't realize she felt, she shoved the photographer hard enough to make her stumble forward. It felt good, she said.

HEADLINE: POP VIEW;
Wartime Dreams Revisited

BYLINE: By Stephen Holden 

 BODY:
WHAT TERM COULD BE more oxymoronic than "wartime nostalgia"? Does anyone really want a return to the days of Hitler, Hiroshima and Auschwitz? Yet in America, where no bombs fell and no storm troopers landed during World War II, Hollywood and Tin Pan Alley created a seductive wartime dream world of heroics and hearts and flowers that grows more appealing as the decades slip away.
Fifty years after the end of the World War II, the music that wafted through our national dream life in the early 1940's is regarded by many as the country's finest pop moment. Nostalgia for the 40's dates back to the early 1970's when Bette Midler scored a top 10 single with "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy," a 1941 Andrews Sisters hit. More recently, cabaret singers like Maureen McGovern, Andrea Marcovicci and Mary Cleere Haran have devoted entire programs to the 1940's, and Barry Manilow has recorded an album of big-band standards. Harry Connick Jr. presents himself as a born-in-New-Orleans reincarnation of Frank Sinatra and Dick Haymes. 
 Discussing his passion for 40's pop, Mr. Connick has used words like "clean" to describe its charm. He doesn't just mean its lack of sexual explicitness but its simplicity, integrity and upbeat attitude.
When America declared war on Japan in 1941, the swing era was already in full flower, with the most popular band, the Glenn Miller Orchestra, defining the optimum musical balance between the visceral and the romantic.
As America went to war, Irving Berlin's "White Christmas," crooned by Bing Crosby in a voice rich with reassurance and faith, projected a Currier and Ives vision of a pristine, snow-christened America to soldiers abroad and their loved ones at home. Crosby, who was 40 when Pearl Harbor was bombed, reigned as the vocal embodiment of American benevolence, while Mr. Sinatra, who was 13 1/2 years younger, brought a new current of erotic tenderness and vulnerability into pop singing. Hits like "I Dream of You," "If You Are But a Dream," "Dream" and "Put Your Dreams Away" were sugarcoated valentines counseling patience and delayed gratification to the wives and girlfriends of American soldiers.
Few sounds are more compellingly wistful than the youthful Sinatra's ardent murmurings. Tomorrow, a three-night celebration of the singer's music will begin with Michael Feinstein singing "Night and Day," Mr. Sinatra's first hit after leaving the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra. In that historic recording, Axel Stordahl's exquisite orchestration, which brought the harmonic vocabulary of Puccini and Rachmaninoff into the pop arena, defined Mr. Sinatra's war-years sound.
Just as they are today, pop music's sound, structure and technology during the war years were a populist esthetic mirror of their time and place. With the birth of swing in the late 1930's, American pop achieved a blend of sophistication and utopian optimisim that prevailed for nearly a decade. But if the ascendance of swing expressed a remarkable unanimity of spirit in America, that communal feeling coincided with shared adversity: a Depression followed by a world war.
The music of the early-40's may have been better made and more wholesome than much of today's pop, but the social and economic climate was in many ways harsher. The standard of living was much lower, and individual opportunities for self-fulfillment were relatively limited. Feminism had subsided after women won the vote in 1920, the civil rights and gay liberation movements were still years away, and there was little in the way of teen-age culture.
IN THIS PURITANICAL CLI-
mate, the more pop-oriented swing bands like those of Glenn Miller and the Dorsey brothers made music that presented the ensemble as a model community ruled by a strong (often dictatorial) male leader surrounded by deferential henchmen and largely anonymous instrumentalists. Although technical expertise within one's assigned role was respected, teamwork was valued above everything, and obedience to authority obligatory.
While the voices of leading swing band vocalists like Bob Eberly, Ray Eberle, Tex Beneke, Marion Hutton and Helen O'Connell had their distinctive traits, they were ultimately homogenous with the ensemble. Their rhythmic and timbral inflections and freedom of interpretative expression were limited by rigid, preset musical formats.
The smoothness of the ensemble blend reflected an unquestioned belief in social decorum, in being "nice," at all costs. The band arrangements emphasized neat, orderly patterns and a group harmony that was emotional as well as musical. Among vocal groups like the Pied Pipers, the Modernaires and the Andrews Sisters, individual styles were subordinated to a scrupulously homogenized sound, accented by synchronized movements and invariably cheery smiles. This team spirit mirrored a society in which it was assumed that every able-bodied man would gladly serve his country or risk social ostracism.
V.J. Day, on Aug. 15, 1945, burst the bubble. Within the next year and a half, eight of the country's most popular swing bands, including those of Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey had broken up. (Glenn Miller had died in December 1944 when his plane was lost over the English Channel.) Led by Mr. Sinatra, the era of the model community gave way to the era of the model singer. The reign of the genteel pop crooner ended with the arrival of Elvis Presley and the comeback of Mr. Sinatra, who had reinvented himself as the new king of swing.
In the more sophisticated swing revival that Mr. Sinatra oversaw, the singer ruled, with the band arrangements custom-made to suit his moods. Although obedience to the leader was still necessary, an aura of "niceness" was no longer a requirement.
Cooperation, teamwork and an enforced civility had brought America out of the Depression and enabled the country to triumph in a world war that almost everyone agreed had been worth fighting. It was time for an explosion of individual voices.

HEADLINE: THEATER: UP AND COMING -- Caroline Seymour;
'A Difficult Peg to Fit' Finds Her Place in New York

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
AS JEAN, THE ACCOMMODATING but deeply anguished woman at the center of Mike Leigh's ensemble drama, "Ecstasy," Caroline Seymour is the embodiment of the wan, economically enslaved British working class, circa 1979. Living in a squalid, one-room flat in north London, working at a gas station, Jean drinks, smokes, has semi-consensual sex with a galoot she hardly knows and lies to herself and to her equally trapped friends that life is bearable. It is well into the second act before she lets slip a fantasy.
"My character says, 'I want to go to America,' " Ms. Seymour said in an interview on the set at the Judith Anderson Theater on West 42d Street, where the play has just reopened after a move. "And every night I think, 'Bloody 'ell, I made it! This girl didn't.' " 
 Ms. Seymour, who is 29, arrived in New York from England during Christmas week of 1992. Married to an American, Josh Cheuse, a photographer of rock-and-roll bands, she remains unrepentantly British, speaking in the accent and vernacular of her working-class roots, even as she wholeheartedly embraces New York.
In an age of diversity on the New York stage, she is an unusual ethnic presence. Pale-skinned, even sallow, very thin, shy in demeanor but earthy in speech, she is from Essex, a working-class area northeast of London. She was raised by her mother, a nurse, and, from the age of 12, a stepfather, a research scientist.
"I think I wanted to be a lawyer, but it was too much work," she said, a little hazy on how she became interested in theater. "I always enjoyed playing the fool. I kind of dabbled around from the age of 16." She went to Cambridge University, where, with a friend, Abigail Morris, now the artistic director of Soho Poly, a small company in London, she founded Trouble and Strife, a women's theater group (the name is cockney slang for wife).
"The two of us were very disgruntled with the fact that boys from private schools seemed to control everything in Cambridge," she said, describing Trouble and Strife as their revenge. One of her plays written there, "Now and at the Hour of Our Death," about a prisoners' protest in Northern Ireland, was performed at the Irish Arts Center in New York in 1989.
"I'm a difficult peg to fit in any hole," she said. "That's why I came to America. You can define yourself so much more easily here. In England, it's difficult being educated and coming from an ordinary background. People in England are so aware of accents, of what people wear. And it doesn't seem to get better. Americans are less hung up on class."
"Ecstasy," was written by Mr. Leigh (who is better known for his films "Life Is Sweet" and "Naked") in 1979 and performed in London. But it did not have its American premiere until it opened earlier this year at the John Houseman Studio Theater, under the direction of Scott Elliott.
Mr. Elliott, the founder and artistic director of the New Group, which produced the play, had never heard of Ms. Seymour before she was sent to audition by a casting director, and had already decided to hire someone else. "But as soon as Caroline opened her mouth, I knew," Mr. Elliott said.
"There isn't a false move or a false note in any of these performances," Margo Jefferson wrote in The Times, about the six member cast that includes Jared Harris and Patrick Fitzgerald.
The highly favorable reviews of "Ecstasy," Ms. Seymour said, have had a salubrious effect on her career and "there are things in the pipeline." But a regular gig does take up her time: "I'm like, man, where's my social life? I can't go out any more. Blimey!"

To the Editor:
In his article "Americans in a Land of Opportunity: Europe" [July 2], Alan Riding neglects to explain why young American writers and painters no longer go to Europe to develop as artists. Besides the growing insularity of Americans in general, surely the main reason for this is economic, i.e., the weak dollar. 
 When I went to Paris in 1948 to write a book, I lived for $75 a month, eating all my meals in restaurants and going to the opera every week. It was the biggest bargain of my generation, and artists and writers particularly took full advantage of the situation.

HEADLINE: Q and A

BYLINE: By TERENCE NEILAN

 BODY:

Passage to Poland
 Q. I will be visiting the Masurian region of Poland (former East Prussia) by late August and would like to spend a few days in a town called Elk, formerly Lyck. Are there any hotels or other tourist facilities there? And how can I get there from Warsaw? -- George E. Caspary, Tallahassee, Fla. 
 A. The scene of intense military action in both world wars, Elk is set on a small lake that in the 14th century was the site of a castle established by the Teutonic Knights. The castle has been partially reconstructed, although nothing of the original remains.
In World War I the town, known by its German name of Lyck, was the scene of the battle of Masurian Lakes in February 1915. In World War II the town was about 50 percent destroyed. After the war its German population was evacuated and it became part of Bialystok Province in northeast Poland.
The town, which is 60 miles northwest of Bialystok and about 150 miles north of Warsaw, has only a few hotels but, curiously, two state-run tourist offices.
In the center of town is the Hotel Zodiak, 1 Kajki Street, (4822 87) 102491. A single or double room with a private bathroom is $14, calculated at 2.34 new zlotys to the dollar.
In Szeligi, just outside near Elk, the Hotel Gryfia Mazur, (4822 87) 103709, charges $19 for a single or double room.
For a three-star experience visit the lake at Chelchy, about 10 miles from Elk, and the Lega Inn, (4822 87) 104443. A single costs $42 and a double $47, both with breakfast. Chelchy can be reached by train from Elk. The round-trip fare is about $1 and a taxi from the Chelchy station to the Lega Inn is $9.
Trains from Warsaw Central Station, with a change in Bialystok, leave at 7:15 A.M., arriving in Elk at 11:23 A.M.; at 11:12 A.M., arriving at 3:24 P.M.; at 1:12 P.M., arriving at 5:22 P.M., and at 5:12 P.M., arriving at 9:27 P.M.
One-way ticket prices are $10 in first class and $7 in second.
For tourist information visit Orbis, on Mickiewicza Street, (4822 87) 103843, and P.T.T.K., on Armii Krajowej Street, (4822 87) 103819.
 
Motorbikes in Spain
 Q. My wife and I are planning a self-guided tour of Spain, particularly Valencia and the east coast, and we would like to travel by motorcycle.Can you give me a list of agencies that rent bikes for that purpose? -- Jon Gurney, New York, N.Y.
A. One of the following should fit the bill:
Eurosol, Playa Edificio Eurosol, 46700 Gandia, Valencia, Spain; (34 6) 284 02 52, no fax. The company rents everything from little Maxis and Derbis, both 49 cubic centimeters, to a 250-cubic-centimeter GN. Rates range from $19 a day for the Maxi, calculated at 120 pesetas to the dollar, to $49 a day for the GN ($33 a day for two or more days). Deposits range from $25 to $83 a day, depending on the size of the bike. Prices include 16 percent tax.
Motos Castro, 13 Calle Conde Duque, 13 Madrid, Spain; telephone and fax (34 1) 542 06 57. Vespino bikes, at 50, 75 and 250 cubic centimeters, are rented by the week from Monday to Friday. Rates range from $116 to $333 and deposits from $208 to $333. Prices do not include 16 percent tax.
Vanguard, 31 Calle Londres, Barcelona, Spain; (34 3) 439 38 80, fax (34 3) 410 82 71. A 50-cubic-centimeter Vespino is $25 a day for up to three days and $22.50 a day for more than three days. A 50-cubic-centimeter Honda Scoopy is $36 a day for up to three days and $22.50 a day for more than three days. A 600-cubic-centimeter Yamaha is $87.50 a day for up to three days and $83 a day for more than three days. Prices do not include 16 percent tax.
Crom Raid Adventure, 12 Avenida de la Alegria, 17310 Lloret de Mar, Spain; (34 972) 36 54 12, fax (34 972) 36 85 94. This company offers a variety of motorbikes and will put together a personalized itinerary that includes bike rental and either camping or hotel accommodations. Rates range from $1,166 a person a week, staying at campsites, to $1,958 a person for two weeks with hotel accommodations.
 
On the Road to Morocco
 Q. My husband and I are planning to spend a few days in Morocco and wonder if it is safe to travel there, especially in view of increasing fundamentalism in the Mediterranean area. -- Stephanie Kipperman, San Francisco
A. The fundamentalist fervor that has terrorized Algeria and severely dented Egypt's tourist industry has not shown itself in Morocco, according to both the State Department and the Moroccan Embassy in Washington.
And if you avoid such sparsely populated areas as the Western Sahara (not a difficult thing for most tourists to do) and keep an eye open for crime in the big cities, security should not be a major concern.
The Western Sahara, formerly Spanish Sahara, was long the site of armed conflict between the Polisario Front and Morocco on the issue of independence versus Moroccan sovereignty. Although a cease-fire is in place, the State Department says several violations have occurred and the area cannot be considered safe. In any event, travel to the area is restricted, so your chances of becoming embroiled in guerilla warfare are slim at best.
The country's urban areas have a moderately high crime rate, according to the State Department. Criminals have targeted foreigners for assaults, muggings, thefts, pickpocketings and scams of all kinds, the department said in its latest Consular Information Sheet on Morocco, issued on July 28, 1994.
Commonly reported crimes include falsifying credit-card vouchers and shipping inferior rugs as a substitute for the rugs bought by travelers. Harassment by unemployed Moroccans trying to be guides is a common problem. The department suggests travelers should hire only official tour guides through hotels and travel agencies.
 
Basic Black in Italy
 Q. I am taking a hosteling trip to Europe this summer, using a Eurailpass and taking no fancy clothes. Now I have received an invitation from a friend who is getting married in Italy. Will it be acceptable for me to wear a black dress, the only one I will carry? -- Heidi R. Card, New York, N.Y.
A. The consensus of opinion is that Italians have always considered black a very elegant color and that a black dress at a wedding is unlikely to be considered offensive or out of place. If it's a daytime ceremony, of course, you might suffer from the heat.
Take cheer from a spokeswoman at the Italian Embassy in Washington: she herself wore a black dress at a wedding in the far south of Italy and it was considered "perfectly acceptable," she says. Her fashion suggestion: take something to brighten the dress up a bit; maybe a scarf. TERENCE NEILAN

HEADLINE: Output Is Up; So Are Complaints on Quality

BYLINE: By LEONARD M. APCAR 

 BODY:
GENERAL MOTORS is selling every sport utility vehicle it can make, but a survey has found that soon after they find a home, they generate far more customer complaints than do new cars.
No wonder. In my test of Chevrolet's Blazer, Tahoe and Suburban, an ashtray fell out of the dash and a seat adjuster proved balky (Blazer), a power window came off its track (Tahoe), a plastic shield on a shoulder belt was not properly fastened and easily came off, screw covers were not secure, another seat was balky and a light under the hood flickered (Suburban). A colleague recently drove a Tahoe with a Chevrolet engineer and both agreed it had a noisy wiper motor. 
 J. D. Power & Associates, the Agoura Hills, Calif., firm that measures car buyers' satisfaction in the first 90 days of ownership, was surprised in May when it found that the quality of sport-utility vehicles and light trucks had slipped after years of improvement. "Most car segments have generally gotten better year over the year," said Dave Sargent, who directed the light-truck study. "This segment has gotten worse."
One reason may be that the Big Three are cranking out as many of these vehicles as they can, and quality may be taking a back seat to quantity. Also, these are large, complex vehicles that are more difficult to assemble, Mr. Sargent said.
He said he also suspected that many buyers of four-wheel-drive vehicles were simply unaccustomed to driving a truck. Indeed, another Power study found that buyers who had replaced a car with a full-sized truck or a big sport utility were less satisfied after a year than those who had previously owned a truck and bought a new one.
To help satisfy a surge in demand, G.M. acknowledges that it has increased production at the plant where Suburbans and Tahoes are made. But it does not believe quality has declined. In fact, the Suburban's level of complaints dropped from a 1994 J. D. Power study. "Yes, we're making a lot of vehicles, but the trend on the Suburban is in the right direction," said William J. O'Neill, a Chevrolet spokesman.
The Suburban's improvement in the complaint department gave it the best showing among full-sized sport utilities, slightly better than the Tahoe and its sibling, the GMC Yukon. But that is not saying much. Among all light trucks, full-sized sport utilities had the highest number of complaints after three months of ownership. And the number was far higher than the average for cars.
Among compact sport utilities, the Japanese led the way in initial impressions about quality. The Toyota 4Runner ranked highest, with the Nissan Pathfinder a distant No. 2. The Blazer was in the middle of the pack, alongside the Jeep Grand Cherokee.
None of this reflects the little irritations that turn a proud purchaser into a bitter owner. A 7-Eleven Big Gulp soda and a large squeeze bottle kept falling out of the cup holders on the Tahoe and Suburban's dash; there was a convenient button to pop open the rear window, but no warning light to tell you that you were driving with the window up, as I did inadvertently. Leaning into the truck and buckling in a child safety seat was a chore because of the Suburban's height and because the seat belt buckle was not on stiff stem and was difficult to find.
The Blazer's and Tahoe's spare tires are under the rear of the vehicle, which would mean crawling beneath the bumper in the event of a flat -- not a pleasant prospect when you are dressed up and running late. (When else do flats occur?)
But there was one thoughtful touch from Chevrolet. There is a mat and a pair of gloves to help keep you clean.

HEADLINE: Graham Greene, Bigot

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In his review of "Graham Greene: The Enemy Within" (July 2), Martin Stannard does his best to ridicule my criticisms of Greene's racism and other "moral failings," but Mr. Stannard's snide comments are no substitute for hard evidence. If he had given serious consideration to Greene's virulent anti-Semitism, he might have been less eager to mock my "politically correct" views. 
 By pretending that there is "very little" evidence behind my charges, he can scold me for launching a purely malicious assault on an "honorable" man, but nothing could be more malicious than Mr. Stannard's suppression of vital facts. Determined to smear me, he cannot acknowledge quotations like these from Greene's published work of the late 1930's: "that Semitic expression in the dark eyes above the hooked nose of being open to the commercial chance" ("Journey Without Maps"); "She deserved something better than a man named Furtstein . . . the domed Semitic forehead, the dark eyes above the rather gaudy tie" ("The Confidential Agent"); "How the financial crisis has improved English films! They have lost their tasteless Semitic opulence" (The Spectator).
These examples and many more are quoted in my book, but no discussion of Greene's anti-Semitism will be found in the official biography by Norman Sherry, which may help explain why Mr. Stannard urges readers to "chuck out" my book and buy Mr. Sherry's. Readers who want to ignore Greene's condemnation of "a large fat foreign Jew" will find that Mr. Sherry has helpfully provided a less damaging version involving merely "a large fat foreigner."

HEADLINE: If Your Thinking of Living In/Marble Hill;
A Bit of Manhattan in the Bronx

BYLINE: By JENNIFER KINGSON BLOOM 

 BODY:
YES, you have crossed the Harlem River and, yes, that is the northern tip of Manhattan island that you can see to the south. But as residents of Marble Hill are quick to point out, you are not in the Bronx: because of a 19th-century public works project that reshaped Manhattan island and severed its topmost land, Marble Hill is across the river and into what logically should be the Bronx.
It is a quirky and little-known neighborhood whose residents consider it a well-kept secret. Where else in Manhattan can you find a six-bedroom, three-story house on a quiet, tree-lined street with an attic, a basement, an enclosed front porch and a pretty facade for sale for $174,000? Or a three-family house with six bedrooms on an architecturally magnificent street with an asking price of $295,000? 
 Realtors link the low prices partly to the fact that the homes are aging and may need repairs, and partly to the eagerness of elderly sellers, most of whom are retiring to their homelands in the Caribbean. Or to the fact that part of the small neighborhood is a giant public housing project.
There are 4,000 households in Marble Hill, but only 135 private homes. The neighborhood is divided, both physically and socially: clustered near the commercial spine of Broadway are the Marble Hill Houses, an 11-building housing development, while up on "the hill," the former site of marble quarries, are the attractive turn-of-the-century houses that lend the neighborhood its cachet.
"It's a very small area and there's a strong sense of neighborhood community about it," said Susan Goldy, president of the Bronx Board of Realtors. "It has the advantage of lower prices than some of the surrounding communities, like Riverdale, and it's really a very affordable alternative to most of Manhattan."
Rental apartments are easy to come by, but houses do not come on the market with great regularity (at last count, there were only five listed with real estate brokers). Some homeowners and landlords choose only to advertise their properties in the classified section of the local paper, The Riverdale Press, and many transactions are done even more informally. "People just don't move out, and when they do they often sell their homes to their neighbors," said H. Michael Pichardo, executive director of the Marble Hill Neighborhood Improvement Corporation.
In what many residents view as a vote of confidence for Marble Hill, City Councilman Guillermo Linares bought a house on Van Corlear Place a year and a half ago. "We just went driving around and looking, and we saw this house that had a sale sign," Mr. Linares said. "We talked to the owner, we looked at the area, we fell in love with it, and we have been very happy."
Mr. Linares said he had traded a relatively cramped and high-rent apartment in Washington Heights for a house with a backyard, three kitchens, three bathrooms, a finished basement, three bedrooms and an attic.
BUT even Mr. Linares, who was elected to represent the neighborhood in 1991, had not been aware of its existence or its status as part of Manhattan before he began campaigning for office. "Even though I had lived in Washington Heights all this time, I thought that on the other side of the 225th Street Bridge was the beginning of the Bronx," he said.
The confusion is extremely common. While Marble Hill residents vote in Manhattan, do jury duty there, and are represented by Manhattan officials, their municipal services come from the Bronx. Their fight for recognition as a Manhattan neighborhood has persisted for years. As recently as this decade, neighbors turned out in force to oppose the move to change their telephone area code from 212 to 718 (they lost).
Marble Hill was lopped from Manhattan in 1895, when the northern channel of the Harlem River was redug to make way for a ship canal. Soon after, the Spuyten Duyvil Creek was filled in, cementing Marble Hill to the Bronx. The Greater New York Charter of 1897 designated Marble Hill as part of Manhattan but not of New York County, producing decades of headaches and squabbles. In 1939, the Bronx Borough President, James J. Lyons, tried unsuccessfully to annex the neighborhood to the Bronx.
In 1984, the matter was settled with some finality when Assemblyman J. Brian Murtaugh and State Senator Franz Leichter sponsored successful legislation declaring the neighborhood part of Manhattan. Mr. Murtaugh, an Inwood resident, is a longtime Marble Hill enthusiast. "It's just a very unusual niche," he said. "It is one of the most ethnically and economically mixed neighborhoods in New York City, and yet they operate like a small town."
A community council meets monthly. In a recent example of civic activism, Mr. Murtaugh pointed to a successful effort by the police and local residents to close a bodega at 228th Street and Marble Hill Avenue where drug sales had been noted.
Formerly an Irish and Jewish bastion, Marble Hill's population is now about 35 percent black and 55 percent Hispanic. In the 50's, the construction of the Marble Hill Houses brought about the radical demographic change. "The church that I served went from an all white to an all black congregation," recalled the Rev. William Tieck, who served for 31 years as the pastor of St. Stephen's United Methodist Church, an old wooden church at the southeast corner of Marble Hill Avenue and 228th Street that serves as a focal point for the community.
The neighborhood's population of middle-class Hispanic people has continued to grow in recent years, and the first Asians have begun moving in. While whites make up only about 8 percent of the population now, their influence still permeates the neighborhood: Broadway is still dotted with Irish pubs that draw a loyal local clientele, and just over the Kingsbridge border are a kosher bakery and an Orthodox synagogue.
The Rev. Leonis Quinlan, the current pastor of St. Stephen's, moved to Marble Hill in 1991 and said that its heavily Dominican flavor came as a pleasant surprise. "It is Dominican in its essence," he said. "You can smell the foods in the air, you can hear the music. You see older men playing dominos in front of the bodegas, and women in traditional dress."
During the day, the neighborhood is populated -- some would say inundated -- by students from John F. Kennedy High School, a school of 5,100 that was built in 1972 for a student body of 3,500. Residents complain that the students generate noise and litter and crowd the local markets at lunchtime. But aside from the annoyance factor, the school's multiracial student body has caused no racial tensions.
"You don't have racial problems here -- there are no bias crimes," Mr. Pichardo of the neighborhood group said. "Show me another neighborhood in the city with this racial composition, this mix, where people get along." Relations are somewhat less harmonious between homeowners and residents of the housing projects.
UPHILL from the boxy housing projects is a cluster of attractive homes, many of them fixer-uppers. And some multifamily dwellings, like the one for sale at 121-123 West 227th Street, are already occupied by tenants with leases, compounding the difficulty of finding a property.
John Brown, an agent with the Robert E. Hill agency in Kingsbridge, said his office received few inquiries about Marble Hill. "At times we thought that the Marble Hill area was going to experience a renaissance, because of its interesting housing stock and its proximity to Manhattan, but it never did," he said.
Other than a few new health-food stores, there are still no signs that Marble Hill or its environs are going upscale. Yet fans of the neighborhood cite the convenience of its shopping district on Broadway, where mid-price retail stores and supermarkets abound.
Most of the shops lie over the Bronx border, but within easy walking distance. Residents also point with pride to the recently built Allen Pavilion, a community hospital operated by Columbia-Presbyterian hospital just across the river in Inwood. And they note the abundance of transportation options: both Metro-North and the IRT have stations in Marble Hill, numerous express buses run from Broadway and 230th Street to midtown Manhattan, and highways are close by.
On the down side, the neighborhood has no movie theaters, and dining options are limited to pubs and the Riverdale Diner. The noise from the elevated subway line is an annoyance to some residents, and the area's public schools are crowded (there are a few parochial schools just outside of Marble Hill). And, as with any urban area, the neighborhood does have its share of drug problems and blighted properties.
One neighborhood stalwart is Dr. Jeffrey L. Gurian, a dentist and comedy writer whose practice lies across the street from St. Stephen's. Through his career as a professional comedian, he has lured various celebrities to his office for dental work. "When they see the private homes and the trees, they all say it's much nicer than they ever expected," Dr. Gurian said.
On the flip side, Dr. Gurian said, the neighbors are equally astonished by some of his clients. When the actor Charlie Sheen and his bodyguard drove to the office in a stretch limousine, the police came over to check out the situation. "They don't expect to see a big stretch limo up here," Dr. Gurian said.

SEPARATE BUT EQUAL: It was the routine task of selecting a jury for a trial that provoked a legal settlement of dispute over whether Marble Hill is part of Manhattan or the Bronx. In May, 1984, State Supreme Court Judge Peter J. McQuillan ruled that a Marble Hill woman could not sit on a jury in a New York County murder case, holding that legislative boundaries for the borough and the county were defined differently and that the woman was a Bronx County resident. Judge McQuillan's decision alarmed Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morganthau, who feared it would enable criminal convictions to be challenged if a Marble Hill resident were convicted of a crime in the wrong jurisdiction or if a Marble Hill resident had sat on a jury in the wrong county. To end the confusion, Assemblyman J. Brian Murtaugh and State Senator Franz Leichter sponsored legislation declaring Marble Hill "part of the Island of Manhattan . . . regardless of the construction of the Harlem Ship Canal." The legislation passed, its sole opposition coming from a handful of Bronx legislators.

HEADLINE: On Electronic Highway, Manhattan Is A Destination

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
YOU can't call it the software industry anymore, because its products go well beyond computer programs. Multimedia is too all-encompassing, while information technology seems to exclude entertainment products. Interactive technology probably comes closest, at least until some newly-coined expression -- infoware is a recent one -- takes hold.
But whatever this amorphous industry is called, the people who form its creative backbone -- the ones who dream up the steady stream of products flitting across the internet, powering business computers, starring in interactive television entertainment and fueling the insatiable lust for video games -- are flocking to this city. 
 Ask them why and, just like Willie Sutton robbed banks "because that's where the money is," they answer simply, "that's where the people are."
"The venture capitalists are here, Bell Labs is near here, the financial companies who were the earliest customers are here, the entertainment companies who are the latest customers are here," said Gail Kleinberg Koch, president of C/A/S Comsearch, an executive recruiting firm specializing in the on-line information and telecommunications industries. "And this is a young person's business, and the young people are here, too."
Nor are they content to trade ideas across the internet. "That creative process, where people sit around a room jamming out an idea, is invaluable to get a product's soul," said Michele A. DiLorenzo, president of Viacom New Media.
The influx represents a wonderful irony for the New York real estate industry, and a compound one at that. Interactive technology made it possible for Wall Street firms to ship their backoffice operations to New Jersey, for employees to telecommute from anywhere, for video conferences to replace farflung meetings, for companies to slash the amount of office space they need.
And that same convergence of computers, telephones and telecommunications fed industry's demand for huge floor plates, cable television hookups, huge amounts of electricity and air-conditioning, raised floors and dropped ceilings, the myriad architectural and infrastructure features whose lack has caused businesses to spurn any number of once-prestigious office buildings.
And now, the interactive technology companies are doing exactly what their products had apparently eliminated a need for: Clustering in New York so they can be with their customers, their suppliers and, yes, with each other. And, they are clustering in funky older buildings in SoHo and Midtown South that are vacant in good part because interactive technology rendered them obsolete.
"There's been this huge bubbling of companies south of 23d Street, and the growth is feeding on itself," said Carl Weisbrod, head of the Alliance for Downtown Manhattan, which hopes to lure many of the companies even further south, to the space-rich financial district. "The companies are attracted by the huge amount of creative talent, and the talented people are attracted by the large number of prospective employers."
Indeed, San Francisco's Silicon Alley and Boston's Route 128 still share a bicoastal lock on the production and operations end of the business, but as Red Burns, chair of the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, put it, "They make machines in Silicon Valley, and machines do not have ideas, any more than a pen can write a novel."
By the same token, Hollywood remains the movie capital of the world, but when movies and other forms of old media are repackaged and sent forth onto the electronic highways, the entrance to those highways increasingly is here. Viacom New Media and Time Warner Interactive are here, the Sega Channel is here, Delphi Internet Services is here, and Prodigy, another huge on-line service, is coming to Manhattan soon.
"There's a tremendous concentration of entertainment software publishers in New York, so it follows that a whole subculture would grow up around them," said Douglas Lowenstein, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Interactive Digital Software Association.
And, face it -- the atmosphere is just, well, different in New York. "New York and San Francisco are the axes around which the creative world revolves, but I'm just too rambunctious for the West Coast," said Daniel Stechow, who started Brainstorm Interactive, a multimedia company, in Manhattan least year. Jonathan Herbert, the head of Computer Illustration, which makes computer generated images for commercials, is even more adamant: "I get narcolepsy whenever I leave this town," he said.
For landlords, the onslaught of the interactive technology companies is a mixed blessing. They generally rent just a few thousand feet -- yet because their staffs work odd hours, they require 7-day, 24-hour services and power. And small companies are known for high failure rates and shaky credit ratings.
"New York's future lies in high-tech brainpower, but the brainpower companies are so high-risk and use so little space that the buildings we represent are not targeting them yet," said David M. Gialanella, a senior managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
But the interactive-technology companies can be a godsend to those landlords with outmoded or vacant buildings. "Many of the deals are small, but they soon add up," said Ira Schuman, an executive vice president of the Julien J. Studley brokerage.
Moreover, creative tenants simply are not that demanding. "These companies don't need redundancy, they don't need raised floors, they don't need uninterrupted power service," said Adam E. Krupp, senior vice president of CS Partners, a technology real estate consulting group in Jersey City.
Nor do they need luxury, which makes them particularly tasty prospects for owners of downscale buildings. "These are nontraditional people with nontraditional work habits, and if the air-conditioning isn't working, they'll open a window," said David W. Levinson, executive managing director of the Edward S. Gordon real estate company.
NOT surprisingly, many landlords are actively pursuing even the smallest and newest companies. Rudin Management just offered its vacant building at 55 Broad Street, the former home of Drexel Burnham Lambert, as an industry building for high-tech firms. Manhattan Community College donated 5,000 square feet of space at 30 Broadway for an incubator for five small companies. The Sylvan Lawrence Company, the new leasing agents for 665 Broadway, at Bond Street, are marketing the newly renovated building as "located in Manhattan's Silicon Alley, a well-known location for technology companies."
In the first half of this year Newmark Realty leased close to 190,000 square feet to interactive technology firms in its buildings. "A lot of them cannot pay a great deal in rent, but my gut tells me they represent a market that is ready to crystallize," said Barry Gosin, Newmark's president.
Audrey Novoa's instincts tell her the same thing. Ms. Novoa, a Williams Real Estate managing director, handles leasing at 60 Hudson Street, the telecommunications industry building at Thomas Street. She is actively courting smaller telecommunications-oriented tenants. "So if they have lousy credit we'll rent them four walls, with minimum buildout," she said.
Of course, the handful of well-established interactive-technology companies offer landlords the best of all worlds. Not surprisingly, many are trying to snag Prodigy. The on-line service is based in White Plains, but plans to move about 50 creative people to Manhattan, probably to SoHo. Its new chief executive, Edward Bennett, lives here, but Carol A. Wallace, Prodigy's spokeswoman, insists that is not the reason for the move.
"This is a young industry that has to focus on creating the best content," Ms. Wallace said. "Extra dollars for Manhattan rents are insignificant compared to access to the people who can do this."
Delphi is closing its Cambridge, Mass., headquarters for similar reasons. It is moving the operations side of its business to Lowell, Mass., near Route 128. Creative types are going into a big open-office layout at 620 Avenue of the Americas, the Ladies' Mile building between 18th and 19th Streets that houses Bed, Bath & Beyond.
"We offered a variety of metropolitan locations, but they quickly narrowed in on Manhattan," said Mr. Levinson, who found Delphi its 75,000 square foot space.
"Our products," explained a Delphi spokeswoman, "may build communities that are not restricted by geographic boundaries, but our industry is in that early stage where you have to build relationships."
Even companies that are happily based elsewhere are opening outposts here. Sega, the video-game giant, has no plans to move from Redwood City, Calif., but its new Sega Channel, which offers video games via cable television, is here. "The cable operators are in New York, and that's who we sell to," said Thomas J. Kalinske, Sega's chief executive.
Of course, some companies are in the vicinity purely by choice. GT Interactive Software, the publisher of the hugely successful "Doom" video game, operates out of 16 East 40th Street because its owners own the building. "The bottom line is, we are all from New York and we stayed here," said Ron Chaimowitz, the chief executive.
Long Island has held onto major interactive technology players for the same reason. Acclaim, which publishes the equally successful "Mortal Kombat" video game, started in Oyster Bay, L.I., and recently expanded to nearby Glen Cove. Computer Associates, the huge business software producer, has moved several times, but always within an easy commute of Garden City, where Charles Wong started the company.
"Their main concern has always been to be near where the key people lived," said August A. DiRenzo, a Cushman & Wakefield vice chairman who has been the company's broker for more than a decade.
NOT surprisingly, New York City officials and landlords, particularly those in beleaguered lower Manhattan, are not content to be ruled by historic geography. Nor are they satisfied with the steady flow of interactive technology companies to New York.
They cite studies that show that many of the smallest firms still shun New York because of high taxes and rents, difficulty getting loans, and equal difficulty finding a highly skilled work force. The result, they say, is that as fast as the interactive-technology industry is growing in New York, it is still growing faster elsewhere.
City Hall is looking for ways to catch up. In January Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced the NYC Discovery Fund, a venture-capital fund with mixed public and private funding, aimed at developing high-technology industries. Consolidated Edison and Brooklyn Union Gas have each committed $5 million to the fund.
"This is a chance to help an industry that can replace the manufacturers that have left," said Carol M. Conflato, a section manager of economic development for Con Ed.
The city and several private companies are also trying to find cheap places for that industry to grow. One frontrunner: a new New York Information Technology Center at 55 Broad Street. Originally the Center was slated for half of the 400,000 square foot building, but officials say that interest from potential tenants has been high enough to warrant dedicating the entire building.
"The overriding intent is to create an incubator, a facility where these companies can come together to do their creative work," said Carl G. Symon, general manager of the northeastern area for I.B.M.-North America, which is providing design help for the building.
The Center, originally slated for 11 Broadway, switched over to the Rudin building when Mel Schnell, the co-owner of 11 Broadway who had wanted the center, died, and Moses Marx, the partner who had preferred sticking to conventional rentals, pulled out of the deal.
The Rudins say they will pump more than $15 million into the building, to put in assorted technological bells and whistles, including enhanced electric power systems and four types of telecommunications systems -- voice-grade copper wire, which telephones run on; high-speed wire, which provides speedier access to the Internet; single mode fiberoptics, which can transmit huge volumes of data, like that generated by traders, at the speed of light; and multimode fiberoptics, which is capable of transmitting even denser volumes of data, such as full-motion video and music, at light speed.
"We want this to be a 'plug-and-play' place, where any tenant can inexpensively hook into the Internet," said William C. Rudin, Rudin Management's president.
The center will hold lobby trade shows, provide conference facilities, perhaps even offer purchasing and marketing services so that the small tenants can get the volume discounts usually reserved for big companies. And it will provide all of this at annual per-square-foot rents in the mid-teens.
"These companies are taking their first leaps from lofts and backyards and garages into real office space," said Mr. Weisbrod. "If we charged even $20 a foot, it could be a real problem."
Jonathan and Wesley Rudes, the two brothers in charge of leasing the center, say they have been premarketing it for two years, and have a list of 500 tenants who have expressed interest.
But they concede that the new center has some hard-to-overcome negatives. It is in the kind of glass-box building that many creative types despise. And it is in a neighborhood that still rolls up its sidewalks at night and on weekends. Prodigy, for one, is not even considering locating in lower Manhattan. "We want an older building with a lot of character, in a community that feels alive at any time of day or night," Ms. Wallace said.
THE Rudes brothers acknowledge the problems. "These companies want open spaces with hardwood floors and high ceilings and lots of light and color," said Wes Rudes. He hopes to use paint, dropped ceilings, a "high-tech lobby" and other cosmetic changes to "make this glass and steel place look funky and functional."
He also hopes that a few high-profile tenants will help create a critical mass. I.B.M. and Nynex, for example, both may put research and development facilities in the building, and may provide reduced-rate equipment for tenants. And the New York New Media Association, which Brian T. Horey, a local venture capitalist, started in October, also plans to move down.
That could help generate activity, too. The association, which already has close to 1,300 members, runs several monthly seminars and networking events, ranging from guided tours of the Internet to primers on interactive music to dance parties at the Roxy.
"Our association can bring a community together that is now fragmented in a lot of different pockets," Mr. Horey said.
Mr. Horey meant it metaphorically, but several large New York corporations, including Nynex, Con Ed and I.B.M., have forged an alliance to turn 55 Broad into the epicenter of a much wider physical community. Con Ed, for example, has hired an architect to study whether four buildings -- 55, 60, 67 and 70 Broad Street, which together encompass 2.5 million square feet -- could work together as a high-tech center. The idea is to have the different owners share emergency power systems and other costly technologies, as well as coordinate amenities: If one puts in a deli downstairs, the other should put in a dry cleaner, the third a restaurant, and so forth.
If that proves feasible, it might go a long way to overcoming the neighborhood's isolation. And that, in turn, could create the type of technology enclave in lower Manhattan that Mr. Weisbrod, for one, believes can restore the neighborhood to the boom days it once had.
"It is a gamble, but a calculated gamble," Mr. Weisbrod said. "I think it will be a super home run."

HEADLINE: ROAD AND RAIL;
Truckers Carve a New Route, Crowding a Two-Lane Road

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

DATELINE: EAST AMWELL TOWNSHIP

 BODY:
It seemed like some kind of long-distance magic trick. In November 1993, transportation officials cut the ribbon on the last link of Interstate 287 in northern Passaic County. Fifty miles away, on the other side of the state, tractor-trailers began to inundate a two-lane road.
But what happened is not really much of a mystery. The completion of I-287 created a toll-free alternative to the New Jersey Turnpike for north- and southbound interstate truckers, a route that includes a nine-mile stretch of Route 31 in Hunterdon and Mercer Counties. The 287 link, coupled with several more recent road projects authorized by the state, more than tripled truck traffic along the two-lane portion of Route 31 within 18 months, from 900 trucks a weekday to more than 3,000 a day in March. 
 All this without any improvements to the piece of road itself, a hilly, curvy stretch that winds through a patchwork of houses, cornfields, small businesses and woods in East Amwell and Hopewell Townships.
The resulting mess, residents and local officials say, shows what happens when state planners upgrade some parts of a road system but not others: three fatal accidents involving trucks in the last four months; lines of trucks that make a left turn next to impossible; trucks going too slow and boxing in cars; entire fleets giving the road the appearance of a convoy.
dd "What we've got," said John Mack, an East Amwell Township Committeeman, "is a death-causing piece of public policy that really proves the bureaucrats are sound asleep at the wheel."
State officials acknowledge that the truck congestion is a problem but have no proposals on the table to reduce it, though they do plan to reconfigure some intersections. The Department of Transportation gave up a campaign to turn the stretch into a four-lane divided highway years ago in the face of opposition from residents who feared that the widening would simply attract more traffic.
"What we're looking at at this point is potential speed limit reductions, stepped-up truck safety and that is it," said Jeff Lamm, a spokesman for the Transportation Department.
Before the completion of I-287, the usual route through New Jersey for trucks coming up from Delaware and points south was to cross at the Delaware Memorial Bridge, head north on some combination of the turnpike and I-295, and take the George Washington Bridge into New York.
Now trucks can stay on I-95 through Pennsylvania, cross into New Jersey north of Trenton, take Route 31 to 202 near Flemington and ride I-287 from Somerville up to New York State, crossing the Hudson at the Tappan Zee Bridge.
The route can save more than $61 a round trip, and allows New England-bound truckers to bypass the terror-inducing Cross Bronx Expressway without losing any time.
I-287 isn't the only thing tempting 18-wheelers westward. The treacherous Somerville Circle, where 202 meets I-287, was replaced this year with a system of high-speed flyovers, and workers completed several improvements around the capital collectively known as the Trenton Complex. A study by the Transportation Department predicted that the Trenton Complex would reduce truck traffic on Route 31 slightly. Instead, volume has jumped by a thousand trucks a day.
Nor is the congestion confined to Route 31. Route 206, which passes through Princeton as it links I-295 near Trenton to I-287, has also seen a jump in truck traffic. At a jammed regional meeting on the problem in Princeton on June 29, citizens complained that trucks were spilling onto residential streets, too.
Residents are quick to point out they're not the only losers. Though transportation officials note that truck traffic throughout the state has increased during the last two years of economic boom, most of the newcomers to Route 31 are trucks that used to take the turnpike for at least part of their trip. Even assuming that the average Route 31 trucker is skirting a very modest $7 in turnpike tolls (the fare from the Delaware Memorial Bridge to the George Washington is $20.80), the state is losing more than $5 million in toll revenue a year.
State Highway 31 is not a country lane. It is the biggest north-south road on the western side of the state, and it carries plenty of traffic between the suburban sprawl around Flemington and the Route 1 corridor from Princeton to Trenton.
But it is no limited-access throughway either. There are several dozen residential driveways along the stretch, many of them in the middle of curves. School buses still stop along its broad shoulders.
"D.O.T. talks about speed checks and checking brakes," said William E. Schluter, the State Senator whose district straddles Route 31, "but we're not talking about individual safety violations and carelessness as much as the vast numbers and the dominance of the road. It is very, very unsafe."
Mr. Mack, the East Amwell committeeman, and others have proposed banning trucks from the road, but such a move would mean the loss of Federal funds for a highway bypass in Flemington. Assemblywoman Shirley Turner has recommended cutting the tolls on the turnpike in half -- a proposal endorsed, not surprisingly, by the American Truckers Association -- but even then, the I-287 route would still be cheaper because of differences in bridge tolls.
Now, Mr. Mack said, even if the Transportation Department decided to make Route 31 a dual highway, it would take 12 years. Meanwhile, the trucks continue to barrel down the road.
"I would love to be able to wave a wand and keep trucks off there and have another North Jersey route, maybe in somebody else's district," Mr. Schluter said. "But the number of trucks seems like it's only going to increase as they seek that route that is faster, less costly and saner."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
The Layoff Business: How Popular Is It?

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON; Iver peterson is the Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: LAWRENCE

 BODY:
The school board here in suburban Trenton is talking about getting rid of its staff of school janitors and maintenance workers and replacing them with cheaper services from commercial cleaning companies, and thereby hangs a wider tale about what is going on in New Jersey these days as Governor Whitman's cuts in taxes and controls on state spending work their way down from the capital to the local level.
The district, prosperous and middle class in a state full of prosperous, middle class places, has seen its state aid reduced by hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time when enrollments are once again creeping upward. In earlier years, this pincer movement would have won a sympathetic ear from Trenton and from local taxpayers, who for a decade dutifully passed higher and higher school budgets while the Governor and Legislature down by the Delaware River, whether Republican or Democrat, also dutifully passed on higher and higher levels of state aid. 
 In the process, school boards like Lawrence's also generously began running up the wages and benefits of teachers and nonteachers alike until per-pupil school spending in New Jersey became the highest in the country.
The economic bust of 1990 put an end to the rising incomes and property values that fueled this spiral, but it took the rookie politician in the Governor's office, elected in 1993, to challenge the political culture that grew up around it.
For a while, a lot of people, especially Democrats, assumed hopefully that the Whitman phenomenon would unravel when local taxes began to rise as a result of cuts in state income taxes, the source of money earmarked by the constitution to offset local taxes. What they had not grasped was that ideas, like money, also percolate downward.
The Lawrence Board of Education got that message in April of last year when their proposed budget, with a 4 percent increase in spending, was rejected for the first time in years.
"One thing we learned is that the public has grown more sensitive to spending and taxes, absolutely," said Dennis Casale, president of the town Board of Education. "Another is that the state has put out a number of recommendations that make it clear that they intend to look at costs that do not go into the classroom, and that if they deem those costs to be excessive, those districts are going to be penalized."
Well, custodians are not classroom employees, the board reasoned, and like the Governor turning the operation of motor vehicle offices over to private contractors, the board began talking to private janitorial concerns. What they found was bad news for public employees: instead of the $15 an hour the board was paying custodians, private firms paid $8 or $9, amounting to savings of close to $500,000 a year for the district. This is a mouth-watering sum to school managers who are being squeezed by state cutbacks above and tax-averse voters below.
Like a lot of schools, Lawrence has already made cuts in sports programs, laid off some administrators, reduced library staffs, and now it looks as if it will be the custodians' turn to feel the inexorable logic of cost containment, although Mr. Casale said the board would help them get jobs with the private contractor, and transition payments to soften the loss of income for a while.
The Governor would no doubt agree with the Board's move. After all, she said last month, you can't expect government to support jobs for their own sake. "It's unfair to the taxpayers and its bad government," she said.
But if laying off workers is good politics, is it also good public policy? Richard Leone, a former Democratic state treasurer and fierce critic of Mrs. Whitman's program, is vehement.
"Institutions are not built on savings alone," he said in an interview. "Henry Ford recongnized that his workers had to make enough to be able to afford one of his cars. Bismarck recognized that there needed to be some level of social security or there would be unrest. Now we have a theory that if we lay off enough people we'll all be rich? I don't think so."
So far, New Jerseyans seem to be siding with the Governor on that debate, partly because they believe her when she says that cutting public spending will boost the economy. In the process, however, they should remember that a lot of the savings are being taken out of other people's paychecks.

HEADLINE: ROAD AND RAIL;
For Safety's Sake and Their Own, Towns Learn to Pamper Pedestrians

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
New Jersey municipalities used to be primarily concerned with moving traffic through town as quickly as possible. Now that concern is shifting -- from cars and trucks to people on foot.
By state law, motorists must yield to pedestrians in crosswalks. But unlike California, where drivers actually do yield -- and are universally berated if they don't -- New Jersey seldom enforces the law. 
 Now, as communities seek to revive aging downtowns or preserve thriving ones, more and more of them are looking for ways to pamper their pedestrians. In Mercer County, Princeton has added zebra-striped crosswalks, brick markings and signs to remind motorists that pedestrians, not motorists, have the right of way. Other towns and cities are adding midblock crosswalks and yield signs; making it easier to get to the bus or train; emphasizing pedestrian issues in planning documents; making downtown businesses more attractive and accessible.
"There's a whole movement to give the downtown back to the pedestrian," said Mayor Marvin Reed of Princeton. "The old-fashioned town where you can walk to places is certainly coming back into vogue."
Peter Calthorpe, owner of Calthorpe Associates, an urban design and architecture firm in San Francisco, says the same thing is happening in cities and towns across the country. "We need to develop places that are more community-oriented and that we have to move back to a more human-scale environment," he said. "Pedestrians are fundamental to that."
Because New Jersey is so densely populated, it is far more prone than most states to pedestrian accidents: they make up more than a fifth of all traffic deaths, compared to a nationwide average of 13 percent. And perhaps for that reason, New Jersey towns are among the pioneers in raising awareness of pedestrians.
"We're knocking them off left and right, and it's the No. 1 problem we have," said Col. Peter J. O'Hagan, director of the State Division of Highway Traffic Safety. "Pedestrian safety has to be done at the local level, and this is something that more towns are starting to realize."
Just ask Michael Gentile, a salesman for L & C Flashing Barricades of Canton, Mass., which makes the increasingly familiar yellow, red and white signs that say, "State Law: Stop for Pedestrians in Crosswalk."
"New Jersey is by far my biggest seller," said Mr. Gentile, who estimated that he has done business with 25 towns. "It's definitely been a pleasant surprise, because we never expected to expand to that area and we don't even have a salesman who deals with New Jersey."
Among L & C's recent customers was Leonia, which placed three such signs on Broad Avenue in June. That borough is also considering whether to form a pedestrian review committee to evaluate development projects and zoning changes, said Tom Toronto, a Leonia Councilman.
Similar signs have popped up in Somerville, Ridgewood and Maplewood. In Millburn, the signs have been put up every Friday since June 23 in front of the Farmers Market.
And the signs are only the easy part. South Orange plans to widen downtown sidewalks and pave its crosswalks with brick, and it is considering adding pedestrian islands on South Orange Avenue.
"Before, the popular myth was that highway funds were free, and so the tendency was to widen the road at the expense of the sidewalk," said Lawrence Houstoun, principal of the Atlantic Group, an urban development consulting firm in Cranbury that has been advising South Orange. "But downtown commerce is not a drive-through window; it's a park-once, move-around-on-foot kind of destination."
In West Orange, several ideas are on the table, according to Susan Berg, director of planning and development: denying requests to waive requirements for sidewalks of a certain width; rewriting the municipal master plan to accommodate pedestrians; requiring developers to prepare plans that include pedestrian access.
In Woodbridge, New Jersey Transit recently renovated a train station, complete with brick-paved crosswalks, historic lampposts and other touches to encourage walkers. In Plainfield, there are plans for a pedestrian-oriented commercial zone near the Netherwood rail station.
Some officials say such measures are all very well, but they warn that pedestrian safety is more than signs and crosswalks. They point out that one-third of the pedestrians killed in traffic accidents are walking drunk. "I think that the more these signs show up, the more pedestrians will have a false sense of security," said Anthony Parenti, president of the New Jersey Police Traffic Officers Association.
Even so, Mr. Parenti and others agree that this is as good a time as any to pay attention to pedestrians.
"Towns are spending a lot of time thinking about being livable, and quality is hot on the municipal agenda," said Chester P. Mattson, director of Bergen County's Department of Planning and Economic Development. "The idea that you have a town center through which you can walk is becoming very attractive to communities."

HEADLINE: HOUSING;
Crackdown on Illegal Housing Collides With a Tradition of Helping Others

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
Last December, fire raced through a crowded single-family house in Orange that had been illegally divided into at least three apartments. Fire officials are still not sure how many people were living there -- they say at least 17 -- but 9 died in the flames, their efforts to escape thwarted at least in part by the lack of fire exits.
Since that blaze, and another one three weeks later in nearby Irvington that killed 3 of the 18 inhabitants of a one-family house, officials in several communities have cracked down on illegal apartments and rooming houses. 
 Officials in Orange and East Orange say most people living in illegal apartments are immigrants, mostly Caribbean -- the victims of both fatal fires were from Haiti -- and that the effort to end overcrowding has pitted zoning and safety codes against cultural traditions of extended family.
"If you're from Haiti or the Dominican Republic," said Ronald Salahuddin, director of housing code enforcement for East Orange, "and someone you know is coming into the area and has no place to stay, what are you going to do? You invite them in, and before you know it you have all these people living in one apartment."
"A lot of these people are just not aware of the laws and regulations, that you just can't have four or five people living in one or two rooms," he said.
Though they are sympathetic, Mr. Salahuddin and other officials say they can't afford to risk lives. And so teams of inspectors have been dispatched to look for telltale signs of extra apartments carved out of basements, attics and other areas without permission of zoning boards -- drapes hung in cellar windows, extra mailboxes, new entrances, additional utility meters.
In six months of increased inspections, East Orange officials have found 250 illegal dwellings in a city of 73,000 people. Most of the offending owners eliminated the apartments, but 40 property owners ignored their summonses and wound up in court.
In Orange itself, James Slaughter, the director of planning and development, said efforts to get residents to notify officials of overcrowded buildings has netted 20 violators so far.
"We've essentially tried to encourage people to rat each other out," he said. "Citizens turning in other citizens."
Officials in Irvington have started taking out newspapers ads urging residents to file complaints when they know of illegal dwellings. And David Fuller, the township business administrator, says the municipal court is levying heavier fines against property owners who deliberately rent out illegal apartments. State law allows fines of up to $1,000 for illegal rental, with additional fines of up to $1,000 a day.
Haitian community leaders called overcrowding an unfortunate necessity.
"In some places there will always be more people living in a place than they should, and I think that has more to do with economics than anything else," said the Rev. Emmanes Doxy, president of the Great Commission Learning Center in East Orange, which offers services to Essex County's 10,000 Haitians.
Not all the property owners caught in the sweep were just trying to help out family members. East Orange shut down four unlicensed rooming houses, one of whose owners had squeezed nine families into a house meant for two.
"You have a variety of things," Mr. Salahuddin said. "You have those who aren't consciously trying to break the law, and then you have those that purposely break the law to make money."
State law forbids the creation of any new dwelling units without local approval. In addition, many municipalities -- including Orange and East Orange -- have minimum living space ordinances. Both cities require 150 square feet for the initial occupant and 100 more square feet for each additional occupant.
The effort to get rid of firetraps has been educational as well as punitive. The Orange Fire Department has given out 1,100 free smoke detectors this year, along with lessons on how to use them. East Orange and Orange officials have been distributing fire safety pamphlets printed in English, Spanish and Creole and have visited schools to teach children the basics of fire safety.
State officials say the demand for very inexpensive housing has risen in New Jersey cities as immigration, both legal and illegal, has soared. Many immigrants, for various reasons, do not qualify for public assistance or housing.
At the same time, the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, citing widespread violations, has closed down nearly half of the boarding houses in the state over the past decade.
"Some of them were illegal, some were substandard, and some of them were toilets," said Robert Friant, spokesman for the Department of Community Affairs.
Mr. Friant said rents at boarding houses, which typically provide meals or other services, run $400 to $450 a month, while rooming houses, which simply rent rooms, charge about $100 less. Currently, there are 1,538 licensed rooming houses in the state with 18,167 beds, and 277 boarding houses with 5,867 beds.
And what happens to a tenant who is forced out of illegal housing? If the building was condemned, the tenant could be eligible for up to $4,800 in state relocation grants over three years. If the building is not condemned, some towns provide emergency moving expenses, $500 in the case of East Orange.
Deborah Middleton, housing director at the nonprofit Isaiah House, East Orange's only shelter, said she did not know of any clients who had come to the shelter as a result of being evicted from an illegal apartment. And officials in both Oranges say most displaced tenants eventually legal housing.
"We're not cold with these people," Mr. Salahuddin said. "We give them something so they at least can move, even if it's the Y.M.C.A. for a month. If somene is living in an illegal basement or attic, even if we're making them leave their apartment, we're giving them their life."

HEADLINE: The Day the Jobs Got Up and Moved Away

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: EAST WINDSOR

 BODY:
HERE among the open fields and winding roads of suburban Mercer County, a sprawling steel and brown-brick factory has long provided jobs for hundreds of people, from janitors to rocket scientists. Opened by RCA in 1958, it foreshadowed a regional economy that would flourish in the 1970's and 80's, as office buildings and corporate campuses sprang up between Princeton and Trenton.
But in recent months, what was once the unthinkable became the inevitable: the Lockheed Martin Corporation, the current owner of the East Windsor factory, joined three other major employers to announce plans to leave Mercer, taking a total of 5,400 jobs. The losses amounted to 3,200 positions at Lockheed, which designs and manufactures spacecraft; 900 at the Mobil Corporation's research and development office in Hopewell Junction; 800 at Hill Refrigeration in Trenton, and 500 at a condom factory owned by Carter-Wallace, also in Trenton. 
 To make matters worse, Governor Whitman eliminated 1,200 state jobs in May, including hundreds in Mercer County. All told, the losses make up 3.6 percent of the county's 199,000 jobs.
Economists say the pullouts reflect a devastating case of bad timing. But they represent something much more: the latest and most alarming reminder of the stress on New Jersey's economy, which, like most of its Northeastern neighbors, has watched helplessly in the last few years as a nationwide trend toward leaner corporations moved some high-tech jobs (particularly in the oil and defense industries) out of the region and permanently elminated jobs in manufacturing.
"Simply the scale of the closings that have been announced make it seem like a real high-tech hit on the New Jersey economy," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "But this is part of the broad restructuring that is going on everywhere."
Dr. Hughes said the corporate departures would not permanently damage Mercer County's economy, which has always been bolstered by the presence of Princeton University and the state government. But they will certainly play a role in reshaping it, as manufacturing jobs are phased out and service-sector jobs -- whether they be at fast-food restaurants or consulting firms -- multiply.
In some ways, the job cuts in Mercer County reflect a situation New Jersey has been battling for decades: the decline of manufacturing jobs. But now, besides that, Mercer, which has one of the highest concentrations of high-tech industries in the state, has found itself hostage to corporate forces that in part are beyond its control: the need to consolidate jobs to places where operating costs are less onerous. Many of the scientists and engineers working for Mobil and Lockheed will be transferred to other sites, and the rest may find new opportunities in the county's growing high-tech sector. But Carter-Wallace and Hill employees who have spent their lives in manufacturing jobs might not be so lucky.
The state has lost almost 300,000 factory jobs since 1979, and only 500,000 remain, according to the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. Unless they receive intensive training for other work, factory workers have few options beyond low-wage jobs in the retail and service sectors.
"The manufacturing workers are never going to find an equivalent job," Dr. Hughes said. "The real disaster is for them, because their incomes will be permanently reduced."
The search for solutions promises to be difficult, in part because officials here are more accustomed to curbing development than encouraging it. Mercer County's suburbs flourished in the 1980's, even as its one city, Trenton, was struggling. In fact, development was so rapid that it was curtailed with strict zoning laws.
But now, as the last manufacturing jobs trickle out of Trenton, Mercer County is wondering how to help thousands of assembly-line workers make the transition to a high-tech economy. Meanwhile, as New Jersey towns receive less state and Federal money, they are fighting to keep the businesses they have and attract more. While the retail and service sectors are doing well, there is increasing pressure to lure pharmaceuticals, telecommunications companies and other corporate giants -- no small feat given the state's stringent regulations and high taxes and labor costs.
"We are lagging behind other states in being business friendly, and there's no magic bullet to change things dramatically," Dr. Hughes said. "It's going to be a long, slow process."
INDUSTRY
The Bottom Line
 Emotions are running high in Mercer County these days, and everyone has an opinion about the cause and effect of the abrupt, severe job cuts. But as the debate intensifies, the voices of corporate executives are conspicuously silent.
Beyond a few terse press releases, Carter-Wallace, Hill, Lockheed and Mobil have offered scant explanation for their decisions to leave the county. Their announcements, which came between December and June, were similar in theme: "downsizing" was essential, and the directive to cut costs precluded staying in central New Jersey.
"We are in a fiercely competitive business environment, and changes in the way we run our business are essential to our future," the Mobil chairman, Lucio A. Noto, said when he announced the cuts on May 2. "Failure to change means failure to compete in the long term."
For both Mobil and Lockheed, the job cuts reached far beyond Mercer County. Mobil's decision to close its research center in Hopewell Junction was part of a plan to lay off 4,700 workers, or more than 9 percent of its work force. And Lockheed's East Windsor factory was among the 12 corporations designated for closing last month. That consolidation will eliminate 12,000 jobs and eventually save $1.8 billion a year, the company said.
Charles Manor, a Lockheed spokesman, said the decision to leave East Windsor had everything to do with savings at a time when the defense industry is fighting for survival. The company, he said, will save millions of dollars by moving its operations at East Windsor and another plant in Valley Forge, Pa., to a larger, more modern site in Sunnyvale, Calif.
In Mobil's case, the company will lay off 250 of its Hopewell employees and transfer 650 to Paulsboro, in Sussex County, or Dallas. Mobil officials have said it would have cost twice as much to move the Paulsboro employees to Hopewell, because that plant is larger and has an attached refinery.
Mobil, which opened its Hopewell plant in 1959, wanted to build a small refinery there a decade ago, but the town would not allow it.
Dr. Hughes, the Rutgers economist, pointed out that both the Lockheed and Mobil buildings are almost 50 years old, and it made sense for both companies to choose more modern plants.
"These were among the first generation of suburban industrial facilities," he said. "Now they are lagging in basic infrastructure, and it's easier to build new ones from scratch."
Although Carter-Wallace and Hill are also abandoning aging plants, both in Trenton, they had another incentive to leave New Jersey, said Alan J. Steinberg, an assistant commissioner at the state Department of Commerce and Economic Development. Unlike Lockheed and Mobil, their work force was unionized, and the cost of labor will probably be much lower in Chesterfield, Va., where the two companies will have neighboring properties.
"Our labor costs are higher than average, and we're proud of that," Mr. Steinberg said. "We have an intelligent labor force used to a higher standard of living."
 
GOVERNMENT
'A Losing Game'
 If jobs are a political issue, losing 5,400 of them is fodder for endless recriminations. And Robert D. Prunetti, the Mercer County Executive, is at the center of the storm.
Mr. Prunetti is up for re-election this year, and his critics place the blame on his shoulders. Some say he did not communicate with executives at Lockheed and the three other corporations until it was too late. Others say he has not done enough to lure businesses in the way of tax relief and other incentives.
But Mr. Prunetti, a Republican who says he has focused on economic development since he took office in 1991, insists that the sudden departures were beyond his or any other government official's control.
"This is not a Mercer County problem, or even a New Jersey problem," Mr. Prunetti said. "Cost-cutting is the name of the game, and companies are going to go where they can make the most money with the tightest budget."
In the case of Lockheed, Mr. Prunetti prompted the state Economic Development Authority to offer a last-minute enticement in June, days before the corporation announced it was closing its East Windsor plant. The state offered to float bonds to pay for the expansion and upgrading of the plant. As part of the deal, New Jersey would pay for and hold title to the plant, leasing it back to Lockheed at favorable rates.
But Lockheed, Mr. Prunetti said, was determined to get out.
"The bottom line is, They were not interested," he said. "They had a facility in California that was only 25 percent occupied, and it made more sense to go there."
Dr. Hughes agrees that when it comes to retaining business, governments have limited means -- especially in a high-cost state like New Jersey.
"Incentives can become a losing game, and you can destroy your whole tax base," he said. "The cost of doing business in New Jersey weighs heavily against the state, and governments can only affect corporate decisions at the margin."
But that doesn't mean they can't try harder, Mr. Prunetti said, adding that his top priority is easing environmental and planning regulations and simplifying the process of getting permits.
"If a company goes to Virginia, it can be up and operating in six months," he said. "In New Jersey, it can take four years to get one permit."
While the loss of 5,400 jobs will be devastating, Mr. Prunetti said, it does not constitute an economic catastrophe. By summer's end, he said, Mercer County will have 2,400 new jobs: 1,200 in retail, 1,000 at a new post office in West Windsor and 200 at a medical diagnostics firm, also in West Windsor. The county's office space is 82 percent full, the highest rate since before the recession.
As for the workers losing jobs at Carter-Wallace, Hill, Lockheed and Mobil, the county recently started a program with job training and a job bank. An $800,000 grant from the Federal Department of Labor will be used to counsel and train the 800 Hill employees, and Mr. Prunetti hopes to obtain more money as the other layoffs occur.
But the main emphasis, he said, must be attracting new business.
"The best thing we can do," he said, "is be an advocate of people who want to come in here and create jobs."
 
LABOR
'Nothing in the Middle'
 As the July heat enveloped his small red house, Rick Moore drew on a cigarette and recalled his first day of work at Hill Refrigeration. The year was 1970, and he was fresh out of high school, counting on a long career at the company his father and grandfather had retired from. Over time he rose through the ranks, eventually becoming a supervisor and earning $40,000 a year.
Then last month, as Mr. Moore prepared to celebrate his 25th anniversary at the Trenton factory, his career ended abruptly. He is among 800 Hill employees losing their jobs as the company, which makes freezer units for grocery stores, prepares to move to Virginia. And no matter how long and hard the search, he does not expect to find a new job that pays as much as his old one.
"What kept people at Hill was job security, benefits and steady pay, but that kind of job is becoming extinct," said Mr. Moore, 43, who lives in Ewing with his wife and daughter. "There are Ivy League paychecks and minimum-wage paychecks, and nothing in the middle for people like me."
While he collects $400 a week in unemployment benefits, Mr. Moore is pinning his hopes on Mercer County's $800,000 grant to find new jobs for Hill workers. The idea is to prepare them for service-sector jobs, such as electrical contracting or computer repair, that will offer security as manufacturing jobs dwindle. But many of Mr. Moore's co-workers, he said, are not even aware that help is available, and he is skeptical that it will benefit more than a few.
"Most people won't take advantage of that money because they won't know how to access it," he said. "Even if they do train us in something new, all the jobs are moving to other states where it's easier to do business."
If Mr. Moore had his way, New Jersey would simplify its maze of regulations and Trenton would clean up old industrial sites to attract new manufacturing businesses. But his friend Jack Nealon, who has spent 14 years at Hill and will stay on until October, scoffs at his wishful thinking.
"America's changing and we've got to change with it," said Mr. Nealon, 44, who distributes parts for refrigeration units. "The answer is not another manufacturing job in another filthy factory."
There are no clear answers at this point, as Mr. Moore awaits calls from employment agencies and his wife works overtime at a textile company on Route 1. The prospect of staying in Mercer County is questionable, as more jobs require a college education and the cost of living continues to rise. Life was better in the 1960's, he said, when his father earned enough at Hill to live in Pennington, one of the county's most affluent towns.
"Twenty-five years ago it was a decent family business, a place to put your life into," he said. "If you didn't like working there, you could walk down the street and get another manufacturing job."
Mr. Moore said he would apply for government jobs, and if all else fails, he will consider a minimum-wage job at one of the new department stores along Route 1. But the possibility that he will never find another manufacturing job, he said, is jarring.
"I don't know anything else but labor," he said, lighting another cigarette. "Maybe this county isn't trying to squeeze out people like me, but it certainly isn't doing anything to save us."
 
 
A Scary Prospect: Growth
 MERCER COUNTYU is home to some of the quietest, most picturesque towns in New Jersey, and for good reason: in recent years, strict zoning laws have slowed the pace of development. Even densely populated towns like Princeton and Lawrence still have cornfields and lush, wooded areas.
 But as luring business to New Jersey becomes a priority, Mercer County is one of several that face a quandary: How to improve the local economy without compromising the quality of life that draws families and businesses there inthe first place?
 Many towns that hve resisted development are relaxing their zoning laws, suddenly eager to catch up with other parts of the state. West Windsor and Hamilton recently lifted sewer moratoriums that had stifled both residential and commercial growth, and now they are among the fastest-growing towns in the county, with subdivisions, shopping centers and office complexes in the works.
 The Mercer County Executive, Robert D. Prunetti, has advocated easing environmental regulations to encourage development. But planners at MSM Regional Council, which monitors growth inMerce, Somerset and Middlesex Counties, warn that such a policy could do more harm than good.
 "You can't just throw out regulations the way the fervor seems to be going," said Dianne Brake, president of the council. "Streamlining should be associated with certain areas that are prime for development."
 The best policy, Ms. Brake said, is to preserve small towns wiht little capacity for extra traffic and utilities, and focus on areas that already have plenty, like Hamilton and the heavily traveled Route 1 corridor between Princeton and Trenton. Route 1 will be widened over the next two years, and a maze of highways around Trenton, including I-195 and I-295, were recently connected.
 The connected highways will affect towns like Hopewell, whose proximity to the Mercer County Airport has made it a focus for future development. And Bristol Meyers-Squibb, a pharmaceutical company with headquarters in Lawrence, is developing an industrial complex on a 600-acre tract. Mr. Prunetti said the county is negotiating to expand Hopewell's sewage capacity, to accommodate the growth.
 Another focal point is Trenton - last year, Mercer County Waterfront Park with a 6,200-seat baseball stadium, opened along the Delaware River. And a 45-acre site known as the Roebling complex, which used to house factories, will be transformed into shops, offices, housing for the elderly and a 350-seat performing arts center.
 "I don't think we should have rampant development, but we've got to plan carefuly and designate certain areas for it," Mr. Prunetti said. "Towns need to understand they are part of a bigger picture, compromise and work together."
 That mindset appears to be growing more common, as towns that once thwarted development, like Hopewell, finally accept it.
 "All our municipal and county officials are very cooperative because frankly, everyone is scared," said Edward Meara, executive director of the Mercer County Chamber of Commerce. "The lack of development is starting to hit everyone's pocketbook." ABBY GOODNOUGH

Chart: Trenton Made, the World Took
 
As other kinds of employment boomed, New Jersey saw a long, slow decline in manufacturing that has worsened in recent years. From '76 to '94, by contrast, service jobs rose 65 percent, to 2.3 million. This chart shows manufacturing jobs as a percentage of total employment. (Pg. 1)

Mercer: Fewer Goods, More Services
 
Like the rest of the state, Mercer County has lost manufacturing jobs while gaining service jobs. Over the last decade, total employment in the county has still registered a healthy gain -- 13 percent, to 198,800 nonfarm jobs. (The county's population grew 00 percent in the decade, to 000,000.) But many new service jobs -- in discount stores, warehouses and fast-food chains -- pay less than the old factory jobs did.

These charts show long-term trends in manufacturing and service employment. MANUFACTURING includes durable goods like glassware, metal, industrial machinery and electronic equipment, and nondurables like food, printing and plastics. SERVICES include transportation and utilities; retail and wholesale trade; banking, insurance and real estate; personal, business, health and educational services; and Federal, state and local government.

HEADLINE: Mr. Murdoch Goes To Washington

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A WEEK from Tuesday, Rupert Murdoch is scheduled to appear before the House ethics committee, where he will be grilled by Democrats about his company's lucrative book deal with the Republican House Speaker, Newt Gingrich. Over on the House floor that week, perhaps even that same day, Republican lawmakers will be trying to push through a major telecommunications bill that would, among other things, let the media baron buy still more television stations and newspapers in the United States.
In one sense, this is all in a week's notoriety for Mr. Murdoch -- a man fiercely admired by some as a brilliant entrepreneur and just as fiercely reviled by others as a harsh and domineering mogul. But the simple fact of this double-barreled, center-stage presence in Congress also represents a new phase in a remarkable career: After years as an outsider in the capital's whirl of money and politics, Mr. Murdoch has come to Washington. 
 It's not that he has become an avid habitue of the capital's dinner-party circuit, the latest darling of the conservative establishment. Still, in his characteristically aloof way, Mr. Murdoch and his Australia-based company, the News Corporation, have become increasingly visible, and influential, in this new Republican world.
"News Corporation is dramatically more active here than it was a few years ago," said Tim Boggs, Time Warner's top lobbyist in Washington. "A lot of it reflects the growing complexity of the company and its business plan, with interests in so many different areas."
Mr. Murdoch's efforts in Washington come at a crucial time for his company's expansionist ambitions. As ever, though, his interests and intentions are far from one-dimensional -- a mix of the financial, the political and the personal. He has ridden into town, so to speak, on a Republican deregulatory tide, and the welcome, after all those years in the wilderness, has been warm indeed. "It's been like pushing on an open door," said Peggy Binzel, Mr. Murdoch's Congressional lobbyist.
Though he didn't show up in person, Mr. Murdoch contributed $100,000 as one of nine honorary chairmen of a fund-raising dinner last month for House Republicans. Next month, he will sponsor a dinner for Senator Larry Pressler, the South Dakota Republican who heads the Commerce Committee.
He has invested $3 million to underwrite a new conservative weekly magazine in Washington called The Standard. The magazine, which should hit the stands shortly after Labor Day, will be edited by William Kristol, who was one of former Vice President Dan Quayle's top advisers and is considered one of the Republican Party's leading intellectual lights.
And though Mr. Murdoch's patronage of The Standard is unlikely to make him much money, it will place him in a role that he clearly savors: Like The New York Post, which is often stridently conservative, it will give him a piece of the political debate in one of the media capitals of the world.
But it is on the legislative and regulatory fronts where Mr. Murdoch has been most active, and where he has the most to gain.
To be sure, every segment of the tightly regulated communications industry lobbies and spends heavily on political contributions. Dollar for dollar, Mr. Murdoch's efforts pale when compared with those of the local and long-distance telephone companies as they struggle to enter each other's markets.
Yet Mr. Murdoch would be a big winner if Congress, as is expected, passes a telecommunications bill eliminating most of the rules that restrict a company from owning more than 12 television stations. To that end, his lobbyist, Ms. Binzel, organized a coalition with ABC, NBC, CBS and The Tribune Company that successfully persuaded the Senate to eliminate the numerical limits as long as a company's stations do not reach more than 35 percent of the population. The House version would also end prohibitions against owning a television station and a newspaper in the same city.
In an interview from Australia, where he has been holding a month-long management retreat, Mr. Murdoch said he was not seeking any special preferences. "We believe in deregulation whether it hurts us or helps us and we've been absolutely consistent about that. Deregulation is in the public interest."
On the regulatory side, Mr. Murdoch fended off efforts by the Federal Communications Commission to strictly enforce foreign ownership limits on his company. Those limits would have required the News Corporation to reduce its equity in its TV stations from 99 percent to 20 percent. Meantime, largely unnoticed -- except by his industry rivals -- Mr. Murdoch has successfully exploited peculiar features of the ownership rules to acquire 20 to 25 percent ownership stakes in stations and extend his reach to roughly 35 percent of the nation's population.
Preston Padden, the News Corporation's head of Government affairs, says those who look for a "grand plan" in Mr. Murdoch's Washington activities will be disappointed.
"There is no strategic planning group, no floor of M.B.A.'s," he said. "It's Rupert waking up earlier than his competition with eight great ideas before breakfast."
Still, the deregulation of broadcast ownership seems to cut to the heart of Mr. Murdoch's ambitions. For while Mr. Murdoch's global empire includes newspapers, the Twentieth Century Fox studio, book publishers and stakes in broadcasting satellites in Europe and Asia, the biggest profits are coming from American television stations.
"America is very much the basis of News Corporation's activities," Mr. Murdoch said .And that means television stations. "Networks do not make a lot of money, but the stations they own do," he said. "If you look at Capital Cities/ABC, the stations make about four times as much money as the network."
There are those, many of them Democrats, who say that in this new political climate, Mr. Murdoch has become too involved -- most notably in his $4.5 million book deal with Mr. Gingrich, the Georgia Republican. Mr. Murdoch met with Mr. Gingrich several weeks before the book contract was signed, and acknowledged discussing his battle with the F.C.C. over foreign ownership rules. But he has vehemently denied trying to enlist Mr. Gingrich's support and said his company did not lobby in Congress on that issue at all.
Mr. Murdoch has shown scant interest in windy debates about the "information highway," and has testified at almost none of the scores of Congressional hearings on communications policy during the last few years.
In fact, he said his company had played no role at all on the most important segments of the telecommunications bill, which is primarily aimed at letting local telephone, long-distance companies and cable television networks enter one another's markets.
And he actually parted ways with other over-the-air broadcasters in recent months, who have been lobbying Congress for legislation to prevent cable television operators from burying their channels when they offer menus with more than 100 video services.
But the News Corporation was ferocious and successful in fighting the F.C.C. on complaints that the company violated rules that forbid a foreign company from owning more than 20 percent of an American television station.
In April, the F.C.C.'s staff circulated a confidential draft order that would have forced the company to reduce its equity in the stations to 20 percent and would have fined it $500,000.
"We can think of few circumstances that could be more intuitively contrary to the Congressional interest in safeguarding national security," the draft order read. Though it gave Mr. Murdoch a chance to show that an exception to the rules would be in the public interest, the draft order concluded that an exception "is inconsistent with the public interest in this case."
After news organizations reported about the draft order, company executives said that a restructuring would impose hundreds of millions of dollars in tax liabilities. The company had already deluged the agency with legal briefs, along with testimonials from programmers and stations that had signed up as Fox network affiliates. The company had even persuaded several former F.C.C. officials to recant statements that they had not understood Fox's ownership structure at the time the company's licenses were approved.
Within the F.C.C., a majority of the agency's five commissioners drastically revised the original recommendation. Led by Commissioner James Quello, a Democrat who argued that the News Corporation had greatly enhanced the public interest by launching a fourth national television network, the final order backed away from explicit demands for restructuring or fines and three of the commissioners said that Fox had enhanced the public interest.
Meantime, in the last 18 months, Fox television stations have signed deals to acquire stakes of 20 to 25 percent in 17 stations. All told, these stations reach about 35 percent of the population -- a wider reach than ABC, NBC or CBS have with their company-owned stations.
"He has pioneered creative ownership relationships and taken advantage of F.C.C. rules to become the No. 1 stakeholder in American television stations," said Gerald Waldron, a lawyer for affiliates of ABC, NBC and CBS.
Yet, despite loud protests by both NBC and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which objected on grounds that Mr. Murdoch's efforts were preventing minorities from gaining ownership of television stations, those stations will not be counted against the current limit of 12 stations. That is because the F.C.C.'s arcane rules allow a company to own as much as 49 percent of a station, without it being counted against ownership limits, if a single company owns the other 51 percent.
Mr. Murdoch supports eliminating rules that prohibit companies from owning a newspaper and a television station in one market. But he said he was unsure about the wisdom of buying more papers.
"I love newspapers and I would love to have one or two more," he said. "But I don't know if I could justify it economically to my shareholders. At the moment, the newspapers are about to go into a period of extreme suffering because of high paper prices and it's likely to last for a long time."
Mr. Murdoch said that even he is unsure what the company will do next. He recently made a multi-billion-dollar offer to acquire the extensive television holdings of Italy's Fininvest, owned by Silvio Berlusconi. Mr. Murdoch was rebuffed, which leaves him scouring the globe once again.
Broadly, however, he seems intent on expanding the amount of entertainment and information his company produces and then finding new channels of distribution. The Fox television stations constitute the foundation of his American operations. In Europe, Mr. Murdoch is beaming television programming to homes by satellite over British Sky Broadcasting. In Asia, News Corporation owns a 63 percent stake in Star TV, a direct broadcast satellite that covers much of the continent.
Beyond his immediate business interests, he seems determined to carve out a role in the broader political debate. And that, some say, might even strain his relations with politicians.
"If he was simply acting to maximize profit, he would have shied away from a controversial magazine like The Standard because it could actually hurt his relations with some politicians," said Mr. Kristol. "We've made it clear we are going to be critical and that we'll go after Republicans too."
One longtime business acquaintance said that Mr. Murdoch runs the risk of alienating executives within the entertainment industry, who tend to be centrist Democrats.
"It's never been a secret that Murdoch is conservative," said Barry Diller, who started the Fox Television Network for Mr. Murdoch. "But if he continues to unsheathe that harsh conservatism, it will impose some operational difficulties. Extreme political views, whether liberal or conservative, particularly with a broadcasting base, make a lot of people exceedingly nervous -- both those you work with and those in government."
To Mr. Murdoch, though, investing in The Standard is "fun."
"We don't think it'll lose much," he added. "It's a worthwhile exercise. For a company our size, I suppose it's a bit of a hobby. I think it will be an important voice. I hope it will be an important voice."
 
 
 
Ownership Limits a Problem? Just Change the Definition
 FEDERAL regulations prohibit a company from owning more than 12 television stations in the United States, but Rupert Murdoch has masterfully blurred the definition of ownership.
Mr. Murdoch's Fox Television Stations Inc., which now owns 11 stations and has signed an agreement to buy one more, has already bumped against the ceiling. But it has capitalized on a quirk in the rules to acquire stakes of 20 or 25 percent in 17 other stations that together cover more than 10 percent of the national population.
Consider the case of WLUK, Channel 2 in Green Bay, Wis. The station was acquired earlier this year by a company called Savoy-Fox, a business in which Fox owns a 25 percent stake and whose president, Thomas Herwitz, was general manager of Fox's Washington television station from 1989 to 1993.
Under its agreement with Savoy-Fox, moreover, Mr. Murdoch's company has options to increase its 25 percent stake of nonvoting stock to 50 percent and to convert those shares into voting stock. Meanwhile, the station will be an affiliate of the Fox Television Network.
The Federal Communications Commission approved the takeover of WLUK in April, but not without controversy. One of the agency's five commissioners, Susan Ness, said the deal clearly violated the spirit of the ownership restrictions.
"Considering the entire web of relationships, it stretches the imagination to believe that the potential for influence does not exist," Ms. Ness said in a statement at the time of the decision.
Savoy-Fox is awaiting approval to acquire three other stations, but the F.C.C. has been scrutinizing those deals closely and has yet to make a decision. EDMUND L. ANDREWS
 
 
 
Deregulation, Deregulation: Murdoch's Washington Agenda
1. Expanding television holdings.
Fox Television Stations owns eight stations and either holds or is acquiring partial stakes in more than 20 others. Current rules prohibit the company from owning majority control in more than 12 stations. News Corporation, along with ABC, NBC and CBS, is pushing Congress to end most limits. Approval, as part of a broad telecommunications bill, is considered likely.
 
2. Resolving foreign ownership dispute.
The F.C.C. has given News Corporation, based in Australia, an opportunity to get an exemption to rules forbidding foreign companies from owning television stations. The commission must still approve the company's petition that an exception would be in the public interest, and is expected to do so on Friday.
 
3. Ending cross-owndership rules.
News Corporation is seeking repeal of restrictions that forbid companies from owning newspapers and television stations, or newspapers and cable television systems, in the same market. This is part of the telecommunications bill.
 
4. Alternative uses for digital television.
News Corporation, with most other broadcasters, is seeking freedom to use new channels designed for high-definition television for an alternative purpose: to offer several different programs at once, using digital technology. The F.C.C. is expected to support that position.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
The Week That Was Bad, and Real Bad

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
Oh, so that is what a really bad day in the stock market feels like.
Until lunchtime last Wednesday, bad days had become so infrequent that professional traders seemed momentarily addled when technology stocks led a lemming-like plunge in midday prices across all the major stock markets. 
 Firsthand evidence of that unsteadiness was offered by Laszlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates, a market research firm. "I put in a bid to buy a little bit of Hewlett-Packard at $77 a share," Mr. Birinyi recalled on Friday. "I got it for $76.50 a share. So I went to buy another little bit at $75, and got it for $74.50." When professional traders start shoving Hewlett-Packard shares at a willing buyer for $2 a share less than he'd paid just moments before, "you know you've got an over-reaction," Mr. Birinyi said.
But if the week erased a few cocky smiles from the unlined faces of technology-fund managers, it did not seem to shake America's faith in the single most important idea to emerge from the stock market in the last decade: Buy on weakness.
On Wednesday, as the market bucked like an air mattress in the surf, major mutual fund organizations reported no evidence of panicky redemptions. Carl Wittnebert, the managing editor of the Mutual Fund Trim Tabs newsletter in Santa Rosa, Calif., tracks the flow of cash into mutual funds -- a decent proxy for Main Street sentiment. On Friday, his verdict on the week was: "As of now, nothing at all dramatic has happened." Buyers "may have pulled back a tad," he said, but sellers were not at all plentiful, and the overall cash flows were "quite stable."
The result was a Dow that closed Friday at 4,641.55 points, down 1.4 percent for the week. The Nasdaq composite index closed at 961.77, down 3.7 percent from the prior week's close.
But the week that ended with barely a whimper in the stock market closed with a bruising bang in the bond market. In a realm where prices typically move in fractions, the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell more than 5 percent during the week. In other words, the value of a $1,000 30-year Treasury bond has fallen about $50 since last weekend.
One historical fact embedded even in young minds is that a contributor to the stock market crash in October 1987 was the bruising decline in the bond market that began six months earlier. So a bad week for bonds is bound to cause some uneasiness.
Is the bond market's pain likely to continue? Probably not, in the view of several veteran bond-watchers. The economist David B. Bostian Jr. of the Bostian Group in New York, who has been optimistic about bonds for months, believes the market was just blowing off some steam after "a buying panic" that pushed prices up and yields down in June. "There is still a bullish case for bonds," he said, "but the market is just retracing to a more sustainable level." Samuel Kahan, an economist for Fuji Securities in Chicago, agreed that there were no deep-seated inflation fears behind the market's recent plunge. "There was a lot of supply hitting the market and I think people just decided to step back a little," he said on Friday.
As for the stock market, Mr. Kahan is watching his own personal indicator. "I have a favorite client who has an uncanny ability to pick market tops and bottoms," he said. "When he calls me up and says he's ready to buy stocks, I'll know we've reached the peak. He hasn't called me yet."

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
When Business Partners Are Marriage Partners

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
JAMI AND KLAUS HEIDEGGER met in 1982 when she was an aerobics instructor and he was a rising star on Austria's Olympic ski team. Three years later they were married, and now they run Kiehl's, a Manhattan-based cosmetics company.
The enterprise, with yearly revenue of $10 million, surely makes money. But, in the couple's eyes, it makes their marriage, too. 
 "It's not enough to just be in love or in lust, because these things fade away," said Mrs. Heidegger, the willowy and voluble president and principal owner of Kiehl's. "For some people, it's a child that keeps the relationship going, but for us, even more than our child, it's the business." Indeed, she said, for them weekends pale in comparison to Monday morning, "when the faxes start coming through."
Theirs is but one fin-de-siecle twist on the hoary concept of the mom-and-pop storefront, and such arrangements are growing fast. Whether because of corporate cutbacks, the increased presence of women in the work force or other causes, more than one million couples work together, up from 500,000 in 1986, said Sharon Nelton, an editor at Nation's Business in Washington. That doubling counts spouses who have their own businesses, as well as the relative few working for someone else.
Corporate America may frown on the practice: indeed, one recent survey found that 65 percent of managers disapprove of married people working side by side. But couples are mixing the nuptial and the entrepreneurial in fields from medicine to marketing.
THEY seem to toil no less hard than unrelated workmates. Consider the grueling pace of Helen and Stephen Colen, two physicians who run a husband-and-wife plastic surgery practice on Park Avenue in Manhattan. If he's in the office, she's in surgery, and vice versa. She was in surgery as she went into labor with their first child -- they have two -- but went to the delivery room only after she had finished stitching her patient. And the chores of their personal lives are also formally assigned: She books their airline tickets, but he's in charge of cooking dinner.
The Heideggers are similarly hard charging. They have given up what Mrs. Heidegger calls "sybaritic friends" -- those not connected with their work -- and have done away with formal family meals to accommodate their work schedule. They are also inclined not to send their 4-year-old daughter to school quite yet. "I just want to focus on my business," Mrs. Heidegger said. "I don't want to have to schmooze the teachers or jockey for position in the P.T.A."
Hard charging or laid back, "working marriages" have their bright sides. While some people may balk at having spouses who know exactly how much time they take for lunch, co-working couples do sidestep the jealousy and tension that often arises when one spouse's career overwhelms the other's. Other partner-spouses cite such benefits as growing trust, increased camaraderie and enhanced mutual respect.
Dr. William Bygrave, director of the Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., credits on-the-job togetherness with saving his marriage. Dr. Bygrave ran his own technology company in the early 1970's, and his wife came aboard as a part-time secretary. "She got to know my customers and my business," he said. "It made her much more empathetic toward the problems. Before that, I had been this grouchy guy who came home and was totally unanimated, because my brain would be totally involved with some issue with the company."
Also, couples who are partners often develop exceptionally close and satisfying work relationships. Helen Colen's patients will often see her husband for a consultation if she is not around, for example; his will meet with her on the aftereffects of a tummy tuck or a proboscis redesign. Now and then they operate together, particularly if a patient has flown in from overseas and has only a few days for multiple procedures.
"When I have a difficult surgery coming up, very often I'll ask my husband's opinion," Helen Colen said. "And it's very nice to talk to someone who really cares that my patients do well. If you ask another colleague, sometimes they'll just answer off the cuff."
Of the dangers in working together, the biggest is that disputes and ill feelings either at home or at work can poison the other realm. Couples who work together can jeopardize their marriages, especially if they endlessly intertwine the emotional and the professional, said Dr. Paul Baard, a psychotherapist and associate professor of communication and management at Fordham University's Graduate School of Business.
"Couples need to be very clear about their boundaries," Dr. Baard said. "Any relationship is going to be strained by pressure, and business pressures, which are greater than ever today, bring out the worst in people."
Combining family and business may also hurt the chance for marketplace success, said Paul Reynolds, a professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee. In a survey of fledgling Wisconsin businesses two years ago, he found that more than half were family-owned, with most of that group run by couples. But in additional research, he found that nonfamily businesses, while outnumbered, were much more likely to flourish and expand.
"Many of the decisions are being made on the basis of family considerations, not on what's best for the business," he said about the family-run companies. "Rather than expand the business, the principals might decide they're going to take a month off and go on vacation. Then their competitors take the market."
Similarly, some venture capitalists will never invest in a company, no matter how promising, that is headed by a husband-and-wife team, Dr. Bygrave of Babson College said. "The last thing they want to happen in the middle of running and growing a company is to get involved in the strife between two partners," Dr. Bygrave said. "It's a significant risk."
The Levys of Manhattan are well aware of the pitfalls, personal and professional, of marrying family and business. Rosann Levy, the marketer for her husband's accounting firm, Arthur D. Levy & Company, said they and their son, who is also in the business, regularly meet with a family therapist to help keep things running smoothly.
"I believe very strongly in having an objective facilitator to help you get through things," Ms. Levy said. "There are change-and-control issues, control between husbands and wives."
To avoid damaging run-ins, many couples develop divisions of labor. Nathaniel and Charlesetta Lee founded the United Academy of Beauty in Phoenix in 1969, fulfilling her childhood dream. Today they've diversified into real estate, operations which Mr. Lee manages, and they are opening a string of hair salons around Arizona, over which Mrs. Lee presides.
"Not everybody can work together," Mrs. Lee said. "But he's a good business partner and I can depend on him, and I try to be the same way."
The Heideggers divide chores, too. She does the hiring and looks for new products, while he runs the factory in Jersey City. "What I do there," he said, "isn't interfering with what she's doing here." Still, tussles are unavoidable. Mrs. Heidegger is in charge of the free-sample giveaways, for instance, and Mr. Heidegger says she sometimes goes overboard.
OTHERS advise working couples to leave the personal side at the office door. But some people don't bother with such compartmentalization. "Everything is open to discussion at all times," said Lois McCutcheon, a real estate agent in Middle Haddam, Conn., who since 1964 has shared her occupation, her office and even her desk with her husband, Ron.
For three years, Dr. Helen Colen insisted on maintaining a separate practice, explaining that she had wanted time to establish herself professionally before joining forces with her husband. "If you have two people running a business, people always defer to the man," she said, "and I didn't want that to happen."
Perhaps the best advice for co-working couples comes from Joe Mancuso, president of the Manhattan-based Center for Entrepreneurial Management, where his wife, Karla, is vice president. "It's nice to know other couples who are also in business but are not competitors," he said. "You can go out to dinner once in a while and ask detailed questions of one another." As in, how do you guys do it?
 
 
 
If Connubial Bliss Fades, Family Business Can Suffer
 FAME and success: Some couples who worked together had both. But good fortune is not insurance against divorce. And a split between co-working spouses reaches not only to their marriage but also to their livelihood.
Consider Fred and Gale Hayman, the co-owners of perfume maker Giorgio Inc. Starting with a women's wear boutique on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, Calif., they hit the jackpot with one overpowering fragrance. After divorcing in 1983, they tried to run the company together but apparently could not stop fighting. Eventually they sold out to Avon Products, and divided $185 million. (Avon later sold Giorgio to the Procter & Gamble Company.)
The founders of Esprit de Corp., the sportswear company, fared much worse. Susie and Doug Tompkins clashed for years -- almost from the company's start in 1968 -- over its strategic direction. Eventually, their marriage went completely awry and they put the company up for sale. No one bought, however, and in 1990, Mr. Tompkins sold his interest to an investment group headed by Mrs. Tompkins. She later left management.
Hollywood has had several feuding business couples. There's Mary Tyler Moore, who back in 1981 divorced Grant Tinker, with whom she founded MTM Enterprises, the company that produced her shows, among others. He, of course, later ran NBC, while she kept producing shows. More recently, Roseanne and Tom Arnold, who owned a production company together, parted ways. And remember Lucille Ball and Desi Arnez?
Perhaps the biggest corporate soap opera of late was played out in Washington. In 1993, soon after Herbert H. Haft, the patriarch of the Dart Group, began to quarrel with his son and heir-apparent, Robert M. Haft, the entire family unraveled. Herbert's wife, Gloria, sided with Robert and was fired from the Dart board. Soon, the couple was in a bitter divorce. Gloria, who had helped Herbert start their first drug store, considered herself an equal partner in building the Haft retailing and real estate empire.
Just this year, Jann and Jane Wenner, founders of Rolling Stone magazine and Wenner Media, split. Though Jane had no official title beyond director, she actively advised the magazines and is said to have mediated disputes between Mr. Wenner and employees. What's more, she owns a stake in the company -- so the divorce will probably affect the company.
Splits can be easier, at least on the business, when couples work together in large corporations. Often, one spouse just goes elsewhere. That's what Joni Evans, then president of the trade book division at Simon & Schuster, did in 1987 when her marriage to the publisher's chief executive, Richard E. Snyder, foundered and their year-long divorce proceeding turned rancorous. Ms. Evans took her editorial skills to a rival, Random House, though she has since become a literary agent at the William Morris Agency.
Such are the trials and tribulations of rich and famous working couples. Remove the headlines and the picture doubtless looks much the same for everybody else. JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI

HEADLINE: Crime Lab;
Mystery of New York, the Suddenly Safer City

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

 BODY:
NEW YORK CITY'S murder, robbery and burglary rates have plummeted to their lowest levels in a quarter century -- a development that has become a marvel of American law enforcement. But Police Commissioner William J. Bratton will not be satisfied until every last criminologist surrenders.
 "We'll knock them down like ducks in a row," said Mr. Bratton, speaking of all the standard criminological theories about how crime waves are tied to the size of the youth population, or to changes in the weather, or to unemployment levels, or to drug use patterns, or to the availability of guns. 
 As an enthusiastic brawler and bragger, Mr. Bratton wants the world to believe that it is his aggressive new crime strategies, and just about nothing else, that have forced New York's thugs into a fast retreat.
 Still, almost everyone else who studies crime is mystified by New York's 30 percent drop in murder and shooting incidents so far this year. Attorney General Janet Reno has called on her researchers to study it, and local social scientists are faxing faster than speeding bullets to foundations with grant proposals to test one new theory or another.
 Many cities have increased their police forces and seen crime rates decline, just as New York has, but this city's drop is simply breathtaking. As of Thursday, the 648 murders so far this year were 312 below last year's total on July 20. Over the first six months, reported robberies fell by 21.9 percent, burglaries by 18.1 percent and motor vehicle theft by 25.2 percent over the same period in 1994. Only with rape, a crime that women are believed to be reporting more often, have the numbers remained roughly the same.

 
 
More Than Cops
 "There's a miracle happening before our eyes and we don't know why it's happening," said Jeffrey Fagan, director of the Center for Violence Research and Prevention at Columbia University. "Cops deserve credit, but it would be a first in the history of social science for there to be a single reason for such a dramatic change in social behavior."
 Central to the question of why crime has dropped so dramatically in New York two years in a row is the issue of whether crime is preventable by police work at all. Many researchers say crime is an inexorable symptom of deeper social trends, like the breakdown of family or community, that police cannot possibly control. Deferring to criminologists, police chiefs have accepted the notion that individual crimes are random events, driven by passion or desperation, made more lethal in recent years by the easy availability of guns.
 Mr. Bratton has disputed such thinking, and he has made New York City a laboratory for perhaps the most innovative policing of any big city in the country. In the crackdown on minor offenses, like public beer drinking and urination and unlicensed street vending, Mr. Bratton's department found new ways to frisk people for guns and check their records for outstanding warrants. Suddenly people brought into precinct station houses for nothing more serious than graffiti-scrawling were pressed for information about drug or gun dealing.

 
 
In the War Room
 Mr. Bratton ordered the department's number-crunchers, who once measured productivity by clocking how fast patrol cars responded to calls, to design computer maps to plot crime trends daily for every street in the city. The approach likens criminals to enemy army units that can be squashed or deterred before they make their next move. The commissioner has advanced his predecessors' community policing policies by giving local precinct commanders wide latitude in creating their own anti-crime strategies.
 Before Mr. Bratton took over the department, neighborhood officers were ordered not to make narcotics arrests out of fear they would be tempted into corruption. Few anti-gun and narcotics units worked nights or weekends, leaving criminals an open field to operate. That has changed, and arrests have climbed by more than 25 percent.
 "I want to challenge the old idea that policing can't make a substantial impact on social change," Mr. Bratton said. "American policing has been swatting at mosquitoes for 20 years. In New York we've learned how to drain the swamp."
 Nevertheless, those ducks Mr. Bratton promises to knock down keep quacking. And while they cannot explain why the drop in crime accelerated precisely at the time the new crime strategies took effect in the middle of last year, these theories offered by criminologists do suggest that something more than Mr. Bratton's innovations are contributing to the city's good fortunes.

 
THEORY The drop in New York's crime rate reflects a national trend.
 While some medium-sized cities continue to record more crime, the nation as a whole, and big cities in particular, is seeing less. Baltimore, Cleveland, Houston, Jacksonville, Los Angeles, Memphis, Milwaukee, Nashville, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, San Antonio, San Diego and San Francisco all saw their murder rates drop by better than 10 percent last year. The 32 percent drop in Houston's murder rate for the first six months of this year was slightly better than New York's 31 percent slide, and Phoenix and Chicago were not too far behind.
 "Different cities point to different reasons," said Marie Simonetti Rosen, publisher of Law Enforcement News. "Some say it's the impact of community policing, some say it's the impact of tougher jail sentences, some say it's because of special courts dealing with guns, domestic violence and drugs."
 But New York's drop in virtually every category of crime is more sustained and steeper than any other major city's. While most of the cities that experienced drops in violent crimes last year were coming off a couple of years of rising murder and robbery rates, New York's drop of 12.3 percent in all felonies last year came as an acceleration of three straight years of gentle declines.

 
THEORY The crack-cocaine epidemic that fueled the crime wave has ebbed.
 New York criminologists offer some strong, albeit anecdotal, evidence that crack smoking is going out of style among youths who grew up watching their neighborhoods ravaged by agitated users and pistol-toting sellers fighting for turf.
 "The kids who are around the age of 18 have gravitated away from hard drugs, from both use and distribution," said Richard S. Curtis, an anthropologist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. "Crack has just played itself out." Mr. Curtis based his conclusions on interviews and focus groups including hundreds of New York City youths over the last two years.
 "They were really disillusioned with what crack had done," he concluded, adding that the increasingly aggressive police work may have "sped up" the growing conclusion of inner city youths that drugs and crime do not pay.
 In his own interviews with youths recently released from the city jail on Rikers Island, Mr. Fagan, the Columbia University criminologist, has arrived at similar findings. "There has been some cultural adaptation to the slaughter," he said.
 Mr. Fagan has also concluded that crime is decreasing as heroin slowly replaces crack as the drug of choice in New York. "While crack is a stimulant, heroin is a depressant," he said. And because heroin is purer and cheaper today than during its last surge in the 1960's, he has concluded that heroin addicts are not commiting as many robberies and burglaries as they did 30 years ago to support their habits.
 The police department disputes such conclusions, noting that 78 percent of the people arrested in Manhattan in February tested positive for cocaine, while only 22 percent tested positive for heroin and other opiates.

 
THEORY Most of the adolescents who shot up New York over the last decade ended up behind bars or murdered in gang wars, while the total number of people in their prime crime years has fallen.
 Criminologists note that the 55,000 felons imprisoned in New York State is about double the number locked up a decade ago. More than half come from the city, and about half of those have been in prison for less than five years. Figuring that each one of the newly imprisoned New Yorkers would commit five or six felonies in a year, that's a considerable number of murders, rapes and robberies prevented.
 Another estimated 3,000 people involved in narcotics crimes have been killed over the last five years in New York.
 But criminologists cannot explain how these factors could have come into play so suddenly the second half of last year, when New York's crime began falling so fast.
 Perhaps the most popular theory, and the one most disdained by Mr. Bratton, argues that the crime rate is determined by the number of youths in society at any given time. At a news conference two weeks ago, Mr. Bratton disparaged the major proponent of demographic criminology, James Alan Fox of Northeastern University, as well as the journalists who go to him for his opinions.
 "Most of the decline that has occurred would have occurred anyway," Mr. Fox said in an interview last week. "The baby boom generation, which comprises almost a third of the population, is getting older. They are middle-aged, and they are not nearly as aggressive and violent as they were when they were younger."
 Mr. Bratton, backed by city demographers, rejects such thinking, noting that from 1990 to 1995 the city saw a decrease of only 6 to 7 percent in the number of people between the ages of 15 and 29, the age group that commits and is victimized by the vast majority of crimes.
 But those ducks are persistent.
 "To resolve the researchers' questions, we need to know what is happening with crack markets, gun markets, juvenile violence, and comparing New York City police tactics with other cities," said Jeremy Travis, director of the National Institute of Justice, the Justice Department's research arm. "Understanding takes time."

HEADLINE: Medicare, Turning 30, Won't Be What It Was

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER and ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
Thirty years after its creation, Medicare celebrates its anniversary this summer as a rare creature in the politics of the 1990's: a big, ambitious, exceedingly popular Government program that worked.
Nevertheless, it stands on the brink of extraordinary change. 
 Few dispute the successes of Medicare. When President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the bill creating it on July 30, 1965, only half of America's elderly had any health insurance. Today, the Government insurance program pays hospital and doctor bills for more than 37 million Americans 65 and older. This age group is the only one in America with virtually universal coverage.
Despite its successes -- and perhaps, in part, because of them -- Democrats, Republicans and policy-makers of all stripes now agree that Medicare in its current form cannot be sustained. They say its costs, which totaled $159.5 billion last year and are rising at an annual rate of 10 percent, must be controlled before the great wave of baby boomers begins to hit the rolls around 2010.
Beyond the need for cost control, the consensus breaks down. Politicians and policy-makers are bitterly divided over how Medicare should be changed, and how quickly. Democrats, using this month's anniversary to recall past glories, say that Republicans fought the creation of Medicare and should not be trusted with its overhaul today.
But Democrats in Congress and the White House, exhausted from their effort to redesign the nation's health care system in 1993 and 1994, have advanced few proposals of their own to improve the financial condition of Medicare. The party that sought bold innovations in health policy in the last two years is now advocating a cautious, go-slow approach to changes in Medicare.
Congressional Republicans say they are simply trying to govern and save a program that is badly out of date. Many favor a proposal that would constitute one of the most profound changes in the history of the program: the Government, which now acts as the insurer, paying doctors and hospitals for covered services, would instead contribute a fixed amount of money to a health insurance plan on behalf of each Medicare beneficiary. In the argot of health policy, a defined benefit would be replaced by a defined contribution, which Medicare recipients could use to purchase coverage in the marketplace.
Republicans say this proposal, described in internal documents that came to light this month, would offer the elderly the chance to pick and choose among health plans with different benefit packages and different premiums. Under this arrangement, sometimes known as a voucher system, elderly consumers would win because they would have more choices, and Government would win because it would have more control over the cost of the program, Republicans say.
"Senior citizens deserve the same choices available to other Americans," Representative Jim McCrery, a Louisiana Republican, said this week. "Medicare beneficiaries are given only one option when they enroll in the program, a bureaucratic, outdated, one-size-fits-all program that has not really changed since Congress passed it 30 years ago."
But Democrats say costs can be contained through less drastic steps. The voucher system, the Democrats argue, would send a vulnerable population into a fiercely competitive, confusing market. They see it as a step toward ending the fundamental promise of Medicare: an entitlement to first-class care for older Americans.
"Vouchers are a cruel birthday present on the 30th anniversary of Medicare," said Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
Differences between the two parties are intensified because Medicare's future has become enmeshed in the great budget battle of 1995. Republicans say their immediate goal is to prevent a central part of Medicare, the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, from going bankrupt. But Democrats assert that the Republicans are trying to ram through changes in Medicare over the next 10 weeks so they can deliver on their promise of a tax cut and a balanced budget by 2002.
Republicans counter that the Democrats are abdicating their responsibility to help find a solution because they want to exploit Medicare as a political issue in the 1996 elections.
In fact, the stakes for both parties are huge.
"There are folks on both sides of this who are spoiling for an ideological Armageddon," said Bruce C. Vladeck, administrator of the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare.
It would not be the first epic battle. Today's debate echoes concerns that were raised from the start about the proper role of Government, the trade-off between costs and benefits, and the degree to which the private market can be trusted to meet the insurance needs of the elderly.
 
The Past
Access for All Was Grand Goal
 Medicare's defenders say it is easy to take the program for granted in the summer of 1995. Before its enactment, they say, a serious illness could wipe out the savings of a lifetime, elderly people were often consigned to charity wards, and in any given year one-third of the aged did not see physicians.
Since the early 1960's, life expectancy at age 65 has increased by nearly three years. Procedures like cataract surgery, hip replacements and coronary bypass operations have vastly improved the quality of life for many elderly.
As Democrats are only too happy to recall, it was their party that championed national health insurance, beginning with President Harry S. Truman, who in 1945 urged Congress to establish such a program. In the debate over Medicare, Democrats said that only a true social insurance program, financed by payroll taxes and covering everyone, would spread the risk sufficiently and insure that all the elderly, rich and poor, were brought into the mainstream of American medicine. Republicans, by and large, argued for a voluntary system.
Bob Dole, who was then a Republican Representative from Kansas, put it this way in the House debate on Medicare on April 8, 1965: "The real opposition to the bill stems from the fact hospitalization benefits are to be financed by a compulsory payroll tax administered by the Social Security Administration." He added, "The point is that nearly everyone supports the concept that adequate medical protection should be made available to the aged, but it should be voluntary and should reflect ability to pay."
The costs of the program were a concern from the start, and not just to Republicans. But the architects of Medicare were more concerned about the program's grander goals. It had taken eight years, four election cycles, the assassination of a President and the Johnson landslide of 1964 to bring them to the point of passing this program.
Joseph A. Califano Jr., then a young White House aide, remembers sitting at a crucial moment with President Johnson and Lawrence F. O'Brien Jr., a White House adviser, in a small room off the Oval Office:
"Larry O'Brien said, 'Mr. President, we can't get Medicare out of Ways and Means unless we give the doctors and hospitals the reimbursement system they want.' Mr. Johnson replied, 'Get it out.' "
Mr. Califano added: "Our eyes were focused on access. We were not focused on costs."
In the 1980's, Congress revised Medicare's methods of paying hospitals and doctors, trying with some success to slow the increase in costs. In 1983, Congress decided that hospitals should receive uniform rates set in advance for each patient with a particular illness. Under a 1989 law that took effect in 1992, doctors are paid according to a fee schedule.
Medicare payments are made from trust funds, which are basically accounting devices in the Federal budget. The Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is financed with payroll taxes. The Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, for doctors and other outpatient services, is financed with general tax revenues (65 percent), premiums paid by beneficiaries (31 percent) and interest from Government securities (4 percent).
The Medicare payroll tax has been repeatedly increased, most recently in 1986. Medicare remains essentially what it was in the beginning, a promise by the Government to give the elderly free choice of doctors and specialists, and to reimburse those doctors on the basis of each service they perform.
Beneficiaries are responsible for deductibles, copayments and many other costs not covered by Medicare. Most elderly people buy private Medigap insurance to help cover these costs.
Medicare's fee-for-service system was the norm for medicine in 1965, but it is no longer. Millions of workers are now enrolled in health maintenance organizations and other forms of managed care aimed at coordinating services and controlling costs. Often such arrangements restrict patients' choice of doctors, and the doctors often receive flat monthly fees for their services. Medicare recipients can enroll in H.M.O.'s today, but fewer than 10 percent of the 37 million beneficiaries have done so.
 
The Proposal
With Alternatives, Responsibility
 The voucher system favored by many Republicans would push Medicare recipients into the new medical marketplace. Once a year, under this proposal, Medicare beneficiaries would choose which health plan they wanted. They would receive cash rebates if they chose plans charging less than the standard Federal payment, but would have to make up the difference with their own money if they chose plans costing more.
Some might select an H.M.O. covering prescription drugs, routine physical examinations and dental care. Others might prefer a plan with a high deductible that offers less protection at lower cost. Or, Republicans are quick to note, people could choose to stay with the traditional Medicare program.
It is not only conservatives who say Medicare beneficiaries should have more choices, and more financial responsibility for what they choose. In a recent paper on the future of Medicare, Henry J. Aaron, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, and Robert D. Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office under the Democrats, said Medicare recipients now had "little direct financial stake in the selection of health care plans or providers."
Beneficiaries "should bear the financial consequences of their choices," they said. They too propose that the Government contribute a fixed sum toward the purchase of an insurance policy for each Medicare beneficiary, but with this difference: Each plan would have to provide, at minimum, a package of benefits or services defined by the Government.
"It's too risky to allow variation in benefit packages," said Mr. Reischauer.
By contrast, the conservative Heritage Foundation and many Republicans want to encourage plans to offer different benefit packages, including benefits not now covered by Medicare.
Republicans cite the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program as a model for Medicare. The Federal employees' program is, in effect, a supermarket through which 300 private health plans are offered to nine million Federal employees, retirees and dependents, including members of Congress, White House officials and judges. The Federal Office of Personnel Management supervises the operation, disseminates information on the plans in a standard format and informally encourages insurers to offer new benefits.
In the Federal employees' program, the Government contribution is not simply a flat dollar amount. It is based on 60 percent of average premiums for the six biggest health plans. But the economic incentives are still powerful. Federal employees shop avidly. In the last decade, they have steadily migrated into lower-cost plans.
 
The Debate
Free to Choose, Or Is It Coercion?
 Any debate over a voucher system will focus on this question: Are the elderly being given more options, or are they being forced into lower-cost health plans by a web of financial incentives and disincentives imposed by a Government trying to save money?
Prof. Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University, said that under the Republican proposals, "you would have a larger choice among a more varied set of health insurance products, with all the glory and danger that brings." Beneficiaries would have a wider choice of health plans, he said, but "less choice of a doctor" within many of those plans.
In addition, he said, under these proposals, "the beneficiary would bear the risk of health care cost inflation, whereas now the taxpayer bears that risk."
Republicans like the idea of a defined Federal contribution, or voucher, because it would give the Government more control over Medicare costs. But that is a major source of concern for many Democrats.
"This proposal is put forward as choice, but it's really fiscal coercion," said Judith Feder, a deputy assistant secretary of Health and Human Services.
Given the Republicans' commitment to cut projected Medicare spending by $270 billion, or 14 percent, over seven years, she said, it is clear that the Federal payment on behalf of each beneficiary will grow less than the cost of health care or private insurance, so the value of the voucher will quickly erode.
Republicans reject such forecasts. They insist that the details of their proposal have not been decided. Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, said her party could "guarantee to the seniors of America a payment that would buy them the same basket of services they get under Medicare now."
Representative Bill Thomas of California, the chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on health, said Republicans would not allow elderly people with vouchers to be "shoved out into the cold."
But an underlying assumption of many Republican proposals is that people who choose the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program would pay more: higher premiums, deductibles and copayments.
One of the thorniest problems with a voucher program is how to calculate the Federal payment -- specifically, how to adjust the standard Federal payment for the medical condition of a particular beneficiary. How much, for example, will it take to guarantee that an 85-year-old paraplegic can find decent coverage in the open market?
In theory, plans should receive less money for enrolling healthy people than for signing up sick people. Otherwise, the use of vouchers will probably not save money for the Government and insurance companies may try to exclude sick or frail elderly. So far, actuaries have had difficulty devising a reliable way to make such "risk adjustments."
The Republicans may require health plans to enroll any Medicare beneficiary who wants to sign up. Mr. Vladeck, the Medicare administrator, said that an extensive regime of Federal regulation would be needed to enforce such a requirement and to make sure private health plans do not discriminate against sick elderly people. President Clinton was harshly criticized when he proposed such regulation as part of his plan to remake the nation's health care system, Mr. Vladeck said. But without such regulation, he said, a voucher system will not work.
 
The Politics
Behind the Fight, A Broader Issue
 The Republican voucher proposal, though still under development, is now at the heart of a debate with vast political implications. How voters view the Medicare struggle can frame the 1996 election, strategists in both parties say. Will the Republicans be able to campaign as the party that delivered a balanced budget and a large tax cut? Only if they can deliver on $270 billion in Medicare savings.
Will they be able to produce those savings without being punished at the polls by the elderly and their allies? Only if they can persuade the American people that the changes in Medicare are for the good of the program.
Republicans are clearly on the defensive on this issue, but they have made strides in recent months in pressing their argument that Medicare's costs must be controlled or the program is destined for bankruptcy.
"If I were a Democrat, I would not want to be in a position where Republicans balance the budget, deliver a tax cut and I'm not able to make any points on Medicare," said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster. "If we block them from doing that, we're in a very commanding position with a year left to try to increase our Congressional majority."
Democrats, for their part, are intent on using the coming weeks to remind the American people of Medicare's proud history, and the Democratic Party's role in creating it. "We advocated the program, we got it passed, we've paid constant attention to keeping it solvent and strong and now we're at the barricades defending it and the people who benefit from it from the Republican assault," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader.
The Clinton Administration is also urging caution on Medicare restructuring and regularly denouncing the Republicans' motives, although Mr. Clinton himself has called for about $124 billion in Medicare savings over seven years.
But Mr. Clinton has argued throughout that Medicare cannot be truly overhauled, and thus Federal health care costs cannot truly be contained, without more comprehensive changes to the health care system.
In the end, the struggle over Medicare may turn out to be emblematic of the broader debate now under way between the two parties: Are there jobs, like insuring the elderly, that government simply does better? Or, as Speaker Newt Gingrich put it in his book, "To Renew America," is Medicare "a government monopoly and therefore inefficient, wasteful and slow to adapt to innovations in technology and management"? Would the market forces of the private sector simply do better?
It was an issue decided one way in 1965, but very much open in the summer of 1995.
And it will ultimately be debated, as it was in 1965, with the understanding that Medicare is not just another Government program. As Senator Russell B. Long, Democrat of Louisiana, put it before the Medicare vote 30 years ago: "The spirit in which this law is written draws deeply upon the ancient dreams of all mankind. In Leviticus, it is written, 'Thou shall rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of an old man.' "

1965 -- President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the Medicare bill. The new law provides basic health insurance for Americans 65 and older who are entitled to Social Security or the Railroad Retirement benefits.
 
1966 -- Medicare program goes into effect.
 
1972 -- Coverage is extended to people under 65 who are blind or seriously disabled and to certain people with end-stage kidney failure.
 
1977 -- Responsibility for administering Medicare is transferred from the Social Security Administration to a new agency, the Health Care Financing Administration.
 
1980 -- Coverage of home health services is expanded.
 
1981 -- Congress authorizes gradual increases in deductibles.
 
1982 -- Congress expanded Medicare to cover hospice care for the terminally ill.
 
1983 -- Congress establishes a new method of hospital reimbursement, paying uniform rates set in advance for each patient with a particular illness.
 
1988 -- Congress approves the Catastrophic Coverage Act to protect Medicare beneficiaries from financial ruin because of the high cost of acute illness. To finance it, monthly premiums would gradually increase, and the wealthiest 40 percent would pay an income tax surtax. Angry beneficiaries protest, and in 1989 Congress repeals the law.
 
1989 -- Congress establishes a new method of paying doctors based on a fee schedule rather than "reasonable charges."
 
1990 -- Congress increases the deductible to $100 from $75. It sets Federal standards for private Medigap policies supplementing Medicare.
 
1993 -- Congress removes the limit on earnings subject to the Medicare payroll tax, so the tax applies to apply to all earnings, not just the first $135,000. MONICA BORKOWSKI

HEADLINE: Guarding the Turf, Stepping on Toes;
Henry Stern, Passionate and Blunt, Champions the City Parks

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
There is a certain "Car 54, Where Are You?" quality to careering about the boroughs with Henry J. Stern, New York City's odd duck of a Parks Commissioner, who over two recent days fielded calls from his chauffered Crown Victoria about the mini-crises that roll through a job he would happily keep for life.
He bristled at news that a sulking corporate donor wants a larger sign in Central Park advertising its largesse: "They're trying to push us," he said into the car phone. "If they're so noble, what do they care if the letters are an inch and a quarter high?" 
He perked up at reports that Frieda, a rambunctious circus elephant at a park in Queens, could have a history of dangerous behavior: "Frieda has a record?"
And at a stop to dedicate a playground in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, where a ribbon-cutting ended with complaints from Russian-speaking children and grandparents about teen-age gangs in the park, Mr. Stern listened sympathetically and promised more patrols, then left for his next event.
"It's basically Italians hitting on the Russians," he muttered as he slid into his car.
Friends say the comment was classic Henry Stern, the view of a man who grew up in an immigrant upper Manhattan neighborhood in the 1940's and sees the world in stark ethnic, racial and religious terms. Now, in his second stint as Parks Commissioner, Mr. Stern is one of the most eccentric and controversial members of the Giuliani administration. A tree-loving pixie and master politician, he has what his detractors say is a mean streak in private that sometimes seeps out in public.
For years Mr. Stern has suffered from recurring foot-in-mouth disease, as when he introduced his dog to a group of Chinese-American children in April by saying they could "pet him -- but don't eat him."
No one doubts that Mr. Stern has a very hard job or that he passionately loves the parks. "When Henry was Parks Commissioner, he was living in his own Camelot," said former Mayor Edward I. Koch, his old boss and longtime friend.
Mr. Stern, a rumpled, scrawny, white-haired 60-year-old, presides over a Parks Department that has been under siege for 25 years. He battles daily to save an empire of 1,500 properties and more than two million trees from further budget cuts at a time when layoffs will soon reduce his roster of full-time workers to a record low of 2,400. He had twice that many when he was Parks Commissioner in the last decade.
Yet Mr. Stern is managing to adjust to a job that has changed with the social, economic and political fabric of New York City in the 1990's. In the 1980's, as a liberal under a Democratic mayor, he was like a general in charge of a personal army, commanding generous public spending for city parks. Today, under a Republican mayor, he must manage the citizens groups and donors who help the parks in lean times. He has also swallowed budget cuts without publicly taking on the Mayor who gave him his job.
"The peculiar nature of our service lends itself to reduction," he said. "Say you cut the grass once a week. The next year, you cut it every three weeks. And so on. If there were a strike and nobody came in and the grass was never cut, what would you have? Long grass. So who would die from long grass?"
The proliferation of crack cocaine has also changed the Commissioner's mission, redefining what a park should be. "It's more than just green space," he said. "Once it was, 'If you build it, they will come.' Now you think, 'Who will use it?' What is the critical mass that will make a park safe?' Because a deserted park is a dangerous park."
Mr. Stern said he had also changed over the years, drifting politically from the left to the center. A longtime Liberal Party member who supported Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in the last election, Mr. Stern is well aware of the people who say that his politics are governed by personal expediency and that this little-l liberal has had to look the other way while a Republican Mayor has cut programs for the poor.
Mr. Stern argues with that. "The ideological divide in New York City politics is not between Democrats and Republicans," he said. "It's between the left and the middle. And I'm in the middle, as is Giuliani."
But does he agree with everything Mr. Giuliani does?
"You can't ask me that question," he said. "He's my employer."
Mr. Stern's supporters say he has done a fine job of defending his empire from even greater budget cuts, and they praise him for putting welfare recipients to work in city parks. His critics, however, many of them former employees, complain about what they call his silly -- if attention-grabbing -- daily events. Mr. Stern has dressed up for events as an astronaut, as King Neptune and as a shepherd, with Little Bo Peep at his side. Last year an elaborate funeral he staged for a tree got lots of press, but it also drew angry complaints about wasted money.
Mr. Stern is infamous for his unusual attention to bizarre details, particularly his propensity to play with numbers, which amuses him but can sometimes humiliate his employees. Once Mr. Stern reduced a secretary's raise so the last two digits of her annual salary would match her age; another time, he held an employee's annual raise to $2,010 because that was 10 times the man's home-telephone area code. "It was to tease him," Mr. Stern said. "He might have gotten more if he hadn't lived in New Jersey."
No one has ever said Mr. Stern is easy to work for. When he was executive director of parks in 1966, Mr. Stern discovered one afternoon that an attendant at a Brooklyn pool had signed in but was not there. Suspicious, Mr. Stern went to the man's home and found his prey sound asleep. "Eventually, I got fired for that attitude," Mr. Stern said.
Mr. Stern is still known for boring into his managers when he sees something out of order in their parks: a puddle, graffiti on a tree, litter. "The staff feeling is that he has mellowed a bit -- emphasize 'a bit,' " said Jack Linn, an Assistant Commissioner.
 
In Hot Water
Awkward Humor, Or Blatant Racism?
 The staff also cites Mr. Stern's tendency to say things in public that he should not.
This spring, after Mr. Stern haplessly introduced his golden retriever, Boomer, to the Chinese-American children, his remark ignited a minor furor. The Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, shot off a letter to Mr. Stern expressing her "extreme displeasure" with his "offensive comments." In a recent interview in his office, in the Central Park Arsenal, Mr. Stern played down his remark as "an offhand comment made affectionately to a group of about 12 kids." Then he took a political swipe at Ms. Messinger. "If she felt this way, why didn't she call me?" he said. "Why didn't she say, 'Henry, you buh-buh-buh-buh-buh, why did you say that?' But she shot first. And that's politics. She's running for Mayor."
Mr. Stern's associates agree that he has exhibited a pattern over the years of what have been construed as racist remarks to reporters, parks officials and friends. Mr. Stern shrugs that off, too. "I kid around," he said. "I mean, I will say things. I mean, I will tell, in private, Jewish jokes." Mr. Stern admitted that he was "certainly politically incorrect" and that he saw "institutions weakened by crazy racial gerrymandering." He smiled. "I also think that I don't feel guilty," he said, "because I am Jewish, white, male or heterosexual."
One critical official said the Parks Department under Mr. Stern had a "plantation" aspect: The high command is largely white, while the field force is largely black and Hispanic, which has been a problem under most other commissioners as well. Mr. Stern acknowledged that he did not have any blacks in senior management positions. But he also noted that he had appointed the first two black Parks Department officials when he worked for the Parks Department in 1966, and he said he was searching for more black managers.
"You do the best you can, without being ridiculous," he said. "You don't want to appoint someone who can't deliver. There are many qualified people who can do these jobs. I'm just not sure they want to work for the City Parks Department in 1995."
 
Chaos to Go
Tuning In, And Tuning Out
 11:15 A.M., somewhere on the Gowanus Expressway: "Portable One calling Longshot. Shadow, is Rebound there?"
Mr. Stern was in the back seat -- he is Portable One -- radioing his office about what appeared to be a matter of some urgency.
Well, maybe not. "How are you doing on the mail?" asked Mr. Stern when he reached the person he needed.
Mr. Stern uses a walkie-talkie to keep in constant touch with his office, and he gives code names to his staff members, most of them young and male. There is Roadrunner, Starfish, Nairobi. One staff member has rejected Shrimp as a moniker. Frank Raffaele, Yale '95, is "Turtle."
"Commissioner," said Mr. Raffaele one recent afternoon in Mr. Stern's car, "Portable 2 would like to 10-1 you." (Translation: First Deputy Commissioner Alan M. Moss wanted to telephone Mr. Stern.)
"Turtle," Mr. Stern said, "why did I call Commissioner Moss?"
"I think Commissioner Moss would like to talk to you about graffiti," Mr. Raffaele said.
Mr. Stern looked toward a group of birds near 43d Street. "Look at all those pigeons on the light fixtures," he said, absorbed.
Mr. Stern is known for his fascination with animals, living and in sculpture, and he has formed the American Association for the Advancement and Appreciation of Animals in Art and Architecture, or the 7A. That led him to 86th Street and Park Avenue on a recent morning to admire a building that he calls his "mecca"; it has 22 tortoises and 51 hares carved whimsically into the stone. "There they are," he said, marveling.
The people of upper Park Avenue, however, could not help noticing that Mr. Stern was attired in wet Parks Department swimming trunks, a polo shirt and black dress shoes and socks. A woman gave him a strange look, unaware that her Parks Commissioner had been dressing in his car after a sluggish lap of backstroke for a swimming event on the Upper East Side. Mr. Stern resumed dressing when he returned to the car, nonchalantly pulling dress trousers over his wet trunks.
Later in the day, Mr. Stern was back in his office wing chair, with a half-eaten can of peas, a favorite snack, to his right, his collection of ducks spread almost everywhere else and his family photos nearby. Mr. Stern met his wife, Dr. Margaret Ewing, a pediatrician, at a grape-strike fund raiser on the Upper West Side. "This was before lettuce," he said. Today, they have two teen-age sons and live on the East Side.
There are a few other key things that define Mr. Stern. He grew up in Inwood, a mixture of Jewish, Irish and Greek immigrants several generations ago but now a largely Dominican neighborhood. His father made tents. He was a child prodigy, graduating from the Bronx High School of Science at 15. He has been a public servant for nearly four decades, and he makes $110,000 a year. His closest friend was the late Robert F. Wagner Jr., who hired him at Citizens Union, a civic group that monitors city government, when Mr. Stern was between his two appointments to run the parks. (After the Liberal Party and Mr. Wagner backed Mr. Giuliani, the groundwork for Mr. Stern's reappointment as Parks Commissioner was laid.)
Mr. Stern turned 60 recently. "I was always used to being the youngest at everything," he said. "But I still feel the same way. I still feel as immature as ever."

HEADLINE: U.S. Lists 10 Soviet-Built Nuclear Reactors as High Risks

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
Underscoring previous warnings from Western experts about the dangers of Soviet-built nuclear power plants, a Federal intelligence report says 10 reactors in Slovakia, Lithuania, Russia, Bulgaria and Ukraine face an abnormally high risk of failure.
The danger is attributed to design flaws, tattered economies, political disorder and weak regulatory oversight. 
 The 10 reactors, at five power plants, are the most dangerous among a group that poses "significant safety risks," the report says. It was prepared by the Energy Department, distributed to Federal intelligence agencies and made available to a reporter by a private group trying to win financial aid for the troubled plants.
"As a class," the report says, "these reactors continue to experience serious incidents, raising the specter of another accident akin to Chernobyl."
In 1986 the Soviet nuclear power station at Chernobyl near Kiev exploded in the world's worst nuclear accident, killing at least 31 people and spreading significant amounts of radiation across Europe.
All told, about 60 Soviet-designed reactors are operating in former Soviet republics and Eastern Europe.
Russian scientists and managers defend their reactors, saying Western criticism is rooted in ignorance and neglects a series of improvements. United States Energy Department officials have also pointed to "significant progress" made at the power plants.
While Western experts have often voiced alarm over the safety of the Soviet-designed plants, the Federal report is unusual in that it singles out the 10 reactors as particularly worrisome. Because of diplomatic sensitivities, international agencies have tended to shy away from rating the degree of danger of such reactors country by country.
The 10 reactors are Bohunice units 1 and 2 in Slovakia, Ignalina units 1 and 2 in Lithuania, Kola units 1 and 2 in Russia, Kozloduy units 1 and 2 in Bulgaria, and Chernobyl units 1 and 3 in Ukraine.
Unit 2 at Chernobyl was shut down in 1991 after a dangerous fire, and unit 4 was buried in concrete after it blew up in 1986. The report ranks the two remaining Chernobyl reactors as having the highest risk, while the eight other reactors are lumped together in terms of danger.
In interviews, Energy Department officials tried to distance themselves from the report, saying it had been put together over the last two years, was to be periodically updated and in some cases had failed to note improvements and efforts to reduce the dangers.
"We are concerned about the safety status of these plants," said Terry R. Lash, the Energy Department's director of nuclear science. "But I think the host countries have made significant progress in the last two years in making upgrades. Things are on the upswing."
Mr. Lash runs a $121 million program of technical assistance for nuclear plants in the former Soviet bloc, including the ones listed by the report as most dangerous. House Republicans are threatening to cut such aid, although whether they will succeed is uncertain.
Anatoly Shurygin, science attache at the Russian Embassy in Washington, said in an interview that the designs of Russian reactors were comparable or superior to American ones in terms of safety.
"The real problem is economic problems and difficulties," Dr. Shurygin added. "We would be happier to spend much more money for increasing safety."
Gosatomnadzor, a Russian nuclear regulatory agency, told a Russian news agency that the safety of the reactors under its jurisdiction was deteriorating, based on an analysis of plant operations and incidents in 1994 and the first half of 1995.
The agency said engineering support was declining, replacement gear was unavailable and maintenance was being postponed for lack of parts and money.
The Energy Department report was obtained from the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private group in Washington that monitors global nuclear work. It declined to say how it had obtained the report.
The group called for the creation of a $10 billion fund by the West that would allow the 10 problematic reactors to be shut down and replaced. Western countries and international lending agencies have committed $1.2 billion to improve safety, but the council says that is inadequate.
David A. Schwarzbach, a council analyst who studies the troubled plants, said the $10 billion replacement fund would be "a small price to pay compared to the cost of another Chernobyl-class accident."
The Energy Department runs the Government's nuclear work and has an intelligence arm that monitors foreign developments. In 1993 the intelligence office set up a program to single out reactors most likely to have problems and to alert policy makers of "imminent accident dangers."
Dated May 1995, the intelligence office's report was prepared by the Pacific Northwest Laboratory, an arm of the Energy Department in Richland, Wash. The report is titled "Most Dangerous Reactors: A Worldwide Compendium of Reactor Risk Assessments."
The likelihood of a particular plant having an accident was judged on the basis of its design, operations, conditions, regulatory oversight, external events, support systems and political environment.
The report graded the plants on each of these criteria and then ranked them on a scale from A to F, with F the highest risk. All of the 10 worrisome plants were given a D, even though Chernobyl was judged the most dangerous.
These were among the findings:
*Bohunice in Slovakia: "The emergency core-cooling system is dangerously undersized."
*Ignalina in Lithuania: Reactors "remain unstable and difficult to control and rely heavily on operator intervention to keep things from going out of kilter."
*Kola in Russia: "Recently, workers staged a sit-in, protesting delays in pay, and the station received an anonymous phone threat, presumably from a worker, to set Kola afire if wages were not paid."
*Kozloduy in Bulgaria: "Rolling blackouts, mostly during winter months, have plagued Bulgaria since 1984. Often, for every three hours with electricity there is one hour without. This power shortage has resulted in severe demand-side pressure to operate Kozloduy whatever the risk."
*Chernobyl in Ukraine: "Today, conditions at the Chernobyl plant are in many ways worse than those that existed prior to the disastrous 1986 accident."
Many of the balky plants are old and scheduled for retirement. But economic pressures tend to keep them open. The Ukrainian Government has agreed in principle to shut down the remaining reactors at Chernobyl by 2000, but only if the West provides $4 billion for replacements, repairs and waste mitigation.
Armenia is preparing to restart its Metsamor unit 1 out of economic necessity, despite international objections that it is unsafe. The Energy report gives Metsamor a grade of D, though it is not on the list because it is shut down.
"Armenia," the report said, "does not plan to replace the reactor's obsolete control system until after the restart" because of its urgency and a lack of money.

HEADLINE: Clinton Regains His Voice With 3 Speeches

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
Inside the White House they call them "the trilogy" -- the series of highly personal speeches President Clinton has delivered this summer in an effort to re-establish his voice and the power of the President to lead as much through oratory as through legislative agility.
In doing so, Mr. Clinton has harkened back to 1991, when as governor of Arkansas he went three times to his alma mater of Georgetown University to deliver a series of speeches setting out his vision of a "new covenant" between the government and the American people. 
 Now, four years later, having watched in frustration as he was branded an indecisive leader, as his health care proposals died and the Democrats were swept from control of Congress, Mr. Clinton is once again seeking to provide Americans with a road map to his personal beliefs and to show where he hopes to lead them through a second term in office.
His speeches, culminating in Mr. Clinton's strong support for affirmative action programs last week, have touched on economics but largely ranged across the field of social and cultural issues that the Republican Presidential candidates have sought to make their own, from school prayer to violence in the media to affirmative action.
To a large degree Mr. Clinton's approach to the potent issues has been to try to defuse them by telling Americans they can find "common ground" -- classic Clinton to the political strategists who remember him counseling them in 1992 to seek not the "wedge issues" that divide the country, but the "web issues" of coalition.
For while he has taken strong stands, in favor of affirmative action and in support of personal religious expression in schools, Mr. Clinton has also told Americans that the Republicans have presented the country with false choices.
The same First Amendment that bars establishment of a state religion, he said, also prohibits government from barring free exercise of religion. "Affirmative action," he counseled, "did not cause the great economic problems of the American middle class."
Whether the center will hold on such volatile issues is far from certain, as the Republican Presidential candidates vie for support of the religious right and present an almost solid block of opposition to affirmative action as discriminatory. And nowhere is that issue as dangerous to Mr. Clinton as in California, where Gov. Pete Wilson is trying to use it as a stepping stone in his quest for the Presidential nomination.
But simply by speaking out in these areas of controversy, Mr. Clinton may have helped himself, political analysts say.
"If you look at what people saw as the central character deficiency in Clinton, it was not that he was too far to the left or too far to the right," said Carter Eskew, a Democratic political consultant, "it was that he didn't stand for anything and wouldn't take a position on controversial issues."
An array of Presidential advisers from across the various camps in the factionalized White House has had a role in the preparation of the speeches, among them political consultants Dick Morris and Frank Greer; senior speechwriter Donald Baer; senior adviser George R. Stephanopoulos; William Curry, counselor to the president, and Melanne Verveer, the First Lady's deputy chief of staff.
But it has been Mr. Clinton, his aides say, who has been the driving force behind the carefully staged addresses, staying up until the early hours of morning to polish them, persisting with them even when advisers were dubious or fearful of the political consequences.
"These are all issues he has thought about and wrestled with much of his professional and personal life," said Mr. Stephanopoulos. "I think he's really been aching to speak on them."
Administration officials describe the speeches as the culmination of a long period of rumination by Mr. Clinton that began in the November and December days after the Republicans won control of Congress. The defeat, they say, made him more determined to explain who he is perhaps before it was too late and to return to the New Democratic themes of centrism on which he was originally elected.
Some of the ideas started to be forged in the preparations for January's State of the Union address, when Mr. Clinton invited more than a dozen academics and writers to a retreat at Camp David, people like Robert D. Putnam, who had written about civic disengagement in America, and Stephen L. Carter, a professor of law at Yale University who has written about the growing tendency in American law and politics to ban religion from the public realm.
The idea that the July speeches compose a trilogy has become almost talismanic inside the Administration because of the symmetry with the three speeches of 1991. But in reality the sequence of speeches and the number was developed partly through accidents of schedule.
The affirmative action address had long been promised as a culmination of a four-month-long study of preference programs for women and minorities. Mr. Clinton's decision to take on the issue of religion in the schools, by contrast, was controversial inside the White House.
While Education Secretary Richard Riley had strongly supported the President's stand, a number of the President's other advisers had felt queasy about this address and the President's assertion that the First Amendment "does not convert our schools into religion-free zones." The aides feared it could alienate Jewish voters or turn into the controversy of last fall when Mr. Clinton briefly suggested that he would not rule out his support for a constitutional amendment to allow organized prayer that was not coerced. But Mr. Clinton, a practicing Baptist, followed his own counsel.
In fact, the President has really delivered four news-making speeches recently, though one was a less-formal appearance at Vice President Al Gore's conference on the family in Nashville. There, Mr. Clinton endorsed Congressional proposals to require television makers to instill a computer chip that could screen out programs broadcasters coded as violent.
And starting on Monday, Mr. Clinton will extend his theme of common ground to the first of a new set of speeches, these putting forth his views on economic issues and the confrontation over the budget that looms with the Republican Congress.
For political speeches, the addresses so far have been strikingly personal. Mr. Clinton used his brother Roger's problems with drugs to speak about how a person cannot be helped unless he assumes personal responsibility for himself. When speaking about affirmative action, Mr. Clinton recalled graduating from a segregated high school in a state where the poll tax was still in place in 1960. The President even considered delivering his defense of affirmative action from the steps of Little Rock Central High School, integrated under the order of President Eisenhower.
In each case, after receiving speech drafts, Mr. Clinton edited and rewrote them well into the hours before dawn. Last Wednesday the Cabinet members and guests assembled in the National Archives for the affirmative action speech were kept waiting for 40 minutes, in part because Mr. Clinton was still tinkering with his words.
Whatever their effect on their audiences or their political impact, those who know him say the act of giving the speeches has been galvanizing for Mr. Clinton. "They are important not just for the public sense of him but his own sense of self," said Mr. Eskew.

STOCKS
 
Sugar Blues for the Market
Let's see. The stock market soars, led by technology stocks. Microsoft, the highest of tech, reports surprisingly strong earnings. So naturally the market nose-dives, led by technology stocks. At one point in Wednesday's free-fall, in fact, with the Dow down 130, Microsoft shares were $18 below where they'd been two days earlier. What happened? Perhaps it was that dreaded "correction" -- an odd term implying that the notoriously illogical market has some "correct" level from which foolish investors deviate. Or perhaps it was the Wall Street equivalent of gorging on sweets and then crashing after the sugar high. In any case, traders pulled out of it and the market held steady for the rest of the week. Bill Gates won't have to go to work at McDonald's.
 
GREENSPAN WATCH
 
Flirting With Clarity
Alan Greenspan may have had something to do with that market bump, too. If he ever made himself totally clear, of course, the Dow would probably rise or fall 1,000 points in a day. There's no remote danger of him doing that, but last week he did skate perilously close to clarity, saying the economy "may have passed the point of maximum risk." In his usual hedging fashion, he added, "We have certainly not yet reached the point" where no risk remains. But the markets seemed to fix on his optimism, which might mean he has no plans for further interest-rate cuts. Or it might not.
 
ELECTRONICS
 
U.S. TV Maker? No Such Thing
Considering that the average American lives and breathes by the almighty Tube, you'd think making TV sets would be the ideal home-town business. Far from it. Yes, many of the names sound all-American: G.E., RCA, Motorola, Zenith, Magnavox. But G.E. and RCA sets are sold by Thomson of France, Magnavox sets by the Dutch company Philips, and Motorola sets have been renamed Quasars by their Japanese manufacturer, Matsushita. Zenith held on alone -- until last week. A South Korean company called LG Electronics, which makes the Goldstar brand, bought control of Zenith. Now Americans can only sit and watch, at which they're proven experts.
 
TRANSPORTATION
 
Metro-North Strike: Never Mind
For all the fuss, you'd think there had been a strike. Westchester and Connecticut commuters fretted or stayed home or plotted the least painful trek to the subway's far reaches. They watched and waited and talked, talked, talked -- the Strike That Wasn't provided endless conversational fodder. But then Metro-North pulled a trick out of its hat -- a Railway Labor Act cooling-off period -- and, Presto!, no strike threat for four months. Negotiators can get some sleep now, and commuters, after three days at the edge of their train seats, are left wondering whether the whole mess will be back in November. And why does no one mention, by the way, that Metro-North hasn't even raised New York fares for over five years?
 
TOBACCO
 
Is the Marlboro Man Happy?
A survey out last week showed a sharp rise in teen-age smoking -- a big surprise, since that rate had held steady while adult smoking fell. But now, a tough question: Is this good news or bad for the tobacco industry? Last month Philip Morris announced a plan to cut smoking by minors, so presumably it would find this news disturbing. Yet rarely does anyone but a teen-ager start smoking, and if they don't start, there'll be no customers. But let's take Philip Morris at its word, making the next question this: How do you keep kids from starting? It's already illegal to sell minors cigarettes, of course, but that means little. Another survey shows that, nationwide, minors can buy cigarettes 75 percent of the places they try.
 
THINGS MADE IN HEAVEN
 
Scott, Meet Kimberly
It almost sounded like a consumer-hip young couple finding joy in pooling unusual strengths: "Scott is strong in bath tissue and towels; Kimberly is strong in facial tissue." Scott "has nothing in diapers and feminine pads" but "can open a lot of doors in Europe." (As well he should!) But no, this was an analyst talking about Kimberly-Clark's planned purchase of Scott Paper last week, a $7 billion stock transaction the analyst called "a very complementary deal." And it's a deal that would create a powerful rival to the true giant of consumer products, Procter & Gamble. And why is Albert Dunlap smiling? Well, he's chairman of Scott Paper, and he could wind up with $100 million. Nothing to, uh, sneeze at.
 
FRAUD
 
Twice Bitten at Towers?
Two years ago, the gloom was deep for creditors of Towers Financial. Towers descended into bankruptcy; its founder, Steven Hoffenberg, pleaded guilty to fraud, and creditors were out hundreds of millions in an unimaginably vast Ponzi scheme. Then came that fuzzy, golden moment when the pure of heart ride in and do their virtuous best to patch things up. A Los Angeles businessman named John Hall entered the scene, with the hope that he'd do all he could for creditors with Towers' tattered remains. But the fairy tale ends there. A lawsuit now contends that Mr. Hall, too, was merely intent on lining his own pockets -- that he siphoned millions from the patched-up venture by having it pay grossly inflated prices for worthless assets.
 
REGULATION
 
Safety Rules: Hard to Kill
Business is dying to get rid of a lot of environmental, health and safety regulations, and it seemed the reigning Republicans would oblige them. Regulation-slaying legislation, way up there on Congress's checklist, was moving along nicely. But last week, outnumbered Democrats managed to kill it, borrowing the tactic that had sunk Henry Foster's chance to be Surgeon General: talk it to death. And as with Dr. Foster, backers of the bill couldn't quite come up with the votes to cut off debate. "I regret that we have failed the American people again," said Bob Dole, who would have loved to add the bill to his resume as he applies for that job up Pennsylvania Avenue. But environmentalists surely saw no failure.
 
PUBLISHING
 
Let 'em Read Balance Sheets
"I like our core businesses," said Mark Willes. Well, if you say so. It was a bit hard to tell last week. Mr. Willes, after all, is the new head of Times Mirror, whose "core business" is newspapers, and he had just closed New York Newsday, cutting 750 jobs. Just days later, as part of a broad sweep of the broom, he said he would cut 1,000 more newspaper jobs, including 700 at The Los Angeles Times. Yes, costs must be cut, shareholders must be kept cozy and warm, and Mr. Willes, once a General Mills financial executive, is certainly trying to do that. "Core businesses" -- that's the way business people talk, not journalists.

Enter Le Bulldozer

BYLINE: By Thomas L. Friedman 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
Now this could get interesting.
 Jacques Chirac has only been President of France for two months, but in that brief span he has demonstrated that he is going to pose a very different challenge for Washington than his predecessors. Mr. Chirac has signaled that he won't be content playing the traditional French role of annoying the U.S., by ostentatiously asserting French independence but ultimately falling in line behind American leadership. No, no, Mr. Chirac is hunting bigger game. He aspires to supplant Washington as leader of the Western alliance, period, full stop, hand over the keys. 
 With the end of the cold war diminishing the importance of the U.S. security umbrella, and with the missing-in-action Clinton Administration leaving a yawning leadership vacuum on the world stage, who's to say Mr. Chirac won't succeed? As the French President pointedly pointed out two weeks ago: "I believe the Atlantic Alliance does not have a leader."
 Hmmmm. Got any candidates, Jacques? Yes, this could get interesting.
 So who is this man who would be king? Mr. Chirac is not your typical French statesman. Unlike his aloof, cautious and calculating predecessor, Francois Mitterrand, Mr. Chirac is impulsive and impetuous -- a gambler in his own way, whose instinct for snap decisions can border on the reckless. As one diplomat in Paris remarked to me: "Chirac is a bulldozer without a steering wheel, and when one of those is on the road everyone else should put on their seat belts."
 Consider his first two months: He dominated the G-7 summit in Halifax, arm-twisting the other leaders to issue a muscular declaration on Bosnia. He ordered a resumption of French nuclear testing in the Pacific, without consulting any of his European Union partners, and when they protested he sniffed that his decision was "irrevocable." Mr. Chirac startled his country by becoming the first President to acknowledge French responsibility for the deportation of thousands of Jews to Nazi death camps during Germany's occupation of France. And it was Mr. Chirac's sudden ultimatum to the allies -- either reinforce the safe havens against further Serbian attacks or France pulls its troops out of Bosnia -- that triggered a U.S. decision to threaten massive air strikes to deter the Serbs.
 How far can Mr. Chirac lead? That depends on two factors. First, Mr. Chirac needs to be able to lead the European Union before he can lead the West. He needs the E.U. power base as a multiplier of French power and right now many E.U. members -- particularly Britain and Germany -- are wary of Mr. Chirac's impulsiveness, and uncertain whether there is any real strategic vision behind it. Second, France has 12.5 percent unemployment, and it is that number, not Bosnia, that the French public is obsessed with. It is worth recalling that Charles de Gaulle, France's last President to really challenge Washington's leadership, was brought down not by foreign policy but by the 1968 student-worker strike in the streets of Paris.
 There is an opportunity here for the U.S., and a risk. At a time when Washington is tired of leading it has in France a President who wants to lead as much as de Gaulle, but is not, like de Gaulle, congenitally anti-American. Mr. Chirac speaks English and has warm feelings toward the U.S. from his summer working the soda fountain at Howard Johnson's. He is a rare breed: a Gaullist baseball fan. Who knows, maybe he could be to Bill Clinton what Margaret Thatcher was to Presidents Reagan and Bush -- an assertive European leader who encourages U.S. leadership, while acting as Washington's full partner. The danger is that Mr. Chirac's impulsiveness will wear thin on Washington and his European allies and there will be total incoherence in the alliance -- with Washington refusing to lead or be led.
 Thirty-some years ago, John Kennedy and Charles de Gaulle also vied for primacy in the Western community, but that was a clash of two titans, each with a very strong vision of his country's role in the world. For now, Bill Clinton and Jacques Chirac look like pale imitations. One hopes that they will find a way to live with each other's weaknesses, and still work together. If not, they could give living proof to Karl Marx's dictum that all great events and personalities in world history appear twice -- "the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce."

The Vicuna Lacuna

BYLINE: By Maureen Dowd 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Al D'Amato's impersonation of a statesman made my head hurt. And hanging on the words of Howell Heflin was not my idea of how to spend a steamy Friday afternoon.
 But accountability of government is a pillar of our democracy. So I went to hearings all week, and watched Congressional panels on Whitewater, Waco and the Good Ol' Boys Roundup, the racist A.T.F. picnic. 
 The props were unforgettable. Grown men fought for the attention of cameras with a dead man's briefcase. Senators pored over the Roundup invitation, featuring a Redneck Chili Cook-Off judged by "former Rednecks of the Year."
 Congressional hearings are useful, I suppose, although the country still seems pretty confused about what Ronald Reagan knew about Iran-contra, and what happened between Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas. Plus, this is not the Roman Senate. The oratory runs more to Senator Joe Biden vaporizing that the Good Ol' Boys Roundup hurt "the soul of this country" and "the soul of law enforcement" and "the heart and soul" of law enforcement.
 But anyway, let's review what we've learned so far:
 * David Koresh was a pervert.
 * Janet Reno was so green on the job that she was rolled by the F.B.I. in Waco and by the White House in Whitewater.
 * Bernard Nussbaum was such a gifted obstructionist that he could make even an innocent person look guilty.
 * The Republicans have a weakness for conspiracy theories.
 * The Clinton Administration would rather climb a tree to tell a lie than stand on the ground and tell the truth.
 * The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms should be abolished before the Council of Economic Advisers.
 * Good ol' boys are sometimes racists and heavy drinkers.
 * The bottom of a briefcase is in the eye of the beholder.
 You may feel you knew all that already. But this is a Congress more intent on sound bites than civics.
 Senator Arlen Specter said he will convene a panel on the 1992 F.B.I. raid on the white separatist Randy Weaver in Ruby Ridge, Idaho. Senator Barbara Boxer, a Democrat, wants open hearings on Bob Packwood. That way, we could finally prove, beyond any shadow of a doubt, once and for all, absolutely, that Senator Packwood is not the master of his desires.
 Neither was Senator Edward Kennedy, says Senator Mitch McConnell. The Republican Ethics Committee chairman has threatened to hold hearings on Chappaquiddick, the accident that occurred many years ago, before disco. Senator McConnell also would retaliate with a hearing on another Democrat, Senator Tom Daschle, on whether he improperly intervened to help an air-charter company owned by a friend.
 Senator McConnell's threats of revenge hearings are preposterous and tasteless, and perfectly in keeping with the spirit of the 104th Congress.
 Think about it. Why shouldn't the capital complete its descent into partisan madness and get around to all those scandals that got away? The nation's past is riddled with mysteries. Let the hearings commence.
 We could start with that cherry tree. The anti-environmentalism of the Father of His Country is a disgrace. And we could find the smoking teapot of the Harding Administration. We like Ike, but isn't there a piece of unfinished business about Sherman Adams and that coat? What is vicuna, anyway? And where did it go?
 Then Congress could try to get to the bottom of current troubling questions:
 * Does Strom Thurmond know that his hair is the color of Tang?
 * Why does Robert Byrd insist on holding up Senate business with all those references to Brutus and Tacitus? (Call him Tedius.)
 * Did Jesse Jackson teach Bill Clinton to say "Mend it, but don't end it"?
 Oh, and there's that new Senate resolution Senator Byrd got passed saying reporters should have to join legislators in disclosing the sources and amounts of their outside income. Can hearings be far behind? (Who will cover them?)
 First, they'll ask Diane Sawyer questions about her sex life. Then they'll want to know why Larry King never asks follow-up questions. Next they'll try to figure out how bored David Brinkley really is. And then they'll come after me.
 Enough. I'm losing perspective.

HEADLINE: If Your Thinking of Living In/Marble Hill;
A Bit of Manhattan in the Bronx

BYLINE: By JENNIFER KINGSON BLOOM

 BODY:
YES, you have crossed the Harlem River and, yes, that is the northern tip of Manhattan island that you can see to the south. But as residents of Marble Hill are quick to point out, you are not in the Bronx: because of a 19th-century public works project that reshaped Manhattan island and severed its topmost land, Marble Hill is across the river and into what logically should be the Bronx.
It is a quirky and little-known neighborhood whose residents consider it a well-kept secret. Where else in Manhattan can you find a six-bedroom, three-story house on a quiet, tree-lined street with an attic, a basement, an enclosed front porch and a pretty facade for sale for $174,000? Or a three-family house with six bedrooms on an architecturally magnificent street with an asking price of $295,000? 
 Realtors link the low prices partly to the fact that the homes are aging and may need repairs, and partly to the eagerness of elderly sellers, most of whom are retiring to their homelands in the Caribbean. Or to the fact that part of the small neighborhood is a giant public housing project.
There are 4,000 households in Marble Hill, but only 135 private homes. The neighborhood is divided, both physically and socially: clustered near the commercial spine of Broadway are the Marble Hill Houses, an 11-building housing development, while up on "the hill," the former site of marble quarries, are the attractive turn-of-the-century houses that lend the neighborhood its cachet.
"It's a very small area and there's a strong sense of neighborhood community about it," said Susan Goldy, president of the Bronx Board of Realtors. "It has the advantage of lower prices than some of the surrounding communities, like Riverdale, and it's really a very affordable alternative to most of Manhattan."
Rental apartments are easy to come by, but houses do not come on the market with great regularity (at last count, there were only five listed with real estate brokers). Some homeowners and landlords choose only to advertise their properties in the classified section of the local paper, The Riverdale Press, and many transactions are done even more informally. "People just don't move out, and when they do they often sell their homes to their neighbors," said H. Michael Pichardo, executive director of the Marble Hill Neighborhood Improvement Corporation.
In what many residents view as a vote of confidence for Marble Hill, City Councilman Guillermo Linares bought a house on Van Corlear Place a year and a half ago. "We just went driving around and looking, and we saw this house that had a sale sign," Mr. Linares said. "We talked to the owner, we looked at the area, we fell in love with it, and we have been very happy."
Mr. Linares said he had traded a relatively cramped and high-rent apartment in Washington Heights for a house with a backyard, three kitchens, three bathrooms, a finished basement, three bedrooms and an attic.
BUT even Mr. Linares, who was elected to represent the neighborhood in 1991, had not been aware of its existence or its status as part of Manhattan before he began campaigning for office. "Even though I had lived in Washington Heights all this time, I thought that on the other side of the 225th Street Bridge was the beginning of the Bronx," he said.
The confusion is extremely common. While Marble Hill residents vote in Manhattan, do jury duty there, and are represented by Manhattan officials, their municipal services come from the Bronx. Their fight for recognition as a Manhattan neighborhood has persisted for years. As recently as this decade, neighbors turned out in force to oppose the move to change their telephone area code from 212 to 718 (they lost).
Marble Hill was lopped from Manhattan in 1895, when the northern channel of the Harlem River was redug to make way for a ship canal. Soon after, the Spuyten Duyvil Creek was filled in, cementing Marble Hill to the Bronx. The Greater New York Charter of 1897 designated Marble Hill as part of Manhattan but not of New York County, producing decades of headaches and squabbles. In 1939, the Bronx Borough President, James J. Lyons, tried unsuccessfully to annex the neighborhood to the Bronx.
In 1984, the matter was settled with some finality when Assemblyman J. Brian Murtaugh and State Senator Franz Leichter sponsored successful legislation declaring the neighborhood part of Manhattan. Mr. Murtaugh, an Inwood resident, is a longtime Marble Hill enthusiast. "It's just a very unusual niche," he said. "It is one of the most ethnically and economically mixed neighborhoods in New York City, and yet they operate like a small town."
A community council meets monthly. In a recent example of civic activism, Mr. Murtaugh pointed to a successful effort by the police and local residents to close a bodega at 228th Street and Marble Hill Avenue where drug sales had been noted.
Formerly an Irish and Jewish bastion, Marble Hill's population is now about 35 percent black and 55 percent Hispanic. In the 50's, the construction of the Marble Hill Houses brought about the radical demographic change. "The church that I served went from an all white to an all black congregation," recalled the Rev. William Tieck, who served for 31 years as the pastor of St. Stephen's United Methodist Church, an old wooden church at the southeast corner of Marble Hill Avenue and 228th Street that serves as a focal point for the community.
The neighborhood's population of middle-class Hispanic people has continued to grow in recent years, and the first Asians have begun moving in. While whites make up only about 8 percent of the population now, their influence still permeates the neighborhood: Broadway is still dotted with Irish pubs that draw a loyal local clientele, and just over the Kingsbridge border are a kosher bakery and an Orthodox synagogue.
The Rev. Leonis Quinlan, the current pastor of St. Stephen's, moved to Marble Hill in 1991 and said that its heavily Dominican flavor came as a pleasant surprise. "It is Dominican in its essence," he said. "You can smell the foods in the air, you can hear the music. You see older men playing dominos in front of the bodegas, and women in traditional dress."
During the day, the neighborhood is populated -- some would say inundated -- by students from John F. Kennedy High School, a school of 5,100 that was built in 1972 for a student body of 3,500. Residents complain that the students generate noise and litter and crowd the local markets at lunchtime. But aside from the annoyance factor, the school's multiracial student body has caused no racial tensions.
"You don't have racial problems here -- there are no bias crimes," Mr. Pichardo of the neighborhood group said. "Show me another neighborhood in the city with this racial composition, this mix, where people get along." Relations are somewhat less harmonious between homeowners and residents of the housing projects.
UPHILL from the boxy housing projects is a cluster of attractive homes, many of them fixer-uppers. And some multifamily dwellings, like the one for sale at 121-123 West 227th Street, are already occupied by tenants with leases, compounding the difficulty of finding a property.
John Brown, an agent with the Robert E. Hill agency in Kingsbridge, said his office received few inquiries about Marble Hill. "At times we thought that the Marble Hill area was going to experience a renaissance, because of its interesting housing stock and its proximity to Manhattan, but it never did," he said.
Other than a few new health-food stores, there are still no signs that Marble Hill or its environs are going upscale. Yet fans of the neighborhood cite the convenience of its shopping district on Broadway, where mid-price retail stores and supermarkets abound.
Most of the shops lie over the Bronx border, but within easy walking distance. Residents also point with pride to the recently built Allen Pavilion, a community hospital operated by Columbia-Presbyterian hospital just across the river in Inwood. And they note the abundance of transportation options: both Metro-North and the IRT have stations in Marble Hill, numerous express buses run from Broadway and 230th Street to midtown Manhattan, and highways are close by.
On the down side, the neighborhood has no movie theaters, and dining options are limited to pubs and the Riverdale Diner. The noise from the elevated subway line is an annoyance to some residents, and the area's public schools are crowded (there are a few parochial schools just outside of Marble Hill). And, as with any urban area, the neighborhood does have its share of drug problems and blighted properties.
One neighborhood stalwart is Dr. Jeffrey L. Gurian, a dentist and comedy writer whose practice lies across the street from St. Stephen's. Through his career as a professional comedian, he has lured various celebrities to his office for dental work. "When they see the private homes and the trees, they all say it's much nicer than they ever expected," Dr. Gurian said.
On the flip side, Dr. Gurian said, the neighbors are equally astonished by some of his clients. When the actor Charlie Sheen and his bodyguard drove to the office in a stretch limousine, the police came over to check out the situation. "They don't expect to see a big stretch limo up here," Dr. Gurian said.
 Another caption, in the Gazetteer chart with the article, misidentified the house at the left. It was a four-family house at 119-121 West 227th Street, not a one-family house at 46 Adrian Avenue.

SEPARATE BUT EQUAL: It was the routine task of selecting a jury for a trial that provoked a legal settlement of dispute over whether Marble Hill is part of Manhattan or the Bronx. In May, 1984, State Supreme Court Judge Peter J. McQuillan ruled that a Marble Hill woman could not sit on a jury in a New York County murder case, holding that legislative boundaries for the borough and the county were defined differently and that the woman was a Bronx County resident. Judge McQuillan's decision alarmed Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morganthau, who feared it would enable criminal convictions to be challenged if a Marble Hill resident were convicted of a crime in the wrong jurisdiction or if a Marble Hill resident had sat on a jury in the wrong county. To end the confusion, Assemblyman J. Brian Murtaugh and State Senator Franz Leichter sponsored legislation declaring Marble Hill "part of the Island of Manhattan . . . regardless of the construction of the Harlem Ship Canal." The legislation passed, its sole opposition coming from a handful of Bronx legislators.

What's Bill Got That Worked for John, Dick and Yes, Harry

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
Over the years, people have tried to predict market performance based on such factors as hemline lengths, baseball or football championships and the position of the stars in the sky. Another favorite tactic is to correlate returns with presidential elections, which may not be so unreasonable after all.
 Phoenix Investments, a fund and money management company in Hartford, noted in a recent study that stocks perform best in the third year of a presidential cycle, and the company encourages investors to get in the game before it's too late. 
 Despite last week's volatility, the stock market's performance suggests this pattern may hold for the Clinton Administration. Beginning in the days of President Harry S. Truman and covering the next nine administrations, the Standard & Poor's 500 has averaged a 20.6 percent gain in the third year of each term, compared with average gains of slightly more than 9 percent in the first and second years and 13.6 percent in the final year. During President Clinton's term, the S. & P. returned 10.08 percent the first year, 1.32 percent the second year and 20.21 percent through June 30 of this, the third year.
 William J. Newman, chief investment strategist for Phoenix, said the market cycle was not happenstance. "A new administration prefers to take bad medicine early on, so the post-election year is usually not terribly good for the stock market," he said. Then, as presidential elections loom, it tries to put its best foot forward.
 The recent move by the Federal Reserve Board to lower interest rates is just another example of attempts to keep the economy going, Mr. Newman said. The Phoenix conclusion: "It only happens every four years! Don't miss out. Invest today!" Investors are left to wonder, though, if the oversized gains already this year can possibly be sustained.

HEADLINE: Why Some Are Switching to Nursing

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
WHY do people with one college degree leave good jobs to plunk down $25,000 for tuition so they can study tirelessly for 16 months in order to get a degree in nursing?
Ask the 20 students enrolled in the College of New Rochelle's accelerated bachelor of science and nursing program, and the answers are as diverse as the students themselves. 
 Take Marcy Maldonado, 31, one of the students enrolled in the College of New Rochelle's School of Nursing second degree program. Ms. Maldonado, of Queens, said she is seeking retraining because she would eventually like to be a nurse practitioner for the Hispanic community.
"My first degree, in economics, was in such an abstract field that I never felt what I was doing was making a difference," Ms. Maldonado said. "I realized what I missed was working with people. The nursing profession not only involves working with people, but it offers a variety of career possibilities. I know there is a huge need for nurses, especially in Spanish neighborhoods."
Fred Balfour, 42, who is enrolled in the same program, has two degrees, one in business administration and a master's in marketing and finance.
"Financially, I was doing very well," Mr. Balfour said. "I was working in the financial area for the New York City Social Services Department. My motive for getting a third degree? Quite honestly, it is because I have a strong desire to do good, to be of assistance to people in need. Just being in business wasn't enough for me. My wife is a nurse, and I saw how really important her work is."
For the 16 months it will take Mr. Balfour to complete the course, he said his wife has volunteered to be the family's sole breadwinner.
"In addition to the personal satisfaction I hope to find as a nurse, I believe the field of health service is constantly expanding and the opportunities are tremendous," he said. "And salaries are also appealing."
Dr. Connie Vance, dean of the College of New Rochelle School of Nursing, said that starting salaries of former nursing graduates of the second-degree program are ranging between $38,000 and $40,000.
The program, which is intended to provide a fast track to a career change, was begun three years ago. Dr. Vance said: "We developed it in response to the interest in nursing we saw from people with degrees in fields as diverse as banking and dance who were all looking for a way to make the transition to nursing. They queried us because of our reputation as a nursing school. Diversity both in the program and students is a hallmark of New Rochelle's School of Nursing."
Despite their vastly different backgrounds, Dr. Vance said the students share a common trait.
"We find they generally are in the course because they want to serve people," she said. "Nursing is an intimate profession, and that is what students like. Students such as the woman who has a doctorate and had been working as a research chemist, said she missed being involved directly with people."
Second-degree program students, who are mature people in their 30's and 40's, have to be taught differently from younger students, Dr. Vance added. "Ninety-nine percent of our professors have doctorate degrees, and they treat adult learners as a peer group," she said. "A lot is required of the students. The program is arduous. We immerse them in clinical learning experiences right away at small community hospitals and at large urban medical centers in the public health programs and in the home through visiting nurse services."
Currently, there are 20 students -- 4 men and 16 women -- enrolled in the program, which began this month and will be completed in December 1996. The program is kept deliberately small in order to give students personal attention, said Dr. Vance, who added that men have consistently made up 25 percent of the second-degree program's student body.
The School of Nursing, Dr. Vance said, has four degree programs. "The reverse side of the second-degree program is the accelerated program we have for R.N.'s, which leads to a bachelor of science and nursing degree, something a lot of R.N.'s don't have. And we graduated 138 students in May with a bachelor of science degree from our traditional four-year program. We also have a graduate program for masters of science and nursing."
With the advent of health care reform, the graying of the population and the spector of AIDS, Dr. Vance said the demand and opportunities for nurses will "expand and grow to meet the many demands for health care that haven't yet been addressed." She continued: "The emphasis now is on keeping people well. For example, 20 percent of the population in all developed countries is now over 65. And AIDS patients are increasing. What does that signify? That large numbers of nurses will be needed more than ever for health maintenance and home care, making career possibilities for nurses wide open."
Graduates of the second-degree program come from all over the world and have jobs in all areas of health care. For example, Tatyana Falkovich, 42, is a Russian journalist who came to the United States five years ago and now lives in Mamaroneck. Mrs. Falkovich, who previously worked in a physician's office when she first came to the United States, learned about the second-degree nursing program in a newspaper, said her husband Igor Falkovich, a mathematician.
"It was something she liked," he said. "She did well in the course. She graduated in December with a 3.4 average. She is now working as a staff nurse in the general medical unit at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City."
Susan Cavalieri is a biochemist who lives in Larchmont. Mrs. Cavalieri graduated in December 1993. She said she put her first career on hold in order to be at home with her children. "When the time came to go back to work, I felt I really didn't want to be working in a lab all day," she said. "When you're bringing up children, you're constantly involved with people, and I like that, and besides nursing has always interested me. I found the program very intense and demanding and extremely comprehensive."
Mrs. Cavalieri, who now works for a home-care agency, said it took her time to find the right job. "At first I thought of doing research, combining it with nursing, but my children are still teen-agers so I decided it would be better for all of us if I worked closer to home."
But jobs were hard to get, she said. "A lot of hospital nurses were out of work as hospitals were cutting back, and I found myself competing with them," she said. "However, I think that this is only a temporary state of affairs. With the rush to managed health care, I feel that not only will professional nurses be in demand but they will have a lot of increased responsibility."

HEADLINE: Lessons Learned in School-Work Link

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

DATELINE: VALHALLA

 BODY:
WITH a practiced hand and steady eye, David Ferrer examined a group of test tubes containing blood samples to be checked for Lyme disease at the county's Department of Laboratories and Research here.
Such procedures are standard for technicians in laboratories, but David is no ordinary technician. A recent graduate of White Plains High School, he was earning science credit through his school district's School-to-Work program, part of a recently begun national initiative to aid students' transition from school to the workplace. 
 A conference celebrating the first anniversary of School-to-Work was held at Westchester Community College on May 17.
Unlike other programs directed toward the vocational or noncollege-bound student, the Federal School-to-Work Opportunity Act, signed into law by President Clinton in May 1994, is intended for all students. As part of that initiative, New York State received $620,000 to develop programs, with $10 million allocated last year to put the programs into effect. It is possible that $20 million more will be made available this year, according to the national School to Work office in Washington.
Kevin Hart, director of Occupational Education for the Putnam/ Northern Westchester Board of Cooperative Educational Services, said: "It's not about vocationalizing schools. The object of this act is to have students see the relationship between school and work. We're asking districts to think of ways to infuse career education from the earliest grades. Business is interested in the bottom line. They're interested in employees and are very interested in the schools."
As a project that links schools, businesses and the community, School-to-Work is not merely a so-called shadow-job experience. "This has to be more than just employment opportunities," said Jondel Hoye, director of the School-to-Work Opportunities Office in Washington, a joint venture of the United States Departments of Labor and Education. "It's talking about building a system that lets everybody improve their ability to compete. The goal for us is to offer opportunities for all students and to have all employers participate. It's a continuum of the educational process. This is not a substitute for vocational education."
Dr. Augusta S. Kappner, assistant secretary of education for Vocational and Adult Education, said: "What's so exciting -- and so difficult -- is that this requires partnerships on all levels. The future will require all young people to work in careers and to change careers. This gives us a way to apply learning to the world of work. The idea is to invest in states and communities and to use local strategies in a way that integrates the academic and the vocational." In the county, several districts have started pilot projects. White Plains High School and the county are offering from seven to nine students on-site experiences carrying academic credit. Besides David, other classmates have been assigned to locations like the district attorney's office, public information office, and police academy.
Similarly, the Walter Pandas High School in the Lakeland school district has linked its English and math departments around the subject of medicine. Even fourth-graders at the Columbus Magnet Elementary School in New Rochelle had the opportunity to learn about the hotel industry, through classroom and on-site experiences at the Hyatt Hotel in Greenwich.
At the May 17th conference, Joseph Schwatzberg, director of the Occupational Educational Division of the Southern Westchester Board of Cooperative Educational Services, announced the formation of the Westchester/Putnam Partnership, which has received $350,000 to begin pilot school-to-work programs in 12 local school districts.
"These funds are to help plant the seeds for systematic change in the public schools," said Dr. Schwartzberg. "We're not preparing our students for the middle-tier paraprofessional and technical jobs that will be available in the year 2000. The bar has been raised, and we have to meet those standards. At some point, all of us go to work. There's dignity in having preparation for work be part of public education, to be part of the fiber and fabric of the system."
The global economy, with its premium placed on technical and information-based skills, is one of the forces behind the school-to-work movement. "With the changes in society, all kids really need to acquire the skills that are required in the marketplace," said Shirley L. Mow, executive director of the Westchester Education Coalition, a nonprofit organization in White Plains. "While we may be complacent in the county, with our high achievement in many schools, compared to other countries, we're middling.
"Businesses are dissatisfied with what the schools produce, and can't hire graduates. There's a terrible waste of young minds and productivity. When the public educational system got set up, there was a factory model for high schools that was designed for mass immigrants. Now that industry has changed, we still have the same educational system. What we need is problem-solving skills, technology, communications and critical thinking. Young people need to have flexibility so they can adapt their skills to different environments and different requirements."
In school-to-work models, Mrs. Mow said, "the academic learning, the core curriculum of history, math, social sciences, English, is integrated into work-based learning." "The idea is to make it more relevant," she continued, "so that instead of just learning geometry, a student could see how it applies to career clusters such as architecture."
To those who would suggest that school-to-work might resemble internship models already in place in high schools or colleges -- like the 23-year-old senior internship program at Woodlands High School in Greenburgh, known as Woodlands Individualized Senior Experiences -- proponents of the current projects offer evidence of school-to-work's more rigorous approach.
"The difference between this program and the typical co-op is the explicit connection between the classroom and the requirements of the workplace," said Dr. Carol A. Rhoder, associate professor of education at the Pace University School of Education in Pleasantville. Dr. Rhoder's graduate students supervise the White Plains high school students, who are required to keep a journal about their experience, do appropriate readings in relevant professional publications as assigned by their on-site job supervisors, and do a self-assessment of their performance as well as an an oral presentation to faculty and supervisors.
"The focus is on developing kids' thinking skills," Dr. Rhoder said. "I'm traditional, and was really skeptical at first, but to even complete the requirements is very hard. The students put in as much time at the work site as in the classroom. It's a lot of work."
Such has been David Ferrer's experience. "I'm working a lot harder here," said David, who will be attending the State University of New York at Albany in the fall. "I wanted to try something new, to not just be one of the average students. It was frustrating at first trying to make exact measurements before I knew how to do it. What I liked best is that I got hands-on experience, and got to see what my education would be used for. Nothing could really prepare you for this kind of stuff."
His supervisor, Dr. Syed H. Abid, said: "In this department, we have a program for participating for training for the medical college students. In the beginning, I was apprehensive about having high school students. I wondered if their lab technique would be up to it, or if they would be overwhelmed by the sophisticated instruments we have.
"But I've been happy. David has been studious and eager to learn, and is a hard worker. He did all the assignments that I asked him to do. His level of work is equivalent to a freshman or sophomore college student. He was a help in our laboratory and I would be happy to do it again."
 
Teaching Facts of Life To Next Entrepreneurs
 NEW ROCHELLE
ON a sunny summer day, when most of their students would be at the beach, 25 or so high school teachers from the metropolitan area were gathered in a darkened conference room watching a video on how to adapt to change.
The teachers were taking part in a new program called Symposium for Entrepreneurship Teaching, under the auspices of the College of New Rochelle's Taylor Institute here. The three-day institute, offered free to the educators, was designed to provide a hands-on curriculum to teach entrepreneurship in the classroom. The two sessions, which ran July 10 to 12 and July 24 to 26, were sponsored by the Price Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies and the Coleman Foundation.
"Entrepreneurship is the engine that is driving our economy," said Russel R. Taylor, who founded the H. W. Taylor Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies at the college in 1988. "More and more people are starting new businesses. A recent survey by Gallup said that 70 percent of high school students want to have their own business. People do not start their own business to get rich, but to have control of their own destiny. Large corporations are laying off people. Even corporate managers must learn to think like entrepreneurs. So teachers are becoming more and more aware of the need to teach entrepreneurship."
Activities included exercises in using case studies for classroom discussion, a stock market contest to help students understand how the stock market functions, exploration of marketing strategies and suggestions for preparing a business plan.
The Taylor Institute will provide matching grants of $500 to the first 10 schools that put the program into effect.
Dr. Taylor's idea for the symposium grew out of his "Bizkids" program, which has been offered to high school students since 1992. It is currently available at New Rochelle High School and Blessed Sacrament/ St. Gabriel's High Schools. Students receive a $50 loan to purchase products for a business, and those who take part are expected to learn the basics of running a small business.
For the teachers enrolled in the symposium, enthusiasm ran high. "The program sounds terrific," said Noel Bloomfeld, who teaches business courses and computer operation at Our Lady of Victory, a Catholic school for girls in Dobbs Ferry. "I'm really big on what students need to survive in the real world and integrating classroom and real life experience."
Phyllis Rothschild, a business teacher at Eastchester High School, said: "Most of the kids are questioning the necessity of school. They don't have much experience relating what they learn to their lives. This makes it very real to them."
For several of the teachers, adding an entrepreneurial component to the business curriculum made sense in today's economic environment. "Everybody knows people who've lost their jobs after 20 years with a big corporation," said Rosanne Moore, a business education teacher at Yorktown High School.
"We're in the post-industrial revolution, and kids have to be able to deal with change. I think it's the wave of the future of our economy. And kids would like this program because it's hands-on and not theoretical." MERRI ROSENBERG

THE FREEDOM REVOLUTION
The New Republican House Majority Leader Tells
Why Big Government Failed, Why Freedom Works,
and How We Will Rebuild America.
By Dick Armey.

IN 1961, Edward C. Banfield, lamenting the trend toward ideological politics in the United States, invoked France as a warning: "In France, every argument becomes a matter of principle; the practical results are relegated to second place." Two new books by Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, and Dick Armey, the House majority leader, prove that the transplantation to the Potomac of Gallic dogmatism has not been accompanied by a grafting of either Gallic rigor or Gallic subtlety.
The Gingrich book (platform? infomercial?) is impossible to summarize concisely. Stories of Capitol Hill politicking -- some of them quite interesting -- are interpolated among complicated programs for national policy, inspirational sermons and visions of the future glory of the Republic. Topics range from the Contract With America and the third-wave information age to welfare, defense, environmentalism and Rush Lim baugh. Many of the chapters are divided into multistep plans: "Seventh, we should develop a guest-worker program." But certain themes emerge.
Mr. Gingrich has replaced Jack Kemp as the spokesman in today's grim and prim Republican Party for a certain kind of optimistic futurism. Actually he is fascinated less by the real future than by a past future, the antiseptic high-tech future familiar to those of us who grew up between the 1939 World's Fair and the Apollo missions. Science fiction and adventure stories, he tells us, were better in the 50's: "When I was young, Frank Buck's Bring-'em-Back-Alive adventures, Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic, Arthur C. Clarke's visions of space exploration and the American Museum's diving bell exploring the deep oceans made me believe there was a whole universe waiting to be learned and explored."
As this suggests, Mr. Gingrich, a true child of the media age, is constantly comparing the way the past represented itself with the way the present represents itself. "From the Jamestown colony and the Pilgrims, through de Tocqueville's 'Democracy in America,' up to the Norman Rockwell paintings of the 1940's and 1950's, there was a clear sense of what it meant to be an American," he says. For evidence of the health of American society in the 50's, he writes, "go and look at Reader's Digest and The Saturday Evening Post from around 1955." From the biography of George Washington written by another Republican professor-politician, Henry Cabot Lodge, a pioneer of rigorous German-style scholarship in the United States, Mr. Gingrich says he learned that "America must be described in romantic terms. . . . To me, America is a romance in which we all partake."
"To Renew America" should be subtitled "Songs of Innocence and Experience." The Speaker of the House introduces us to his inner child: "At heart, I am still a happy 4-year-old who gets up every morning hoping to find a cookie that friends or relatives may have left for me somewhere." There is no reason to think this kind of naivete is faux; sentimentality about childhood has been part of American culture since the 19th century. Indeed, we owe Mr. Gingrich's political career, we are told, to his visit to a city hall in 1953, when a kindly bureaucrat in the parks department listened to the little boy lobby for a public zoo, inspired by -- what else? -- the movies: "At 4 in the afternoon, after two exciting African safari films, I wandered into the sunlight dreaming of animals and adventure." The dream has not died: "Why not aspire to build a real Jurassic Park? (It may not be at all impossible, you know.)" Mr. Gingrich also now dreams of orbital honeymoons for the space-shuttle set: "Imagine looking out at the Earth from your honeymoon suite. . . . For those who have everything, a long trip in space will be the equivalent of today's sailboat or yacht or private airplane."
Dick Armey's book develops a more consistent argument. It is a duller read, even though an attempt has been made to liven it up with "Armey's Axioms," most of which sound as though Chairman Mao had been converted to Market-Leninism: "To diagnose our problems, we must understand the full anatomy of the political economy -- especially the invisible foot of the government." Like Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Armey would rather talk about economics than social issues. Though he bitterly denounces "radical feminists" and abortion on demand, he claims to find the answer in moral conversion to the antiabortion cause: "And the answer is right here, in the hearts of America's women."
Much of "The Freedom Revolution" is devoted to his retelling of American history as the story of an expulsion from a laissez-faire Eden, with Franklin Delano Roosevelt assigned the role of Satan, whispering seductively in the ear of the electorate. Satan's little helpers are the "talkers" -- that is, what Irving Kristol called the "new class," Dan Quayle the "cultural elite" and George Wallace the "pointyheads." The talkers serve conservatives as a focus for the diversion of discontent that might otherwise be directed at the people who bankroll the Republican Party: the hereditary rich, corporate executives, the professional elite and Wall Street speculators. Like other right-wing purveyors of new-class demonology, Mr. Armey divides the country into virtuous "doers" and sinister "talkers," who are divided into six subspecies: "politicians, educators, journalists, lawyers (!), theologians and entertainers." (Mr. Armey, an educator before he became a politician, must be the exception to the rule that people like him should be doubly distrusted.) The doers know what the talkers deny: "The market is rational and the government is dumb."
Having suffered under the oppressive rule of New Deal talkers since 1932, we Americans were liberated by the victory of strong but silent can-do Republicans in 1994. "My philosophical reason for writing this book," Mr. Armey tells us, "begins with the simple conviction that what happened last November really was, in every sense, a Freedom Revolution -- a revolution in the bold sense of scrapping an entrenched, arrogant political order, of tossing out the moneychangers." For all his revolutionary rhetoric, though, Mr. Armey is relatively modest in his prescriptions -- he only calls for reducing the size of the Federal Government by one-half.
The standards of intellectual honesty governing political tracts are notoriously low; even so, Mr. Armey violates them repeatedly. From figures showing a degree of upward and downward mobility in the 1980's, Mr. Armey infers: "All told, a person in the poorest income group in 1979 was more likely to end the decade in the richest quintile than to remain at the bottom." Really? Was someone making $10,000 in 1979 more likely to be making $120,000 than $12,000 in 1989? Mr. Armey, a former professor of economics, has bungled his math, and is trying to pass off his howler as evidence that "Ronald Reagan proved, as John Kennedy said, that a rising tide lifts all boats."
Mr. Armey tortures history as well as census data in the service of his cause. This is how he describes the heroism of Lech Walesa: "One day some shipyard workers led by an electrician decided, to hell with the millennium, to hell with 'power principles' and 'dialectics' of history and all that." Nowhere in his encomium to Mr. Walesa does Mr. Armey mention that this "small group of people with a great deal of courage" belonged to a labor union.
OF the two Republican leaders, Mr. Armey undoubtedly is more representative of the right, in his combination of anti-statism, anti-intellectualism, anti-feminism, anti-New Dealism and just plain anti-ism. Mr. Gingrich, like Mr. Kemp (who has been marginalized by the right for his pains), wants to include F. D. R. and Martin Luther King Jr. in an ecumenical pantheon. (To be sure, he makes the condescending argument that King triumphed because he proved that blacks are "capable of the personal responsibilities that went with" the rights of citizens.) What is more, Mr. Gingrich, who claims that everything worthwhile that liberals want to do can be done by more market-oriented or decentralized means, sounds at times like a neoliberal. A fundamentalist free-marketeer like Mr. Armey could not have delivered himself of the following: "We have all seen society change for the better in recent years in its views on smoking, drunk driving and racism." (Typically, and perhaps tactically, Mr. Gingrich neglects to mention that coercive acts of the state have been inseparable from all three reforms.)
Mr. Armey is an ideologue, Mr. Gingrich a politician. Mr. Gingrich's elastic first principles give him a degree of strategic maneuverability denied to someone tied to a program, like Mr. Armey. If Mr. Gingrich did become President, his book suggests that the right would soon be denouncing him for betraying conservative ideology by moving to the center. Indeed, the figure in American politics whom Mr. Gingrich most resembles is another graying baby boomer from the South who is also voluble, at home with pop culture and adept at manipulating the media, and who also combines a technocrat's fascination for detail with a philosophy so vague that it can justify any reversal of direction. Mr. Armey's hopes for ideological purity in the Freedom Revolution may yet be dashed by his colleague and leader, the Republican Party's answer to Bill Clinton.

HEADLINE: NOT SO FAST

BYLINE: By Bill McKibben; Bill McKibben is the author of "The End of Nature." His latest book, "Hope, Human and Wild," will be published in September.

 BODY:
HERE'S A SHORT CHEMISTRY LESSON. Grasp it and you will grasp the reason the environmental era has barely begun; perhaps you will grasp the history of the next 50 years.
Put a gallon of gasoline in the tank of your car and go out for a drive. Assuming your engine's well tuned, burning that gallon of petroleum should put about half a pound of carbon in the form of carbon monoxide -- CO -- into the air. A generation ago that number was closer to one pound; by decade's end, as new technologies clean the exhaust, it should drop to barely a tenth of a pound. The steady decrease in CO emissions, as well as in those of nitrous oxide and particulates, is the reason the air is clearer and safer now in Los Angeles than it was a generation ago. 
 On the same drive, however, that gallon of gas will transmute itself into almost five and a half pounds of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide. Long considered proof that gas was burning cleanly, invisible and odorless CO2 is the inevitable byproduct of fossil fuel consumption. It doesn't matter if your car's old or new; there's no filter you can stick on the exhaust to reduce CO2 production. And if the wide international consensus of scientists is correct, this carbon dioxide is now warming the planet more quickly and to higher temperatures than ever in human history.
CO versus CO2 . One damn oxygen atom, and all the difference in the world.
If you focus on carbon monoxide, then you can count yourself among the currently fashionable environmental optimists. Pollution, from their perspective, is an unfortunate byproduct of an essentially sound system. Since smog and its many analogues (river pollution, acid rain, crowded landfills) are precisely the sorts of things that can be tamed with filters and scrubbers, or with small changes in human behavior like recycling, the optimists are in some ways right. Though Congress is even now gutting the laws that have begun to clean America, and though there are plenty of poor and minority communities that never began to get cleaned in the first place, the technology exists to diminish smog, to purify drinking water. It's merely a matter of finding the will to pay for it -- there's no reason for rivers to catch fire. (And every poll suggests that the will is there, that after a quarter-century of hard-fought environmental campaigns the American people are far more convinced than their congressmen that the environment is worth cleaning up.) So if CO turns out to be the real issue, then it's just a systems problem. Environmentalism is a success story, and the world we die in will resemble the one we were born into, albeit with more computers.
That's the conventional wisdom of the moment, best expressed by Gregg Easterbrook in his recent book, "A Moment on the Earth." And yet there are those of us who are not soothed -- who grow more worried with each passing month, and not simply by the fact of a Republican Congress. Those in this second camp tend to be focused on problems like widespread extinction, growing populations, dying fisheries and dwindling wilderness -- signals, like the ever-expanding cloud of CO2 , indicating that our societies and their appetites have simply grown too large. Signals still all but ignored.
Since the environmental movement began, all these crises have been lumped together. The same people who worried about clean air worried about recycling and species extinction, about dirty rivers and the press of population. All these causes are important -- now more than ever as the right attempts to undermine environmental protection -- but acting as if they were all essentially the same crisis carries risks as well as benefits. While it's certainly easier to focus on things like smog, which people see around them every day, the logic of focusing on the most visible pollution cuts both ways. Such a narrowly pragmatic vision is potentially paralyzing precisely because you can clean urban air, you can return fish to the Great Lakes, you can recycle enough to keep landfills from overflowing.
Unfortunately, you can do all these quite vital things without having any real effect on the more systematic troubles. The progress we've made in solving environmental problems is deceptive: we're making no progress at all on the deeper problems, because they do not spring from the same sources. One set stems from a defect in the car; the other set comes from the very existence of the car. And in an odd way, solving the first kind of problem makes the deeper ones ever more intractable -- if visible air pollution starts to decline, then the push for better mass transit dwindles, and with it the chances of cutting the invisible CO2 .
The environmental movement, in other words, has reached a diagnostic crisis. To use a medical analogy: The world has presented itself, complaining of chest pains. After three decades of examination, there are still those who insist it's indigestion and want to prescribe some Bromo. Others say arteriosclerosis, which means our most basic behaviors must change. Most people -- not just C.E.O.'s -- badly want to find out that our problems are not related to our life styles. Change frightens us: we've come to believe, for instance, that our well-being is lashed to constant economic growth. "It's the economy, stupid."
And yet the basic laws of chemistry may soon demand that we give up such fixations. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists assembled by the United Nations, has calculated that an immediate 60 percent reduction in fossil fuel use is necessary to stabilize global climate. This could not happen in a world that closely resembles ours. Addicted to growth, busily spreading our vision of the good life around the globe, we are sprinting in the opposite direction. The growth in our economies and populations wipes out our incremental gains in energy efficiency: from 1983 to 1993, despite a tremendous push toward efficiency by power companies, Americans increased their per capita power usage by more than 22 percent. Electric utilities offered rebates for installing compact fluorescent bulbs, and, indeed, between 1986 and 1991 the typical household added one such light. But as Andrew Rudin pointed out recently in Public Power magazine, the typical household also added more than seven incandescent lamps.
Since the greenhouse effect and other consequences of our civilization's basic momentum have yet to hit us full-on, no mass movement has developed to challenge that momentum. "We are in an unusual predicament as a global civilization," Al Gore said when I interviewed him early in his Vice Presidency. "The maximum that is politically feasible, even the maximum that is politically imaginable right now, still falls short of the minimum that is scientifically and ecologically necessary." And that was before Newt Gingrich.
But this state of affairs may not last. According to the most accurate computer models of global climate, for instance, increased global temperatures may be obvious to the man in the street by decade's end. For all the right-wing bluster about taming the environmental movement, for all the happy-talk books about our ecological triumphs, it will take only a hot summer or two, a string of crop failures or some similar catastrophe to bring these issues center stage once more. A spate of recent studies has begun to make clear that an average temperature increase of only a few degrees hides tremendous heat waves, droughts and storms; the insurance industry has actually begun to worry publicly about the greenhouse effect and the losses it will cause.
If and when such stresses really show themselves, though, we will need an environmental movement that understands what is happening -- that understands that more recycling is not the main answer, that is willing to advocate the unpopular and the disturbing. Partly this means a stepped-up political campaign -- continual pressure on governments around the world to sign and fulfill treaties, share renewable technologies and pass steep new taxes on the use of fossil fuels and other polluters. Already a small segment of the environmental movement has begun to focus on such issues.
But remember the numbers. A 60 percent reduction in fossil fuel use? Even under the most hopeful technological scenarios, it won't happen if we're simultaneously doubling or tripling our economies. More money makes reducing smog easier, because you can afford to build better cars; more money makes dealing with the greenhouse effect harder, because you can afford to buy more cars. So the sweet dream that we'll all grow rich enough to turn green is simply that -- a dream, and one that will turn into a nightmare if we try to follow it.
We face tough choices. The most pragmatic realism, rooted in the molecular structure of CO2 , demands electric cars. It also demands nothing less than heresy: an all-out drive for deep thrift, for self-restraint, for smaller families. Brute objectivity requires new ideas about what constitutes sufficiency: smaller homes, more food grown locally, repair instead of replacement. Environmental visionaries have always talked about simplicity and community, but now atmospheric chemists are starting to say the same things. Not for esthetic and moral reasons, but for eminently practical ones. The world can't support a population of five and a half billion people living like middle-class Americans, much less the eight or nine billion that will soon share the planet with us. That's the crux of the issue -- that and the fact that as long as we go on living the way we do everyone else will want to as well. We need China to stop burning so much fossil fuel -- the developing world now produces as much CO2 as the developed -- but China will pay no attention until we start cutting back too.
Clearly, it's as immoral as it is impractical for us to demand that underdeveloped countries remain underdeveloped -- those countries passionately want to develop. But it's terrifying to imagine Asians owning cars in the same numbers as we do. The only way out of this dilemma is to rethink what we mean by "development" -- and to do it here first. We've exported our passion for democracy, our devotion to human rights. But that's not all we've exported. More than a billion humans, one in five of us, watch "Baywatch" every week. If the good life whose pictures we flash around the world doesn't change, then all the treaties on earth won't do the job. We need bicycles and we need buses, and we need to make them seem as marvelous as Miatas.
Rush Limbaugh has it right when he denounces environmentalists as a threat to current ways of life. The systemic environmentalism he fears has one question to ask: "How much is enough?" How much convenience, how many people, how much money? It's a question that won't go away. It's a question with a time limit, too: either we make these changes soon, or it won't be worth the bother.

HEADLINE: The Life and Times Of a Young Rock Band

BYLINE: By ERIN ST. JOHN KELLY 

 BODY:
IT was one of the first warm nights of this cold dark spring. Sri Kesava, a.k.a. Kim Shopov, the pigtailed lead singer of Baby Gopal, was pacing a Brooklyn club, as nervous as a teen-ager giving her first really hip and life-defining party. Ignoring her, a bartender in a "Stupid Is as Stupid Does" T-shirt and an old Polish man ate fried chicken out of Styrofoam containers at the bar. Their chomping on wings and drumsticks appeared undisturbed by the sounds from the black hole of the back room. From behind the gold brocade curtains drifted the band State of Execution's acknowledgement of thanks to "everyone who came down to see us." As recompense the band promised to open up with its song "Whore" for the 30 or so present. The refrain was a predictable "she's a" over and over. A handful of black T-shirted, shaved heads slammed into each other, moshing and snacking from canisters of Pringles potato chips to keep their energy fueled.
For Sri, things were messing up. She and her band had arrived at the show about an hour late. They had apparently been driving around the hinterlands of Greenpoint for some time, perhaps even catching cruel, taunting glimpses of the isle of Manhattan, where they would really rather be playing instead of being ironically relegated to the 996 Club on Manhattan Avenue. Nonetheless, jumpy and swigging from a bottle of imported water, Sri made her way to the sound and light man, who seemed to have had some power over the doings, and she gamely jockeyed for a spot sooner rather than later among Sour, Pittfall, Struggle Within, Nemenon and State of Execution. 
 "If a girl approaches and makes a case to them, people don't get rough and tough," she said later.
By Any Means Necessary is the prevailing credo in the self-perpetuation of a struggling band in New York, particularly at a time when the success of bands like Nirvana has, by most accounts, helped to swell the number of aspirants on the alternative rock scene. "Instead of rock music being on the fringe, bands like Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana and Pearl Jam have made kids pick up guitars, and they want to be in bands," said Richard Sweret, a vice president of A&R at Arista Records.
Clubs like 996 are an all-important preparation and honing experience for the big time. And though the Brooklyn scene may be burgeoning for artists -- a kind of refuge for a New York Bohemia elbowed out of Manhattan by a heartless rental market -- most musicians still have their eyes focused intently across the river. All along Houston Street, on the Lower East Side and in the East Village are bars and clubs that have long been proving grounds for musical waves. And there are other places that open up and close much like clams disappearing into the wet sand. Some that endure have become hallowed grounds of rock -- places like the venerable and filthy CBGB's on the Bowery, which opened in 1973 and where the likes of The Police toured with their first album and Sonic Youth played in the 1970's. And there are places like Brownies on Avenue A and the Mercury Lounge and The Spiral on East Houston and The Knitting Factory, now in TriBeCa. The coveted prize in the struggles among the bands is a slot at one of these clubs, or in venues like the New York Music Festival, which ended yesterday.
Small bands face the common traps and obstacles: personal feuds, individual life goals, disorganization and no money. Baby Gopal has a nucleus from Washington and Sydney, Australia (Sri's hometown), and a fluidly staffed rhythm section currently from Boston and Brooklyn (by way of New Jersey). It does not have a booker or a record deal. Nor does it have a manager.
For now, the ad hoc answer is Sri, petite, blonde, aerobicized, a Krishna follower and at 25 the oldest band member. She has relentless energy for the finances, the scheduling, the phone calls, the merchandising, the selling of the band. She spends her days in the tiny hot office Baby Gopal shares in the Hari Krishna temple on Schermerhorn Street in Downtown Brooklyn with the like-minded band Shelter, trying to get the band dates, planning rehearsals and even stringing the beaded necklaces they sell at their shows along with T-shirts, 7-inch singles and stickers.
"Blood, sweat and tears I tell you," she says. "Takes 10 phone calls to to make one show."
One of the more tangible goals of this band is the eventual ownership of a van, but meanwhile the mode of transport is the guitar player's father's car. On this night in Greenpoint they played with a borrowed bass player, Justin Hogan, too. He was imported from Boston by Al Garcia-Rivera, the drummer, to fill in for a missing Ray, who was in Oregon getting her braces off. Neither Justin nor Ray would be seen nor heard from again. This kind of impermanence plagues nascent bands.
At about 12:30 A.M. (Sri's entreaty had shortened the wait by at least one band) Baby Gopal played a set, sold a single and then loaded up and set out for home, a few members, at least, dreaming that their submissions of promo packs and tapes would pay off somewhere, and that they would someday be be playing before rapt crowds and appreciative bookers.
"It is so bizarre how everything is concentrated on that little hot-dog," Sri says of Manhattan. "If it fell into the ocean the world would be in a void."
 
NEW YORK IS THE MEDIA BASE, 'THE BEST PLACE TO PLAY
 Sri came to America, to New York, to succeed in a way not possible in Sydney. "I decided to spread my wings instead of sit in my own bath water," she says.
"This is where all the labels are," she says. "Where all the magazines are. It is the media base and the best place to play. Boston, New York and D.C. are all accessible from here, and they are the core of alternative music."
Jim Testa, the publisher and editor of the rock fanzine Jersey Beat, says bands are starting younger and hanging in for longer, describing Nirvana's 1992 album, "Nevermind" as a seminal moment.
"It used to be the only reason you played out was because you loved it," he says. "Now being in a quirky original band you can have a reasonable expectation of making a living." He says this is why mediocre bands are "choking the city."
Baby Gopal defines itself against the rock scene in one way. Three of the members are Hari Krishna followers, "devotees" as they call themselves. Band members say they practice sexual abstinence, don't wear leather, indulge in any mood enhancers or eat meat, though there is a vegetarian schism as to whether dairy or onion and garlic are permissible digestibles.
All is not completely forsaken of the traditions and rites of rock. The band is at least multiply pierced and tattooed. And three of the members toil away in minimum-wage employment -- Gayatri, 22, doing part time office help at Road Runner Records; Al, 21, working at the Gap; Alex Burke, the 22-year-old bass player, the child of a Linden, N.J., detective, working at an organic bakery. (She also demonstrates coffee machines at Macy's in Brooklyn on Sundays.)
Sri is otherwise unemployed. Her last job, months ago, was as a companion to an old woman on the Upper East Side who kept giving Sri, who favors athletic-inspired wear, "nice" clothes to wear and had no inkling of Sri's lifestyle. Sri suspects the woman "was a Republican."
Also following in rock tradition the members want to get on MTV, but there are compromises they will not make. Sexiness of the female members is muted to cuteness. At worst their beliefs are a means of exposure; at best, they seek to be a clean-living influence on those who would listen.
The members want to make it so they can give something back, they say. "Fame is wasted on the dizzy," says Sri. They express modest dreams of success.
"I hope to live off my music and stop working at the Gap" said Al the drummer, who "experimented with cigarettes and beer" in seventh grade, but "gave it up."
Sri likens forming a band to finding a marriage partner. Only harder, because you need to find more than one and all at the same time. "It is difficult finding similar music taste, levels of ambition and commitment to the project" she says. Like securing the ideal mate, luck and the misfortunes of others often plays a part.
In March 1994, after arriving from Sydney and acquiring a green card, Sri had what she considered a "really cute" name for a band -- Baby Gopal, the childhood name of Krishna -- lots of ambition and a readymade genre: "Krishna Edge," a somewhat ethereal, pop-like brand of punk descended from "Straight Edge," a hardcore style based on the rejection of drugs, drink and fascist politics.
But Sri had no actual band.
Enter Gayatri, ne Graham Land, a guitarist on a visit home from England. They were introduced by mutual musician friends while Sri was in Washington. For the next three days they worked on songs together and Sri said she spent time "coercing, begging and torturing him to stay and do my band." They wrote three songs but he resisted her siren song. But he resurfaced a few months later and succumbed.
"In my heart I just knew, here is someone I love writing with," she said. "He was frustrated in England." And Sri had quite the lure: she had secured her band a tour.
The band formed with Sri, Gayatri, Al on the drums and a bass player named Leila. They convened to Connecticut and practiced for a week before hitting the road. Leila designed the band's logo and they had T-shirts and stickers made.
"June was a really happening month," Sri says.
The month-and-a-half long tour kicked off at "The Grand," a club in the East Village. "Oh, don't even mention that show to me," Sri sighs. "Everyone's got to go through it, like their first driving experience. I felt like a big dork. I didn't have any of my raps between songs down."
Surviving dorkiness, the group launched its tour, becoming familiar with promoters and gathering fans in places like the Cootie Hut in Florence, S.C. They formed the beginnings of an all-important mailing list of fans, fanzine writers and promoters.
But the tour ended and the band didn't have anywhere to come home to. It lost Leila, who formed her own band with a member of Shelter to whom she was coincidentally engaged. The band members scattered. Al went back to Boston and his girlfriend. Sri and her boyfriend, Ray, the leader of Shelter, moved to New York. Gayatri didn't want to leave D.C. but then came to New York to do what "was best for the band."
So they shopped for a rehearsal space and a place to live, and realized that they couldn't afford much. Neither Sri nor Gayatri had revenue-generating jobs. They ended up with a deal at the Hari Krishna temple in Downtown Brooklyn. The converted synagogue on Schermerhorn Street had room that was cheap and easily renovated.
Their rehearsal space wasn't completely perfect -- it shared a wall with the bingo hall next door. G-5, I-7 being called is clearly audible to the band and the riffs and melodies of Krishna Edge were clearly audible the other way, too. On both sides of the wall people pursued their dreams but Baby Gopal's rehearsal times, so vital to its pursuit, were curtailed as a courtesy.
This winter the band played in Washington and Boston. Soon the band convulsed. The band's second drummer's girlfriend fell into a coma and he had to resign mid-winter. But Al broke up with his girlfriend in Boston and thus unfettered could rejoin the band on drums. The band got a woman named Ray on bass after Leila left. But then Ray disappeared into Oregon to be relieved of her braces. By May they had Alex Burke, and Gayatri was teaching her the Baby Gopal standards like "Tofu" and "Shiva."
There was also a mishap: the band lost a show at ABC No Rio on Rivington Street for failing to get its lyrics on time to the management, which reserves the right to clear the bands for ideology.
Late June brought very good news: J.P., the booker at the coveted Knitting Factory in TriBeCa, called and offered a place on the bill for July 8. This was a needle in a haystack. Gayatri had dropped off a tape at the club in December. Someone at The Knitting Factory finally listened to it.
"Once or twice a month we try to give somebody a break," says Michael Dorf, owner of the Knitting Factory. "We sift through hundreds of tapes and pick stuff that's interesting and not being done. Stuff that is different."
Displaying her customary super-tenacity Sri says: "Getting shows in Manhattan is different than elsewhere where friends and word of mouth work. In New York you drop your record off and then harass them. Like Chinese water torture, you keep dropping water on the same spot."
It broke prisoners, it broke the Knitting Factory. Asked about her hopes for the show, she was guarded and cryptic. "I see the beginning of a relationship with that venue. J.P. is obviously serious about encouraging younger bands."
 
THE NIGHT OF THE SHOW
 At 6 P.M. July 8, Sri, Alex and Al the drummer were running late after a day of sunbathing on the roof of the Krishna Temple. They were late, said Sri, because they were "mental about clothes." Sri had scavenged a piece of Mary Quant-ish polyester, and had sewed an elastic waistband into it to make a long skirt. Alex sported extra-large black hiphop jeans belted below her pierced navel with an Army/Navy store web belt, and Al had buttoned a plaid cotton shirt to the neck with a pair of knee-length cutoffs. Gayatri selected a Bobby Brady T with clean blue jeans, which were instantly greasy after loading the cars with the band's instruments.
Baby Gopal was to open for the Knitting Factory's Main Room bill, which included Baby Tooth, John S. Hall and Fly Ashtray. The $6 show started at 9 P.M. with a 7 P.M. sound check. When the band arrived and found it could put 10 people on the guest list, it made quick calls to friends who could not afford the cover. Baby Gopal met Baby Tooth and after a friendly negotiation, Al agreed to share the drum kit and Alex finagled the bass amp.
The players were chatting nervously. Only four people sat at the bar. Sri wondered out loud whether there was some "alternative scene" in New York that she was not plugged into. The band got fruit and nuts from a local deli, and stood outside the club munching. Alex's fiance arrived, and three other guest-list people came, which seemed to calm the band a bit. As the sun went down, a small line formed to pay the cover charge.
At one point, Sri shook her head loose from a tight ponytail and asked Gayatri "Up or Down?" "Down." That settled, Sri's shorn locks (a la Debbie Harry 1978) had a halo mark where the elastic had been.
At 9:15 P.M. the band took the stage. The audience, now numbering close to 20, stood feet apart in the roomy space. The audience members were clean cut and largely male. They wore oversize T-shirts and below-the knee cutoffs with suede sneakers, mimicking the band. The few young women looked even younger than their ages, with braided pigtails and pleated skirts. One audience member fondled his prayer beads and chanted, barely audible.
"Thanks for coming," announced Sri. "We're Baby Gopal, the first of the Babies tonight." The band launched into its first song. The audience beat time to the music.
In between songs, Sri asked, "Are there any vegetarians in the room?" One of the beer-drinkers shouted, "I like my food dead," and another "Meat is cheap."
"Really?" said Sri, and Gayatri broke the tension with the lead-in to the next song.
At 9:45 the band ended with "Shiva," and the small audience, which had dwindled only slightly, politely applauded.
The band was not satisfied. "I could only hear me," said Alex. "I started to move around a little but I looked out at the audience and saw mostly my friends, so I stopped. It was like playing a rehearsal."
Life looked cheerier the next day. Gayatri returned on Sunday to collect the proceeds.
"We made $107 for the night," said Sri. "We were really pleased with that. Eighty people came through the door throughout the night, and about a quarter of them were there for our show."
Because of the turnout, Sri said, the Knitting Factory booker was fairly enthusiastic.
"It looks like Baby Gopal will be doing more shows there," said Sri. "We've made another New York contact."
And then she added: "Sometimes I really think we'll make it. It seems like you really have to want it."
 
Rock 101
A Hardcore Curriculum
 
1 Computer as Tool -- "Use the Internet" says Michael Dorf, the owner of The Knitting Factory. It is a "whole new medium" to get word out about your band out.
 
2 Bartender Primacy -- "If you are forming a band, you might want to ask a bartender to join first," says Glenn Boothe, A&R and product manager at Caroline Records. Bands with the most friends win. "Clubs don't have that much patience. Even if the promoter likes your show, you have got to pull in a crowd."
 
3 Whole Lot of Love -- "A person or group must have a sense of what they love -- and get good at it," says Hilly Crystal, owner of CBGB's. "It is the emotion that makes them different. After all, the notes are all the same."
 
4 Corn -- "Do all the things that seem really corny," says Jim Testa, editor and publisher of Jersey Beat, a quarterly fanzine. "Be persistent. Work really hard. Keep a list. Mail out postcards. Be picky about where you play."
 
Other advice:
Mix in the club scene of the Lower East Side and East Village and give your band time to gel.
Be lucky.

HEADLINE: Japan's Leaders to Stay On Despite Poor Election Showing

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, July 24

 BODY:
Voters humiliated Japan's governing coalition in nationwide elections on Sunday, weakening its authority but apparently allowing it to remain in power for the time being.
The immediate result may be to paralyze decision-making even further. But in the medium term, it could bring forward new general elections and stimulate a far-reaching political realignment in Japan. 
 "A political vacuum cannot be allowed for even one day," Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama declared at a news conference this morning. "So we have decided to continue in office."
 The coalition Government may be able to remain in power because Mr. Murayama's Socialist Party apparently squeaked by with enough seats that he will not have to resign to take the blame. But it was the Socialists' worst performance on record.
If the result is that the Government remains in office, but weaker than ever, that is the most disappointing outcome of all for American officials. A weak coalition is unlikely to take measures to deregulate and stimulate the Japanese economy, as Washington would like.
The elections were for seats in Parliament's upper house, which is less important than the lower house. The lower house chooses the Prime Minister, and so Mr. Murayama was not on the ballots.
Yet this was the first national election since the collapse in 1993 of a political system under which the Liberal Democratic Party had governed continuously for 38 years. Inevitably, it was regarded as a referendum on Mr. Murayama and the Socialists, as well as on the other members of his coalition.
The Socialists were the biggest losers. They elected only 16 members to the upper house, out of 126 seats up for election.
In contrast, they had held 41 of the seats up for election. The party had set a goal of 22 seats, the same number it won in the upper house three years ago. Members of the upper house serve six-year terms, with half elected every three years.
The main reason that Mr. Murayama may be able to hold on to his office is simply that the coalition is so fragmented that no one knows what would happen if he did resign. None of those with a hand in power seem eager to risk finding out.
Nevertheless, most major newspapers called in today's editions for early elections, saying that the Government had been so weakened that it would be unable to lead Japan effectively.
The Liberal Democrats, who dominate the coalition even though they allow Mr. Murayama to be Prime Minister, won 46 seats. This was more than any other party, but still much less than expected.
The poor performance may affect who is chosen in September to lead the party, and thus to become a leading candidate for prime minister after the next general elections. The present Liberal Democratic leader is Yohei Kono, who is also Foreign Minister, but the poor results could encourage a challenge by Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Trade Minister.
Mr. Hashimoto emerged strengthened from his confrontation with the United States over trade in autos and auto parts, leading to a last-minute settlement in June in which both sides declared victory.
The outlines of what may eventually become a two-party system were faintly visible in the election results. A substantial majority of the seats were won either by the Liberal Democrats or by the New Frontier Party, a new grouping that favors more rapid deregulation and economic and political restructuring.
The New Frontier Party won fewer seats than the Liberal Democrats but psychologically was the biggest victor. It won 40 seats, up from the 19 it had held among those up for election.
Ichiro Ozawa, the secretary general of the New Frontier Party, urged Mr. Murayama to resign or call new general elections. Elections are expected later this year or early next year, but the Prime Minister -- whose decision it would be to call early elections -- appears unenthusiastic about hastening a vote that presumably would result in his party's losing influence in the lower house as well as the upper one.
Voter turnout was 44.5 percent, easily the lowest in any postwar national election. The previous worst turnout was just over 50 percent.
The poor turnout seemed to reflect general distaste for the political parties and the process. A Gallup poll found that 32 percent of Japanese respondents were dissatisfied with the way democracy works here.
Partly because the parties are awkward coalitions of rival factions, they hesitate to take strong positions on specific issues.
Indeed, one of the few parties to take a clear position on a policy matter was the tiny U.F.O. Party, which ran candidates on a platform of making Japan a leader in hospitality toward extra-terrestials.

HEADLINE: Amid Old Brooklyn Factories, A Shrinking Canvas

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
In the last 15 years, artists by the hundreds have advanced on a desolate warren of empty factory buildings and cobblestone streets in Brooklyn known as Dumbo, for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass.
As traffic rumbled overhead, the artists propped up their canvases and put up curtains in sooty Civil War-era buildings abandoned by manufacturers. They began a Friday pizza night as babies were born. They did their laundry by hiring a car service to take them to gentrified Brooklyn Heights next-door. They became patrons of a local espresso bar that serves freshly baked biscotti and cappuccino with extra foam. They felt blessed to be in a quiet old factory district much like SoHo before it became SoHo. 
 But tensions are simmering now in Dumbo, and artists used to living on the edge are living more precariously than ever before.
Interest has grown in developing the waterfront property along the East River. The Jehovah's Witnesses are quietly buying old buildings and noisily jackhammering them to the ground to construct buildings for missionaries that include a health club. And landlords who once welcomed the artists have chilled to their presence.
"I want them out of here so bad I can taste it," said Martin Prince, an owner of a factory building who inherited more than a dozen homesteading artists when he bought the property 14 years ago. "I feel like they are animals and they ought to be put in cages. We're trying to get rid of them. They are in our way."
One painter, Sara Pasti, who pays about $200 a month for a 2,000-square-foot loft apartment, said: "We feel under siege. They are not passive in their desire to have us disappear."
If there is a place off the beaten track, artists in search of sun-drenched space and dirt-cheap rents will find it, just as they did in SoHo three decades ago and as they are doing now in Williamsburg, Red Hook and Greenpoint, in Brooklyn, and Jersey City and beyond. To a large degree, artists tend to define -- both geographically and intellectually -- the resurgent neighborhoods of a city.
Dumbo is a forbidding outpost lined with dark industrial buildings, some with broken windows and graffiti. Mainly an industrial and commercial district, its choppy, potholed streets are deserted at night. Its artist population grew from a couple dozen artists in the late 1970's to more than 400 in the late 1980's but has slipped back to about 200 artists as eviction battles have escalated and worn nerves.
The area has no legal boundaries but is loosely defined by artists as perhaps four blocks wide and seven blocks long, south of the Brooklyn Navy Yard where the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges nearly converge. One section on its southern border is better known as Fulton Ferry Landing. The name Dumbo is thought to have been coined by an artist who lived there some years ago.
"All of a sudden, everybody has discovered the neighborhood that nobody wanted," Councilman Kenneth Fisher, who represents the community, said. "It's unfortunate that it's taken on this threatening air."
Ms. Pasti, who paints portraits of imagined families, has watched Dumbo transform since she settled in 1980 on the top floor of a factory building at 195-201 Front Street. She has carved out a studio for her large canvases and a cozy loft apartment with $20,000 in renovations. Her bedroom, in a freight elevator shaft, is decorated with a ceiling fan, a throw rug and an antique dresser.
On the factory floors below her, there was once the gentle hum of sewing machines. She saw one doll factory go out of business. Then, a company that produced polyester jackets came and went in the mid-1980's, followed by a factory that made lampshades. A garter and suspender factory expanded its business on the second floor after another company moved away. On the ground floor, Mr. Prince, the president of DLX Industries and the building's landlord, has kept busy manufacturing vinyl products like briefcases and folders, between his court battles to root out about a dozen artists. "They're sleazy but they're not stupid," Mr. Prince said.
The artists' existence in Dumbo hangs by a thread on the Loft Law, passed by the State Legislature in 1982. The law requires landlords to bring industrial lofts up to residential occupancy codes and protects tenants from eviction. More than 12 years after the law was enacted, owners and tenants in Dumbo are at each other's throats over the artists' right to remain. Only 250 out of 820 city-registered loft buildings have been legalized.
Before the Loft Law was passed, landlords were only too happy to have anyone paying rent, and the city looked the other way while artists moved in illegally.
In Ms. Pasti's building and in a 100-year-old factory building next-door at 223 Water Street, the landlords say that they cannot afford to convert industrial lofts to legal residences under Loft Law provisions, and that hazardous, flammable materials make them unsafe for tenants. They have filed hardship claims before the city's Loft Board.
"What I'm trying to do is to bring this building back to a cash-positive flow basis as well as improve the building." said Marsha Egeth, a vice president of Horizon Steel Corporation, a manufacturer of storage cabinets. She helps manage the Water Street property that her father bought in 1975. "We're almost bankrupt because of all the legal bills."
On a recent afternoon, Ms. Egeth gave a tour of the dark nooks of the building, stacked with boxes, sheet metal and cabinets. She pointed to about 10 lofts occupied by artists, including one housing an expectant mother. "I'm hysterical," Ms. Egeth said, throwing up her hands. "I'm afraid of a developing fetus with all this chemical influence. It's toxic. They can't be in this building with what we do."
The disputes have gone beyond words, artists say. Their car tires have been slashed. One third of the tenants in the 24 apartments on Water Street were ordered to leave two years ago when an anonymous call was placed to the Fire Department and the loft apartments were found to be in violation of fire codes. Ms. Egeth said the events were not the doing of her management company.
But Deborah Masters, who creates concrete sculptures in a 5,500-square-foot loft for which she pays $700 a month, said tenants in her building on Water Street are each paying $200 a month in legal fees to stake their claim.
"The pressure is real estate," she said. "Because we're here, rich people want to be here also. That's what happened to SoHo. A few artists were there. Then, wealthier people who were art-world hangers-on moved in, and now fashion models are there. Artists can't afford to eat in SoHo anymore."
What Dumbo lacks in galleries, boutiques and easy access to public transportation, it makes up for in a stunning view of the Manhattan skyline and a stark, cinematic quality. A week does not go by that film crews are not shooting scenes for commercials, music videos and movies, Councilman Fisher said.
Over the years, a number of developments have been proposed for the prime waterfront property. David Walentas, the primary developer in Fulton Ferry Landing, envisions a waterfront filled with shops, entertainment, a marina and a park. "It will happen one of these days," he said. There is a separate community initiative, called Brooklyn Bridge Park, that would transform Piers 1 through 5 and the Empire State Park into a regional recreation area.
Some artists are convinced that the encroaching presence of the Jehovah's Witnesses from their world headquarters in Brooklyn Heights also has put dollar signs in the eyes of landlords and exacerbated efforts to evict them. That claim is vigorously denied by landlords who say they have not been approached by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of the Jehovah's Witnesses.
The Witnesses began a massive acquisition campaign in Brooklyn Heights about 15 years ago, buying up old hotels and brownstones. The city shot down their plan to build an apartment tower that would have blocked the view from the Promenade. The Witnesses set their sights on Dumbo, where fewer people live, according to Mr. Fisher.
In the last few years, the Witnesses have rattled the artists in Dumbo who know how to tangle with landlords but not how to deal with a religious group that keeps to itself. On Front Street, the Witnesses have bought at least five old buildings, including a public school and a former lead company, and demolished them, one by one. A deep pit, consuming a city block and surrounded by a corrugated metal fence lined with razor wire, now sits in readiness for a Watchtower printing operation. Further down the same street, volunteer Witnesses are erecting a boxy beige building that will house a recreation center with tennis and racquetball courts and a parking garage.
On a scorching day, the construction workers were expressionless as Mariella Bisson, who paints landscapes, and Ms. Pasti strolled by.
"They are pushing their empire in any direction it will go," whispered Ms. Bisson. "Every business they do business with, they own. It's amazing. They're like army ants. What do you say? They are just going to look at you with robot faces and tell you that your concerns are so well articulated and have you read the Watchtower today. I'm a deeply believing pagan goddess; don't mess with me."
The artists fear that the Witnesses will swallow up their buildings and leave them homeless, but a spokesman for the religious organization said their worries are groundless.
George M. Couch, a vice president of the Watchtower Society of New York, said that the only two sites planned for the area are the recreation center and the printing plant. Last year, the Witnesses opened a 30-story hotel near the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, on Sand Street, for 900 missionaries.
"We've got about all we need, unless it would be something very usable right next to it," Mr. Couch said.
Statements like those do little to allay artists' concern.
"If we are kicked out, in five years, the whole neighborhood will be empty of artists," said Bill Nogosek, a painter dressed in black jeans and a black T-shirt with a silver cross around his neck. "Obviously, there is a big plan in the works."

HEADLINE: Whither CBS?

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER 

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif., July 23

 BODY:
If the Westinghouse Electric Corporation completes a bid for CBS Inc., the reaction inside CBS may be muted relief that the eight-year reign of Laurence A. Tisch as chairman will end.
But the only truly happy people may be at CBS's competitors, cheered that the new owner would be Westinghouse and not an entrepreneurial company with better prospects of reviving the network's sagging fortunes. Executives from the competing networks and analysts said a CBS-Westinghouse combination would pose little threat of a quick comeback for the network. 
 CBS, which as recently as two years ago was the leader in prime-time programming, is now a distant third. And in its recent second-quarter financial report, earnings were down 52 percent, primarily because of lower advertising revenue and higher fees to station affiliates to remain part of the CBS network.
Both inside and outside CBS, Mr. Tisch's policies have been blamed for CBS's lowly position in the industry. His decisions have included selling off CBS's nonbroadcast properties like its music division, declining to expand the business by buying into cable or international interests as his network competitors have done on a large scale and spending only cautiously in areas like buying more television and radio stations.
Because CBS has minimal debt, and might easily have invested more aggressively in its existing operations or expanded into new ventures, critics have been particulary harsh about Mr. Tisch's stewardship.
"CBS is being systematically dismantled," said John Tinker, a media analyst with Furman Selz. And he and other analysts have serious doubts that Westinghouse -- which already has a heavy debt load that it would have to increase to buy CBS -- is the right company to rejuvenate the network.
"Whoever gets CBS has to ramp it up," Mr. Tinker said. "In the media now you have to compete with whole companies, the Time Warners and Seagrams of the world. These are big guys. CBS and Westinghouse, they're not big enough. You've got to have scale. This is not scale."
Beyond speculation about whether Westinghouse is really what a hungry and depressed CBS needs is the question of Mr. Tisch's intentions. The CBS chairman, who last year made a deal that was later abandoned to merge the company with Barry Diller's QVC Network, has not commented on the current negotiations with Westinghouse. Nor has any other CBS executive indicated, even off the record, what involvement Mr. Tisch has had in helping to shape an offer from Westinghouse.
But Mr. Tisch and several advisers did meet with Michael H. Jordan, the Westinghouse chairman on Friday in Manhattan at the headquarters of the Loews Corporation, which Mr. Tisch also controls. Those talks are expected to resume on Monday, according to executives familiar with the discussion.
Wall Street analysts also suggest that Mr. Tisch's interests are being served by leaks of information to the news media about the Westinghouse bid, because Westinghouse's overtures may flush out other potential bidders who might feel the need to come in -- and push up the price beyond the $80 a share, or $5 billion total, that Westinghouse is expected to offer. Since last Monday, when word of Westinghouse's intentions began to spread, CBS shares have climbed from slightly more than $65 to close on Friday at $75.25, up 37.5 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr. Tinker of Furman Selz said almost any of the other media companies that had reportedly looked into buying CBS in the past -- including Turner Broadcasting, Walt Disney, Viacom and Time Warner -- would be better suited than Westinghouse to bringing the network quickly up to speed, both in programming and the alliances the network needs in cable and other forms of media. But, he said, none of those companies have been willing to pay Mr. Tisch's price.
At least one other potential bidder has again expressed an interest, however. Ted Turner of Turner Broadcasting said at an award ceremony honoring him here Friday night that he would have 30 days after a Westinghouse bid is accepted by Mr. Tisch in which to prepare a bid, and that he intended to do so.
But he also said he would first have to complete a deal to buy out Time Warner's 17 percent interest in Turner Broadcasting. Time Warner has long resisted Mr. Turner's broadcast-network ambitions, just as it has resisted his efforts so far to buy back its stake in his company. On Friday, even Mr. Turner characterized his hopes of bidding for CBS as a long shot.
And yet, for some CBS employees the prospect of Mr. Turner's taking over the network makes much more sense than a deal with Westinghouse. After hearing Mr. Turner's comments, one CBS executive said that much of the programming staff was very concerned about Westinghouse's limited media portfolio.
"I really hope Ted isn't joking about making a bid," said the executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Among the potential benefits he cited was that CBS News could combine its efforts with Mr. Turner's CNN. Mr. Tisch's rounds of cost-cutting have hit CBS's once-vaunted news operation particularly hard.
The main question about Westinghouse is whether it can infuse the capital that CBS would need for a comeback. The network's own executives concede that they need to spend money on National Football League coverage and other important sports events. The N.F.L. rights they relinquished to Fox last year will come up for renegotiation in two years.
Analysts also contend that CBS needs to find a way to get into cable programming, a field in which ABC, NBC and Fox are all quite active. "Is Westinghouse going to have enough left after paying $5 billion to pay for anything CBS needs?" asked Dennis McAlpine, who analyzes media and entertainment companies for the investment firm Josephthal, Lyon & Ross.
Westinghouse does have a long history in broadcasting. And its radio and television stations, while not the industry's strongest, are generally considered to be well run. CBS's own stations have turned in only average performances in terms of ratings and profits in recent years, compared with the stations owned by ABC and NBC.
Still, a combination of the Westinghouse and CBS stations would give the company the largest base of stations, if not the strongest, in the country. The combined 13 television stations would reach some 30 percent of the national television audience -- if pending Congressional legislation raises the current 25 percent, 12-station limit, as expected.
Who would run CBS for Westinghouse? William C. Korn, chairman of Westinghouse's broadcasting unit, Group W, is not seen as a likely candidate for the job.
But there may be no need for Westinghouse's chairman, Mr. Jordan, to bring in anyone from the outside to lead CBS. The programming has recently been put in the hands of Leslie Moonves, a highly regarded entertainment executive. Both Mr. Moonves and Peter Lund, president of the CBS Broadcast Group, have strong reputations.
"They can do what you need if they're allowed to do more," Mr. McAlpine said.
Mr. Tisch has always backed his programming department with a strong budget, and he reportedly paid more than $10 million to lure Mr. Moonves from his job as head of Warner Brothers Television. And earlier this year, CBS signed an exclusive deal with Steven Bochco, creator of NBC's "NYPD Blue" and other hits, to develop programs for CBS beginning next year.
But CBS has not made any of the expensive, ground-breaking program deals that ABC has made with new production companies like Dreamworks and Brillstein-Grey Entertainment, nor has it spread CBS's program base to cable and international networks.
Westinghouse's strategy, according to those following the proposed deal, will be to cut back on its other businesses in favor of a streamlined communications company. For many at CBS, that may sound distressingly similar to CBS's "pure broadcasting" strategy, which has left them without interests in cable or international broadcasting.
"The good news is that you find two hits and all the economics change," Mr. Tinker said. "The nightmare is that '60 Minutes' falls apart. Then you've got real problems."

HEADLINE: Universities Taking On Risks To Overcome Fiscal Squeeze

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Facing bigger student financial-aid needs and shrinking government support, a growing number of top universities are pulling endowment money out of stodgy investments like blue-chip stocks and bonds and putting it into much riskier, high-flying corners of the financial markets: venture capital, leveraged buyouts, hedge funds and emerging markets like Poland and Mexico.
Yale University, which pioneered the approach and has embraced it most aggressively, now puts roughly 60 percent of its portfolio into less-conventional -- and generally riskier -- investments. Duke assigns half its endowment to such investments, and Brown and Notre Dame a third each. 
 "The reasons for this are simple," said Scott C. Malpass, chief investment officer at Notre Dame. "The traditional sources of revenue, like tuition and government support, are not going to be as predictable as they have been."
Many universities believe they have already raised tuitions as much as the market will bear. And because tuition is so high, they are using more and more of their own money for student financial aid. At the same time, government support of the universities is unlikely to grow.
So, while Orange County, Calif., Procter & Gamble and others have lost money in risky investments like derivatives, which sometimes looked more like wagers than investments, many financial experts, instead of being alarmed, are cheering the universities' strategies.
Even the recent loss of $128 million by a rogue broker handling accounts for the Common Fund, a nonprofit company that manages $20 billion in investments for some 1,400 universities, appears not to have daunted them.
"We have some level of comfort with the universities that are doing this because of the diversification," said Naomi Richman, a vice president and assistant director of the public finance department at Moody's Investors Service, the financial rating agency, which has given many of these universities its highest borrowing ratings.
Some investment experts, however, express concern. One pointed to the mid-1970's, when colleges ventured to put more money in the stock market and into growth stocks where the profits come from appreciation in price rather than dividends only to be pummeled by a bear market of 1974.
"I'm supremely suspicious," said John Train, a New York investment manager. "This brings back disagreeable memories of '72-73, when university money managers were seized by a rapture that led them into excess risk, and they were punished horribly in '74."
Although recent years have proved relatively kind to many of these investors, there have been missteps and losses, most of them kept relatively quiet. Harvard, for example, marked down its high-risk investment portfolio by $200 million in 1992, when some of its nontraditional investments lost value. Harvard's total endowment was more than $4.7 billion then. It tightened its controls, but stayed with its overall approach.
One widely followed investment expert, Barton M. Biggs, chairman of Morgan Stanley Asset Management, holds up Yale as an example for other institutional investors like pension funds.
"In order to get double-digit returns on any substantial portfolios for the next 5 or 10 years, you are going to have to be in less-conventional assets," he said.
He points out, "Inevitably there will be dark moments."
Universities like Harvard have been drawn to the alternative investment strategy because it is getting harder and harder to beat the markets, said D. Ronald Daniel, Harvard's treasurer. "In some cases, these investments have gotten riskier and more esoteric," he said. "That is not necessarily bad per se. But if you don't have good controls, you can be taken in."
Although the Ivy League universities and other large, top-ranked institutions have generally moved the farthest, smaller colleges are following.
Swarthmore has gradually been increasing its nonconventional investments and now has about 18 percent of its $500 million investment portfolio abroad -- about a third in emerging markets -- and 10 percent in venture capital, high-yield bonds, corporate reorganizations and other alternative investments.
In recent years, these strategies have paid off and generally outperformed the stock market. In the fiscal year ended in June 1994, for example, when the S.& P. 500 index of stocks was up only 1.4 percent (and the Lehman Brothers aggregate bond index was down 1.3 percent), Yale earned 12 percent on its portfolio, Duke 7.7 percent and Brown 6.3 percent.
The more aggressive approach has allowed universities to use millions of dollars that they earn in the markets to help pay for salaries, student aid and other costs, and still pour millions of dollars back into their endowment funds to offset inflation.
For universities with large endowments, investment income can cover a substantial portion of their costs. Swarthmore, for example, draws more than 30 percent of its operating revenue from earnings on its endowment, Harvard more than 20 percent, and Williams, Bowdoin, Amherst and Smith more than 15 percent of their operating revenues from investment income.
In the current investment climate, many universities have determined that they can afford to spend an amount equal to about 5 percent of the assets in their endowments each year. This means they must earn more than 5 percent just to match inflation.
If the inflation rate for educational spending is running at about 4 percent a year (it tends to be higher than consumer inflation), the university then needs to earn a return of 9 percent on its investments to cover the spending and to maintain the real value of endowment.
An extra 1 percentage point return on $100 million brings a university an extra $1 million -- equal to 40 students paying full tuition of $25,000. As of last year, 163 colleges and universities had endowments of more than $100 million, while 17 had endowments of more than $1 billion. The endowment pool for all American universities is $120 billion.
For many universities, the more aggressive strategies are a complete turnabout from where they were just 25 years ago.
Under trust and estate law, it was widely accepted that holders of endowed funds were allowed to spend only what they earned in dividends and interest, and not the increases in the value of the principal. So most invested in conservative stocks and bonds with high payouts and little price appreciation, rather than taking advantage of growth stocks whose prices were soaring but that paid small dividends. As inflation climbed through the 1960's, the real value of their endowments shrank.
McGeorge Bundy, president of the Ford Foundation, berated colleges and universities for their excessive caution. He set up a panel that helped to reinterpret the trust law -- and alter the investment culture -- by changing their focus to an investment's total return, not just the money it actually paid out annually.
Soon, colleges began to invest in a broader range of stocks, and the stock market portion of their portfolios began to climb. Unfortunately, just as they began to move into stocks in the early 1970's, stocks plummeted, and then languished for most of the rest of the decade. It was not until 1982 that the stock market really took off.
Yale was among the first universities willing to enter into less-traditional investments, acting on the belief that as traditional securities markets became increasingly efficient, it had to turn to areas where the market is less efficient to get higher returns. Newly developed investment theories offered further incentive, by showing that riskier investments did not necessarily add up to a riskier portfolio, but that done right, could even cut risk.
The strong performance of universities like Yale, which had an average annual return of 15.5 percent from 1984 to 1994, is helping to convince others that they, too, should move more strongly into alternative investments. For the 10-period ended June 1994, the median investment pool for about 400 colleges and universities achieved an annualized return of 12.7 percent, according to the National Association of College and University Business Officers.
But smaller universities, often with smaller, less-sophisticated staffs and less money to invest, have turned to the Common Fund, the nonprofit investment management company that the Ford Foundation established in 1971 to help colleges and universities improve their sparse returns. In 1988, the Common Fund set up a separate investment arm specifically to handle private investments in energy, real estate, venture capital and other private equity. And notwithstanding the investment problem last month, the Common Fund has done quite well.
Others are also beginning to offer similar help. One new consultant is William Massey, a former chief financial officer for Stanford University and a professor there. He is working with the P. R. Taylor Group, a financial counseling firm in Palo Alto, Calif., to develop investing strategies, to offer advice on the mix of investments and to help in managing investment advisers.
"We think we can bring this technology to smaller colleges," he said. "If you develop a broadly diversified strategy, it can be very profitable."

HEADLINE: At Yale, an 'Original Thinker' Gets Results, and Attention

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
From a roll-top desk in a Victorian mansion on the edge of Yale's campus, David F. Swenson directs the investment of the university's endowment portfolio and other assets.
At 41, he has already run the portfolio for 10 years -- a decade during which Yale's investments have earned an average annual compound return of 15.5 percent, putting it in the top 1 percent of all institutional funds and helping to push the university's endowment to $3.6 billion from $1.1 billion. (Between 1984 and 1994, investment income added $3 billion, while gifts added another $350 million. During that same time, the endowment contributed $880 million to Yale's budget.) He has drawn the attention not only of other university treasurers but also of Wall Street professionals. 
 Barton Biggs, chairman of Morgan Stanley Asset Management, calls Mr. Swenson, "a very bright, original thinker who is also very brave, because victory has a thousand alumni fathers but defeat is an orphan."
As at many universities, Mr. Swenson, as chief investment officer, works closely with the business and financial heavyweights who make up the university's investment committee. In any week, he will often be in touch with one or more members with expertise in an area he is thinking about putting money into.
The committee of 14, which meets quarterly, includes Sid Bass, the Texas billionaire; Diana Brooks, the head of Sotheby's; Richard Franke, chairman of John Nuveen & Co., the municipal bond specialists; Charles Ellis of Greenwich Associates, a financial consulting firm, and William Poorvu, a Harvard Business School professor and private investor.
Yale made early forays into alternative investments beginning more than a decade before Mr. Swenson's arrival: leveraged buyouts in 1973, venture capital in 1976 and international stocks in 1980. But it was not until he showed up in 1985 that it systematically began to direct larger sums into these areas.
The slot of chief investment officer had been open more than a year, before William Brainard, Yale's provost, wooed Mr. Swenson, a senior vice president at Lehman Brothers. Mr. Swenson had earned a Ph.D. in economics at Yale and had studied with Mr. Brainard. Although some universities, such as Harvard and Princeton, pay some of their investment professionals salaries on a par with Wall Street, Yale does not, and Mr. Swenson took a huge pay cut, lured by campus life in New Haven, Conn., and the chance to teach, as well as to help Yale.
So far, the university has done well. Over the past two decades its private equity investments -- where it takes a direct stake in a company rather than buying public shares -- have earned percentage returns in the mid-20's. That has helped raise the average return rate on its portfolio. The 15.5 percent per year average return over the last decade is not far from the performance of the stock markets themselves, but well above the performance of many other universities and institutions.

HEADLINE: Corestates Drops Proposed Merger With Bank of Boston

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Corestates Financial of Philadelphia and the Bank of Bostonannounced yesterday that they had called off a $4.2 billion merger. It was the third time that a potential merger has fallen through for the Boston bank.
The banks said yesterday that they "were unable to agree on a plan that provides sufficient benefits to our shareholders, customers, employees and communities." They had intended to announce the merger this morning. 
 Investors and analysts cheered the collapse of a deal that offered little in the way of cost saving or revenue gain. "Thank God," said Nancy A. Bush, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman.
Hundreds of executives of both banks were poring over each other's books on Saturday before Terrence A. Larson, Corestates' chairman, called off the deal that night.
People close to Mr. Larson said he was troubled by the cultural fit between executives of the two banks. Investment bankers also pointed to the negative reaction of investors; the stock of both companies fell sharply after word leaked of a preliminary deal Thursday night. And the Corestates board may have had concerns about leaving Philadelphia without any major bank company headquarters; the first bank in the country was founded there.
Some investors have been hoping that the Bank of Boston would choose to be acquired outright for $50 a share or more, compared to the roughly $38 in Corestates stock they would have received in the scuttled deal, which had been termed a merger of equals.
Last week, the Mellon Bank Corporation was willing to merge with the Bank of Boston, offering slightly more stock than Corestates; the merged bank would have been based in Boston, a prerequisite of the Bank of Boston board. Nationsbank, and perhaps others, are thought to be willing to pay still more for complete control of the company.
The Bank of Boston board met last night. Afterward, the company sent a statement to its employees indicating that the talks with Corestates had been rocky. While "initially encouraged" by a common focus on customer relations, it said, "it became clear that a common approach would not extend to other aspects of this potential combination." And it did not rule out future talks with other likely partners.
"This is a total embarrassment for the Bank of Boston," said an investment banker.
Ms. Bush of Brown Brothers Harriman said: "Of all the deals that I have ever encountered, that would have been by far the worst. The only thing those banks have in common is the lack of credibility of their managements."
At the beginning of this year, the Bank of Boston was close to merging with Fleet Financial Group of Providence, but when negotiations dragged, Fleet instead bought the Shawmut National Corporation of Hartford. Later, the Bank of Boston was negotiating to merge with First Fidelity Bancorp, but that bank instead sold itself to First Union Corporation.
In these and other negotiations, the Bank of Boston and its chairman, Ira Stepanian, have had a reputation for being difficult and adding conditions after the other side thought terms were complete.
Those familiar with the Bank of Boston said the string of thwarted deals has strained the relationship between Mr. Stepanian and the bank's board.
The Bank of Boston has fewer attractive options left. It could still try to find a similarly sized merger partner willing to move to Boston. But such a deal would hardly please shareholders looking for a premium, and the bank's bargaining position has weakened.
The board could give up its effort to keep the bank based in Boston, and simply auction the company to the highest bidder. Analysts said the bank could probably bring $45 to $47 a share, less than some investors have wanted. The Bank of Boston's mix of business is not the sort for which a big bank would pay top dollar, analysts said.
The majority of its earnings comes from lending to large corporations, one of the most competitive and least profitable areas of banking. About 20 percent of its earnings come from Latin America that while lucrative are of interest only to the handful of the largest banks. Consumer banking, which benefits most from the economies of scale in mergers, represents only 20 percent of the Bank of Boston's profits.
The most likely course now is that the Bank of Boston will halt deal-making and try to remain independent, at least for a while.
"We think we have a very viable company," Charles K. Gifford, the Bank of Boston's president, said in a brief telephone interview yesterday.
But some analysts questioned whether the board would continue to support Mr. Stepanian and Mr. Gifford.
The negative market reaction "does not reflect well on Bank of Boston's management," Ms. Bush said. "There is not a sense that there is a firm hand at the tiller. I would like to see stronger oversight by the board."
Ms. Bush says she is not calling for Mr. Stepanian's ouster, however, because management switches at banks often cause other problems.
Corestates, as a medium-size bank, is also seen as a takeover target, but as such, its stock has risen so much that it would be difficult for a larger bank to buy it at a premium over the current market price.
"Corestates stock is already selling for two times book value, so it's harder for someone to buy it than to buy the Bank of Boston," Ms. Bush said.
Corestates is also in the middle of an extensive restructuring program meant to cut its annual costs by $180 million and analysts do not expect it to rush out and look for another deal.
The uproar among shareholders may quiet the rapid wave of bank mergers. Five deals valued at more than $1 billion have been announced so far this year, three in the last month.
"The outcome here has ramifications beyond the Bank of Boston," said Orin S. Kramer, general partner of Boston Provident Partners, a Fort Lee, N.J., investment fund specializing in banks. "It stands for the proposition that shareholder interests will not be ignored. It became clear to them that had they gone forward, the deal would have been voted down."
Several bank investors said that large holders of Bank of Boston put pressure on Corestates to scuttle the deal, in effect threatening to become hostile shareholders of the combined bank.

HEADLINE: Taiwan Reports Nearby Firing Of 4 Test Missiles by China

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 23

 BODY:
The Taiwan military authorities said today that China had fired four test missiles off its southern coast on Friday and Saturday, about 85 miles north of Taiwan.
The missile tests, announced last week by the Chinese Army, appear to be one of several steps taken by China to highlight its displeasure with recent efforts by Taiwan to gain international recognition. 
 Tonight, the New China News Agency issued an official commentary accusing Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui, of plotting with "some people" in the United States to declare the island officially independent, and of revealing his plans during a visit to Cornell University last month.
The commentary also accused Taiwan of trying to "squeeze" its way into the United Nations, where China replaced Taiwan in 1971. Mr. Lee recently offered to ease the United Nations' financial woes with a $1 billion contribution.
China has recently threatened to invade Taiwan if it declared independence, even though it has been politically and economically separate from the mainland since Nationalist forces retreated to the island at the end of China's civil war in 1949.
Although Western military analysts do not foresee any invasion soon, last week's missile test announcement sent Taiwan's stock market diving more than 6 percent and forced 144 commercial flights to be re-routed to avoid the area of the tests, which Beijing said would last a week starting on Friday.
"We have spotted four missiles fired by China, two on Friday and two on Saturday," Reuters quoted a senior official from Taiwan's Defense Ministry as saying. "We will continue to keep on high alert for any further activities."
The surface-to-surface, short-range missiles were fired from the Leping military base in the southeastern province of Jiangxi and apparently carried no explosives, according to reports in Taiwan. One missile missed its target and landed harmlessly in the sea, the military official said.
Taiwan newspapers also reported that China had deployed a number of warplanes along its eastern coast, 170 miles across the Taiwan Strait.
A spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, Shen Guofang, played down the significance of the tests, saying they were normal military exercises.
"If you have an army, you have to conduct exercises," Mr. Shen said.
Yet the timing of the tests left little doubt among Western military and political analysts that they were intended to carry a larger message.
Tonight's commentary reinforced it, accusing Taiwan's President of colluding with "some people" in the United States "who always always follow a policy of opposing and splitting China."
"This is the first time for him to have displayed such nakedness and openness in preaching the separation of the motherland by taking advantage of the forum provided by foreigners," the statement said. "The atmosphere surrounding his attempt to build himself up with the help of foreign forces is also hitherto unknown."

HEADLINE: In America;
Sweatshop Beneficiaries

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The hundreds of thousands of young (and mostly female) factory workers in Central America who earn next to nothing and often live in squalor have been an absolute boon to American clothing company executives like Donald G. Fisher, the chief executive of the Gap and Banana Republic empire, who lives in splendor and paid himself more than $2 million last year.
Judith Viera is an 18-year-old who worked at a maquiladora plant in El Salvador that made clothing for the Gap and other companies. She was paid a pathetic 56 cents an hour. If she wanted to use the bathroom, she had to go through the humiliation of asking a supervisor for a ticket. Anyone who stayed in the bathroom too long was punished by being sent outside to sweep the grounds in the hot sun. 
 Donald Fisher should meet Judith Viera, spend some time with her, listen to her as she describes in a still-childish voice her most modest of dreams. She would like to earn enough money to buy a little more food for her mother and two sisters. She would like to go to high school.
But Donald Fisher is a busy man. It takes a great deal of time to oversee an empire balanced on the backs of youngsters like Ms. Viera (and her counterparts in Asia). After all, the Gap had sales of $3.6 billion last year. And Forbes magazine reported that Mr. Fisher himself is worth $1.5 billion.
No, Donald Fisher wouldn't have time for the likes of Judith Viera. Besides, if they had an honest conversation, Mr. Fisher might come to the conclusion that the maquiladora workers were being exploited. That is a conclusion to be shunned with the same intensity that tobacco executives muster for their denials that cigarettes cause cancer.
The free-trade zones in which the sweatshops flourish in Central America and the Caribbean were promoted by the U.S. Government and largely financed by U.S. taxpayers. They are a scandal. In August 1990, the ludicrously named Salvadoran Foundation for Social and Economic Development (Fusades), a group almost entirely financed by the United States Agency for International Development, placed an ad in Bobbin, a major trade magazine for the apparel industry in the U.S.
The glossy full-color ad showed a young woman seated at a sewing machine in a shirt factory. The text spoke directly to executives in the United States. It said: "Rosa Martinez produces apparel for U.S. markets on her sewing machine in El Salvador. You can hire her for 57 cents an hour."
The ad went out of its way to explain that "Rosa is more than just colorful." It assured the executives who would be shelling out the two quarters and seven pennies an hour that "she and her co-workers are known for their industriousness, reliability and quick learning."
In March 1991, the same ad ran in the same magazine, except for one minor change. "You can hire her for 57 cents an hour" was changed to "You can hire her for 33 cents an hour."
At some point between August and March it was decided that at 57 cents an hour the industrious, reliable and quick-learning Rosa Martinez was overpaid!
Warren Hashagen, a senior vice president at Gap Inc., said on Friday that he did not believe the maquiladora system was "inherently" exploitative. "We believe that it is important to pay at a minimum the legal minimum wage, or the prevailing wage for the industry, whichever is higher," he said. Whether that is a sufficient income for the wage earners, he said, is not his call.
"I'm not an economist," said Mr. Hashagen, "and I'm not an expert on Central America to know whether it's an appropriate wage for the cost of living there and for whatever is provided by the factory otherwise."
In fact, while companies like the Gap, J.C. Penney, Levi Strauss and many others reap the benefits, the maquiladora workers are suffering. In El Salvador, for example, they earn less than one-fifth of the amount needed to meet the minimum cost-of-living requirements. In the luxurious suites of the big U.S. apparel companies, the attitude is: that's their problem.

HEADLINE: Japanese Schools Are Different, Not Better;
Cultural Conditioning

 BODY:
To the Editor:
My 20 years as a student of the Japanese educational system lead me to different conclusions from your July 18 front-page article. 
 Japanese education is responsible for Japan's economic growth, you write. Many aspects of Japanese education you praise are cultural factors -- parental involvement, school as a community, shared responsibility for school facilities.
In Japan, "Government spending on education accounts for a smaller proportion of its gross national product than in the United States," you write. True, but Japan concentrates spending on precollegiate education. United States Government spending is weighted more heavily toward higher education. In addition, Japanese families spend far more on their children's education than American parents.

HEADLINE: U.S. Prods Nicaragua on Seized Land

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua

 BODY:
From the day she took office five years ago, President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro has struggled with the thorniest problem she inherited from the Sandinista National Liberation Front: how to reimburse the owners of the thousands of houses, farms and factories that her predecessors seized as part of their program of social revolution.
Some 2,200 cases have been resolved and more than $260 million in bonds issued to former property owners. 
 But now the United States Congress, dissatisfied with the pace at which the Chamorro Government is compensating Americans who have claims to confiscated properties, is threatening to cut off aid to Nicaragua. That could be a severe problem in a country whose economy has just started to recover from a decade of civil war between the Sandinistas and American-backed rebels.
The get-tough attitude, championed by Senator Jesse Helms, the Republican from North Carolina who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Representative Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, has been encouraged by the property owners themselves, hundreds of whom fled to the United States and became American citizens when the Sandinistas were in power.
"We are now U.S. citizens, paying taxes, and we don't see why our money should go to this country," said Luis Raul Cerna, a leader of the Association of Bondholders, one of several groups that represents owners of confiscated properties. "I want the U.S. Congress to tell the Nicaraguan Government that in order to get more aid, they must obey the law."
Nicaraguan officials say they are dealing with the claims as quickly as they can under difficult and confusing circumstances, and they have been pleading with the United States to be patient.
They point out that many of the properties were seized without legal formalities, creating a welter of conflicting claims and land titles that have overwhelmed the courts here.
"It is not that there is no political will to solve this problem," Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal Sanchez said in an interview here shortly before heading to Washington to argue Nicaragua's case. "It is that the problem is complex and immense."
To avoid a cutoff of aid, the Clinton Administration must certify by July 31, as it has in the past, that Nicaragua has shown progress in resolving the property issue and in correcting human rights abuses, or else grant a special waiver.
But Congress is considering legislation that would remove that authority from the President and place Nicaragua's fate in the hands of a hostile, Republican-dominated Congress. "They've got to show continued progress, and progress has slowed," Mr. Torricelli said in a telephone interview. "This is a new Congress, and we could just cut off aid."
American aid to Nicaragua, in the form of grants, loans, credit and debt forgiveness, has totaled more than $1 billion since Mrs. Chamorro took office, but has been declining and this year is less than $30 million.
Officials here say that what most alarms them is a provision in the Helms-sponsored bill that in the absence of certification would force the United States to vote against loans to Nicaragua in the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.
Nicaraguan Government figures show about 3,000 claims that have yet to be resolved, and the United States Embassy here calculates that about 1,100 of those involve American citizens. The confiscated properties include family homes and farms and ranches amounting to a quarter of the arable land in this country of 4.5 million people, and also factories, stores, machinery, mines and quarries and even shopping malls.
To satisfy all of the property claims, the Nicaraguan Government estimates that it must raise a total of $650 million. That amount, more than double the size of Nicaragua's foreign reserves and equal to two years' worth of the country's exports, is expected to be raised through the privatization of state-owned enterprises like the national telephone and electricity utilities.
Legislation to privatize Telcor, the state telephone company, and use the proceeds to pay off property claimants is pending in the Nicaraguan Parliament. But Mr. Torricelli challenged the seriousness of that effort, saying: "We've been through this discussion before. There are more imaginative ways to resolve some of these cases."
Emilio Pereira, Nicaragua's Minister of the Economy, said one-third of the claims for compensation had been filed by associates, partners and supporters of the Somoza family dictatorship, which was overthrown by the Sandinistas 16 years ago. The same group, he said, accounts for half of the claims that have been settled.
"They were the first to get American citizenship and the first to pressure Congress," Mr. Pereira said.
Much of the land the Sandinistas confiscated, initially from the Somoza family and then later from others considered unfriendly, was turned into agricultural cooperatives or given to squatters.
More than 170,000 families, most of them poor peasants or refugees from the violence of the 1980's who settled on the edge of Managua and other cities, now live on such parcels, though most are still waiting for formal property titles.
The issue is further complicated by the desire of many property claimants to return to their homes rather than accept compensation. Bayardo Arce, a Sandinista commander, and the Cuban Embassy moved into houses owned by the family of Roberto Arguello, president of the Nicaraguan-American Bankers Association, a situation the family still finds difficult to accept.
"Even though in terms of your overall net worth a house may mean nothing, 99 percent of those who had houses taken away want them back because they have such sentimental value," said Mr. Arguello, who now lives in Miami. "That's where you were born and played and saw your father kissing your mother. It represents family, values, tradition."
In addition, many of those already compensated with bonds are unhappy because the bonds are now worth only about 15 percent of face value. "The bonds are a joke right now," Mr. Cerna said.
But several officials here, like Luis Humberto Guzman, the Speaker of Parliament, say there is little legal justification for United States involvement in the controversy. Though many claimants are now American citizens, international law regards them as Nicaraguans, officials contend, because that was their nationality when the properties were confiscated.
The State Department said the American Embassy here "offers assistance regardless of when or how a claimant acquired United States citizenship." But it acknowledged that "principles of international law limit the ability of the United States to 'espouse,' or formally assume as its own, the claims of persons who are not United States citizens at the time their property was confiscated."

HEADLINE: Goals Conflict In Plan to Sell Nuclear Unit

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
A plan by the Federal Government to sell the operations that produce fuel for the nation's nuclear power plants -- the largest privatization ever attempted by Washington -- has long been counted on to demonstrate commitment to leaner government. But with the White House ready to announce details of the sale this week, a debate is raging over whether such a sale would do more harm than good.
The central question is one familiar whenever a government sells off a chunk of itself: would a private owner's financial interests be at odds with the national interest? 
 In this case, critics of the plan are worried about what will happen to America's agreement to buy the uranium from 20,000 Russian bombs, which was to be diluted to make fuel for American nuclear power plants.
Eager to increase profits, the newly privatized business will have strong incentives to drive hard bargains with the Russians, even to the point of risking collapse of the deal, which is intended to keep the uranium from falling into the wrong hands, critics say. The privatization effort is a case study, they suggest, of the difficulties of mixing high diplomacy with a bottom-line mentality.
"We could end up with the worst of possible worlds," said Thomas L. Neff, a nuclear weapons specialist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who first proposed the swords-to-plowshares idea but is a critic of how it would be carried out.
Natural uranium metal cannot be used to power reactors or to make bombs until it is enriched, increasing the proportion of the lighter uranium isotope, U-235, to the far more common U-238. To that end, the Government has operated two giant plants in Kentucky and Ohio since the 1950's that manufacture virtually all the fuel for America's commercial nuclear reactors.
But the Department of Energy, which runs the plants, has been widely criticized for sloppy management and the enrichment operation was singled out for privatization by the Bush Administration. In 1992, Congress created an independent Government entity, the United States Enrichment Corporation, which was ordered to cut costs, improve marketing and prepare a plan for selling shares to the public by July 1995.
"We've transformed a Government bureaucracy into a corporate culture," said William H. Timbers Jr., a former investment banker who has been running the company since 1993. Many analysts agree.
The company, based in Bethesda. Md., has renegotiated its contract with the Lockheed-Martin Corporation for technical operation of the two plants, linking payments to productivity and safety. And, on schedule, Mr. Timbers's team produced a privatization plan to sell stock through a public offering or to merge the agency with an existing corporation. By the letter of the 1992 law, all that is needed to go forward is approval from the White House.
But privatization is far from a done deal. One hurdle requiring legislation involves the accounting of the $2 billion sales price for the purposes of deficit reduction. Under a 1985 law to prohibit gimmickry in budget-making, one-time sales of Government assets cannot offset spending. But both Republicans and Democrats are eager to make an exception for the enrichment corporation in order to support budget outlays.
Other barriers to privatization will not be so easily breached. The company wants to take with it not just the two plants but all the uranium controlled by the Department of Energy. And commercial rivals -- uranium mining companies, traders and processors -- are crying foul. James Graham, the president of Converdyn, a company that converts uranium to gaseous form for enrichment, puts it bluntly. "We can't compete with someone who gets the materials for free," he said.
Congressional sources suggest that a compromise is possible. Besides, those opposed to privatization on the enrichment company's terms have a far bigger fish to fry: the company's unique role in the sale of 500 tons of Russia's weapons-grade uranium.
In 1992, the Bush Administration agreed to buy roughly 40 percent of Russia's stockpile over the next 20 years to keep it from terrorists or rogue states. The deal will generate badly needed cash for Russia -- roughly $12 billion at current market prices. And it will provide employment for nuclear engineers who might otherwise be tempted to pursue their careers in Iran. But apparently neither the Bush nor the Clinton Administrations fully understood the legal and economic consequences.
Russia was already exporting substantial quantities of unenriched uranium, depressing prices in a glutted global market. Indeed, in 1991, the Department of Energy supported a suit against the states of the former Soviet Union that ended in agreements sharply restricting uranium exports to America.
The enriched portion of the Russian weapons-grade uranium has since been exempted from laws involving the dumping at unfair prices. But the exemption does not apply to the natural uranium component, which represents roughly a third of the value.
An American buyer of Russian enriched uranium could comply with the law by stockpiling an equivalent amount of domestic unenriched uranium. But this stockpiled uranium could not be resold until 2003 under the trade agreement, and the Russians are demanding payment on delivery.
Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, a longtime supporter of nuclear research, would compromise by permitting the Russians to sell the natural uranium component now for delivery in 2003.But with the delay in delivery, the price would not be as high. The Clinton Administration wants to go a step further, giving the President authority to exempt the natural uranium from trade restrictions if there is no other way to get full value for the Russians.
Another issue is the designation of the enrichment corporation as the "executive agent" -- as America's exclusive negotiator and buyer of Russian enriched uranium. This assignment seemed undisputable in 1992, since the company was part of the Government and was experienced in the handling and marketing of uranium fuel. A first small shipment from Russia arrived at the company's Portsmouth, Ohio, plant on June 23.
But Richard A. Falkenrath, a researcher at Harvard University, believes the exclusive designation is a disaster waiting to happen since the relationship between a privatized enrichment company and Minatom, its Russian counterpart, is "inherently adversarial."
Under the agreement, the American enrichment company and Minatom must renegotiate a price each year for the following year's delivery. But the American company has little reason to be generous, he says: the less it pays, the more profit it will make when it resells the fuel to nuclear utilities and the less capital Minatom will have to sustain itself as a competitor in the global market for enrichment services.
Indeed, Mr. Falkenrath argues that the American company has every reason to play tough, even at the risk of stalemate: the less Russian enriched uranium that reaches the market, the higher the market price of the enriched material that the American company produces. Moreover, he says, the company has no financial motivation to buy Russian enrichment services for more than its own cost -- which is roughly one-third less than the current world price.
Mr. Timbers, the enrichment company executive, makes no secret of his exasperation with these unflattering predictions of how his company will behave. He says a breakdown in the negotiations will lead the Government to name another executive agent. "We can be yanked on 30 days' notice," he said.
What is more, he said, collapse of the agreement would give competitors of his company a chance to buy the Russian enriched uranium. "The sale to U.S.E.C. will happen," Mr. Timbers insisted. "I have a strong incentive to be in the middle of the deal -- not on the outside looking in."
But this argument does not persuade Mr. Falkenrath, or a number of Administration officials who have pressed to modify the mechanics of buying the Russian weapons-grade uranium. They worry that it would be hard to identify the culprit if negotiations break down, and that the White House would be under substantial political pressure to defend the enrichment company.
If specialists in arrangements to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons are concerned that a privatized enrichment company will undermine the deal with the Russians, for-profit players in the nuclear industry are equally worried about the prospect that the enrichment company will pull it off.
Nicholas M. Nikazmerad, the president of Nukem, a division of the German conglomerate RWE, says "the intention of U.S.E.C. is to dominate the commercial nuclear market." He is especially critical of leaving it to the Russians to "blend down" the weapons-grade uranium into reactor fuel because Nukem runs a blending plant in Virginia in partnership with the Babcock & Wilcox Company.
Mr. Falkenrath would like to start afresh. In the best of plausible worlds, he says, a privatized enrichment company would become just another bidder for Russian enriched uranium. That is not likely to happen. It would require renegotiation of the agreement with Minatom, which in the past has been eager to deal with a single Government-backed American buyer. What's more, the loss of the right to act as executive agent would make shares of the enrichment company less valuable, depriving Washington of revenue and offending the members of Congress who represent thousands of union workers at the company's enrichment plants.
To be workable in political terms, any alternative arrangement must satisfy both President Clinton and Senator Domenici. The White House argues that the Government already has sufficient leverage to force the enrichment corporation to buy the Russian uranium at a fair price.
However, Senator Domenici will not easily go along with suspension of import restrictions that protect the feeble domestic uranium industry. Nor would he permit the enrichment company the luxury of weighing its own interests against national security in bargaining with the Russians. He wants to require the White House to open sales to other bidders if the company balks at buying the uranium on schedule.
If revenue from the sale of the enrichment corporation is to be counted in the next budget, a compromise must be reached by late September. Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O'Leary, who has championed the privatization effort as well as the Russian uranium deal, thinks it can -- indeed, that it must. "We're serious about both commitments," she said. "I'm prepared to see it to the wire."

HEADLINE: Clinton Attacks the G.O.P. On Priorities in Budget Plan

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24

 BODY:
Vowing strong opposition to a Congressional budget plan, President Clinton today accused Republicans of abandoning necessary Government programs for the "luxuries" of carrying out large tax cuts and balancing the budget in seven years.
In a speech that aides said was the beginning of a period of concerted lobbying on the budget, Mr. Clinton came close to issuing a blanket veto threat if Republicans failed to heed his own spending priorities in areas like education, Medicare and environmental protection. He said such programs were the "common ground" -- a phrase echoing more frequently in the President's oratory -- and had long had bipartisan support. 
 "I invite senators and members of Congress from both parties to join with me in balancing the budget while protecting our common ground," Mr. Clinton said in an address to Boys Nation, the high school civics program of the American Legion. "If they refuse," he said, "I must continue to act alone if necessary to protect the common ground that brought every single one of you into this White House today."
Thirty-two years ago, Mr. Clinton himself visited the White House as a Boys Nation representative, and a photographer captured the now-famous scene of the Arkansas teen-ager meeting President John F. Kennedy.
White House officials said Mr. Clinton's speech would be followed with three or four budget-related events a week over the next two to three weeks.
On Tuesday, in a ceremony marking the 30th anniversary of Medicare, Mr. Clinton plans to speak out against the Republican program to save $270 billion in projected Medicare spending over seven years. On Wednesday, aides said, he will defend Government programs like empowerment zones to foster urban investment. And on Friday he will stump for education programs before the American Federation of Teachers.
After months of watching from the sidelines, Mr. Clinton stepped into the fiscal debate in June, outlining his plan to balance the budget over a decade instead of across seven years as is favored by the Republicans. He proposed slowing the growth of Medicare far less than the Republicans would and offering smaller tax cuts, targeted to the middle class.
But he has been virtually ignored by the leaders of the Republican-controlled Congress who have persisted in their drive to erase the Federal deficit by 2002. And House and Senate committees are drafting spending bills that make vast cuts in Government programs long cherished by Democrats, like those for day care, housing, job training, the arts and environmental regulation.
Mr. Clinton underlined the points made in his speech with a statement tonight threatening to veto an appropriations bill passed earlier by a House committee that would pare dozens of health and education programs.
On 26-to-15 vote that followed party lines, the House Appropriations Committee approved the measure providing sharply reduced financing next year for the Departments of Labor, Education and Health and Human Services.
The White House now fears a massive "train wreck" of a budget fight in September and October that could shut down the Government. The new Federal fiscal year begins on Oct. 1.
With that confrontation looming, the President today began his campaign to convince Americans that his budget priorities are more reasonable than those of Congress. In his speech, Mr. Clinton extended to the budget debate his recent theme of finding common ground that was laid out in a series of speeches on civic responsibility, religion in schools and in support of affirmative action programs. He said the Republicans were cutting too deeply into areas valued by most Americans, including Medicare, student loans, and enforcement of environmental laws.
"These priorities are not Democratic or Republican priorities," Mr. Clinton said. "They are common-sense national decisions that have served us very well over the last generation."
The President said the country could not afford to make the kinds of program cuts needed to carry out the Republican plan to erase the deficit by 2002 and also provide $245 billion in tax cuts. "The haste of their schedule and the scope of their tax cut are luxuries and this is not a time for luxuries," Mr. Clinton said.
Republicans seemed decidedly unmoved. Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, alluding to the plans of Mr. Clinton and Congressional Democrats to celebrate Medicare's anniversary, said, "They plan a week of cheap shots and nostalgia." And the House Republican Conference released rebuttals to Mr. Clinton, attacking his 10-year plan to balance the budget as insufficient and based on false economic assumptions.

HEADLINE: A Shelter and a Storm;
As Tax Breaks Change, the Working Poor Lose Out

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
For a dozen years Art and Geneva Terry loved living in Allegheny Commons, an apartment project built under a Great Society program that married the needs of the working poor for housing and the desires of the wealthy for tax shelters. Nights at the project fell silent and safe, because the residents of the 134 apartments went to sleep early so they could get up to go to work.
That silence has vanished. This summer, jobless young men congregate in the parking lot, drinking beer from 40-ounce bottles while waiting for another car to pull off the street for a furtive exchange of dollars and drugs. On one steamy night last month a toddler wearing only a diaper wandered on the sidewalk long past dark, while a boom box kept the sandman at bay. 
 The Terrys are among nearly a million of America's retired and working poor who live in more than 400,000 apartments built in the 1960's and 1970's, financed by wealthy investors' tax shelters. Now, many of these people are being squeezed out in favor of the jobless and the homeless, people whom the Terrys blame for the nightly disturbances in their neighborhood.
The problem for people like the Terrys is a 1990 law intended to encourage tax-shelter investors to keep buildings in low-income housing programs rather than switch them to higher market-based rents or even demolish them and convert the properties to other uses. The law accomplishes this by sharply raising the rents going to the investors and using taxpayer dollars to pay those rents. But by law these premium rents can be paid only on behalf of the very poor, like the homeless, who might otherwise be housed in hotels or short-term housing at even greater cost to the taxpayers.
The working poor do not qualify for such generous subsidies, however. Many of them, receiving only a small subsidy, can no longer afford to live in the buildings, or do not want to because of their new neighbors.
The situation at Allegheny Commons shows how an approach to housing the needy that started in the 1960's with modest subsidies and that expected tenants to pay much of the rent is now housing people who pay little or no rent and is using taxpayers' money to give tax-shelter investors much more than they once received. It also illustrates the effect on the working poor of the Government's attempt to pay less over all for housing subsidies than it did two decades ago.
These changes have produced a perverse economic situation in which tax dollars are being used to prop up the tax shelters at a cost that can be more than 14 times the amount an apartment as previously.
"What we have here is the tip of a very, very large iceberg," said Helen Dunlap, a deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. She said the Government had unintentionally created a situation in which tax-shelter investors were deciding what to do with their buildings based on Government handouts and not the market.
Mr. Terry, who is 67, had an even stronger viewpoint. "The way I see it," he said, "the Government's making me live with people who got no jobs, no responsibilities, just so some rich folks don't have to pay taxes. That's crazy, just plain crazy."
The Clinton Administration, House Republicans, advocates of nonprofit housing and the tax-shelter managers all agree that changes must be made, and quickly. The House is scheduled to vote soon on a $200 million down payment on a seven-year effort to replace what an Appropriations Committee report called "the excessive costs under the existing program."
But a key problem is that in any one year the cost of paying higher rents to the tax-shelter investors is much smaller than the cost of a permanent solution, even though in the long run the current policy will cost much, much more. The permanent solution, all the parties agree, would be for the Government to pay off some of the mortgages of the tax-shelter investors and at the same time reduce the subsidy going to rents.
The housing-industry proposal up for a vote would make one-time grants to reduce the mortgages of the tax-shelter investors. If it works, it might save $5.4 billion over 25 years, according to the National Housing Trust, a group that fights for housing for the poor.
But the plan -- and a similar one advanced by the Clinton Administration but not up for a vote -- would cost about $2.3 billion extra over the next seven years. The higher short-run costs make the outlook dubious in a Congress dominated by Republicans who have vowed to eliminate the budget deficit by 2002.
There is a lot of housing at stake. Just in New York City, there are 170 projects with 49,132 apartments covered by the 1990 law, the National Housing Trust said. Ms. Dunlap of HUD said that few if any of these were likely candidates for conversion to market rents or demolition because of the city's rent control laws. The trust also counts 272 other projects with 67,945 apartments elsewhere in New York State and 23 projects with 2,037 apartments in New Jersey. Data on Connecticut were not available.
The problems began in President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society, which, in a drive to build housing for the poor and create construction jobs, focused on short-term benefits.
To attract tax-shelter investors, the Government offered them 40-year mortgages on the buildings, with interest rates of as little as 1 percent. It also guaranteed that if the projects did not bring in enough in rent, it would step in to help the investors pay off the mortgages. It also gave the investors the right to pay off the mortgages after 20 years and then be free of rent regulations.
In the mid-1980's, as the first projects turned 20, the investors that owned the most valuable projects moved to pay off their mortgages. Many such projects were in places like the San Francisco area, where exploding real estate values made the prospect of entering the open market attractive. In one early case, in Alameda, Calif., tenants were told their rents would double.
In 1987, in the face of organized protests and concern that some housing would be demolished to make way for shopping malls or parking lots, Congress imposed a moratorium on such conversions.
Three years later Congress passed the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Home Ownership Act, which took away the mortgage prepayment right and the right to charge open-market rents.
But a commitment had been made to tax-shelter operators, so the law gave them two options for compensation. One was to sell to a nonprofit or local government agency at prices set by the Government. The other was to borrow more money, through bank loans guaranteed by the Government, to both finance repairs and allow the tax-shelter investors to withdraw 70 percent of their equity, much as homeowners do when they take out an equity loan.
Peter Richardson -- a vice president at Boston Financial Property Management, which operates the tax shelter that owns Allegheny Commons -- said his firm prepared an analysis in 1993 for its investors. It compared the costs and benefits of selling the project, which would require the investors to pay income taxes on the proceeds, or taking out $2.5 million in additional loans at market rates, which would provide cash without taxes and maintain the tax shelter.
The bottom line, Mr. Richardson said, was that a sale would net the group of investors $111,000 after taxes, while new loans would net them $540,000. (The loans would be repaid not by the investors but by the Government through rents, while the investors would keep about a third of the loan proceeds, less expenses.)
The tax-shelter investors, not surprisingly, chose the new loans, setting the stage for the project's transformation from working-class housing to welfare housing.
Even though its original $2.2 million mortgage was at just 1 percent, Allegheny Commons had just $23,000 in cash flow in 1993 -- not enough to make payments on that debt plus the new $2.5 million loan.
To cover the payments on the second mortgage, the 1990 law that allowed higher rent payments was invoked. Some existing residents of projects like Allegheny Commons qualified for the bigger subsidies, but the Terrys and many other working-class tenants did not, because their incomes were too high.
The Terrys, both retired, pay $400 a month, plus electricity, for their three-bedroom apartment, and Washington pays the tax shelter an additional $57, for a total of $457.
But if the Terrys leave and a homeless person moves in, the rent goes to $838 under an older law known as Section 8. The Government pays the entire rent for many Section 8 tenants. Some existing tenants, who had smaller incomes than the Terrys, qualified for Section 8, while others were told they not only did not qualify, but their rents would be raised as much as 40 percent.
With Section 8 tenants the tax-shelter investors collect nearly twice as much rent, but because those tenants pay little if any of that, the cost to taxpayers for each apartment increases as much as fifteenfold.
The Section 8 money comes not from some new program, but from dollars already budgeted by the Government to house the very poor, so there is no increase in overall spending. But the switch also means that the same number of dollars rents far fewer apartments, thus helping fewer people and squeezing out the working poor.
Federal law requires the Government to seek a mix of income levels in projects it subsidizes. But Ms. Dunlap of HUD said the 1990 law had "exacerbated the drive toward concentrating the poor."
She said the Government cannot just walk away from the program, and leave the working poor and the tax-shelter investors to the open market, because many of the mortgages, which the Government has guaranteed, would default.
Michael Bodaken, president of the National Housing Trust, said, "This is valuable housing stock, worth perhaps $25 billion, and it must be preserved."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 23, 1995

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on July 25 about a change in the tax law that is affecting low-income housing referred incorrectly to estimates by the National Housing Trust on its proposal that one-time grants replace monthly subsidies for tax-sheltered apartment projects. The group estimated that the proposal would save much more than the $5.4 billion cited in the article. The $2.3 billion in increased costs estimated for the first seven years of the plan was a Government estimate, not the group's.

HEADLINE: For Most U.S. Households, Inheritances Hardly Count

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24

 BODY:
Benjamin Franklin and your mother may have been right after all, at least according to a new study: affluent Americans typically got that way by staying healthy, getting married and working hard for a good wage, rather than by inheriting their money.
A number of studies in recent years have pointed to a greater concentration of wealth and income among fewer and fewer people, prompting some calls for higher taxes on inheritances to prevent a widening of class divisions. But two surveys covering a total of 20,000 Americans over 50 show that health, marital status and income are the main determinants of wealth, according to a study released today by Rand, a research group based in Santa Monica, Calif. 
 "More than 90 percent of current wealth inequalities have nothing to do with financial inheritances," the study concluded.
The Rand study found that at the 95th percentile of households with a 51- to 60-year-old, assets totaled $843,598 when inheritances were included. Without inheritances, these assets totaled $780,641. By contrast, at the 10th percentile, similar households had $923 in assets and typically no inheritances.
James P. Smith, a Rand economist who wrote the study, said two-thirds of all white households and 90 percent of all minority households had not inherited any financial assets -- like stocks, bonds or cash -- by the time the surveys' respondents had reached their mid-50's.
Robert D. Reischauer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the results might not be applicable to younger generations, and that big inheritances were limited to such a small percentage of the population that measurements were difficult.
"They're a big deal for a very tiny portion of the population -- maybe 1, 2 percent of the population, if even that," he said.
Mr. Smith acknowledged this, but said the shortage of data on the wealthiest Americans did not undermine the surveys' reliability. "They're an extremely difficult part of the population to survey," he said. "This shouldn't be taken as a statement that the Rockefellers didn't give to their kids and the Kennedys didn't give to their kids."
Inheritances are less of an issue for Americans over 50 because their parents were less prosperous, Mr. Reischauer added, in part because of the Depression.
But Mr. Smith was skeptical that inheritances would play a bigger role in determining wealth inequality among younger Americans. Most Americans in their 50's and older have barely saved enough to last them through retirement, he said, and are not in a position to leave large sums to their heirs.
The median assets in households where respondents were married were four times the median assets in households of divorced respondents, the Rand study found. The average wealth of someone in excellent health was four times the average wealth of someone in poor health. And high income was the best indicator of wealth, with high-earners typically saving a larger percentage of their incomes.
For reasons that are not entirely clear, being married seemed to encourage people to save more, Mr. Smith said. Good health, by contrast, has a clear link to wealth because healthy people can work longer hours and have lower medical bills.
To be sure, the cause and effect in some instances could be interchangeable: People who save may be more likely to get married and they may be healthier because they can afford good medical care.
The study's definition of household wealth included financial assets like stocks, bonds and checking accounts as well as equity in homes, cars, other real estate and stakes in small businesses.
The University of Michigan conducted the surveys for the Rand study, which was largely paid for with grants from the Federal Government's National Institute on Aging.

HEADLINE: Americans Hit the Road With Relish, and Money to Burn

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: JACKSON, Wyo., July 20

 BODY:
As he circled the Indians, Richard Alexander thought about buying one.
"I could see one of the smaller ones along a wall in our family room," said his wife, Sharon, who watched him study the line of colorful, hand-carved wooden figures outside a souvenir shop near the middle of town. "I'd like to come home with some kind of memento." 
 Just contemplating an exotic memento of their vacation is a novelty for the Alexanders. After years of more modest vacations or no vacation at all, this summer the Alexanders, from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., chose the rugged landscapes of western Wyoming for a 10-day odyssey, a touring and camping adventure that has already included Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks.
"We haven't taken a 10-day vacation in several years, and we just decided it was time," said Mr. Alexander, an accountant. "This year we decided to let it all hang out."
The Alexanders are not alone. With the nation's economy relatively healthy, consumers confident that it will stay that way, and unemployment consistently low, travel industry officials say Americans this summer are driving, flying and cruising to destinations around the country in record numbers. From Bar Harbor, Me., to the Wisconsin Dells to the cushiest of Hawaiian resorts, hotel occupancy rates are up and golf courses and water slides are crowded.
Many national parks are overflowing, led by the Great Smoky Mountains National Park on the Tennessee-North Carolina border, where a record 1.165 million people visited in June, an increase of 20.5 percent over June of last year. At the Grand Canyon, where park officials have worried for years about overcrowding and adverse effects of too many vehicles, a record 665,255 tourists visited last month, an increase of 23.4 percent over June 1994.
"There has been a great deal of pent-up emotion over wish lists for travel for a long time," said William S. Norman, chief executive of the Travel Industry Association of America, a trade organization based in Washington. "A lot of people were thinking, Should we or shouldn't we? But there were enough positive indicators of the economy to decide, Let's do it now, and people are splurging."
In general, Mr. Norman said, vacationers this summer are spending more money, staying longer and upgrading accommodations and transportation where they can. All of this, he said, could result in an increase of 5 percent or more over the $416 billion that Americans and foreign visitors spent on travel and tourism in the United States last year. That would be the largest jump in five years.
Foreigners account for about 1 of every 5 tourist dollars spent in the United States, a proportion that has remained relatively constant in the 1990's.
Many more people are taking family vacations this summer. "People are feeling the need to spread their wings," said Kathy Sudeikis, a travel agent in Kansas City, Mo. "They have been thinking about family values and want to spend their vacation together. They want to play out that experience."
The evidence can be found almost everywhere, not just in traditional vacation meccas like Walt Disney World in Florida or Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. In Bar Harbor, a coastal town near Acadia National Park, visitors from all over the East this summer are tying up traffic. "This year, it was more difficult to finding parking earlier," said Rosteen Masters, chief executive of the town's Chamber of Commerce. "Instead of July, it was happening in May."
In Myrtle Beach, S.C., where a record 12 million visitors last year jammed attractions along 60 miles of oceanfront, officials are predicting even higher numbers this year. Same for the Wisconsin Dells, a favorite Midwestern destination for its growing number of water parks, theme parks and theaters.
Even places not known as resort destinations are enjoying boom times. Sonny Marston, general manager of the side-by-side Plaza Theater Wax Museum and the Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum in San Antonio, said the crowds this summer could exceed last year's record numbers.
"People are always interested in seeing a two-headed pig," Mr. Marston said of the Ripley's museum, where visitors can also view an oil rig made of 400,000 matchsticks, an Eiffel Tower made of 20,000 toothpicks, various shrunken heads and the Lord's Prayer written on a pin.
Mr. Marston said visitors were equally excited about the array of film stars in wax, including the newly arrived Jim Carey and Whoopi Goldberg. "And we should be getting a Brad Pitt pretty quick," he volunteered.
Here in Wyoming, Jackson sits at the base of Jackson Hole, a 60-mile valley that runs through the Tetons up to Yellowstone. It has been a favorite summer resort destination for years for outdoor activities like camping, hiking, fly fishing and whitewater rafting. Next month, President Clinton and his family are expected for two weeks.
The town has a typical resort look, with lots of hotels, boutiques and souvenir shops -- but all in a western motif. A stagecoach with tourists aboard circles the town square all day, and the periodic gunshots are from two faux cowboys re-enacting a showdown. More than 15 movies have been shot in the area, including "Shane" and "Rocky IV," and town officials say Jackson was where John Wayne first rode a horse, in 1932.
Like the Alexanders, many visitors here said their time in Jackson Hole was part of vacation plans that were more ambitious than in recent years, whether measured by money spent, quality of accommodations or number of days away from their lives back home.
"I talk to a lot of people, and more than in the past, they're saying they have extended their vacation this year," said Gerald Humphries, a 41-year-old physical education teacher from Blackfoot, Idaho, who dons cowboy hat and boots each summer to drive the stagecoach. "It's like they're staying two weeks, rather than four or five days."
Driving through the area with their sons, Matthew, 11, and Jonathan, 8, Janet and Brad Belz of Manhasset, L.I., decided to stretch their vacation by 2 days, to 12, on a trip that began in the Black Hills of South Dakota.
"We really want the kids to experience as much as they can of state and Federal parks before they changed," Mr. Belz, a vice president at Macy's, said as his family spent an evening on a covered-wagon train to a western music show and barbecue dinner of chicken, roast beef, corn and beans. "It would have been just as easy to go to the Caribbean. But this is a lot more rewarding."
Craig Whittaker, a sales manager for an oil chemical company in Houston, said he and his wife, Terri, and their daughters, Leah, 8 and Rachel, 5, had generally spent vacations in and around Texas. But a scheduled business trip gave them the opportunity to plan something different.
"We decided to spend a little bit more money and bring the family along," Mr. Whittaker said during the covered-wagon ride, as his girls watched two men dressed like Indians pretend to attack. "It's been fun."
Sitting in the town square, with its portals of elk antlers at each corner, Neal and Mary Crout of Fond du Lac, Wis., said their nine-day vacation was a gift to themselves, a respite from their jobs. "We love to travel even if that means scrimping on something else," said Mr. Crout, a warehouse supervisor. "We decided to be good to ourselves this year."
"But," his wife insisted, "we're still pretty conservative. We're not the kind to buy a $500 Pendleton sweater. We're not from New York, you know."

GRAPHIC: Photos: More Americans are vacationing around the country this year and spending more money doing so, tourism industry experts say. National parks in particular are overflowing. At Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, tourists stopped along a road after they sighted a moose nearby; Janet and Brad Belz of Manhasset, L.I., with their sons Jonathan, left, and Matthew, dining in Jackson, Wyo. "It would have been just as easy to go to the Caribbean," Mr. Belz said. "But this is a lot more rewarding." (Photographs by Jim Wilson/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Vernon I. Cheadle, 85, Botanist And U. of California Chancellor

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Vernon I. Cheadle, a former Chancellor of the University of California at Santa Barbara whose 15-year tenure was marked by rapid campus growth as well as student unrest, died on Sunday at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara. He was 85.
Dr. Cheadle, who lived in Santa Barbara, was an internationally known botanist. He was Chancellor from 1962 to 1977. In that time, the number of disciplines taught on the campus rose to 100 from 36, master's programs to 42 from 15, and Ph.D. programs to 27 from 2. Enrollment grew to more than 12,000 from 4,700. 
 Student unrest over civil rights, the Vietnam War and a feeling of powerlessness against political and economic institutions swirled around Dr. Cheadle when he was Chancellor. In 1969, members of the Black Students Union occupied a campus building and pressured the administation into creating a black studies program.
In February 1970, youths battled the police for three nights in Isla Vista, a college town of about 13,000 people, including 9,000 students, adjacent to the Santa Barbara campus. The violence left 1 student dead and more than 100 injured or arrested, and resulted in the destruction of several buildings, including a bank that was burned to the ground. The violence ended after Ronald Reagan, then Governor of California, declared an "extreme emergency" and called in the National Guard.
After his retirement Dr. Cheadle returned to his botany laboratory, where he studied water-conducting cells in higher forms of plant life, like corn and grasses. His specialty was the morphology of vascular plants.
Vernon Irving Cheadle was born in Salem, S. D., and received a bachelor's degree from Miami University in Ohio in 1932 and a master's degree and Ph.D. in botany from Harvard University.
He taught at Harvard and Rhode Island State College before joining the University of California at Davis as chairman of the botany department in 1952. He was acting vice chancellor at Davis when Santa Barbara named him as Chancellor.
He is survived by his wife, Mary; a son, Dr. William Cheadle of Louisville, Ky., a twin sister, Mrs. Joseph Ruden of Billings, Mont., and two grandsons.

HEADLINE: June Budget Surplus Less Than Expected

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24

 BODY:
The Federal Government today reported a budget surplus for June as quarterly tax returns streamed into the Treasury.
While revenues were up, reflecting healthy business profits and higher taxes on the affluent, expenses also increased, the Treasury said. 
 As a result, the surplus came in at a smaller-than-expected $13.571 billion, down 8.6 percent from $14.850 billion in the month a year earlier.
Economists had expected a surplus of $18.4 billion for June 1995.
But the reason for the smaller surplus was mainly technical. The Government mailed Social Security payments, veterans' benefits and military paychecks for July on June 30 instead of July 1, which fell on a Saturday.

Financial Services Agreement Is Expected by End of Week

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24

 BODY:
Europe's chief trade negotiator predicted today that more than 70 countries would agree by the end of the week on the world's first agreement liberalizing trade in financial services, although the United States would not be among them.
Japan and South Korea have not yet agreed to join the accord. But Sir Leon Brittan, who represents the 15 European Union nations, said at a news conference that he was confident the two nations would commit to join the pact during talks that start in Geneva Wednesday. 
 Their support would insure that the accord, which would allow banks, insurance companies and other financial companies easier access to other countries' markets, would be completed by Friday, Sir Leon said.
In talks at the World Trade Organization in Geneva last month, the Clinton Administration withdrew from the proposed pact because Asian and Latin American countries were unwilling to offer American financial companies the same access to their markets that the United States had been willing to offer them. Financial concerns from the European Union will still get free access to the United States because they offer American firms equal access. But the United States said it would allow other countries access only if they reciprocated.
The Administration's decision threatened to destroy the negotiations over financial services. Other countries reduced the access offers they had made when it became clear that those offers would not necessarily secure them better access to the American market.
In a bid to keep the talks alive, the European Union took the lead in putting pressure on the other countries to maintain their original access offers and seek a trial agreement of two and a half years, after which they would be free to renegotiate -- increasing or decreasing the access they offered foreign companies.
Sir Leon said today that the Administration's stance had not changed. "I never expected the U.S. to change its mind," he said, although he held out the possibility that it might agree to join the proposed trial agreement when it came up for renegotiation in 1997.
Sir Leon, who was accompanied by the Spanish Foreign Minister, Javier Solana, the current president of the European Union's decision-making Council of Ministers, spoke following a review of trans-Atlantic relations with the Secretary of State, Warren Christopher; the Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin; the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, and several Congressional leaders.
Mr. Rubin issued a statement saying that the United States supported the European Union's efforts to negotiate the trial agreement even though it would not join it.
Although most countries have accepted the plan for the trial agreement, European Union negotiators said Japan and South Korea must participate in the accord for it to be worthwhile.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops Against Yen Following Elections in Japan

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the yen yesterday after a poor showing by Japan's governing coalition in elections on Sunday suggested that Japan might ease its commitment to weakening the yen.
But the dollar was steady against the German mark, bolstered by speculation that the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank,would cut interest rates soon. Lower German rates would hurt the mark by making bank deposits denominated in it less attractive. 
 In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar edged up to 1.3857 German marks from 1.3856 marks on Friday. The dollar fell to 87.52 Japanese yen from 88.52 yen.
The dollar initially surged against the yen on the results of the Japanese election, which left the coalition Government of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama in power. But the dollar fell after it became clear that the coalition would be weaker than before.
The elections were for seats in Parliament's upper house, which is less important than the lower house. The elections were still seen as an referendum on the Government's performance.
"The dollar came off on uncertainty surrounding the Japanese elections," said John McCarthy, manager of foreign exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York. "The fact that the political scene is a bit muddled suggests that the reforms the market had hoped for and the closer cooperation with the U.S. the market had hoped for -- all that is under suspicion."
A weaker Japanese Government is unlikely to accelerate measures to deregulate and stimulate the Japanese economy, which would help reduce Japan's trade surplus with the United States. The surplus puts a wealth of dollars in the hands of Japanese exporters, driving up the value of the yen.
To bring the yen down, the Bank of Japan has bought as much as $1 billion for yen in each trading day in the two weeks leading up to the election, traders said. Though the central bank bought dollars again yesterday, its dollar-buying is likely to wane now that the election is over, hurting the dollar against the yen, they said.
The dollar gained against the mark after preliminary reports showed that prices declined in two German states during July. The data revived expectations that the Bundesbank could lower interest rates when it returns from its summer recess later next month.

HEADLINE: Four Oil Companies Report Strong Earnings in Quarter

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Four oil companies reported surprisingly strong second-quarter earnings yesterday, helped by higher oil prices and wider margins in chemical and refining businesses.
Results from the Mobil Corporation; the Shell Oil Company, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group; the Chevron Corporation, and ARCO exceeded analysts' expectations. The Amoco Corporation, however, reported earnings that fell short of estimates. 
 Despite the strong performance by the oil industry in the second quarter, there were also signs yesterday of a possible slowdown head. Mobil warned that chemical prices, which surged as the United States economy revived, were now in retreat. And oil prices have fallen since April.
"I wouldn't call it a red flag," said Paul Ting, managing director of oil industry research at Oppenheimer & Company. "I would certainly call it a yellow flag. It has a sobering affect on the third quarter."
Mobil, based in Fairfax, Va., said it earned $179 million, or 42 cents a share, down from $198 million, or 46 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. But the results included a charge of $527 million, mainly for a revamping. Profit from operations rose to $706 million, or $1.75 a share, in the quarter, from $513 million, or $1.25 a share, a year earlier. The results beat expectations that Mobil would earn $1.65, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue rose 16 percent, to $18.85 billion from $16.22 billion, because of an increase in chemical and refined product sales.
Chemical results were the strongest, with operating profit more than quadrupling to $186 million, as division sales rose 41 percent.
Shell Oil earned $385 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $194 million a year earlier. In the recent quarter, charges for litigation and write-downs in properties and a coal company reduced earnings by $2 million. Revenue rose 25 percent, to $6.39 billion from $5.13 billion.
Shell Oil, based in Houston, said profit from operations rose 51 percent, to $387 million from $257 million. Chemicals performed best, more than doubling operating profit to $176 million. Sales from the unit rose 33 percent, to $1.3 billion.
Chevron, based in San Francisco, said earnings for the quarter more than doubled to $607 million, or 93 cents a share, from $257 million, or 39 cents a share, in the quarter a yeare earlier. The results exceeded Wall Street estimates of 84 cents a share, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research. Revenues rose 8.4 percent. It was the company's best performance since the Persian Gulf war.
The chemical segment turned in the best performance, with operating profit more than tripling to $175 million from $49 million. Still, a Chevron official said prices for olefins and aromatics, two primary products of the chemical division, may have either plateaued or peaked.
ARCO earned $391 million, or $2.39 a share, in the quarter, compared with $24 million, or 14 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The most recent results included a gain of $10 million to settle insurance litigation, while the 1994 quarter included a restructuring charge of $154 million. The results exceed Wall Street expectations of $2.13 a share, according to a survey of analysts by Zacks Investment Research.
ARCO, based in Los Angeles, said profit from operations rose to $381 million, or $2.33 a share, from $178 million, or $1.09. Revenue rose 8 percent.
The company's chemical interests, including a 49.9 percent stake in the Lyondell Petrochemical Company and a 83.1 percent stake in the ARCO Chemical Company turned in strong performances. Their combined contribution to earnings more than doubled to $201 million from $84 million.
Amoco, based in Chicago, said earnings rose 30 percent in the quarter, to $533 million, or $1.08 a share, from $410 million, or 83 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The 1994 quarter included a gain of $270 million for a tax dispute settlement and a charge of $256 million for restructuring. Chemical profit from operations rose to $246 million from $139 million.

Prices Regain Some Ground; Shorter Maturities Weaker

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond prices regained some ground yesterday from last week's retreat. But prices for shorter maturities were mildly weaker as investors positioned themselves for an increase in supply this week.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 16/32 , to 10915/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.87 percent, from 6.96 percent on Friday. Investors gained about $11.25 for every $1,000 of bonds held. 
 Treasury prices opened higher, rebounding from last week's decline. Many traders said the sharp drop on Friday was exaggerated. With the absence of economic data yesterday, the market focused on supply.
The Treasury plans to sell $17.25 billion of new two-year notes today and $11.5 billion of five-year notes tomorrow. In when-issued trading the two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 5.95 percent and the five-year notes at a price to yield 6.25 percent.
Yesterday, the Treasury sold $26.4 billion of new three-month and six-month bills, with rates that were slightly higher than the previous week. The average rate for a three-month maturity was 5.47 percent, up one basis point from a week ago, while the average rate for a six-month bill was 5.46 percent, up six basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Eric Hamilton, a senior fixed-income analyst for Technical Data in Boston, said there was stronger demand than usual from foreign buyers at the auction. Foreign investors usually buy about $1.5 billion to $2 billion of the bills, but Mr. Hamilton estimated that they took $3.4 billion yesterday.
The higher figure was "probably the result of central bank buying of dollars last week," he said, adding, "They have to put those dollars to work and typically those central banks buy bills with those dollars."
Treasury prices were supported in part yesterday by covering by short- sellers. A short-seller sells borrowed securities, hoping to buy them back later at lower prices and pocket the difference. If prices begin to rise instead of fall, as Treasury prices did early yesterday, a short-seller has to buy back, or cover, the securities to limit losses.
And portfolio managers were doing a little bottom fishing yesterday, buying some of the oversold securities.
Portfolio managers apparently reconsidered Friday's selloff over the weekend and returned to the market thinking that a yield near 7 percent was not such a bad deal after all, given an inflation rate of less than 3 percent.
Mr. Hamilton of Technical Data said there was some argument for further bond weakness but the fundamental picture was still sound. "I think a 7 percent long-bond yield will be a good support level for the short term," he said.
"Yes there are some supply concerns," he added, "but the two- and five-year note auctions should go fairly well."
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Lavazza Takes a Ride on America's Coffee Bubble

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: TURIN, Italy

 BODY:
Sipping espresso from a 1-ounce porcelain cup, Giulio Girotto almost shudders as he reaches for a 15-ounce foam container to discuss American espresso bars and drinks like cappuccinos and lattes that he refers to as "espresso-based beverages."
But how you take your espresso has become secondary to Mr. Girotto, the chief executive of Luigi Lavazza S.p.A., Italy's biggest coffee company, and these days he shudders all the way to the bank. Lavazza, which controls 43 percent of Italy's coffee market, is cashing in on America's flirtation with Italian foods, and above all its craze for exotic new coffees. 
 Lavazza (pronounced la-VAATZ-ah) is bringing its beans to the United States and has developed an espresso machine for coffee bars, offices and smaller restaurants. Sales of the machine, called Espresso Point, plus its Lavazza brand coffee, began last year and are expected to increase the company's United States revenue in 1995 by 40 percent, to $12 million.
Lavazza supplies the machines, provides service and, to insure freshness and uniform flavor, delivers coffee in vacuum-packed cartridges. There are now thousands of the machines in America, including those at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York and the garden cafe at the Museum of Modern Art.
With annual sales of $644 million, Lavazza is one of a phalanx of medium-sized, family-owned Italian food companies -- like Barilla S.p.A., the big pasta and baked goods producer, and Parmalat S.p.A., the leading Italian dairy company -- that have plunged into the United States, driven by stagnating or even declining sales in Italy.
Italian Government economists value the export effort because immense imports of milk products and meat from Northern Europe have resulted in an annual trade deficit in food items of $6.8 billion last year, second only to Italy's bill for oil.
Lavazza, which is based here, first went abroad in the 1980's, developing markets for espresso in neighboring France and Germany. But going into the United States is described here as a matter of survival.
"It's important to remember what became of the others," Mr. Girotto said, rattling off a list of smaller rivals that made only coffee and were gobbled up by food giants like Nestle and the Philip Morris Companies.
Six years ago, Lavazza looked at the United States and liked what it saw.
"First, there was this boom in the diffusion of Italian foods," said Ennio Ranaboldo, a spokesman for Lavazza. "Just look at olive oil. Twelve or 15 years ago, it was not part of the American landscape. Now the olive oil section is the largest of some supermarkets. There's even mineral water imported from Italy!
"At the same time, we saw the boom of the specialty coffee business. And for some, espresso was the largest part of this, if not the driving force."
For American tastes, Lavazza developed several new blends of regular and decaffeinated espresso, including one called Gran Filtro. Next, the company outfitted one of its line of electric espresso makers with stainless steel and brass for use in both liquor and coffee bars and in offices. Retailing at about $800, the Espresso Point is admittedly pricey, but as espresso drinking spreads in America, Lavazza hopes to sell it for home use as well.
America's giant coffee bar chains, like Starbucks, grind their own blends, so Lavazza set its sights on individual espresso bars, Italian restaurants, hotels and the growing office coffee business. Alberto Paderi, the president of Lavazza's New York-based operation, the Lavazza Premium Coffees Corporation, says he spends 70 to 80 days a year on the road, knocking on restaurant doors, visiting food trade fairs and securing shelf space for Lavazza at stores like A. & P. and Pathmark. But restaurants account for roughly half of Lavazza's business.
"Since people change their habits at home, because they've tried something at a restaurant," he said during a recent visit to Lavazza's headquarters, "we thought this is where we ought to start."
He said the Lavazza strategy was to move gradually into new regions and businesses.
In Manhattan, the Gramercy Tavern on East 20th Street started serving Lavazza coffee beans when it opened a year ago. Bob Wenzl, the beverage director, said: "There are a lot of other espressos. It just works quite well."
Lucy Di Saverio, who has been running Bleecker Street Pastry in Greenwich Village since 1966, said, "I've used it at intervals, on and off, and I'm using it now." The reason, she said, was "quality, and the people who sell it -- they're convincing."
Lavazza's tactics are a sharp departure from past importers who supplied restaurants with espresso machines, then failed to follow up with service or spare parts.
"Lots of restaurateurs said to us, 'Don't come to me with an espresso machine!' " Mr. Paderi said.
Partly, Mr. Paderi says, what drives espresso is profit. A latte -- espresso coffee and lots of steamed milk, and in some places a shot of syrup, like strawberry, raspberry or banana -- sells in New York coffee bars for $3 to $3.50, for instance. The ingredients cost 15 cents.
Still, Lavazza is not tempted to get into the coffee bar business itself. It does not want to compete with the espresso bars and restaurants that it supplies.
Will America's coffee bubble burst? "I don't think it's really a fad," Mr. Paderi said. "I'm sure there's a little bit too much around, and someday there will be less than the big numbers you see now. But no doubt you're going to see an espresso machine in most any food service operation.
"The big question for us," he added, "is whether it will enter homes."

HEADLINE: Union Chief Linked to the Mob Appears to Have Won a 2d Term

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
The head of the carpenters union in the New York City area, whose administration was under fire on charges of corruption, nepotism and favoritism to mobsters, appears to have been re-elected, according to an unofficial vote count completed last night.
A major issue in the campaign was the disclosures that aides to Frederick W. Devine, who was re-elected to a second term, had doled out lucrative jobs at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center to mobsters and former convicts. 
 Independent officials who supervised the election said that in an unofficial tally Mr. Devine defeated three candidates. He received 3,450 votes, and his closest opponent, Patrick J. Harvey, got 1,937 votes.
Two other candidates, John Abbatemarco and John J. Greany, were far behind.
The union, one of the largest labor groups in New York, has a 30-year history of being investigated by Federal and state authorities for links to the mob and for corruption.
Mr. Devine, 57, declined to be interviewed last night about his platform to win a second four-year term as the head of the union, the New York City District Council of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. He campaigned mainly on his experience and his granting of Christmas bonuses to about 5,000 retired members. He also promised to seek full medical benefits and pensions for members at age 55.
His opponents raised these issues:
*Mr. Devine secretly raised his annual salary to about $360,000, making him one of the nation's highest-paid union officials, while about 40 percent of the union's members are unemployed.
*Dozens of high-paying union jobs were given to relatives of Mr. Devine and his allies. Michael Devine, a son of Mr. Devine, is an assistant to his father at an annual salary of $110,000.
*Under Mr. Devine's leadership, the union's membership declined from 23,000 to fewer than 20,000 active members, while administrative fees soared to $15 million last year from $6 million in 1991.
Mr. Devine was a defendant in a civil racketeering suit brought in 1991 by Federal prosecutors in Manhattan. The suit was settled last year in an agreement that called for the appointment of Kenneth Conboy, a former Federal judge, as an investigator to look into wrongdoing and to supervise the direct election of new officers.
Mr. Devine's immediate predecessor, Paschal McGuiness, was acquitted in 1991 on Federal charges of taking bribes from contractors. Mr. McGuiness had been elected president after Theodore Maritas disappeared in 1982 while awaiting trial on extortion charges.
Law enforcement officials say that in the latest investigation, Federal prosecutors are examining allegations of bribery and kickbacks in the administration of the union's $1.5 billion pension and welfare funds.

HEADLINE: Chain Providing $96 Million for Minorities

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 25

 BODY:
Shoney's Inc., a family restaurant chain criticized for its treatment of blacks, agreed today to provide an estimated $96 million to assist minorities with business opportunities over the next three years.
The agreement covers employment and management opportunities, minority business development, franchise development and community service and contributions. 
 In 1992 the company, which is based in Nashville, paid $132 million to settle a racial discrimination lawsuit filed in 1989 in Florida by nine black former employees. The award went to many black employees and former employees of Shoney's.
Two previous agreements between Shoney's and the leadership conference, in 1989 and 1993, provided $190 million in business opportunities for minorities, the company said. Shoney's operates more than 1,800 restaurants in 34 states and Canada.
The new agreement was signed by Shoney's chairman, C. Stephen Lynn, and the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the organization founded by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

DATELINE: OIL CITY, Pa.

 BODY:
The oil industry got its start in this part of northwestern Pennsylvania with the drilling of the world's first commercial oil well in 1859. The Quaker State Corporation got its start in this town in 1931 by promoting the special qualities of Pennsylvania oil.
When the oil industry moved southwest, Quaker State stayed. And when other big corporations -- Pennzoil, Jones & Laughlin Steel, U.S. Steel and GTE -- began deserting Oil City, the townsfolk took comfort at the sight of the five-story, glass-and-concrete Quaker State headquarters building that reared up over surrounding storefronts. 
 Quaker State, they told themselves, was an immovable economic base that would eventually see them through to better times.
They were wrong. Quaker State is leaving the place it called home for more than 60 years and moving to Irving, Tex., near Dallas.
Just as Akron, in neighboring Ohio, lost tire makers and Youngstown is no longer home to any major steelmaker, Oil City, population 12,000, is losing the last of the oil companies that settled in this region. For Quaker State, the move is the latest of many changes brought about by its chairman, Herbert M. Baum, a former Campbell Soup executive hired two years ago to shake the company out of its doldrums.
The changes under Mr. Baum, the first outsider to head Quaker State, have improved profitability. But their impact on Oil City is another story. Like many small towns in America, it came to see itself as synonymous with the big company that dominated its economic life. And now it feels betrayed, robbed of both its proud past and of hope for the future. About half of the nearly 300 employees at the Oil City headquarters will lose their jobs and struggle to find new employment at much lower wages; the rest will be relocated in a strange place more than 1,000 miles away.
Judy Schwab, a receptionist for the company, has not been asked to move to Dallas. And, at age 52, she has scant hope of finding a job here that could match her current salary. Instead, Ms. Schwab, who has greeted visitors in the lobby for the last 17 years, is thinking of starting a bookshop that would serve tea in the nearly deserted shopping district.
"People had faith in the company, that it would stay and take care of them," she said. "It has taken away their hope that the company that started here would stay here."
Even for many of the 158 employees who received offers to move to Dallas, the future is worrisome. Bob Olen, the purchasing manager for Quaker State for 17 years, spent a weekend with his wife and 20 other couples recently in the Dallas suburbs, looking at homes that are much more expensive and a life style that is much more fast paced than back home.
Going to Texas would mean leaving behind his aging parents and two of his children -- one with a job and another who is finishing school. It would also mean selling his house on one and a half wooded acres in an area where both his and his wife's families have lived since the turn of the century.
But Mr. Olen says he has no choice. At his age, he figures, he would be lucky to find a job here that pays one-third of his current salary. "I would have to relocate anyway," he said ruefully.
The economic descent of Oil City has been relatively rapid. Conrad A. Conrad, the vice chairman and chief financial officer of Quaker State, said the town was a thriving metropolis of 20,000 when he joined the company in the early 1960's.
Oil City's history has always been tied to oil. It was one of the boom towns that sprang up shortly after Edwin L. Drake drilled the world's first commercial oil well 136 years ago in Titusville, about 15 miles to the north. It was built on four square miles straddling the Allegheny River, whose shores bristled with 2,000 oil wells by the late 1860's.
But it was only by a stroke of luck that it achieved prosperity in this century long after most other Pennsylvania oil towns had vanished, victims of severe declines in oil prices and dwindling supply. In 1931, Charles Pape, a Chicago stockbroker, combined a group of oil companies into the Quaker State Corporation and chose Oil City for its headquarters.
His strategy for competing against the huge new fields of Texas and Oklahoma was to start a catchy advertising campaign stressing the special lubricating qualities of the motor oil refined from Pennsylvania Grade crude. His success was soon copied by others, including Pennzoil United Inc. Big refineries were built and companies were formed to supply the needs of the growing industry. The Imperial Works unit of U.S. Steel made oil wells, for example, and the Manion Steel Barrel Company made barrels.
Main Street, which started in the 1860's as little more than a sea of oily mud and ramshackle hotels, was transformed into a bustling strip jammed with cars and lined with modern office buildings, banks, shops and restaurants.
Most important, Quaker State's commitment to continued growth in its hometown seemed unswerving: In 1977, the chief executive at the time, Quentin E. Wood, cut the ribbon on the new $5 million headquarters and said the company was proud to be part of the "continuing renaissance of Oil City." He and other executives served on local boards and were a major force in raising funds for a hospital and for the United Way.
But neither Oil City nor Quaker State could escape the larger forces that embroiled the oil industry in the 1980's: plunging oil prices, production cutbacks and breakthroughs in refining technology that eroded the quality advantages of Pennsylvania Grade crude.
Quaker State fought back by introducing better motor oils, but it continued to charge a premium for a product that retailers often used as a loss leader. That strategy led to a decline in its motor-oil market share from 20 percent in the 1980's to about 13 percent in 1993, second to Pennzoil.
Quaker State also attempted to diversify, buying an insurance group and a coal company, but those moves only dragged down its earnings further.
To reverse its fortunes, the company lured Mr. Baum from Campbell Soup in June 1993. A blunt-spoken executive known for his marketing savvy, Mr. Baum moved quickly, replacing most of the top management with outsiders, selling noncore business and shifting the company's focus from refining to marketing.
He also doubled its lubricant business by buying the Specialty Oil Companies of Shreveport, La., and Slick 50 Inc., a Houston maker of car-engine treatments. In 1994, his first full year on the job, the company's profit rose 37 percent, to $19 million, on a 12 percent increase in revenue, to $852 million. And yesterday, Quaker State reported that its second-quarter profit from continuing operations more than tripled from the corresponding period a year earlier, to $4.96 million from $1.5 million. The improved earnings were more than wiped out, however, by a $9.5 million restructuring charge for the move to Texas.
The company ranks 945th on Fortune magazine's list of the 1,000 largest American corporations.
In the last two years, as the focus of the company shifted to the Southwest, Oil City began to look more and more remote. The frustrations of relying on the two daily commuter flights from the local airport to connecting flights in Pittsburgh began to grate on executives and the sales force. Many chose instead to drive two hours over winding roads.
The company has also had difficulty persuading Wall Street analysts, potential new executives and even suppliers to travel to a place that offers one Holiday Inn and a few restaurants in its downtown.
Nevertheless, Mr. Baum, who had come from New Jersey and bought a large house and become active in the community, said he felt torn about leaving.
"I wish I could take this building and its people and drop them in Dallas," he said in an interview in his office, spreading out his hands as if to take hold of the edifice.
But he added that he was disillusioned with what he saw as the shortsightedness of some residents. Soon after he arrived, Quaker State and several local groups raised $40,000 for a campaign to attract a national retailer to a downtown building vacated years ago by Woolworth.
The effort fell apart, he said, when the landlord held out for a better deal on the lease. The building is still vacant. "The people in this town don't know how to win," he said. "They are their own worst enemy."
Quaker State has contributed $250,000 to an effort to find a company to take its place in Oil City. Cindie Litweiler, executive director of the Oil City Community Development Corporation, said she was hoping to find a financial institution, like a credit-card company, to set up a billing or processing center. She noted the town's abundance of skilled workers and its low cost of living.
"You don't have to pay $14 a square foot for office space and $400 a month for parking," she said.
But the companies she has been talking to generally do not pay much more than the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour, and they offer few if any fringe benefits. For Raymond Lawson, a father of two daughters who made $20,000 a year and enjoyed extensive benefits at his job of maintaining the Quaker State building and grounds, the prospect of a pay cut is daunting.
The best offer he has had so far is $6 an hour, a level he considers too low for someone skilled in carpentry and plumbing. "I feel devastated," he said. "What am I going to do?"

HEADLINE: Clinton Joins a Rally on Medicare's Birthday

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
President Clinton joined Congressional Democrats and hundreds of elderly Americans for a 30th birthday rally for Medicare on Capitol Hill today, attacking Republican plans to cut growth in the program and vowing not to "let the Government mess with your Medicare."
But the reality behind the political oratory was that most Democrats surrounding Mr. Clinton in the caucus room of the Cannon House Office Building bitterly oppose his plan for trimming growth in Medicare spending -- even though the President would do it more slowly than the Republicans and without reducing benefits to individuals. Mr. Clinton barely acknowledged that fact, though his remarks were far milder than those of his fellow partisans. 
 "We must be committed to reducing medical cost inflation and stabilizing the Medicare trust fund through genuine reforms not by destroying Medicare and hurting the people who are on it," Mr. Clinton told the group, which included several members of Congress who cast votes to establish Medicare in 1965.
If Mr. Clinton's efforts at compromise left him a bit of an odd man out among Democrats today, he won no praise from the Republicans either. They responded angrily that they had no intention of slashing Medicare or forcing beneficiaries to pay more for their coverage, though the Republicans have yet to divulge details of their proposals.
Speaker Newt Gingrich accused Mr. Clinton of indulging in a "very despicable strategy" to scare the elderly without producing more detailed alternatives of his own. "What is his solution?" Mr. Gingrich asked.
Speaker after speaker at the rally accused Republicans of planning to cut Medicare growth to finance tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, and Mr. Clinton joined the charge. But the President left the toughest language to others, such as Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who told the Republicans, "Keep your tax-cutting, greedy hands off our Medicare."
Until about a month ago, the White House was raising the same cry. Then Mr. Clinton decided to propose his own plan to balance the Federal budget within 10 years, instead of the the seven the Republicans have proposed. To do so, he said he would rein in growth in Medicare spending by at least $124 billion during the next seven years, while the Republicans would cut it by $270 billion.
Mr. Clinton's proposal infuriated Congressional Democrats, who hope to make Medicare a major issue in the 1996 campaign, and today several appeared to be talking as much to Mr. Clinton as to the Republicans.
Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, whose father sponsored national health insurance legislation as a member of Congress in the 1940's, brandished the big wooden gavel he wielded in the House the day Medicare was approved.
"This is an important thing," Mr. Dingell said, turning to Mr. Clinton, "but, Mr. President, you've got something a lot more important in your pocket, and that's the pen that you're going to use to veto anything that the Republicans ----" as the rest of the phrase was lost in cheers and applause.
Mr. Clinton has taken considerable heat, and won little credit, for acknowledging that Medicare cannot be sustained in its current form, because its growth is outpacing its resources. A major part of the program, the trust fund that pays hospital bills for the elderly, is projected to go bankrupt by 2002.
In his failed health care plan last year, Mr. Clinton proposed major savings in the growth of Medicare to help finance expanded access to care, and he has always maintained that changes in Medicare should be part of a broader overhaul of the health system. Today he complained that "the same crowd that fought against Medicare" as socialized medicine in 1965 "were successful in derailing what we tried to do last year," in part by raising fears among the elderly that the Government would limit their coverage.
"Well, I got the message of the 1994 election, and I'm not going to let the Government mess with your Medicare," Mr. Clinton said.

HEADLINE: California Takeover of Orange County Seems More Likely

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
As the financial crisis in Orange County, Calif., continues to worsen, chances are increasing that the state will seize control of its wealthiest county and force it to pay its debts.
A state appointment of a trustee to manage the county's fiscal affairs would be an action with little precedent: there have been few seizures of municipalities since the Depression, and never of a government of this size. But the magnitude of the county's bankruptcy -- its debts are around $1.9 billion -- and the county's inability to draft a plan to pay its creditors are creating a situation in which state intervention is all but certain. 
 "A trustee is a certainty," said Scott Johnson, legislative aide to Senator William Craven, a Republican from Orange County who is head of the State Legislature's local government committee. "The entire legislative delegation is united in the need for a trustee."
In May, Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed legislation that would have empowered a state trustee to take control of the county's finances, viewing that as a last resort. More recently he asked the county to come up with a plan to resolve its financial crisis by Aug. 15 -- or face state intervention.
Now the county's four state Senators and six Assemblymen seem to be answering that call, putting the finishing touches on legislation calling for the imposition of a state trustee. The bill is expected to be introduced within days in Sacramento, and could be enacted by September.
It is unclear how the Governor will respond to the measure. Russell Gould, the state's finance director and a top aide to Governor Wilson, said yesterday that he could not comment until seeing the measure. He reiterated the Governor's desire for a solution born in Orange County. Paul Kranhold, a spokesman for the Governor, said Mr. Wilson would be interested in seeing the reaction of the Orange County Board of Supervisors before passing judgment.
Still the measure promises to help end a bankruptcy that has dragged on for eight months and has come nowhere close to being resolved. It could also provide some political cover for a Governor caught between the gridlock in the county and the need for the county to pay its bills so that it -- and all California municipalities -- can continue to have access to the credit markets.
But whether such a measure provides enough political cover for Mr. Wilson, who is seeking the Republican Presidential nomination, is a matter of some debate. Some people in Sacramento say Mr. Wilson may still seek an even broader consensus from officials in Orange County that a state trustee is necessary.
Another effect of the proposed legislation could be to prompt the county's Board of Supervisors to act on their own to resolve the crisis before Sacramento intervenes.
A state-imposed trustee would have the power to do exactly what the Board of Supervisors can -- but lacks the willingness to -- do. A trustee would be able to decide where to cut the budget and what tax monies could be diverted from specific projects to help repay the mounting debt -- including $800 million due within a year.
Still, there would be limits on a trustee's actions. Under California law, starting with Proposition 13 in 1978, a trustee cannot raise taxes without a vote by taxpayers.
The notion of naming a trustee took on more urgency after voters in Orange County, who are well known for their anti-tax views, rejected a half-cent increase in the sales tax last month to help pay the county's debts. Since then, the county's financial advisers have proposed that taxes dedicated for transportation and for the county's special districts, including water, sewer and beaches, be diverted to pay debts. Their proposal is already being attacked in Orange County.
The package from the Orange County legislators is a sign of the increasing frustration of many state legislators who see the Board of Supervisors as unable to agree on any plan. While the package is subject to approval by the full Legislature, some leaders in Sacramento said yesterday that they expected the Legislature to follow the wishes of the Orange County delegation.
"The plan is likely to move forward with or without the interest or support of the Orange County Board of Supervisors," said Karen Staph-Walters, an adviser to State Senator Lucy Killea, an independent from San Diego. "They may not like the idea of a trustee, but that may not matter. They've been given eight months to solve the problem and nothing has been done."
That the legislators have now come forward in seeking state control is a sign of the political gridlock in the county and its Board of Supervisors.
The fact that the action is being brought by the county legislative delegation, composed mainly of Republicans, could embolden Governor Wilson, whose reluctance so far to appoint a trustee stems at least in part from a desire not to alienate his core conservative supporters.
Orange County filed for bankruptcy in December, after making huge wrong-way bets on interest rates with taxpayer dollars. Since then the crisis has worsened as the county has been unable to come up with a financial rescue plan.
William J. Popejoy, a retired bank executive who was brought in as the county's chief executive to help resolve the crisis, resigned after the sales tax was defeated, saying the Board of Supervisors was "dysfunctional" and had undercut his authority.
"Once Bill Popejoy resigned, interest in having a strong state trustee was re-ignited," said Kenneth Emanueals, legislative assistant for the Orange County League of Cities. "People are throwing their hands up on everything else in Orange County. There is a sense that the county government can't execute anything."
The measure to be submitted to the Legislature by the Orange County delegation includes a debt-repayment plan in addition to the call for a trustee. The measure would provide for diverting some county sales tax revenue toward debt repayment.
It also asks that the Orange County cities and municipalities that lost money in the county's ill-fated investment pool hold off on seeking repayment of their claims.
Mr. Johnson, the aide to Senator Craven, said that even if the county's Board of Supervisors accepted this debt-repayment package, a state trustee might still be appointed -- mainly to accept the political heat that would come from putting the plan into effect.
Mr. Gould, the state director of finance, said that neither he nor the Governor had seen this proposal and could not yet comment on it. "The Governor will be looking at this proposal," he said.
In an interview in Sacramento last week, Mr. Gould said Governor Wilson would consider appointing a trustee "when the county convinces us that they will not act responsibly."
After the defeat of the sales tax increase, Governor Wilson sent top aides, including Mr. Gould, to the county to warn that if the county did not act on its own behalf, the state would intervene.
Senator Quentin Kopp, a San Francisco Democrat and a member of a Senate committee investigating the Orange County situation, said that there was no sympathy in the Legislature for the county's refusal to pay its creditors and that the Legislature would be inclined to support any measure forcing the county to do so. He also said in an interview last week that one impediment to putting in a state trustee had been a fear that the Orange County legislative delegation would oppose it -- something that has now changed.
Others in Orange County have been quietly calling for a state trustee. A recent poll taken by The Orange County Register, the county's newspaper, found that residents had far more confidence in Mr. Popejoy than in the Board of Supervisors.

HEADLINE: Why Gingrich 'Trots' for Presidency: It's Publicity

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
Last month, Speaker Newt Gingrich said he was not shutting the door completely on a Presidential bid because if he did, no one would pay any attention to him.
Today, he said that if he opened the door completely, no one would pay attention. 
 "I'd become dramatically less desirable overnight because it's a basic rule of thumb in this business that the next potential candidate is always more exciting than the current candidates," the Georgia Republican told reporters at a breakfast meeting this morning.
"I'd be reduced to three minutes in various cattle calls, whereas right now I get 45 minutes as the guest speaker," he went on. "The places I go, I get longer to speak than the Presidential candidates, so becoming a Presidential candidate would reduce my ability to communicate a coherent message."
Mr. Gingrich has been opening and closing the door on a possible run for the Presidency for months. During a highly publicized trip in June to New Hampshire, where the nation's earliest primary will be held, he said he wanted to keep people guessing so that the press and others would pay attention to him.
Clearly, Mr. Gingrich likes the limelight, and he says he has found it by being the House Speaker. Huge crowds already seek him out, he noted, and his book, "To Renew America," has soared to the top of the best-seller lists.
This, he said, "proves that you don't have to run for President to have an impact, that being Speaker of the House in the way that I'm Speaker of the House -- oriented toward ideas and toward communications and spending probably a third of my time teaching -- that you can have an enormous impact on the Capitol and you don't have to go to the White House."
He mentioned another good reason not to run: "The minute I became a Presidential candidate," he said, "all of you then would re-open every investigative file you had, for one more whack at me."
That said, he proceeded to outline his thoughts about the Republican message for the 1996 Presidential campaign, including a suggestion that the candidates not exploit affirmative action to divide the party or the nation.
"From the Republican Party's standpoint," he said, "we need to be optimistic, we need to be inclusive, we need to argue the future, we need to argue responsibility and draw thematic choices between us and the President."
"I don't think the Republican Party should use affirmative action as a wedge issue," he continued. "We should focus more of our energy on how we design a helping hand."
But he went on to fault President Clinton, who gave a major address on affirmative action last week, for leaving what Mr. Gingrich called "wiggle room" over whether the President favored quotas.
His own view, the Speaker said, is that "there should be no race-based quota system or set-aside," but that "we have an absolute obligation to reach out a helping hand on a one-by-one basis to people who are trying to rise. That makes it more of an economic than a racial matter."
On the ethics charges that have dogged him since he agreed that media magnate Rupert Murdoch's publishing company, HarperCollins, would publish his book, he was asked why he did not select a publisher who did not have Congressional business.
"Everybody in the book industry has legislative interests," Mr. Gingrich replied.
Any other publisher he went with would probably be investigated by Democrats for potential conflicts, he said, adding, "I'm not going to go around from firm to firm, in the age of multinationals and conglomerates, and wait for five smart Democrats or three smart reporters to figure out the next problem."

HEADLINE: Washington Mayor Concedes Necessity of Job Cuts for Budget

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
In his first public admission that many city workers will lose their jobs in a plan to return the District of Columbia to financial stability, Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. said today that as many as 1,500 people, about 4 percent of the work force, could be dismissed over the next two years.
The job cuts are part of Mr. Barry's response to recommendations by the Federal Financial Control Board to guide the city out of its financial crisis. The board, appointed by President Clinton, earlier this month advised the city to eliminate 5,600 positions. Most of those job savings are expected to be achieved through attrition and early retirement. 
 By conceding the need for additional cuts, Mr. Barry acknowledged for the first time that for the city to balance its budget, as required by law, the large-scale reductions he fought to avoid were inescapable. His concession also indicated that he intended to cooperate with the newly created board, which has the power to oversee all financial decisions made by the Mayor and the City Council.
"Whatever it is, we've met it. We're committed," Mr. Barry said at an afternoon news conference, referring to the control board's recommended level of cuts. "We'll be at the number."
The job losses would increase Washington's already high unemployment rate -- it climbed to 8.3 percent in May from 7.9 percent in May 1994 -- but Mr. Barry said the city would create training programs to help people find jobs. Few issues have been more important to Mr. Barry than finding jobs for District residents, many of whom are low-income wage earners. During his three previous terms as Mayor, from 1978 to 1990, economic boom years for the country, the city government grew to more than 57,000 positions.
But as economic conditions turned sour during the term of his successor, Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly, bloated government was blamed for much of the city's growing financial difficulties.
During his campaign for mayor last fall, Mr. Barry refused to take responsibility for the economic downturn and campaigned on the theme of fixing a broken government without cutting jobs. Even when the Congressional committees that oversee the city's operations hounded him to cut jobs, Mr. Barry refused. Instead, he attributed the District's financial problems to Congress for shackling the capital's government with costs that other cities generally share with a county and state government.
But with the control board empowered to reject budget proposals, Mr. Barry acceded to its recommendation that the size of the city government, 45,461 positions, be reduced to 39,861 by the end of the 1996 fiscal year. His agreement to cut the work force, along with responses to other board recommendations, has been forwarded to the City Council for approval.
"The recommendation is based on what I believe is best for the city, not best for Marion Barry politically or the City Council politically, but what is best for Washington," Mr. Barry said.

HEADLINE: Hertz Increases Price of Car Rental by $5

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The Hertz Corporation said yesterday that it would increase its daily rental rates by $5, effective immediately, to offset rising prices of new cars.
Avis Rent A Car System and Alamo Rent A Car said they would follow Hertz, the nation's largest car rental agency. 
 "The whole industry is in the same cost situation," said Craig Koch, president and chief operating officer of Hertz. "We wouldn't have taken the increase if we didn't think they would follow."
The costs of replacing cars in rental fleets has risen 30 percent a year since 1992. Hertz and some of its competitors tried to pass on some of those costs in September by raising rates $3 to $4 a day, but price wars chipped away the gains.
This time, vacation and business travelers will feel the pinch as Hertz increases its average rental rates from $45 a day.
The $14 billion industry -- dominated by Hertz, Avis, Budget and Enterprise -- relies on Detroit's Big Three auto makers to supply them with the bulk of their rental cars.
During the recession, auto makers gave rental agencies cut-rate prices to clear out vehicle inventories. But an improving economy has tightened supplies of automobiles and pushed up prices for the last three years.
"We certainly feel that it's imperative for rates to go up, given the circumstances with the manufacturers' price increases," said Demetria Mudar, a spokeswoman for Avis, based in Garden City, L.I.
The Hertz increases take effect immediately. Only rental rates in the United States are affected.

HEADLINE: A Second Look at Child-Support Laws

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 25

 BODY:
If James Pascale were living in California, he might be paying a lot less child support because of the time he spends with his 11-year-old son and twin 9-year-old daughters.
But he lives in New Jersey, where the State Supreme Court has ruled that his former wife, Debra Pascale, should continue to have complete control over the $25,000 both parents contribute each year to support their children. 
 "The way things are I might as well live on the moon and write checks," Mr. Pascale said, insisting that he does not want his support obligation reduced but that he only wants to share in decisions about how some of it is spent. He argued unsuccessfully that his visitation arrangement with his children was nontraditional and should be exempt from the state's child support guidelines.
The argument made by Mr. Pascale is being heard around the country, as courts and legislatures take a fresh look at divorce laws that include a crazy quilt of child-support standards.
Ellen J. Effron, secretary of the American Bar Association's Family Law Section, said, "Virtually every state is encountering arguments that noncustodial parents who spend much more time with their children should be allowed a deviation from the guidelines, and that's the problem."
An overwhelming majority of cases involve fathers who pay support and mothers who have custody. The Census Bureau reported earlier this year that there are 1.6 million custodial fathers, compared with 9.9 million custodial mothers.
"The big issue is, are we really going to redefine the family and fathers' roles?" said Marvin Ventrell, executive director of the National Association of Counsel for Children, based in Denver.
The unanimous New Jersey Supreme Court decision strengthened Mrs. Pascale's control over the "day to day structure of the new family." By contrast, in California, a noncustodial parent, usually the father, can reduce his support payments by increasing the number of visits with his children.
Michael Barber of Sacramento, a former member of the Federal Commission on Interstate Child Support and a former chairman of the child-support subcommittee of the American Bar Association, said that in a middle-class family with two children, a visiting parent who never saw his children pays about $1,050 a month in support payments, but that could be reduced to $123 a month if he divided child-care time equally with his former wife.
"This produces conflict, since the visiting parent is always trying to get to see the children more often to lower his support payments and the custodial parent is trying to frustrate that to keep the payments up," he said.
A better approach, he said, would be a two-tier system that provided a permanent level of support for fixed costs of maintaining the home for the children and a second level that could fluctuate with the frequency of visits.
Under the Federal Family Support Act of 1988, each state is required to establish child support guidelines, either by legislation, court rules or agency regulations, and to review them every four years.
In the last year, there has been increased pressure in Congress to establish a study commission to come up with national guidelines. But Bruce I. Afran, Mr. Pascale's lawyer, said a national support guideline would be a mistake.
"Each state knows what works best in their environment," he said. "Besides, there is a big difference between the cost of raising a family in Manhattan and in Montana."
The Federal Department of Health and Human Services has commissioned a study of state support guidelines, which is gathering information on the variety of issues that can occupy state rule makers.
In North Carolina, special adjustments for teen-agers' clothing was an issue. Elsewhere, states tried to decide whether courts should have the power to waive support payments, knowing that the children would suffer if a custodial parent impeded visitation. None of the reports discussed increasing support payments if the visiting parent failed to exercise visitation rights, which could add significantly to the custodial parent's expenses.
Colorado and Utah said the parent who did not have custody should have the children for overnight stays 25 percent of the time before becoming eligible for a reduction in support payments. In Alaska, the threshold was set at 30 percent, and Idaho recommended 35 percent. Several states concluded that the custody sharing would have to reach 50 percent before adjustments could be made. Other states avoided such tests entirely and said support levels should be left to the discretion of the courts.
A report released last year by the Women's Legal Defense Fund following a study of state guidelines, stated that the living standards of children continue to decline drastically after their parents divorce, just as they had before the 1988 law. Diane Dodson and Joan Entmacher, the authors of the report, said that applying Bureau of Labor Statistics standards, "The children's households' living standards would decline an average of 26 percent, and those of the fathers would increase an average of 34 percent, for all typical families."
Protecting the children's living standards, and preventing them from sliding into poverty, is a chief concern of courts dealing with child support issues. Justice Marie L. Garibaldi, who wrote the opinion, said parents who fight over their support obligations without considering the impact on their children are missing the point. In the court opinion, she said, "Child support is the right of the child and the responsibility of both parents, not a chip won or lost by the custodial parent from the noncustodial parent during divorce."
Gary N. Skoloff of Livingston, a lawyer specializing in family law, said the New Jersey Supreme Court opinion appeared to be a "result-oriented decision for efficient administration in certain cases" intended to avoid an increase in litigation. The result, he said, was unfair, ignoring the legitimate claims of "fathers, real fathers, not those who do the minimum necessary, but those who want to spend more and more time with their children."
The court is awaiting a new report from the Subcommittee on Child Support of the court's Family Practice Committee, which has reviewed the child support guidelines every two years since 1986. The aim is to base child support schedules on more accurate estimates of child-rearing costs and to increase the upper limit of those schedules, the court said.
The Legislature, which is considering revisions to the state's divorce law, decided not to deal with child support issues immediately, but asked Sara Flohr, manager of planning and budget for Princeton University, to act as liaison with the court's subcommittee. Ms. Flohr said the final report could be ready next month and that it might deal with the issues raised by the Pascale case as well provide an update of economic issues.
In addition, a bill that would create a legislative commission to study custody and child support has been passed by the Assembly and released by a Senate committee. It is expected to pass the upper house if the Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, posts it for a vote when the Legislature returns later this year.

The End of Something

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: BORDEAUX, France

 BODY:
The U.S. consulate in Bordeaux died last week. It was 205 years old. The oldest living consulate in American diplomatic history succumbed to a variety of ailments, including CNN disease, faxatosis, AT&T-Direct, global integration and most of all the lingering effects of a Congressional ax attack. The Bordeaux consulate is survived by the American Embassy in Paris and its sisters, the U.S. consulates in Strasbourg and Marseilles. Memorial donations may be sent to the General Operating Fund of the U.S. State Department in Washington. (It needs the money.) No memorial service is planned.
Yes, in case you missed it, the State Department announced last week that to appease Congressional budget-cutters it was closing down 19 consulates and embassies, including Bordeaux. Normally the closure of a consulate with two U.S. diplomats and nine locals would not be worthy of note, but Bordeaux is a bit different. It was opened by the Washington Administration -- that's George Washington -- in 1790 as America's first consulate abroad. In closing consulates like Bordeaux, the U.S. is turning its back on the past and the future of U.S. foreign policy for the sake of the present. 
 Bordeaux port was named the first consulate because it had become renowned for supplying the American rebel colonists with arms (and wine). It was from Bordeaux that Lafayette sailed off to fight in the Revolutionary War and it was Bordeaux's city father, Baron Montesquieu, who inspired the separation-of-powers concept in the U.S. Constitution.
But Bordeaux's future is also intriguing. As several Bordeaux businessmen pointed out, an increasingly united Europe is moving today from a collection of states to a collection of economic regions. And the region of southwest France, of which Bordeaux is at the center, is among the most dynamic in Europe. It includes the core of the European defense and aerospace industry -- Airbus Industrie, ATR and Dassault -- the soon-to-be-opened French nuclear-weapons simulation center, Ford and I.B.M. plants and, of course, the cutting edge of the French wine industry. The U.S. is southwest France's biggest trading partner -- $5 billion in exports to the U.S., $3 billion in imports. It's a region worth watching.
"Europe is coming together and we're going home -- it makes no sense," says Charles de Guigne, an American businessman in Bordeaux.
Only in the present does it make sense. No question that in an era of CNN and fax machines, consulates are not as critical as they once were. But there is nothing like having a U.S. consul showing up regularly at the opening session of city governments, local functions and business gatherings, keeping tabs on everything and offering more in the way of American culture than McDonald's and Mickey Mouse. Bordeaux's closing is not a disaster, say French businessmen here, just another sign that the America they grew up with won't be around much longer.
Closing a consulate like Bordeaux might be all right if the U.S. Embassy in Paris could pick up the slack, but it can't. Like all other major European embassies, Paris is being cut by 25 percent. In a rare move, the State Department this year didn't even give the Foreign Service exam to young Americans aspiring to be diplomats, because it had no job openings.
According to diplomats, the U.S. ambassadors to Italy, France, Britain, Spain, the E.U., Germany, Russia and NATO got together in March and sent a secret cable to Secretary of State Christopher, signed by all of them, telling him that the "delivery system" of U.S. foreign policy was being destroyed by budget cuts. They pleaded with him to mobilize those constituencies in the U.S. that value the work of embassies, and volunteered to come to Washington to testify before Congress in their defense. The ambassadors got a polite note back from Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott, telling them he understood their concerns but that there was a new mood in Congress. There was no invitation to testify.
But here's the good news. The closure of the 19 embassies and consulates will save the U.S. Treasury $12 million.
"Twelve million dollars a year?" asks Robert Beynat, head of the Chamber of Commerce of Bordeaux. "You are doing all of this for $12 million? That is 20 percent of the Bordeaux Chamber of Commerce's annual budget."

HEADLINE: Looking Backward in India

 BODY:
India's recent drive toward economic liberalization is a remarkable success story in the developing world. With overseas investment pouring in, the economy has boomed. But now many of India's gains are imperiled by a recrudescence of nationalist sentiment that threatens to drive foreign companies away. Fear of economic colonization is as old as India itself, but India's leaders must transcend these anxieties if future progress is to be secured.
The focus of the latest anti-foreign hysteria is a proposed $2.8 billion power plant to be constructed outside Bombay by a consortium of American companies led by the Enron Corporation of Houston, a large natural gas supplier. The plant would be the biggest foreign investment in India since the economy started opening up five years ago. It is also desperately needed. 
 Construction began earlier this year in Maharashtra state. But in March, the ruling Congress Party was swept from power in Maharashtra by two Hindu revivalist parties, which charge that the plant was a sweetheart deal and want to cancel it. They also complain that foreign investment has hurt India's poor. Suddenly, potential investors are wondering if India is reverting to the days when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi expelled Coca-Cola, I.B.M. and other big American companies, closing the country off economically for two decades.
This would be a startling reversal. In recent years, even the Communist Party has begun to welcome foreign investment. It is an especially ugly paradox that Mohandas Gandhi's inspiring independence-era cry for swadeshi, or self-sufficiency, has now been picked up by his old enemies, the Hindu chauvinists. Leading the charge is the Shiv Sena, a party with links to the goons who carried out the anti-Muslim riots in Bombay a few years ago.
Though committed to canceling the power plant, the leaders of Maharashtra could still support a face-saving deal, perhaps persuading the Enron consortium to charge lower prices for power. The Government of Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao should continue to support the project by threatening to override any cancellation by the state government. But the ideal outcome would be for a show of political maturity by the other opponent of the plant, the Bharatiya Janata Party or Indian People's Party.
With the Congress Party splintered, the Bharatiya Janata stands a good chance of coming out on top in the next national elections. The Bharatiya Janata could gain respectability -- and save the project -- by showing that it can put national interests ahead of sectarian impulses.

HEADLINE: Bad Advice for Arafat

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Thomas Friedman's column ("Muffled Militants," July 19) on the Islamic fundamentalist challenge cites the new Palestinian state as an example of "secular authorities" improving living conditions because Yasir Arafat "today has 60,000 people on his payroll in Gaza," thus providing employment and weakening the ability of Hamas to recruit. 
 In the same column, Mr. Friedman attacks such "secular Arab states" as Egypt and Algeria for "heavy-handed bureaucracies," which quash "commerce and entrepreneurship."
But the Arafat statist achievement he praises is in direct opposition to the economic advice he gives other Islamic states. Similarly, his plea for the "liberation of women," if heeded, would flood Arab labor markets and further depress wages. His call for "privatization of state industries" would result in unemployment of many of those 60,000 workers in Gaza. Encouraging Mr. Arafat to repeat the mistakes of other secular Arab regimes is surely not a solution.

HEADLINE: In Korea, Democracy Still Has Far to Go

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your July 19 news article on the hastiness of South Korea's postwar construction boom highlights the darker underside of Korea's "economic miracle." However, as I learned on a trip there last month, it is not only the recent construction boom that rests on a dangerous foundation.
The transition to the "New Korea" promised by President Kim Young Sam, where internationally guaranteed human rights would be respected, remains dangerously incomplete. The laws authorizing arbitrary arrest and detention, suppression of free association, expression and assembly that propped up decades of military rule are actively used by President Kim against political opponents and labor activists. 
 During May and June the Government invoked these laws against independent union leaders and activists in violation of basic human rights and labor rights in particular.
President Kim arrives in Washington in a few days for a three-day visit, and there is a real opportunity to press him to respect human rights. Korea has applied for membership in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, the club of industrialized democracies. The O.E.C.D. entry process provides valuable leverage to press Korea to reform its labor laws to meet international standards.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasurys Close Mixed Following Latest Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, with the long bond up, despite a barrage of indicators that suggested a sustained healthy economy would make it unnecessary for the Federal Reserve to lower rates again.
The 30-year bond gained 22/32 of a percentage point, to a price of 110 5/32. It yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.82 percent, from 6.87 percent on Monday and down from 6.92 percent at its worst point during the day. In the shorter maturities, bill rates were up about one-hundredth of a percentage point, and intermediate maturities were mixed. 
 Analysts said the market bounced back from its lows earlier in the day because of an encouraging outcome of a two-year note auction and because a Reuters report on Fed policy led to short-covering, which added momentum in the afternoon.
Short-covering occurs when a short sale goes awry. In a short sale, investors sell borrowed securities and hope to buy them back later at lower prices and pocket the difference. However, if prices begin to rise as they did yesterday, these investors have to cover their short positions quickly, buying back the securities to limit their losses.
Traders said the note auction went well, and that in itself suggested there was still a lot of positive feeling in the market. "There were a lot of reasons for this auction to go badly, and for it to go well is a good sign," said Waldo T. Best, senior economist at Barclays De Zoette Wedd Securities in New York. Two of the key reasons were reports signaling a significant pickup in the housing sector and in consumer confidence.
"If we could get the five-year to go this well, it would mean that the rally can still go further," Mr. Best added.
The Conference Board's July consumer confidence report rose to 99.9 from 94.6, indicating that consumers were feeling good about spending and the outlook for employment. This came on top of a report by the National Association of Realtors that showed housing resales in June were at their highest level since last October, as lower interest rates helped attract buyers. Overall sales were up 6.5 percent last month to an annual rate of 3.78 million, compared with a 4.7 percent gain in May.
Another report issued yesterday, this one by the Labor Department, showed that American businesses' wage, salary and benefit costs rose seventh-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter, suggesting wage inflation was nearly nonexistent.
Charles Roden, managing director and head of fixed-income investing at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said yesterday's strong finish by the market surprised many.
He said market's turnaround from early morning weakness could probably be traced to a number of events, one of them being a report on the Reuters news wire that cited an unidentified Fed official as having said that future Fed rate moves hinged on whether inflation showed signs of slowing. "I'm sure that the market may have interpreted the story to mean that the Fed could lower rates even if business gets better, just as long as inflation is not a threat," Mr. Roden said.
"I think the weakness in the market over the last week or two reflects the market's readjustment in thinking, as it now realizes that it may not get these rate reductions by the Fed," Mr. Roden continued. "As a guy who runs money, I keep referring to the long end of market, and I think there is less room for interest rates to come down than there is for rates to move higher. Right now, I am more cautious at the long end of the market, and I am finding it better to err on the side of caution.
"On the short end of the market, rates probably could go lower, but only if European central banks cut their rates," Mr. Roden added.
The Treasury sold $17.75 billion of new two-year notes yesterday at a yield of 5.955 percent, up from 5.690 percent in June and the highest since 6.17 percent in May. Analysts had expected an even higher yield of 5.97 percent.
The Treasury is selling two-year notes in a single-price format, which the Government began after the 1991 Salomon Brothers scandal.
In the standard multiple-price auction, bids are awarded at the high, average and low yields. In the single-price system, notes are awarded at the highest yield needed to sell the securities.
Tomorrow, the Government will auction $11.5 billion of five-year notes, also through single-price auctions. And in when-issued trading late yesterday, the notes were being offered at a price to yield 6.25 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new two-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Yield . . . 5.955%
Low Yield . . . 5.882%
Median Yield . . . 5.938%

Data on U.S. Economic Gains Help Lift Dollar Against Mark

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was stronger against most leading European currencies yesterday, bolstered by signs of economic growth in the United States.
But the dollar was little changed against the Japanese yen as investors questioned whether more dollar purchases by Japan's central bank, the Bank of Japan, would lift it higher. 
 The dollar rallied after the Conference Board said consumer confidence increased this month. And a report by the National Association of Realtors showed a larger-than-expected 6.5 percent gain in sales of existing homes.
The data helped confirm expectations that the Federal Reserve, faced with a stronger recovery, would not cut short-term interest rates again this summer. Lower interest rates would hurt the dollar by making dollar-denominated deposits less attractive.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.3942 German marks from 1.3857 marks on Monday. The dollar edged up to 87.79 yen from 87.52 yen.
The dollar also received a lift against the mark after the German state of Hesse reported low inflation in the month that ended in mid-July.
It was the third state to report low inflation this week, raising speculation the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, might cut rates soon. On Monday, Baden-Wurtemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, reported that consumer prices declined slightly in the period.
"The inflation reports were very helpful to dollar-mark because they leave the door open for another ease," said John Rothfield, an international economist at Nationsbanc-CRT in Chicago.
The Bundesbank, which acts as the floor for German money market rates, last trimmed its discount rate on March 30 to a six-year low of 4 percent.
Against the yen, the dollar was little changed amid growing doubts that the dollar could be pushed higher.
Purchases by Japan's central bank were crucial to the dollar's rally last week, traders said. Analysts estimate that the Bank of Japan has bought as much as $1 billion a day since July 7, when both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan stepped in and bought dollars, taking the market by surprise.
Some traders said the action by the Bank of Japan would not be enough to push the dollar higher.
"The dollar's move up was engineered and artificial and didn't get a lot of credence," said Jerry Egan, managing director of foreign exchange at MTB Bank in New York.

HEADLINE: Reports Show Growth but Not Inflation

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
Three reports issued today indicated that the economy was growing moderately without stirring inflation.
The National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes rose 6.5 percent in June, above analysts' expectations. The Conference Board said consumer confidence increased this month. At the same time, the Labor Department reported that employment costs increased slowly in the 12 months through June. 
 The Labor Department's Employment Cost Index advanced just 2.9 percent in the year ended in June, matching the smallest gain since the department began calculating the data in 1981. In the second quarter of this year, the index, which measures growth in wages, salaries and benefits, rose a seasonally adjusted seven-tenths of 1 percent.
The slow growth "points to something different about this cycle," Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, said. "Inflation remains dormant in the fifth year of an expansion."
The index is considered one of the best gauges of inflationary pressures because employee compensation represents about two-thirds of the cost of a product.
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich called the slow growth in compensation a "large cloud in an otherwise blue sky" and something that would eventually come to haunt employers. "Productivity improvements are going into corporate profits, not workers' pockets," he said in an interview. "Workers are consumers. At some point, American workers won't have enough money in their pockets to buy all of the goods and services they are producing."
He added: "The lack of inflation obviously is a plus for all Americans. But it's difficult for many Americans to enjoy it if their paychecks are dropping."
June's 6.5 percent increase in sales of previously owned homes lifted sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.78 million units, the highest since last October, the National Association of Realtors said. In May, sales had risen 4.7 percent.
Data from the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation showed that 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.53 percent in June, down from 7.91 percent in May and 9.15 percent in January.
The index of consumer confidence compiled by the Conference Board rose to 99.9 in July from a revised 94.6 in June. The index had reached 102 in May.
"While consumer confidence declined in June, the current reading is at a reassuringly strong level," said Fabian Linden, director of the New York group's consumer research unit. "Consumers remain optimistic about the health of the U.S. economy."

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
Some airlines are going to great lengths to shorten flying time between North America and Asia.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
WITH little fanfare, Asian-bound passengers from the United States and Canada have been able to shorten their flying time across the Pacific Ocean by as much as three hours. While the flights benefit business and leisure travelers equally, the real motivation behind many of the flights is to make flying more convenient for business travelers, who pay the highest fares.
Northwest Airlines, for example, is so determined to accommodate its business travelers to Asia that on some flights it chooses to carry fewer leisure passengers and less cargo. While it flies in the face of conventional aviation wisdom to leave passengers behind on planes that are not full, Northwest's purpose is to eliminate stops en route that otherwise would be necessary for planes carrying heavier loads. 
 Because such fuel stops can delay arrivals by one to three hours, causing some full-fare customers to miss connections or important meetings, Northwest concluded that it was cheaper in the long run to forgo the revenue from some cargo and excursion passengers than to inconvenience business travelers.
"Northwest generates greater revenues and profits when we provide the service as promised to our high-yield passengers," said Michael Levin, the carrier's executive vice president of marketing and international operations, "because they will be more inclined to fly Northwest again."
Carefully stressing that the new policy does not compromise safety, Jim McKie, manager of Northwest's flight operations, added that there were still circumstances that would require a fuel stop -- for example, stronger head winds than expected or winds that shifted from tail winds to head winds.
Northwest also saves as much as an hour on its Seattle-Hong Kong flight by flying over airspace near the border between Russia and China, which was off-limits to Western carriers during the cold war. A number of American and Canadian carriers are either already flying the corridor or plan to do so soon.
According to Mr. McKie, Northwest pioneered the post-cold war flights over the far eastern air space of Russia, beginning with cargo flights in 1990 and soon including its passenger flights between Detroit and Tokyo.
The decision whether to choose these routes is made on a case-by-case basis -- depending on whether the savings in time and fuel will offset the several thousand dollars the airlines are charged for each overflight. In 1990 and 1991, Northwest often flew the routes over Russia even when it cost the carrier money to do so. The carrier was eager to develop those routes and willing to put up the money to enable Russia to improve its flight control system. Now, having done so, "if the savings aren't there," Mr. McKie said, "we won't go."
 
Return of First Class
Wasn't it only a year or so ago that many airlines were jettisoning their first-class sections, on the theory that nobody pays first-class fares any more?
The answer, it seems, is an unqualified yes and no. Fewer corporations allow employees to fly first class, but since business travelers still prefer first-class comfort and pampering, many airlines have retained their first-class sections -- for that occasional business or leisure traveler willing to pay first-class fares, but mostly in order to reward loyal passengers with upgrades.
America West is going a step further, by adding first class to the 39 planes in its 91-plane feet that do not already have it. "We've often talked about having a business-class cabin," said Michael S. Leonard, the carrier's senior director of market development, "but we concluded that business class was better for international routes than for domestic," which comprises the bulk of America West's route system.
Since America West is locked in furious competition with Southwest Airlines, an all-economy-class carrier, it also considered making its fleet entirely economy class. "But on many other routes we compete with full-service carriers," Mr. Leonard said, "and our market research showed we'd be much better off financially with first class and economy."
This way, he said, first class would be available for any business traveler wanting to buy a first-class ticket, and for upgrading passengers who buy full-fare coach tickets and even leisure passengers who fly America West often.
 
Price Isn't Everything
With travel and entertainment budgets regularly thrust under corporate microscopes, it is logical to conclude that those who negotiate business travel arrangements for employees choose low-priced hotels. Logical, maybe, but misleading. After interviewing travel managers at 20 major corporations, researchers at Cornell University's School of Hotel Administration found that only 18 percent of them selected a hotel that offered only a low price. The hotels most likely to win corporate bookings, according to two professors, Russell Bell and Richard Morey, were those nearest the business traveler's appointment. And as hard as it may be to believe, free breakfast and free airport shuttle service had little or no impact on whether a hotel would be selected.

HEADLINE: In a Ranking of Maternal Health, U.S. Trails Most Developed Nations

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
The United States ranks 18th in an index measuring maternal health, lower than most other developed nations in the world, a new study says.
The study reviewed the data in 10 categories of maternal health and gave each of the 118 countries surveyed a score based on its performance in those areas. Areas rated included the number of women who die during childbirth, teen-age pregnancy, contraceptive use, prenatal care and availability of safe abortions. 
 The study, released on Monday, shows that the chance of dying from pregnancy or childbirth varies dramatically in different parts of the world, from 1 in 7 in Mali to about 1 in 17,000 in Italy. The rate in the United States is 1 in 5,669. The study was done by the research group Population Action International in Washington.
The countries with the best overall rankings were, in order, Italy, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Belgium. Ranked the worst were Mali, Congo, Somalia, Angola and Zaire.
Although an important factor affecting the ranking is a country's relative wealth, said Dr. Shanti R. Conly, director of policy research for the group, some quite poor countries have worked on women's health issues and ranked well, while other nations of great wealth scored relatively poorly.
Last year, at the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, 180 nations reached an agreement urging all countries to make reproductive health services and contraceptives available to all by the year 2015.
The United States did not rank higher largely because of teen-age pregnancies -- its rate is about six times that of European nations -- and a relatively low rate of contraceptive use.
Although it still fell in the study's "very low risk" group of countries, the United States ranked behind such emerging countries as Taiwan and Singapore. And Dr. Conly contended that it "is likely to drop even farther if this Congress continues as it has started." A proposal to end public contraceptive services in the United States has been approved in committee, and another to cut aid to developing nations in Africa by one-third may be an indication of what is to come, she said.
Some relatively poor countries have made long-term commitments to health care and family planning, Dr. Conly said, and have succeeding in several important measures. "Their programs may not be the Cadillac models," she said, "but they give all people access to health care of some kind."
Costa Rica, Cuba and Sri Lanka have maternal death rates lower than 100 per 100,000 births, whereas about half the world's nations have rates of 200 to 1,750 per 100,000. The study also cited Tunisia and Vietnam as having made unexpected progress.
The report contained at least two surprises for researchers. One was that Italy ranked best in reproductive health in the world.
"We didn't expect this," Dr. Conly said, "because while use of family planning in Italy is high, over half of Italian couples use traditional methods like withdrawal and rhythm, which experts generally consider less effective. However, Italian women appear able to use these methods effectively, largely because safe abortion is available on request."
Another surprise, Dr. Conly said, was that countries like Indonesia and Bangladesh, which have become exemplary nations in offering family planning broadly, nevertheless fall in the "high risk" category because their death rates from pregnancy and childbirth remain high.
The study looked at three areas for each country: family planning, which the researchers said reduced the risks associated with frequent childbearing and reliance on unsafe abortion; pregnancy and childbirth, including such related health concerns as AIDS and anemia, and post-pregnancy issues like infertility.
The nations of the former Soviet Union were not included in the survey because some data for those nations were not available in comparable form.

HEADLINE: Required Reading: Grisham, Clancy, Rice and Proust

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
When summer heats up, the reading list of the average college student splits three ways. It's a division that reflects struggle among three impulses. The urge toward enlightenment wrestles with the need to find a job, and both can be pinned to the mat by the swinish desire to wallow in trash.
An informal survey of college bookstores around the country yields a best-seller list that is fraught with contradictions. Some titles, tony and highbrow, suggest that America's colleges really are coaching the best and the brightest for victory in a highly competitive world economy. There are others -- many of them, in fact -- that paint a different picture of the college population. 
 It would be pleasant to think that the flower of American youth is taking advantage of the summer to mount a frontal assault on Gibbon's "History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" or Proust's "Remembrance of Things Past." It's just as likely, though, that students are thumbing through the resume writer's equivalent of "Thinner Thighs in 30 Days" or staring slack-jawed at "The Courtship of Princess Leia."
John Grisham and Tom Clancy rule. "The Chamber" and "Debt of Honor" pop up on nearly every Top 5 list. "The Celestine Prophecy," a squishy New Age tome, also sells briskly.
The plea here seems to be, Guilty, with an explanation. "You've got to allow them one beach book," said Toby Cox, the promotions manager at Brown University's campus bookstore.
Other titles are harder to explain away. "I'm embarrassed by this, but in this store we actually do sell 'The Bridges of Madison County,' " said Joe Dickson, the trade-book buyer at the Johns Hopkins campus bookstore in Baltimore. Things could be worse, and they are. Also on the Hopkins best-seller list is "O. J.'s Legal Pad," a collection of sophomoric doodlings and comments presented as the handiwork of the world's best-known murder defendant. "I'm a little embarrassed by that too," said Mr. Dickson.
At the University of Texas, in Austin, students are bingeing on "Memnoch the Devil," by Anne Rice, and "The Illuminatus Trilogy," a cult science-fiction title by Robert Shea and Robert A. Wilson. Honor is saved by Milan Kundera's "Laughable Loves," Isabel Allende's "House of the Spirits" and Douglas Hofstadter's "Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies."
Similarly, at Square Books, near the University of Mississippi in Oxford, the two top sellers, Kirsty Gunn's "Rain" and Sebastien Japrisot's "Very Long Engagement," suggest a level of taste and intellect one might hope for in William Faulkner's hometown. Unfortunately, "The Beer Lover's Rating Guide" lowers the tone.
Somewhat encouragingly, Richard Preston's "Hot Zone," a perfectly respectable title, is giving Mr. Grisham and Mr. Clancy a run for their money at nearly every college bookstore.
The looming prospect of job interviews and self-promotion has propelled sales of "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People," by Stephen R. Covey, a best seller at many campus bookstores. At Cornell, students are also buying "Cover Letters That Knock 'Em Dead" and "Resumes That Knock 'Em Dead." Although the resume book does not go into this, it's probably not a good idea to put "Tom Clancy novels" under the heading "Outside Interests."
Highbrow titles fall into two categories: proven commodities and local cults. Most college bookstores report steady, strong sales for Mr. Kundera's "Unbearable Lightness of Being," Ms. Allende's "Paula," Toni Morrison's "Beloved," Gabriel Garcia Marquez's "Love in the Time of Cholera" and Sandra Cisneros's "House on Mango Street."
At the University of Southern California, students are still buying the old warhorses like Jack Kerouac's "On the Road" and the novels of Ayn Rand. At Brown, "Lolita" and "The Sound and the Fury" make the Top 20.
Local taste and local conditions can bend the best-seller list in strange ways. Terry Zwigoff's documentary film "Crumb" opened recently in Austin, Tex., and it has pumped up demand for "The Complete Crumb Comics." This year, A. R. Ammons edited "Best American Poetry," a popular annual anthology. He teaches at Cornell, and his influence is reflected in strong local demand. Likewise, "Montana 1948" is a top title at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis at least in part because its author, Larry Watson, is a Minnesota writer and the book is published by a local press. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "Being Digital," by Nicholas Negroponte, sells well, which is not surprising, since its author is the founder and director of the Media Lab at M.I.T.
In general, movies move books, at least temporarily. Many college bookstores report Maeve Binchey's "Circle of Friends" among their Top 10 titles, as well as "Apollo 13," by Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger. In Austin, the title gets an extra boost. "He's almost local," said Ella Watson, the manager of the general books department at the University Co-op Bookstore, referring to Mr. Lovell, the former astronaut. "He lives about 30 miles from here."
Some titles, of course, defy the changing seasons and are immune to fickle fashions and trends. Colleges throughout the land report steady demand for that next-best thing to the book itself: Cliffs Notes.

HEADLINE: A Workaholic's Worst Nightmare? Vacation

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
WHEN Brian Fraidin invites friends to go away with him on vacation, he speaks frankly. Don't get too excited, he warns, because he will probably cancel. In fact, he regularly aborts trips just days before they are supposed to happen. He can live with disappointing others, he said, because work comes first.
"Sitting on a beach sounds appealing to me," said Mr. Fraidin, who owns a venture capital firm in Baltimore and took his last vacation three years ago (it was a weekend trip to Florida). "But once the day is over, what have you accomplished?" 
 Summer travel is booming, agents are reporting huge numbers of bookings, and travel during May was up 11 percent from the same period last year, said Steve Loucks, a spokesman for the American Society of Travel Agents, a trade group in Alexandria, Va.
Yet, there are still some feverish holdouts who refuse to leave their office chairs, even when the rest of their colleagues have long ago left to burn under the sun. They just cannot seem to take all the time they have coming to them, even when their employers insist they must.
Those who go months and even years without vacations do so for a variety of reasons, including widespread layoffs that have increased the workload on individuals, economic insecurity and simple garden-variety neuroses, said human-resource managers and employees in more than a dozen companies around the country.
In interviews, a fairly consistent portrait of vacation-free employees emerged. They tend to be salaried rather than wage employees, often working in management. Most said their own sense of responsibility, or fear of how bosses might react to requests, pushed them to work hard.
"I hadn't been at the company very long," said Elizabeth English, 29, a senior programmer at Lehman Brothers in New York. "So I felt eight days were too many to take last year. It seems hard to get away in general because there are so many demands to be met. It took me four weeks to ask for a vacation this year, and even then, I asked for it in E-mail."
Certain professions like advertising, law and financial trading seem to draw such people. Eileen Canty, an organizational psychologist at William M. Mercer, a human resources consulting group in New York, said that they were easy to spot.
"People say, 'For my vacation, I'm going to paint the garage,' " she said. "They feel they always have to get something done."
A just-released survey done for the Hilton Hotels Corporation found that 38 percent of adults in the United States have not taken a vacation in at least a year. Despite their reluctance to leave work, 67 percent of those surveyed said they would trade a day's salary for a day off.
The survey, conducted by Strategic Consulting and Research in Los Angeles in random telephone interviews with 1,025 adults last fall, also found that while 19 percent of the respondents sneaked away from the job to play hooky last year, just as many skulked off during their vacation to work. The study has a sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The travel industry is fighting to make sure these people do not slip through the cracks. It has come up with new ways to snare those who can afford only weekend getaways, and airlines have increased the number of rock-bottom fares they offer for fast trips to places like Paris, where travelers can presumably take a bite of a croissant, wipe their mouths and then head back to the airport.
"The offerings of four-day, three-night packages to places like London or Paris have dramatically increased in just a couple of years," Mr. Loucks said.
A number of human resource managers said they could not estimate the number of employees who take less than their allowed vacations, because they do not keep records of how much vacation time is used; presumably, too, they are not eager to paint themselves as holding cells for workaholics.
But many acknowledged that they had a problem getting some people to take vacation time.
"It tends to be the case that top management here has a healthy allotment of time off and that they often don't take it," said Lorrie Crum, a spokeswoman for Rubbermaid Inc. in Wooster, Ohio.
Jon Firestone, the president and chief executive of BBDO, Minneapolis, an advertising agency, said: "We find that most of our senior employees never use up all of their vacation. It is just consistent with the dedication and kind of drive that got them where they are to begin with."
Some people said that visions of an overflowing in-box would destroy the scant thrill brought on by a jaunt to Martha's Vineyard.
"I haven't taken a vacation for three or four years," said Daniel Braun, 34, a vice president of graphic services at a New York advertising agency. "If I took one, I would just have more work when I came back."
Companies often offer incentives to encourage workers to take vacations because the unused time is treated by their accountants as debt. To address the problem, many companies push employees to take vacation time by refusing to allow them to roll it over to the next year. Others, like Interbake Foods, Bausch & Lomb and Du Pont, offer workers a chance to "purchase" time by taking payroll deductions in exchange for an extra week of vacation. The logic may be that if it costs something, workers will feel they deserve it.
In the early 1980's, the Intel Corporation, in California's Silicon Valley, started a mandatory paid sabbatical program for employees who have worked for seven years or more. "We were finding that people who had been strong, successful employees would burn out after seven years," said Howard High, a spokesman for the company. "And we would start to see a blip in turnover at those points."
For at least eight weeks, employees go to the beach, teach a class or do whatever else they fancy, with a guarantee that they have a job to come back to. Among the advantages, Mr. High said, are that subordinates get to try their hand at more difficult jobs and receive critiques, while those who actually hold the positions come back refreshed and recharged.
Clearly, though, vacation phobia is simply built into some personalities. It would seem, for example, that people would naturally dream of free time, of a place far away and exciting. A place with frozen drinks.
Bob Amos is not one of those people. A product development manager at MCI in Washington, Mr. Amos, 32, does not remember his last vacation and says he finds that fine. "It's not really a negative thing, because I enjoy what I do," he said. "My fantasy self is a tour guide leading a trip through the Amazon. Because to work is to be on vacation."
Kim Lepine, 48, a hairdresser, took her last vacation three years ago. Now that she owns her own salon on the Upper East Side, she does not plan to see the inside of an airplane anytime soon, unless, of course, it is for a business trip. "It's just my nature," Ms. Lepine said. "I've been working since I was 13. It's what I do. I'm a worker."
Sometimes, however, the family must take control. Bill Lynch, who was a Deputy Mayor of New York in the administration of David N. Dinkins and is now a vice president of McAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc., has taken only one vacation in five years.
It was not his idea. In 1990, his wife and two children strong-armed him into a week in Puerto Rico. Just to be sure no last-minute demands would derail the vacation, his daughter Stacy unplugged the phone before they went to the airport.
"I had to laugh and ask her, 'Am I really that bad?' " Mr. Lynch said. "I guess I am just paranoid that the city will fall off and float away when I'm not here."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Puts Heat on the Commerce Dept.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
With a summer heat wave that has gripped the capital for weeks, it was only a matter of time before Democrats and Republicans began bickering over what to do about the weather -- and more specifically, whether predicting it is still a legitimate role of government.
How to deal with the Government's giant weather bureaucracy -- privatize it, restructure it or cut its budget drastically -- is just one of the bitter arguments that broke out this week as Congress began to tackle the messy business of dismantling the Commerce Department, an invention of President Theodore Roosevelt that has come to embody all that the Republicans, especially the tear-it-up freshmen, say is wrong with big government. 
 It is hard to tell what the Republicans hate most about the Commerce Department, which Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, with an eye to staying abreast of other contenders for the Republican Presidential nomination, today called "the basement of the Federal bureaucracy."
In two days of hearings, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a branch of the Commerce Department, was blamed obliquely for the suicide of overregulated fishermen, its $491 million budget to promote promising but risky technology was labeled "corporate welfare," and Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown was accused of judging potential participants in his trade missions by their contributions to the Democratic National Committee -- an accusation that he vociferously denied.
Mr. Brown has dished it right back. He called the bills in the House and Senate to dismantle the department "unilateral disarmament" in trade competition against Japan. On Monday, he told Republicans in the House that he suspected they were on a "trophy hunt," eager to hang a Cabinet agency on their wall, and delivered a hard-edged message from President Clinton that he would veto a bill to scrap the department.
Mr. Brown, by all accounts, has been one of the most successful Commerce secretaries in years, a point that even many of his Republican sparring partners acknowledge. But with investigations into his own finances continuing, the Secretary's political capital these days is low. And on Capitol Hill, his department is a fat watermelon of a target.
Its problem is that it does everything. It negotiates trade agreements, it takes the census, it hands out money to cities and towns facing economic hardship (a role that no one in Congress has lambasted too harshly), it worries about sea turtles, it totals the gross national product and it runs the United States Travel and Tourism Administration.
But as two days of hearings have shown, it is a lot easier to talk about tearing a department apart than it is to figure out what to do with the pieces. The department's executioners say they can save nearly $8 billion over five years by dismantling it soon, killing some parts and moving other elements elsewhere.
But others say that figure is a budget-cutting fantasy, especially because most of the "dismantlement" bills simply move the department's functions elsewhere.
"Box shuffling does not make a government work any better," Mr. Brown told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee today. Then he told his Republican interlocutors that they would simply be playing into the hands of the Japanese, the Chinese, the European Union and other trade rivals. "We've finally got it working the way it should be working," he said.
Mr. Brown's critics are quick to note that many of the department's functions, working or not, duplicate other parts of the Government.
L. Nye Stevens, a General Accounting Office official, today delineated how the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which accounts for 44 percent of the Commerce Department's budget, overlaps work done by the Department of the Interior, the National Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
The issue that most seems to divide Democrats and Republicans is what to do with the parts of the department that hone in on national competitiveness.
Initially, for example, the critics, led by Representative Dick Chrysler, a Michigan Republican, wanted to wipe out the department's International Trade Administration, which negotiates and monitors trade agreements and puts political pressure on foreign governments to buy American goods. But at the hearings, even the most radical budget-cutters backed away.
"It makes a difference," Mr. Brown said, "when a Secretary of Commerce, accompanied by 25 or so chief executives, gets off a plane emblazoned 'United States of America."
Hard-line Republicans say that such trade advocacy smacks of corporate welfare. But since the International Trade Administration accounts for only 4 percent of the department's $4 billion budget, they have focused on other targets within the department. One of the juiciest is the department's Advanced Technology Program, which awards "seed money" to companies to pursue risky high-technology ventures.
The House Appropriations Committee recently cut such programs out of its proposed budget, calling them a Clinton Administration giveaway to business.
Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia, said today that if he believed in conspiracies, he would regard the effort to dismantle the Commerce Department as "some kind of foreign plot" intended to "force a technological and economic surrender."
Caught in the middle is American business, at once the beneficiary of many of the department's proposals and the biggest advocate of cutting government budgets and regulations. The Republicans seem confident that they can slash at the department without paying a big price among their traditional supporters. But Mr. Brown insisted today that he had received 2,000 letters from companies seeking to keep the department alive and well.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
N.B.A. Says It Is Willing to Address Players' Concerns

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Five weeks after they thought they had completed labor negotiations for the next six seasons, officials of the National Basketball Association and its union of locked-out players returned to the bargaining table yesterday but made no instant progress toward another agreement.
"We discussed and covered a lot of areas," Commissioner David Stern said after the five-hour meeting at a midtown Manhattan hotel. "I can't say that substantial progress was made, but we did indicate the owners' willingness to attempt to address areas of concern that have been raised by the players as long as a deal remained sensible economically." 
 Before leading a contingent of a dozen players to the talks, Simon Gourdine, the union's embattled executive director, dealt with yet another internal matter that has added to the image of a union under siege from within.
Gourdine wrote a four-page letter to W. Charles Bennett, who 24 hours earlier resigned as the union's financial consultant. Bennett charged, among other things, that Gourdine had misrepresented Bennett's analysis of N.B.A. profits to support the agreement the players refused to ratify.
In the letter, Gourdine recalled instances during negotiations in which he said Bennett expressed views contrary to those he stated in his letter of resignation. Bennett disputed that characterization.
In the renewed negotiations, Gourdine raised several issues dealing with the payroll cap and exceptions to it. The union's primary goal is to induce the league to abandon its quest for a luxury tax on top of the cap.
Gourdine agreed to the idea in the June 21 agreement in principle, but the players reacted vehemently to the tax, which teams would pay, ultimately at a 100 percent rate, if they exceeded the payroll cap by signing their own free agents to raises exceeding 10 percent.
"That was the challenge we all agreed was worth looking at," Stern said, referring to the tax. "We weren't able to make any progress on that point today."
The commissioner said the league was "determined" to try to address the concerns players have raised as long as the answers could be found in the economic package that would have been created by the rejected agreement, a package that he said would be worth more than $5 billion over six years.
Asked if he thought a deal could be reached quickly and easily, Stern said: "I don't think it can be done easily. As a result, it probably can't be done quickly. But both sides seem to be willing to engage in strenuous discussion."
The two sides did not schedule another session but agreed to speak in the next day or two. Faced with the possibility the players could vote to decertify the union, thus nullifying any agreement the negotiators might reach, Stern reiterated that the lockout would continue in the absence of an agreement.
Stern also said he felt that if an agreement were to be reached before a decertification election, the players would vote depending on how they viewed the new labor contract.
If the two sides reach agreement, the union will handle ratification differently than it did last month. In a memo to players, Gourdine told them, "If we are able to reach a new agreement with the owners, we will hold regional meetings for all players, and then each of you will be given an opportunity to vote on whether it should be approved."
Regional meetings and vote of the entire membership, not just the player representatives, are steps the union rejected after they were requested last month by the union's agents advisory committee. Players who are clients of agents on the committee began the movement to decertify the union.
The resignation of its financial consultant is the latest problem the union has had to face. Responding to Bennett, Gourdine defended his view of Bennett's analysis by recalling a bargaining session last May 18. At that session, Gourdine wrote, Stern said a union proposal "would 'bankrupt the owners.' "
Bennett, Gourdine added, acknowledged before a break in the session that the proposal would "leave the owners with a minimal profit -- a total of $14 million for all the teams, to be exact."
"In sum," Gourdine wrote, "the teams' profits are declining, and to the extent that your letter disputes this reality, we are at a complete loss to understand where you are coming from and where you have been for the past 16 months."
Bennett said he would answer Gourdine privately in another letter but that Gourdine's recollection made no sense.
"If it takes you three months to analyze the league's revenues, you can't analyze profits just before the break," Bennett said by telephone from Albuquerque, N.M.
In a memorandum to players two weeks ago, Gourdine said the league had given the union financial data showing a decline in operating income from $195 million for the 1992-93 season to $177 million for the 1993-94 season to $115 million for the 1994-95 season.
Leaguewide revenues, Gourdine told the players, had increased at a rate of about 8 percent a year while player salaries increased "at a greater and greater rate each year, reaching 20 percent last season."

HEADLINE: A Realistic Entity: Greater Sarajevo

BYLINE: By Ronald Steel; Ronald Steel, professor of international relations at the University of Southern California, is author of "Temptations of a Superpower."

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
The fall of the isolated Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnia, including Zepa yesterday, may be a blessing in disguise. In threatening air strikes to protect the "safe havens," NATO is misguided. The eventual withdrawal of Muslim troops and civilians from Gorazde, Bihac and Tuzla could hold the key to a political settlement.
The Bosnian Government should have abandoned these towns long ago. They were held because they were considered useful in the effort to reclaim lost territories and because the plight of their refugees engaged the conscience of the West. Now the Bosnian Government should scale back its unrealistic ambitions and withdraw its army to establish a viable, independent republic around Sarajevo. 
 This would help end the war. But for a truce to be established, the combatants and the Western allies will have to take hard realities into account. The Muslims cannot recapture the havens. Neither the United States nor Europe will send in enough ground troops to force the Serbs out of lands they consider theirs. The Muslim state in Bosnia is essentially greater Sarajevo and its hinterland.
Although the legacy of Munich in 1938 is often invoked in discussing the Bosnian tragedy, the conflict is a civil war. A better analogy is the Indian subcontinent in 1947, where Muslims insisted they could insure their safety only through partition into a Muslim Pakistan and a predominantly Hindu India. They have not been good neighbors since then, but both countries still exist.
In effect, Bosnia has already been partitioned. The Bosnian Serbs now have their homeland, which they will likely confederate with Serbia. The Bosnian Croats have their slice, which they expect to link to Croatia. And the Bosnian Muslims have the core of the country around Sarajevo. The Muslim army is larger than that of the Bosnian Serbs and, if the West forced the Serbs out of mortar range of the city, should be able to defend itself.
Would this division constitute ethnic cleansing? Yes, in the European tradition that did not stop with World War II. In 1945, millions of Germans were expelled from Poland and Czechoslovakia. In 1974, Greeks and Turks fled to separate parts of Cyprus. Although the Bosnian Serbs have been extremely cruel and brutal, their primary objective has been to drive the Muslims from coveted territory. This cannot be condoned. But it is not equivalent to Nazi genocide.
A political settlement does not have to assume good will on the combatants' part but simply that they recognize reality. The Serbs have largely achieved their territorial goals. Now they must be made aware that they have reached their limit. The Muslims must realize that others will not retake for them the lands they have lost.
So far, the West has not developed a strategy for dealing with Bosnia but has reacted spasmodically to events. (A typical case was the apparent bombing of Pale on Monday, for which France denies responsibility despite American claims that it was carried out by French planes.) Yet the fall of the "safe havens" makes possible a settlement that all sides can live with. This would involve:
* Withdrawing refugees (along with the United Nations forces) from the enclaves and resettling them in Sarajevo and predominantly Muslim areas around it. This area, a little smaller than 50 percent of the old Bosnia-Herzegovina, is big enough for the fewer than two million Muslims.
* Returning the Bosnian Muslim army from distant outposts so that it can defend Sarajevo. NATO air power and the forces being assembled by the British and French should be used to help the Muslims end the shelling of the capital, open the airport and carve out new borders around the lands they hold.
* Recognizing that Bosnia must shrink to survive. Just as Yugoslavia could not endure as a multiethnic state, neither can a greater Bosnia. Cosmopolitan Sarajevo may deserve its reputation as a multiethnic haven, but the rest of Bosnia is not one.
Small countries can prosper if reconciled with their neighbors, and Sarajevo has a relatively well-educated population and has been a center of industry. The West should offer economic and humanitarian aid and induce Croatia, an ally of Sarajevo's, to offer the Bosnians an outlet to the sea.
* Avoiding manipulation. The Muslims must understand that NATO will not grind the Serbs into submission. The Muslims should have the means to defend themselves but not enough to reopen the war. If they mount an offensive, the West should pull out its forces, withdraw its guarantees and terminate economic aid.
Would the Muslims accept such a solution? Probably, because they depend almost totally on Western protection. Would the Bosnian Serbs recognize this smaller Sarajevo? No one can be sure, but they are dangerously overextended and would have no desire to face a serious Muslim offensive around Sarajevo backed by Western air power. Further, Belgrade wants to bring them under control in anticipation of renewed war with Croatia.
Why not avoid all these unknowns and simply lift the arms embargo, as is called for in legislation making its way through Congress? Because then Europeans would immediately pull out their forces, leaving many civilians without food or shelter. The Bosnian Serbs would almost certainly attack Sarajevo. And the pressure for United States intervention would not diminish, particularly if the Muslims continued to lose the war.
Through clandestine shipments, the Muslims already have most of the weapons they can absorb. More weapons are unlikely to turn the tide of battle but would cause more casualties and could lead to a war between Serbia and Croatia. In that event, Bosnia would be but a sideshow, eventually to be divided up between its two more powerful neighbors.
A brokered political settlement is not a perfect solution. But it offers more hope than any alternatives. And it recognizes that since the Bosnians, like the other Yugoslavs, cannot live together, they must live separately.

Court Will Decide Future of Smoking Suit
 In a victory for the tobacco industry, a Federal appeals court in New Orleans ruled that it would decide whether a giant class-action against the nation's seven largest tobacco companies could continue. 
 The court's final decision could determine the fate of Castano v. the American Tobacco Company et al., the largest class action in history. The suit accuses the tobacco companies of addicting smokers. [Page D3.]
 Two Congressmen have proposed a plan that they say could curtail teen-age smoking without Federal regulation of tobacco. [A16.]
 
Discovery Lifts Amgen Stock
 Researchers have discovered a hormone that makes animals lose body fat, and Amgen has paid Rockefeller University $20 million for a patent license. The news sent the company's stock up $4.375, to $84.25. [A1.]
 
Anheuser-Busch in Spinoff

HEADLINE: Dayton Economic Message Mixed, Like Nation's

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio

 BODY:
At the Voss Auto Network, which runs five dealerships in the Dayton area, cars are hardly moving. Things are not much better at the cavernous BHA Piano Center here, where a weak dollar has sharply raised the price of the Japanese and South Korean models that increasingly dominate the market. Sales of homes are below 1994 levels, and Roberds Furniture and Appliances, with a half-dozen stores in and around the city, has increased its advertising but has yet to reap any benefits.
Six months ago, the Dayton region was riding the crest of an industrial revival in the heartland that had driven down the unemployment rate to 3.6 percent. But now, in the city where the Wright brothers created airplanes in bicycle shops and where John and Frank Patterson built the cash register industry, there are discouraging, if inconsistent, signs of a downturn. 
 Is the slowdown an early warning signal or a minor market correction, as they say on Wall Street? In recent months, economists and policy makers have pondered that question for the country as a whole. And just as an answer has eluded the Federal Reserve, there is no clear explanation for the mixed message found in showrooms and on factory floors here.
As is the case in many parts of the country, the signs in the Dayton region do not all point downward. In the auto supply factories and the General Motors and Chrysler assembly plants in the region, the demand is up for industrial parts and for used cars. And even as the demand for new cars has fallen, there is a surge in orders for auto parts.
All of this has led many to say that last year's boom may be over but nothing as serious as a recession is in the offing. After all, executives are continuing to bet with their order books that consumers will be regaining their confidence.
Despite a buoyant job market, the weakest part of the economic picture here, as it is around the country, is consumer reluctance to buy cars and other big-ticket items that involve borrowed money. Since consumers account for two-thirds of economic activity, the Federal Reserve probably had the caution of shoppers in mind when it decided last month to cut interest rates for the first time since 1992.
A disquieting sign of the times here for big factory employers is that the hot-selling Chevy S-10 Blazer, a sports utility vehicle made only in neighboring Moraine and in Linden, N.J., has suddenly become available to customers without a wait, even as G.M. has added a third shift here to produce it.
Selling new cars is "like hand-to-hand combat" these days, said Steve Lace, general manager of the Voss Auto Network, which sells Chevrolet, Cadillac, Dodge, Honda and BMW, among others. Fierce competition has prompted auto makers to offer ever-higher rebates and other incentives, and Voss has absorbed the 20 percent jump in the cost of floor planning (what it pays to finance its inventory) that resulted from the Fed's raising the interest rate seven times since February 1994.
Bob Royer, president of the BHA Piano Center, a family-owned company he describes as the state's second largest of its type, said sales are off 8 percent so far this year while profits are down twice that much.
More recently, skittishness about the economy on the part of consumers has spread to some manufacturers in the region. Dayton's reliance on factories is relatively high, with slightly more than 20 percent of jobs here factory-related. Unlike the 1980's, in the last year or so that rate has kept pace with employment growth. But this is starting to slip.
"We're beginning to see the average workweek dropping a bit," said John Weiler, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Dayton. This indicates less factory overtime, one of the most sensitive gauges of business activity.
Nonetheless, company officials said what they were seeing was different from what they saw in the months leading to the 1990-91 recession.
"We're seeing strength in all our product lines," said Hugh Becker, a spokesman for Robbins & Myers Inc., a producer of pumps, industrial mixers and large glass-lined vessels for industries like chemical makers. Not only have revenues surged by about 15 percent in the current fiscal year but backlogs climbed to $98.7 million at the end of May, from $77.6 million last November.
At the Dayton Supply and Tool Company, which distributes cutting tools to the auto industry, Carl Woessner, the president, is basking in a 25 percent revenue surge this year and marveling at the lack of any indication the pace will slacken.
"We couldn't be busier," Mr. Woesnner said, adding that his 40-employee company normally is one of the first to feel a downturn. "I don't see anything right now," he said. "That's what's so surprising to me."
And at the Ratliff Metal Spinning Company -- which makes parts for light fixtures and food processing equipment -- business is up 15 percent through June and three employees have been added to bring the work force to 17. In fact, Ratliff said, orders for its products are at record levels.
Such bulging order books bode well for the Dayton economy, suggesting unemployment will remain low here -- the latest reading is 4.1 percent -- and incomes will rise enough to bring consumers back to stores and showrooms.
If Dayton proves typical, the Federal Reserve will then have largely succeeded in engineering the so-called soft landing of the economy it has sought. There could be one more cut in the interest rate in late summer as final insurance against anything more serious than a pause for consumers to catch their breath after a euphoric ride.
"I just don't see the signs that we're going to have a really big downturn," said John A. Allen, general manager of Harmon Cadillac/ Saab on North Main Street, where sales of used cars have been especially strong this year. "People have substantial amounts of money and it's just a question of whether they want to turn loose."

HEADLINE: For Better or Worse, A Marital Milestone;
Ithaca Officials Endorse a Gay Union

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

DATELINE: ITHACA, N.Y., July 20

 BODY:
On Valentine's Day, hoping to reverse a streak of poor romantic luck, Toshav Greene took a chance, called Phillip G. Storrs and invited him on a blind dinner date.
By the time they got to the strawberry cake, it was plain that Mr. Greene's luck had changed. The two men quickly fell in love. By mid-May, they had moved here together from nearby Elmira, hoping to marry and rear children. When they went to City Hall to apply for a marriage license, however, they expected a rejection. 
 Instead, much to their own surprise, they may get a license.
The Mayor and other leaders in this college town, home to Cornell University, have embraced the idea of granting a marriage license to a gay couple. They would be the first officials in the nation to do so deliberately in more than a dozen years.
Occasionally, a clerk may grant a license to a same-sex couple, particularly if the names are indeterminate. Pasha and Penny Rivers-McMahon received a license in Burlington, Vt., last August, but the clerk asked to get it back minutes later and has since refused to record the union of the two women.
Phillip and Toshav Storrs (Mr. Greene has changed his last name to that of his partner) may not hold on to their license very long, either. City clerks merely act as agents of the state in registering marriages, and Republican officials in Albany may object to such a license and try to quash it.
But that does not deter Mayor Benjamin Nichols, 74, a Democrat and 40-year veteran of the civil rights movement, who has met with the gay couple and said, "If they really want to go ahead with it, my position is that they should be granted a license."
The City Attorney expects to rule by the end of the summer on whether the Federal or State Constitutions would compel issuance without regard to a couple's sex. And on July 5, the all-Democratic Common Council unanimously endorsed the right of same-sex couples to marry.
National gay civil-rights advocates fear that a short-lived victory here could provoke judicial and legislative setbacks for their movement. Several organizations are in the paradoxical position of urging the couple to hold off.
Confessing a "totally divided heart," Paula Ettelbrick, legislative counsel of the Empire State Pride Agenda, said: "Part of me very much wants to say: 'Go for it. The question has been called.' But what would be gained if we won the right today and lost it tomorrow because we had not done the grass-roots lobbying that we needed to do?"
Evan Wolfson, senior staff attorney of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, said, "If you go to a court that is uneducated or that is going to rule in a climate that's unreceptive, you're almost certainly going to get back a decision you didn't really want."
Mr. Wolfson is co-counsel to two lesbian couples and a gay couple who were denied licenses in Hawaii. The Hawaii Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that a denial appeared to violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. It sent the case back to a lower court for a trial that is to begin in July 1996. A license granted to a gay couple in Boulder, Colo., was invalidated by a Federal court in 1982, Mr. Wolfson said.
Since that time, weddings and commitment ceremonies have become a more common feature of gay life, as have the limited benefits offered by some governments and companies to domestic partners. But no lesbian or gay couple has won the considerable range of economic and legal rights that come with officially sanctioned marriage.
In the eyes of many people, that is as it should be. "Marriage is for men and women," said Arthur J. Golder, a lawyer in neighboring Trumansburg who has spoken out against issuing a license. "It's not about better health-insurance premiums or credit ratings or access to bridal registries."
"We're created as male and female for a reason," he said. "It's not to enjoy sex. It's to procreate. That's nature's mandate. And nature's mandate becomes man's law."
State officials may not put it quite that way, but no one expects them to look kindly on an attempt to certify a gay marriage.
Lawyers involved with the Ithaca case say they are watching to see whether Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco will nullify the license or prevent its issuance. His office would not comment. The Legislature might amend the domestic-relations law, which does not specify sex, to state explicitly that marriage can occur only between a woman and a man.
None of this has served to dissuade the Storrses.
"It could be potentially detrimental in the short term," Toshav Storrs allowed. "But it could be potentially fantastic. From the information we have, that's a 50-50 call. If it's right on the line, I opt to move forward."
And Phillip Storrs said it would be useful for the public to see that they were "just a couple of regular people." Mr. Storrs, 36, grew up in and around Troy, Pa. He works at the Toshiba television tube factory in Horseheads, N.Y.
Toshav Storrs, 34, grew up in rural Oklahoma and came here in 1979 as a freshman at Cornell. He dropped out of school but returned to Ithaca in the 1980's and met Daniel Chiarilli. They moved to Tulsa and reared two children. Mr. Chiarilli was killed in a car accident in 1991.
Mr. Storrs came back to central New York last year and enrolled at Elmira College. This fall, he plans to return to Cornell, in human development and family studies.
When they applied for their license, the Deputy City Clerk, William Kaupe, started filling out the form but the City Clerk, Julie Conley Holcomb, returned from lunch and halted the proceeding.
She cited the domestic-relations law but the couple challenged her to find any explicit prohibition of same-sex marriage. She could not. Ms. Holcomb directed them to City Attorney Charles J. Guttman.
He took their inquiry seriously, as did Mayor Nichols, whose background is steeped in leftist progressivism. "I started out the meeting saying I didn't know whether we could do it, but that I'd like to issue the license," Mayor Nichols said.
The Mayor's support turned their application from quixotic to conceivable. "He's the one who's made this engine run," Toshav Storrs said.
The legal issue, Mr. Guttman said, centers on whether denying a license to a couple of the same sex violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection and the fundamental right to marry.
For Ms. Holcomb, the issue is whether she might be found guilty of a misdemeanor for issuing a license improperly or, were she to refuse to grant one, end up being dismissed for insubordination.
Phillip and Toshav Storrs did not wait for the government. They exchanged vows in a private ceremony and then, on June 22, at a more public gathering. Rabbi David Castiglione presided at both.
If they get their license, a third wedding is in store. Toshav Storrs's sister, Cindy Williams, could not travel from Tulsa for the June 22 event. "She's hoping to make it to the next one," her brother said.

HEADLINE: Cost of 'Quiet on Set' Is Escalating

BYLINE: By KIT R. ROANE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 26

 BODY:
In his seven years as a location manager in the film industry, Patrick McIntire has rented noisy chain saws just so he could turn them off and paid lawn crews to stop clacking their shears and revving their leaf-blowers. Loud radios, barking dogs and immovable people have cost him a bundle.
Mr. McIntire is not alone. In Los Angeles and other California areas popular for filming, residents are sometimes making thousands of dollars from movie crews by promising to vacate outdoor sets, tone down noise or otherwise stop harassing them. The problem has become so acute that the State Legislature has stepped in, drafting laws to make harassing film crews for profit a criminal offense. 
 "It's gotten to the point where at almost every shoot, somebody has their hand out," said State Senator Herschel Rosenthal, Democrat of Van Nuys, the sponsor of one such bill. "People blow horns, walk through shots, make their dogs bark or crank their stereos. And they all demand money to stop."
A survey of 113 people in film production conducted by the California Film Commission in January found that half had been harassed by opportunists jockeying for money. One production manager said he had paid a man in Culver City to stop pelting his crew with pebbles and debris.
"The individual was compensated for the disruption," the manager wrote, adding that "after filming was in process, he decided the compensation was not enough and decided to throw empty cans."
Sometimes, hecklers wind up in jail when film production people decide to take the time to press charges under public nuisance laws. But enlisting law enforcement does not always stop the harassment. One production manager said he had called the police after a store owner in Venice Beach turned on a "boom box" during filming. After the police ordered the offender to tone down the music, the respondent wrote, "the owner still would not comply, instead calling his lawyer, who arrived with threats." The company, he said, finally gave up and moved.
Patti S. Archuletta, director of the film commission, which promotes shooting movies in California, said: "Warner Brothers called me saying they were held up for $500 by a guy wielding a ladle and a bucket, and a whole neighborhood tried to charge another group $500 just to let a film truck drive down the street. This has really gotten out of hand."
Though no one believes such penny-ante ploys will bankrupt the state's film industry -- a $17 billion-a-year business that employs more than 350,000 people -- some companies now routinely look for film locations outside of California to avoid harassment, Ms. Archuletta said. Others have moved their entire operations out of the state to get away from it, she said.
"This kind of institutional extortion is very bad for California," she said, "particularly Southern California. We have come to a point where people think it's business as usual to stand in front of a production and make life difficult. It's bad for the economy. It has to stop."
Film companies in New York City have not gone unscathed. City officials say that a man who claimed to be running a film school for disadvantaged youth tried to extort money from so many productions, including those of Woody Allen and Spike Lee, that the city was seeking a permanent court order to keep him off movie locations.
In California, two separate bills in the Legislature are aimed at halting the practice. One would make the offense a civil infraction, the other a criminal infraction, but both would carry fines. The bills, with separate sponsors, are now in committee. One is sponsored by Senator Rosenthal and the other by Assemblyman Jim Brulte, Republican of Rancho Cucamonga.
The bills would allow off-duty officers and licensed security guards to ticket offenders after one warning. Both bills would impose fines of up to $100 for the first offense and up to $500 for each later infraction.
Though the bills have strong bipartisan support, residents of popular filming locations and some union representatives have expressed concern that such a law could be used by film companies to muzzle the outspoken.
"I have seen horn honking, and I have seen residents shine lights at the set," said Robert G. Picard, chairman of the Department of Communications at California State University at Fullerton, and a resident of a popular filming area. "But a lot of this is not extortion; it's anger.
"You see some production crews who are very arrogant, and they just say: 'Get out of our way. We're bulldozing through, blockading your street and trampling your bushes.' And that's just not right. If this law is written over-broadly, it could make reasonable requests for compensation a criminal offense."
Ms. Archuletta said that the proposed language for both bills would protect the rights of unions to picket film companies and would allow residents to voice complaints about unruly productions to the commission.
"If you don't seek money, you can't be cited," she said. "This is not going to stop disgruntled people from being noisy. It's going to stop people from holding hostage an industry they perceive to be a cash cow."
She added that the law, which would allow officers to ticket extortionists immediately, could save productions thousands of dollars by reducing unnecessary delays. "Time is money in this business," she said. "As it stands, companies face hours of delay waiting for police to arrive and drag someone off to jail."
Mr. McIntire recalled the man in downtown Los Angeles with the sputtering chain saw, which he offered to the film crew for $5,000. The man, who was more than a block away, enlisted the help of lookouts on the street, Mr. McIntire said, and would open the throttle full bore every time the director yelled, "Action." The saw would miraculously go quiet at every shout of "Cut!"
When the chain-saw operator was given a package containing several hundred dollars, Mr. McIntire said, the saw fell silent.
"I don't mind forking over some cash if we are creating an inconvenience for people," Mr. McIntire said. "But a lot of this is just blackmail and bribery, and right now movie companies can't do anything but open their wallets."

HEADLINE: Crunching Numbers So the Bills Add Up

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER 

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 24

 BODY:
By his own estimate, Alan R. Kooney's line of work doesn't strike sparks at social gatherings.
"I tell people what I do and watch their eyes glaze over," he said. 
 Unless, of course, the listener happens to be one of the army of lobbyists wise to the back corridors of power in Trenton. Their eyes gleam when Mr. Kooney speaks, because they understand his vital role in helping frame the way New Jersey will spend $16 billion in the next fiscal year.
Mr. Kooney is the chief budget and fiscal officer in the Office of Legislative Services, the staff of nonpartisan experts who quietly run the nuts-and-bolts machinery of legislative government and try to stay out of the spotlight.
That is not always possible. When Mr. Kooney's team of fiscal analysts concluded last March that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's proposed budget contained exaggerated revenue projections, State Treasurer Brian W. Clymer strongly hinted that the analysis was slanted to play into the hands of those who opposed the Governor's income tax cut program.
"When the State Treasurer comes out and says our figures are dead wrong, things can get hot around here," said Albert Porroni, executive director of Office of Legislative Services and its chief legislative counsel. "But our ability to provide the best information available to the Legislature in a fair and nonpartisan way is the backbone of our work, even when that information may conflict with the goals of the party in power."
Legislators and their aides, past and present on both sides of the aisle, said the office walks the straight and narrow when it comes to partisanship.
"I can't remember a single episode of political favoritism shown by an O.L.S. staffer," said Brad Brewster, a lawyer and lobbyist who once worked as a committee aide in the Legislature and as staff director of Assembly Republicans. "They do a great job of instilling the idea of nonpartisanship and sticking to it."
Handling a mind-boggling variety of responsibilities, most of the office's 330 employees are quartered in the State House Annex, a squat granite pile next door to the domed Capitol. The annex was built in two stages, with the result that its electrical systems don't match, much like the politics played out in the building's high-ceilinged committee rooms.
Here the staff is available to lawmakers for one-stop shopping to get quick expert advice on legal, financial and procedural matters that may be unavailable from their own staff members, who are generally hired more for their skill in politics than their policy expertise.
The most influential jobs of the Office of Legislative Services are done by its career staff of 83 lawyers, fiscal analysts and a smattering of Ph.D.'s who run committees in both houses.
They schedule hearings, research and draft bills, and are called upon to perform a wide range of support activities.
"Part of my job is being so well versed in every bill on the agenda that when hard questions come up in debate, I'm the one everyone turns to for answers," said Kevil Duhon, a 35-year-old lawyer who serves as staff aide on the Senate Natural Resources, Trade and Economic Development Committee.
Other things the staff does include writing nonpartisan speeches for lawmakers on complex or esoteric subjects.
Other staff members also run the bill room in the State House, which provides the press and public with updated versions of legislative bills, and they run a computer service to 120 legislative offices around the state and 500 locations in the capital that lists legislative schedules, committee hearings and bill status reports.
Even as legislators and their partisan aides come and go, the professional staff stays in place, providing experience and institutional memory when more power is devolving to the states from Washington.
It wasn't always this way.
The office was created in 1979 to combine fiscal and research functions for the Legislature that were largely ignored in the past. Before the court-ordered "one person one vote" redistricting in the 1970's, which took control away from county political bosses, legislators labored in the shadow of a powerful executive branch.
"Bills were created by the governor, written into law by the governor, and the legislators all scrambled for a piece of the pie," recalled Mr. Porroni, a 24-year veteran of government service.
When legislators did propose bills, they were written by lawyers hired for the occasion or by lobbyists representing special interests. Substantive issues were debated in caucus, and bills were passed behind closed doors according to agendas set by party leaders.
Redistricting changed all that, by sweeping more independent-minded legislators into power who soon clamored for equality with the executive branch. The Assembly and Senate adopted a committee system staffed with professional aides who could match the expertise of bureaucrats in departments that reported to the governor.
Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean recalls that as a legislative leader in the 1970's, he urged a reluctant Gov. William Cahill to sign a bill creating an independent fiscal study group for the Legislature. "I don't think future governors will thank me for this," Mr. Kean remembers the Governor saying before signing the measure.
"When I became Governor and was fighting with the budget analysts over in the Legislature, I thought a lot about those words," Mr. Kean said jokingly in an interview recently.
In the view of Steven P. Perskie, a former Democratic majority leader in the Senate, the Legislature rapidly went from having "the barest skeleton staff" to having one of the best in the country.
In 1986, the Office of Legislative Services underwent further reorganization to consolidate the committee staffs. "We formed 10 teams according to subject areas like judiciary and environment, each team headed by a section chief," said Glen E. Moore 3d, director of the office's central management unit, a native Kentuckian with a taste for mints and wry humor.
Section chiefs, he continued, are seasoned masters of dealing with legislators who can turn snappish under great pressures to produce immediate solutions to a problem. "Meeting that demand in a professional manner becomes tricky, because there are a lot of alligators in the Legislature," he said. "Section chiefs can tell which are the rocks and which are the alligators."
Expertise is demanded of staffers, but so is a willingness to suppress egos and hold confidences, Mr. Moore said. "We look for personable people who are very interested in politics but have no political ambitions. People who won't push for passage of a bill just because they had worked on it for two months."
Lawyers and academics head the list of those who apply for staff jobs, which begin at $35,000 and top off at $70,000 after 20 years. By comparison, legislators are paid $35,000 a year and each has a total of $70,000 a year to spend on staff aides. Women fill about half of the staff openings, including four section chief slots, though the number of racial minorities is low: four are black, two are Hispanic and one is Asian.
Since confidentiality is part of the staff's requirements, stories about the shortcomings of legislators who arrive green and unprepared for a demanding job are not easily shared with outsiders.
Mr. Moore, who can't help laughing when he mentions episodes of what he calls "the legislative follies," does tell about a former legislator who once asked a staffer to write a bill requiring the construction of fishing platforms on all bridges in the state. "He was advised it would save the state money if the fishing platforms were limited to only those bridges crossing a body of water," Mr. Moore recalled, his blue eyes dancing.
"But many members are three steps ahead of us," he quickly pointed out, lest anyone think the chambers were filled with dunderheads.
Work on the budget represents six months of number-crunching by Mr. Kooney and analysts he borrows from section teams until the June 30 deadline for passage.
"In January, when the Governor proposes a budget, everything is lover-ly," Mr. Porroni beamed as he fluttered his hands and pirouetted on his office floor to portray a couple representing the Executive branch and the Legislature dancing in harmony.
"Then comes our budget analysis and party meetings," he says, his hands fluttering to a stop as the first sour notes are heard. "Then, on the eve of passage, all the budget is shoved at us and we have to put together a bill that has to be perfect." He drops his hands to his side in feigned exhaustion.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Woman Is Charged in Beating Death of Her Daughter, 3

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
A mother who lived with her husband and four young daughters in a cramped, subdivided Brooklyn apartment was charged with murder yesterday in the beating death of one of the children, a 3-year-old girl named Gabriella, who the police said bore the bruises of continual abuse.
The parents, Sara Munoz and Gilberto Vasquez, were illegal immigrants who came from Mexico several years ago, the police said. They found their way to Sunset Park, where many poor immigrant families live in illegally divided apartments and work in local factories and sweatshops. 
 Shortly after 7 A.M. yesterday, Mr. Vasquez, 25, took Gabriella to Lutheran Medical Center, saying he had found her unconscious, said Doram Tamari, a police spokesman. The girl died a while later, and hospital officials, whose suspicions had been aroused by the infant's heavily bruised body, alerted the police of possible child abuse.
After several hours of interrogation, Ms. Munoz, 25, was charged with second-degree murder. Mr. Vasquez was charged with endangering the welfare of a child, the police said, because Gabriella had been abused for some time and he had known about it.
The couple's three other daughters -- ages 6, 5 and 6 months -- were examined by doctors who found no evidence of abuse. They were placed in the custody of the city's Child Welfare Administration.
It was not clear last night why Gabriella was fatally battered or how long the abuse had continued. Nor could the police say why Gabriella had been singled out, and why her three sisters had been left physically unharmed.
"Who knows?" said Detective Jose Caban, one of the investigators who worked on the case at the 72d Precinct. "Sometimes one child is a little overactive. They lived in a very small apartment, and it was hot. So who knows?"
At the station house, the couple were "very somber," the detective said, adding, "They were just very, very quiet, looking down, not saying much."
The couple's journey to Sunset Park began five years ago when the father left Mexico and illegally entered the country, the police said. His common-law wife joined him two years later.
At some point, they gravitated to Sunset Park, which in recent years has seen an influx of legal and illegal immigrants from Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Mexico. The couple settled in the neighborhood's southern section, a block east of the Gowanus Expressway, where most of the Hispanic immigrants are concentrated -- unlike the area's other large group of newcomers, the Chinese, who live further east along Eighth Avenue.
Neighbors said the family occupied one bedroom inside a three-bedroom apartment where another family -- a couple with one child -- also lived. The two families shared a living room and bathroom. The four-floor walk-up building, at 6005 Fourth Avenue, had apparently been separated into smaller units, the police said.
"Almost every day, new people come to live here," said Gloria Flores, who lives on the fourth floor and who said the couple had lived in the building for only a short time.
Theirs was a noisy avenue. A bit further north, several X-rated businesses opened in the last three years, and closer to their apartment, drug sales are common and out in the open. And in the backyard of the couple's building, neighbors said, a body was found a few months ago, apparently tossed off the roof.
Like many of the area's newcomers, Detective Caban said, Mr. Vasquez found sporadic work in the factories and sweat shops that dot the neighborhood's west end, near the waterfront. But a neighbor on the same floor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Vasquez, who used to work 12-hour days, had been unemployed recently.
The couple blended into the neighborhood, and even after the several years they had spent in the city, they had learned little English. And even though the authorities believe Gabriella had been abused for some time, there had been no reports to Child Welfare, Detective Caban said.
In fact, he added, there were no official records at all of the couple's existence here.
But Ms. Flores, who lives directly above the couple, said she called Child Welfare a few months ago when she heard screaming from below.
"At night, I would look out the window, and I heard the kids screaming in the apartment," she said. "I thought something was wrong, but I didn't think things would end this way."
She said the mother took the daughters to a nearby day camp at a public school every morning. "The kids were skinny and always dirty, but the baby was healthy," she said.
But the neighbor who did not want to be identified said the mother had tried to make the best of things, staying at home with the children.
"The daughters are my daughter's friends," he said, as he stoodwith his 10-year-old girl. The mother "came here and had coffee several times," he said. "She was a very nice lady. We came from the same state in Mexico -- Puebla."
His 10-year-old daughter said she had been puzzled by Gabriella's demeanor on Tuesday. "She looked sad," she recalled. "I asked her why, and she didn't want to tell me why."

HEADLINE: Experts Offer a Wish List to Improve Transportation on the East Side

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
A team of transportation experts studying ways to relieve overcrowding on streets and subways on the East Side of Manhattan presented more than two dozen possibilities at a public hearing yesterday, from completing the abandoned Second Avenue subway line to starting a ferry line along the East River.
While it will be more than a year before the study is completed and as long as 10 years before work would begin on the most ambitious of the plans, the officials presented the options to an audience of about 70 people yesterday as a kind of grand wish list, from which a few of the best ideas would be chosen during the next six months. 
 The $5.4 million Federal study was started in January to come up with a long-range plan for the East Side, whose subways, bus lines and roadways are among the city's most heavily used. City planners have warned that the crush of subway and bus riders, cars and trucks is far outpacing the area's capacity, and that the congestion will eventually hurt the economy and the environment.
"This is without a doubt one of the busiest transportation corridors in the country," said James W. Dubbs, an assistant director of government and community relations for the New York City Transit Authority.
On an average weekday, according to the authority's statistics, 72,000 Lexington Avenue subway riders, 22,000 bus passengers, 35,000 Metro-North passengers and 50,000 cars and trucks enter the East Side business district during the morning rush.
The study, which will be used by state officials to decide where to use Federal transportation money, has also been spurred on because of a need to determine the fate of the Second Avenue subway line.
Three sections of the line -- a total of about a mile of a planned 14-mile route -- were built in the early 1970's before work was halted because of the city's fiscal crisis. The state tried unsuccessfully to revive plans for the line in 1991, and the tunnels, in East Harlem and Chinatown, now sit dormant.
"I think this study really emanated from the question, 'Should we complete the Second Avenue subway line?' " said Peter Allibone of Vollmer Associates, a consulting company working on the study.
The plans being looked at now include completing the 1974 design for the Second Avenue subway by linking the tunnels and creating a line that would run from the southern tip of Manhattan to East 125th Street and would connect to another line running into the South Bronx.
But officials admitted that the enormous cost of creating a completely new subway line makes that solution unlikely. It cost about $65 million to dig the existing sections of tunnel 25 years ago. Because of crosstown lines that bisect the area, new tunnels would have to be dug beneath them, at a cost of hundreds of millions.
Norman Silverman, a planner for the transit authority, said that building the full Second Avenue line is on the "outer bounds" of possibility.
"But we've taken special care not to remove any of the options at this point," he said. "It's difficult to say exactly what will happen in July 1997 when this is finished."
Other plans being looked at range from simple, inexpensive measures -- such as adding trains to the Lexington Avenue line and coordinating signals to move them more swiftly -- to reviving an idea to create a "busway, " a plan first discussed when the Second Avenue subway line was shelved.
The plan calls for building a concrete barrier down part of First Avenue or Second Avenue to reserve lanes exclusively for buses. The buses would run more frequently than those on the line that now serves the area, the M15, which is among the most crowded in the country.
Officials also discussed ideas for creating new elevated lines and for building trolley cars or light rail lines that would run on the street. Another idea was a ferry line that would stop at existing piers and connect with shuttle bus service from docks to points west.
The study will move to its next stage in late November or early December, when officials will decide on what they believe to be the best plans. A final set of recommendations will be presented to the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council, which helps allocate Federal transportation money, in mid-1997.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Oil Prices Surge After a Report Of Declining U.S. Inventories

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Oil prices jumped yesterday after a report showed an unexpected sharp drop in domestic inventories of crude oil and a fall in supplies of heating oil.
On other commodity markets, coffee prices rose sharply. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities rose 1.38 points, to 235.28. 
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for September deliver rose 57 cents, to $17.50 a barrel. August heating oil rose 1.53 cents, to 48.04 cents a gallon, and August gasoline was up 0.52 cent, to 52.89 cents a gallon.
"It's the most significant price action we've seen for some time," said Michael Hiley, an analyst with Smith Barney.
The rally came after the American Petroleum Institute reported that crude oil stocks dropped 7.25 million barrels last week and now stood nearly 22 million barrels lower than in the corresponding period a year ago. The report was released after the market closed on Tuesday.
"This may be the catalyst to start what is not an untypical modest seasonal rally in the third quarter," said William Brown of W. H. Brown & Company.
Crude prices fell 16 percent from May 1 through last Friday, as the market overcame concerns about possible gasoline shortages and increases in oil production in the North Sea.
At the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, coffee traders began buying after a group of coffee exporters reached consensus on a plan to prop up prices.
At a meeting in New York, African and Asian coffee-growing nations joined with Latin American nations to withhold coffee from the market in an effort to reduce supplies and force consuming nations to deplete stocks.
September coffee rose 4.95 cents, to $1.523 a pound.
The Association of Coffee Producing Countries, representing nations that grow 80 percent of the world's coffee, said after emergency talks late Tuesday that it planned to limit exports to 60 million 132-pound bags over the next 12 months. Including production from countries that are not members of the association, world exports would reach 69 million bags; current demand is estimated at 71 million bags.
The move would cut exports by about 9 percent from previously expected levels.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: 'A Wall in the Mind';
Rising Resentment in the East Divides Germany

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: BERNAU, Germany

 BODY:
The concrete-block factory sits abandoned on the outskirts of this eastern German town. Inside, one of the most modern machines for making circuit boards for computers and televisions lies idle.
The company that owned the plant was sold by the Government to a subsidiary of Veba A.G., a utility giant in western Germany. Veba already controlled two companies in the west making similar products, and it closed the plant here, saying it was losing money. The circuit-board machine is now for sale to anyone who will take it out of Germany, so that it does not compete with Veba. 
 Many of the Bernau plant's managers, whose hopes had once soared with the arrival of western German business muscle and know-how, have long since become disillusioned. "Whenever a western German firm has to choose between jobs in western Germany or eastern Germany, it will always choose the west," said Edmund Luhrmann, a former senior manager of the eastern German company, Elektrolaminate.
Almost five years after German reunification, the situation here speaks to the frustrations of many eastern German entrepreneurs and managers who believed the claims of western German politicians that their industries would flourish within five years.
Some, like Mr. Luhrmann, accuse western German companies of buying up potential eastern German competitors in order to close them down. Veba denies that accusation. Others say that shrewd western German businessmen negotiated enormous tax breaks by buying in the east, then closed down shop and ran when those breaks were used up. Others complain that western German retailing chains refused to put eastern German products on their shelves not only in the west but also in the east, where they were once the dominant brands. And still others, who bought small businesses from the Government, say that western German banks have denied them loans, making it difficult for them to expand and compete.
"We feel intentionally betrayed by the west, with very little strength to respond," said Karl-Heinz Herms, a former manager of an eastern German steel fabricating plant in Eisenhuttenstadt and now a struggling entrepreneur. "They told us we were all brothers and sisters, that we would work together. And we believed them. Now, they control our industry. They decide what to keep open and what to shut down. They threaten to put us out of work. And what is our option? We have to be like them, or we don't survive."
Some in eastern Germany even call it the colonization of their economy by the powerful west.
Many in western Germany are aghast at such declarations, calling them the height of ingratitude. They say they have poured more than $660 billion into rebuilding eastern Germany, and will continue such payments for years. Eastern Germans are reaping enormous state subsidies for pensions, medical care and education. They can now afford to drive new Opels and Volkswagens instead of the symbol of the broken socialist economy, the Trabant. And the eastern German economy is the envy of the countries of the former East bloc, with growth this year expected to match last year's 9 percent.
And some of the complaining in the east can indeed be attributed to confronting a bitter reality. Over the last five years, one of the biggest industrial shakeouts of modern times has occurred, forcing a painful adjustment in a region that was protected from outside competition for decades. Vast eastern German chemical, steel and automotive plants were closed, causing the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.
The western Germans, responding to their accusers, say they are only following sound business practices in eastern Germany. For example, bankers say they have to be cautious about lending because so many eastern German companies fail.
Even so, some business and political leaders in western Germany acknowledge that there have been abuses. Kurt Kasch, the head of Deutsche Bank A.G.'s Berlin office, said easterners' lack of familiarity with western-style auditing, marketing and other business practices had left them open to exploitation. 'It's true and it's nasty," he said. "But it happened."
Among the complaints from those doing business in eastern Germany are that western German companies have bought and shut down potential competitors, sometimes taking big tax write-offs or draining the acquired company of its assets.
In Communist times, for example, Schiffswerft Oderberg G.m.b.H., now dormant, was a thriving ship-door maker with 400 employees. The company, in Oderberg, was among the few eastern German companies able to compete in the international shipbuilding business.
After reunification, it was sold to a Bremen shipping entrepreneur, Hans Biedemeier. But Mr. Biedemeier died early last year and state officials discovered he had drained Oderberg of $12 million in state financial aid and operating revenues and concealed the funds in his Bremen holdings, leaving the Oderberg operation without enough funds to pay its workers.
What is more, it will be very hard now to rescue such a failing business, said Susanne Muller, a lawyer in charge of the liquidation of the shipyard. "There is no bank that would lend to an eastern German manager enough money to do such a transaction," she said.
Another complaint is that western German companies are keeping eastern German products off their shelves. For example, an American entrepreneur, Ray Learsy, made a major investment two years ago to modernize Berlin Cosmetics, once the biggest cosmetics company in the East bloc. But he has barely been able to crack the German retail distribution system.
Mr. Learsy, who sold his New York commodities-trading business in the 1980's, took over Berlin Cosmetics after the German privatization agency had all but dismantled the work force, reducing it to 95 from 8,500, and replaced its machinery with new stainless-steel equipment.
But though his company's lipsticks, shampoos, facial creams and other products were once sought-after treasures throughout Eastern Europe, Mr. Learsy found he could no longer sell them in eastern Germany. Western German retailing chains had bought up all the outlets and declined to stock them with eastern German goods. With the cosmetics market saturated with western-made goods, they contended there was no need to add goods that they considered second-rate to their displays.
Mr. Learsy also found bank credit hard to come by. Lacking money to pay for advertising, he concentrated on selling in the former Soviet Union. He said it took him months to get an appointment to show his products to a middle-level manager of a western German retailer, only to be asked "why eastern Germans would want to buy an eastern German product while they had western Germany products now available."
After almost a year, he went public with his frustrations, giving interviews to the local press. Now he says he sees growing hope, and the company's Koivo products can be found in almost all of eastern Germany and are slowing appearing in the west.
"Basically eastern German products are restricted to eastern Germany," Mr. Learsy said. "The western German chains have the distribution power and they can lock you out of the market if they want. But eastern German customers are forcing them to act otherwise."
Klaus Kropelin, a senior official of the Chamber of Commerce in the eastern German town of Frankfurt an der Oder who advises small-business owners in his region on adapting to the free-market economy, said it was unfair for western Germans to look down on eastern Germans. "Don't think that the western system cannot be improved," Mr. Kropelin said.
Sometimes, the tales of misfortune in eastern Germany have had a happy ending. Mr. Luhrmann and some of his co-workers, for example, found a new investor for Bernau. Ziegelwerk Werbellinsee, a Bavarian brick company, is building a factory in the town, right next to the closed factory.
But such stories do little to soften the bitterness among many eastern Germans. In a society reeling from 40 percent unemployment, many of them yearn for the guaranteed housing and jobs they enjoyed under the Communists.
A recent poll by the magazine Der Spiegel disclosed the mixed emotions of the easterners. A majority of those surveyed thought social conditions were better under the Communists than today, and described the transition to capitalism as worse than they expected. But a majority also believed the free market offered them a better chance to improve their living standards.
An overwhelming 67 percent said they thought a psychological wall -- "a wall in the mind" -- was growing between east and west.
"The Ossi must always prove to the Wessi manager that he is not just an Ossi," said Mr. Luhrmann, the former senior manager at the Bernau factory, using the two vernacular terms for eastern and western Germans. "The Ossi always thinks that he has a stable smell."

HEADLINE: Municipal Bond Regulation Debated at House Hearing

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
In the aftermath of the financial debacle in Orange County, Calif., Congress began asking today whether greater financial disclosure was needed in the municipal bond market to prevent similar catastrophes.
At a hearing before a House Banking subcommittee, no consensus emerged, even though spokesmen for both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the nation's two top credit-rating agencies testified that they had investigated Orange County's investment practices late last year and -- based on public information at that time -- found nothing amiss. 
 Testifying before the committee, which is headed by Representative Richard H. Baker, a Louisiana Republican, top officials from California and Orange County said that while additional financial disclosure would have been helpful, it might not have prevented the $1.9 billion losses caused by a highly risky investment strategy that went awry, leading to the county's bankruptcy filing.
Municipal securities are not subject to the same financial disclosure requirements as corporate securities. Municipal issuers are not regulated by the S.E.C. and they do not have to file the same annual and quarterly financial reports as corporations. In the last year, the S.E.C. imposed new disclosure regulations on municipal bond dealers, but not on issuers. Today's hearings focused on whether this was sufficient to inform investors of municipalities' risky investment practices.
Representative Christopher Cox, a Republican whose district includes Orange County, said it was not. "Municipal securities have been exempt from disclosure rules that apply to virtually everyone else," Mr. Cox said. "We are now reaping the whirlwind from the unjustified distinction. Municipal disclosure rules are virtually free form."
William J. Popejoy, the departing Orange County chief executive, also said that municipal market disclosure was insufficient. "The municipal market is based on trust," he said. "It's almost like a gentleman's club. A corporation would not be allowed to issue casino bonds like Orange County did."
He was referring to $600 million in taxable notes that Orange County issued to bet on the direction of interest rates.
But Paul S. Maco, director of the S.E.C.'s Office of Municipal Securities, dismissed the need for further disclosure, saying that a combination of the antifraud provisions of existing Federal securities laws and new market disclosure initiatives from the S.E.C. were sufficient.
In some of the day's most arresting testimony, Mr. Maco outlined a meeting between S.E.C. officers and the former Orange County Treasurer, Robert L. Citron, and his staff in the months before Mr. Citron's investment fund collapsed.
"The S.E.C. had read articles about Citron's risky strategy," Mr. Maco said. On May 2, 1994, seven months before the Orange County's investment losses forced it to file for bankruptcy, S.E.C. officials in Los Angeles met with Mr. Citron and his staff. "The county represented to us that the pool was in fixed-rate instruments," he said. "They showed us a list saying that there were no risky securities in the investment pool. They said the pool was within state law and that their actions were exempt from S.E.C. regulations."
"Absent any indication of fraud, we cannot act, nor question the investment strategy of a local government," Mr. Maco added. Asked later whether the S.E.C. was "lied to," Mr. Maco declined comment, citing an S.E.C. investigation into the matter.
Mr. Maco added that the S.E.C. believed that "matters of investment strategy and what is permissible is the responsibility of the state and local governments. It is not something for which there is an appropriate Federal role."
Top executives of the nation's leading rating agencies -- both of which had given Orange County top investment grades -- explained their analysis of the county.
"We relied on the county's disclosures," said Daniel Heimowitz, head of municipal securities at Moody's Investors Service, which is owned by Dun & Bradstreet. "We're not auditors. Between the time public attention was drawn to the investment pool and the bankruptcy filing, we rated Orange County bonds eight times. Each one of those issues was secured by the county's general resources and not the investment pool."
Mr. Heimowitz said that based on Orange County's "wealth, low debt and good management," along with a large position of liquid reserves in the investment pool, "we felt that nothing was out of the ordinary."
Richard Larkin, head of the municipal finance section of the Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, a unit of McGraw-Hill, said, "We had lots of information from the county that the investment pool had $1 billion in liquid marketable securities and that the investors in the pool did not need their money immediately and could ride out any fluctuation in interest rates."
When pressed as to why his rating agency gave a high rating to the $600 million taxable note -- the so-called casino bond -- Mr. Larkin responded that his agency felt comfortable because it was not only the investment pool's earnings that backed the bond but also Orange County's general obligation to repay its debts. Mr. Larkin said that from May to September 1994, his agency had "several" meetings with Orange County officials to discuss their investment strategy and felt that investors in those bonds had sufficient credit protections.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Securities Prices Fall; Traders Focus On New Issues

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday as traders focused on the supply of new issues poised to come to market over the next month.
Later the losses deepened as investors pondered conflicting reports over comments made by a Fed official and moved to the sidelines ahead of the durable goods report due today. A rise in oil prices also kept the pressure on bond prices. 
 The market will get a glimpse of the labor market today when the weekly jobless claims report is released. Reports are also due on factory orders and durable goods, and tomorrow the preliminary second-quarter G.D.P. is due.
Analysts note that the market had closed higher on Monday and Tuesday, reversing much of last week's deterioration.
A Japanese newspaper, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, quoted a Fed governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, on Tuesday as having said the central bank had room to cut interest rates further. Yesterday the Fed called the report a fabrication.
The Treasury's long bond dropped 24/32 , to a price of 10913/32 yesterday for a yield of 6.88 percent, up from 6.82 percent on Tuesday, with the short-maturity bills mixed.
Market analysts said the day's lows were extended mostly on concern over the coming heavy supply of new issues. Corporate issuance is up because of the low rates.
Traders had not expected yesterday's five-year note auction to be much of a problem, and it turned out to be slightly better than expected. Retail interest, however, was disappointing, but some analysts said that has been typical of recent five-year auctions.
At auction the notes were awarded at a high yield of 6.219 percent, up from 5.905 percent last month and the highest since May 24, when the yield was 6.25 percent.
Thomas E. Donne, vice president and a senior portfolio manager at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said that the current market showed a lack of conviction, whereas three weeks ago it did not. "And to me that signals that it's probably wise to at least play this market from the cautious side of the table," he said.
"I think the basic economic information shows we are out of danger from falling into a recession," Mr. Donne said, "but that doesn't necessarily mean we will see explosive growth or even strong growth. But growth nonetheless."
He said the need for the Fed to ease had dimished considerably, and so the timing and magnitude of future Fed moves was increasingly doubtful and the market was reflecting that.
The market extended its losses in the afternoon following the note auction. Hamilton Davis, a vice president of government trading at Kemper Securities Inc. in Chicago, said: "What we think happened was that dealers tried to push the market price higher after the auction but were unable to induce follow-through buying on the part of retail. And with that being the case, it was time to reverse the field and probe for a price where retail did have an interest. I believe that interest was achieved at the 6.25 percent level."
Mr. Davis cited two other possible reasons for the market's slide. One was a rumor that many of Boeing's plane sales in June would make it into the durable goods data, so that the consensus of five-tenths of 1 percent could jump as high as 3 percent if the orders were included. The second item is that a report released by the American Petroleum Institute yesterday showed low stocks of oil and gas. "A signal," Mr. Davis said, "that the heavy driving season is upon us; consumers are on the road, and since they are on the road they are likely spending money."
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new five-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Yield . . . 6.219%
Low Yield . . . 6.180%

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
MINNESOTA MINING & MFG. CO. (MMM,N)

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, also known as 3M, said yesterday that its earnings rose slightly in the second quarter, but the results were below analysts' forecasts; 3M's share price fell $3.50, to $56, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The company, based in Maplewood, Minn., reported a 2.9 percent rise in earnings to $353 million, or 84 cents a share, from $343 million, or 81 cents a share, for the comparable quarter a year earlier. Revenue climbed 9.8 percent, to $4.14 billion, from $3.77 billion last year. 
 The company's chairman and chief executive, L. D. DeSimone, said earnings showed strong growth internationally. The company does more than half its business abroad.
"However, economic softening slowed U.S. volume growth, which held back our overall profit gain," Mr. DeSimone said.
Internationally, sales for the quarter increased about 19 percent, while United States sales increased only 1 percent, according to the company, which makes a variety of products, including adhesives, abrasives, and telecommunications and electronics products.

HEADLINE: Pilots of All Ages Undergo Medical Testing

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Elderly Pilots, Too, Need More Stringent Testing" (letter, July 19): Aircraft pilots of all ages undergo rigorous, regular medical testing during their flying careers to keep their licenses valid. The least frequent is every three years, with airline pilots tested every six months. This has kept the most handicapped specimens out of the pilot's seat. 
 Indeed there has only been one reported fatality caused by a medical malfunction among pilots over 70 in the last 10 years.
The mandatory retirement of airline pilots at 65 has more to do with $200,000-a-year salaries and their economic impact on the airlines than the condition of the arteries of these healthy, mature and highly skilled pilots. The low accident rate among mature pilots suggests that many are "self-grounding." It also reflects well on the federally qualified aviation medical examiners who perform their duties with evident success.
Statistically, one or two undiscovered health faults among three-quarters of a million pilots is about as good as it will ever get. There is no threat to the public caused by "chronic medical conditions of elderly pilots."

HEADLINE: Trade Accord Without U.S. Set in Geneva

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 26

 BODY:
Japan and South Korea agreed today to join more than 80 other countries in a pact to liberalize world trade in financial services, clearing the way for the accord to be put into effect without the United States, which has refused to participate.
Even though the Clinton Administration will not be signing on to the accord, which will cover the entry into countries of foreign banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions, American companies will still be able to benefit from the extra access that the participants in the agreement will offer one another. The rules of the World Trade Organization, the new body that oversees international commerce, require that trade concessions extended to one member country be extended to all other countries. 
 The support of Japan and South Korea was considered essential for the success of the agreement, which will carry the global liberalization of trade into the realm of services for the first time.
The accord was welcomed by Renato Ruggiero, the head of the World Trade Organization, which was created at the start of this year to replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But he said he regretted the Clinton Administration's refusal to join.
"This must be a second-best result with one member absent, but it is a very good second best," Mr. Ruggiero said. "It is a step toward a more integrated world and a better world. We hope the U.S. will come aboard soon."
Under pressure from American banks and financial institutions, the Clinton Administration has refused to join the pact, complaining that it does not require the rapidly growing economies of Asia and Latin America to open their markets fast enough.
The Administration will allow the foreign financial service companies already in the United States to remain there, and it has told the 15 countries in the European Union that their companies may enter the American market freely because those countries give American companies the same access. But the United States has said it reserves the right to restrict the entry of companies from elsewhere in the world unless their home governments offer American financial firms equal treatment.
The Clinton Administration's decision last month to remain out of the global accord is in contrast to the support the United States has traditionally given to a nondiscriminatory international trading system, free from the kind of deals it now wants to negotiate directly with recalcitrant countries.
Moreover, the United States led the campaign to include service industries in the agreement to liberalize trade in goods that was reached last year under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs on Trade.
After meeting with senior European trade officials in Washington on Monday, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin reiterated the objections of the Administration and confirmed that it would not join the pact. But apparently stung by criticism from Europe and elsewhere that the United States was abandoning its commitment to a global trading system, Mr. Rubin pledged "continued participation in the multilateral process in Geneva."
Under today's agreement, which runs until the end of 1997, many developing countries will offer foreign providers of financial services substantially better access to their markets than they have offered in the past.
Argentina, for instance, is lifting its ban on new banks. Brazil will allow more foreign insurance companies into the country and India will license eight new foreign banks a year. The Philippines is to end a 50-year-old prohibition against new banks and insurance companies and Malaysia will raise the ceiling on foreign ownership of insurance companies to 49 percent from 30 percent.
Even so, these steps fall well short of the virtually unrestricted access that the European Union countries are offering foreign financial service companies. European financial companies have said, however, that even an unbalanced agreement offers some additional access and prevents developing countries from further closing their markets.
The trade agreement negotiated last year requires participants to negotiate a further round of liberalization in financial services in 1999.
After the Clinton Administration said at the end of last month that it would not join the accord on financial services, the negotiations seemed likely to collapse as countries scaled back the access offers they had prepared on the assumption that they would gain automatic entry into the American market. But the European Union started an energetic campaign to keep the talks alive, pressing other countries to maintain their access offers and to enter into the pact.
The accord is scheduled to be endorsed formally on Friday, giving members of the World Trade Organization up to then to consider any last-minute changes. The deal does not include the huge markets of China and Russia, which are still negotiating membership in the trade organization.

HEADLINE: Blame the U.S. Consumer for Latin Sweatshops

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Bob Herbert, in his heart-wrenching columns (July 21 and 24) on the hapless Central American maquiladoras who produce our cheap clothes, shoots at the wrong target. The culprit is not the ruthless capitalist who pays low wages, but the ruthless American consumer who would quickly punish more benign, high-cost producers. 
 Imagine the following scenario: The Gap posts a sign in its store windows announcing that Gap's prices are higher than the competition's because the Gap pays the maquiladoras a humane $2 an hour, rather than the 56 cents paid by more ruthless competitors in Central America or elsewhere.
Do we imagine millions of compassionate Americans flocking to the Gap to support with higher prices some unknown workers in a faraway land? Come on! In their quest for a good deal, American consumers have not even hesitated to devastate their very own neighbors in their own downtowns, as they have flocked to the lower-priced Wal-Marts in the outskirts.
Social envy may make us pick on the income earned by the Gap's owner, but that is just a classic cheap shot. Even if we took all of that income and distributed it to the maquiladoras working for him, the sum would not be large enough to help each of them very much.

HEADLINE: Barings and Mexico Spur New Rules for U.S. Banks

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
Alarmed by the collapses last winter of Barings P.L.C. and the Mexican economy, Federal bank regulators are preparing new procedures to review the risks posed to big American banks by their futures and options brokerage units and by financial markets in newly industrializing countries, a senior regulator said today.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates 3,300 federally chartered banks, is drafting two separate sets of guidance and procedures for Federal bank examiners to use in ruling on the safety and soundness of bank practices, Douglas E. Harris, the senior deputy comptroller for capital markets, said in an interview this afternoon. 
 One set of rules will cover bank operating subsidiaries that are members of options and futures exchanges, like the Chicago Board of Trade, either in the United States or abroad. Barings, based in London, failed this spring because a trader at its operating subsidiary in Singapore lost about $1 billion placing bad bets on the direction of Japanese stock and bond prices.
The other set of rules will apply to American bank operations in emerging markets like Mexico, and will cover everything from the trading and underwriting of stocks and bonds to the issuing of corporate loans. The comptroller's office has been quietly working on such rules for two years, and stepped up the effort after the collapse of the Mexican peso and financial markets last December, although American banks do not appear to have suffered losses in that instance, Mr. Harris said.
The main banking companies involved in futures brokerage and in emerging markets are among the biggest in the United States, notably Citicorp, BankAmerica and First Chicago.
Mr. Harris emphasized that the new procedures, which he plans to announce in a speech in New York on Thursday, were not being drafted in response to any findings by examiners of previously unsuspected losses at big banks.
The details of the new guidelines will not be completed for a few weeks, he said.
The comptroller's bank examiners currently look at futures and options brokerage and emerging markets activities as they encounter them, but have no comprehensive rules for dealing with them. The Federal Reserve, which regulates bank-holding companies and state-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System, has rules on futures and options brokerage that are not under review after the Barings incident, a Fed official said. The Fed does not treat emerging markets as a separate issue.
Mr. Harris said that banks' activities in emerging markets needed a specific review because "we have greater concerns about volatility and liquidity risks in emerging markets debt and equity issues than in nonemerging markets."
In the case of the new rules for futures and options brokerage subsidiaries, he said, "It's something we hadn't added before and in light of Barings, it's obvious that if a regulator is concerned about a bank, he should be concerned about its operating subsidiaries."
When Barings failed, Eugene A. Ludwig, the Comptroller of the Currency, immediately asked his subordinates whether his agency had any specific procedures to catch similar problems at American institutions. When he found that there was no formal set of rules for examiners to follow in such reviews, he demanded that such procedures be drafted as fast as possible, Mr. Harris said.
The bank examination procedures for futures and options brokerage units will emphasize risk-management and risk-control issues, while leaving such issues as customer protection and the pricing of futures and options to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Mr. Harris said. The new rules for emerging markets will focus on the allocation of capital, risk limits and the amount of oversight by senior managers.
Neither set of procedures will be aimed at prescribing or banning a specific list of activities. That is in keeping with an international consensus among regulators that new trading practices and financial products are being developed at such a brisk pace that the best approach to insuring the safety and soundness of banks is to require that they have adequate management processes to recognize new risks as they come up.

Dollar Ends Day Little Changed When Rate-Cut Report Is Denied

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed yesterday in trading that turned listless after initially being buffeted by speculation on the course of American interest rates.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar slipped to 1.3877 German marks from 1.3942 marks on Tuesday. The dollar edged up to 87.91 Japanese yen from 87.79 yen. The British pound rose to $1.5932 from $1.5905. 
 Foreign-exchange markets were roiled after Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a Japanese business newspaper, reported that Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Federal Reserve governor, said in an interview that there could be an additional one-half-point reduction in short-term interest rates. Mr. Lindsey subsequently denied the report as "absolutely ridiculous" and said that he did not discuss Fed policy with the news media.
On July 6, the Fed reduced the rate on overnight loans between banks by a quarter-point, and traders had been looking for signs of further cuts. Lower interest rates in the United States would make dollar-denominated assets less attractive to investors, reducing demand for dollars.
The Japanese report sent the dollar down against the mark and the yen during the morning session of New York trading, said Liz Goldberg, an assistant vice president of Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank A.G.
The dollar received some limited support from more reports of moderate inflation in Germany. Consumer prices in western Germany fell one-tenth of 1 percent in the month that ended in mid-July, according to preliminary data, the first monthly drop since March 1991. The western German state of Bavaria also reported declining inflation.
If a resurgence in inflation is not a threat, there would be room for German central bankers to cut interest rates, something that would make mark-denominated investments less attractive. But traders are already expecting such a cut and have factored such action into their transactions, said Jack Griffin, a foreign exchange vice president at the New York branch of Fuji Bank Ltd.
Among the unknowns facing the market is the strength of the United States economy. Traders are focusing on a report due at the end of the week on the United States gross domestic product, with expectations of a slight increase. Too vigorous growth would reduce chances for further interest rate relief from the Fed.
"Ever since people walked in on Monday they have been talking about G.D.P. on Friday," Ms. Goldberg said.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Theme Parks Help Disney's Earnings Rise

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: BURBANK, Calif., July 26

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company said today that earnings rose 19 percent in the third quarter, aided by increased attendance at its theme parks and a smaller loss on its investment in Euro Disney.
The results were also helped by growth in the company's consumer products operations and by a smaller-than-expected decline in operating income in the filmed entertainment division. 
 Net income rose to $318.2 million, or 60 cents a share, from $267.5 million, or 49 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year ago. Revenue increased 17 percent, to $2.76 billion from $2.35 billion.
The per-share profit of 60 cents exceeded Wall Street expectations of 56 cents, which was the average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. Disney's stock closed at $56.875 today, up $1.125, in Big Board trading.
"We're hitting on all cylinders," Disney's chief financial officer, Stephen Bollenbach, said in an interview. "The quarter is a good demonstration of the balance in our businesses."
Operating income from theme parks rose 27 percent, to $302.5 million from $238.3 million, while revenue increased 20 percent, to $1.13 billion from $942 million. The quarter's results included a $14.4 million loss from the company's 39.9 percent stake in Euro Disney, which operates a large theme park outside Paris. That was narrower than a $52.8 million loss a year ago.
Operating income from filmed entertainment fell 8 percent, but that was not as bad as expected, said Jill Krutick, an analyst at Smith Barney. "The company got a lift in international video from the release of 'The Return of Jafar' and 'Pinocchio,' " she said.
Attendance rose at the company's Florida and California theme parks during the quarter. Mr. Bollenbach said the parks had been "severely impacted" over the last few years by a slowing in the international economy. "Now we're seeing record-high attendance at the parks," he said. "They are one of the major elements of our growth."
On Tuesday, Euro Disney reported a profit of $35 million for its latest fiscal quarter -- its first profit since the theme park opened in April 1992.
The film division's operating income fell 8 percent, to $153.3 million from $167.4 million, on a 15 percent increase in revenue, to $1.16 billion from $1 billion.
Operating income from consumer products rose 23 percent, to $106.5 million from $86.9 million, while revenue increased 25 percent, to $475.1 million from $407.7 million. The growth reflected expansion and sales increases in the Disney stores and the strength of sales of licensed character merchandise.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Energy standards aren't as oppressive as they may seem.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
DOES Washington know your needs better than you? Most people, it is safe to assume, would like a little help from Uncle when it comes to choosing, say, pesticides or antibiotics.
But some Americans undoubtedly resent being told which water heaters to buy or how much insulation they should stuff in their walls. And with that in mind, the House of Representatives voted last week to stop the Clinton Administration from spending any money to set energy-efficiency standards for household appliances or to design model building codes. 
 Robert Hahn, an economist who specializes in regulation at the American Enterprise Institute, is pleased. There is no energy crisis and thus, he suggests, no compelling national interest in regulating the use of electricity or forcing the pace of technological change. "When in doubt," he says, "less is better."
But defenders of energy-efficiency regulations are not just the sort of folks who spend their spare time recycling aluminum foil. "Killing the standards would be a triumph of blind ideology over economic common sense," said Daniel Lashof, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. And whether or not one agrees, there is surely a plausible economic rationale for interfering with the market in energy-related products.
While it is widely assumed that the appliance standards and model building code programs were the handiwork of liberals who never met a payroll, the enabling legislation was, in fact, signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1987 and reinforced by President George Bush's Energy Policy Act of 1992. In part, Republican support reflected the business reality that there was money to be made in selling insulation and designing energy-efficient machines. In part, it reflected appliance makers' fears that the national market would be balkanized, as states -- notably California -- set their own standards.
The program has not generated much public controversy. The Department of Energy has been cautious in limiting standards to those that can be justified on purely economic grounds. Regulators have, in effect, asked what rational consumers would want: Efficiency is mandated only where the likely savings in utility bills substantially exceed the up-front cost.
And why wouldn't consumers make the same decisions on their own, driving the market to produce the desired level of energy efficiency and obviating the need for rules?
One reason, Mr. Lashof suggests, is that consumers have limited time and often leave the decision to a contractor whose primary incentives are to keep prices low and profit margins high. Much the same can happen in appliance stores. "Salesmen usually have only a few minutes to show off the features of their products," said Mike Thompson, director of governmental relations for the Whirlpool Company, "and energy saving isn't high on the list."
In study after study, Mr. Lashof adds, consumers have been shown to make myopic choices, passing by energy-efficient appliances even when the payback period is just one to three years. Hazel R. O'Leary, the Secretary of Energy, estimates that appliance rules already in place will save consumers $1.7 billion annually by 2000.
If the department has behaved cautiously, why the Congressional challenge? For one thing, regulators did raise hackles in proposing rules for fluorescent light fixtures that would force a rapid switch to new technology and would not be cost-effective for lights that were used only a few hours a month.
The department relented after two lighting manufacturers, Magnetek and Philips, protested. And it is now considering the creation of a separate category for lighting that is likely to be used infrequently. But the case illustrates a tension inherent in tinkering with the market: Some producers will have a strong advantage where the pace of technological change is forced by government.
That, in large part explains why Whirlpool is eager to see the current round of rule-making through to completion and why many of its rivals are not. Whirlpool, for example, would probably increase market share in clothes washers if proposed rules go into effect because it has already invested in technology for reducing the amount of hot water needed to get clothes clean.
Those opposed to energy rules will not have as easy a time in the Senate. Some manufacturers, including Whirlpool, will register their distress. Others will no doubt remember that they supported appliance standards in the first place in order to pre-empt state initiatives. If they do not, environmental groups are eager to remind them -- two have already petitioned the California Energy Commission to carry on making rules if the standards are abandoned by the Department of Energy.
Lost in the debate, one suspects, will be any systematic consideration of when interference with free markets is economically justified. That is a pity, but no surprise.

HEADLINE: Michael Andrews, British Painter, Is Dead at 66

BYLINE: By JOHN RUSSELL 

 BODY:
Michael Andrews, a painter who for more than 30 years was an elusive but legendary presence in the London art world, died on July 19 in London. He was 66.
The cause was cancer, London newspapers reported over the weekend. 
 While a student at the Slade School of Art in the early 1950's, he painted a large picture with overtones of a psychiatric case history called "A Man Who Suddenly Fell Over."
Even when young, he was a famously slow worker, known for very large canvases that took him forever. But homes were found for many of his best paintings at the Tate Gallery, at the National Galleries in Melbourne and Canberra, Australia, and with a steadfast handful of private patrons.
Mr. Andrews functioned as a purposeful absentee. No sooner was he acknowledged as an incomparable chronicler and deconstructer of the rackety London scene of the 1960's than he began a series of large paintings based on the adventures of a gas-filled balloon.
First seen as a milk-white presence high above an English pastoral scene, the balloon then hovered above Westminster by night. It monitored more than one largely obsolete pleasure resort on the southern coast and finally defined itself as a moving shadow heading for a landfall somewhere between sand and sea.
From 1975 onward, Scotland seized Mr. Andrews's imagination, in part for its stern and often tumultuous history, in part for the austere and geometrical ritual of deer stalking in castle country. No living painter was better at taking a well-beaten subject and giving it a whole new spin.
In 1983, acting on a 25-year fascination with Ayers Rock, he visited Australia. Not until 1989 did he complete the series of big paintings that resulted. Though many now consider Ayers Rock a hackneyed tourist attraction, Mr. Andrews made it new.
In his later years he appeared in a long series of exhibitions -- notably his retrospective at the Hayward Gallery in London in 1980-81 -- that confirmed not only his own status but the high esteem in which he was held by his peers. "I can't better that," said Lucian Freud when reminded of the saying that "Andrews is such an economical painter, he only paints masterpieces."
His first and only show in New York was at the Grey Art Gallery of New York University in 1991.
Mr. Andrews was born on Oct. 30, 1928, in Norwich, England, where his father was an insurance agent. He was called up for military service from 1947 to 1949, and spent 19 months in Egypt. From 1949 to 1953 he studied at the Slade School of Art in London. His first one-man show in London was at the Beaux-Arts Gallery in 1958.
Though mistrustful of honorifics, Mr. Andrews served briefly as a trustee of the National Gallery in London and was elected to the Royal Academy. He was also made a Fellow of University College, London.
He is survived by his wife, the former June Keeley, and a daughter, Melanie.

HEADLINE: Nutting, Nuts Hero

BYLINE: By MITCHELL OWENS 

 BODY:
SCORNED after his death in 1941 as a sentimental crackpot with an unhealthy yen for Pilgrim days, the Rev. Dr. Wallace Nutting, a Congregational minister turned photographer, author, antiques expert and furniture manufacturer, is enjoying an unexpected revival.
"Antiques dealers used to pooh-pooh and say, 'Oh, we couldn't possibly carry junk like that,' " said George Monro of North Caldwell, N.J., who, along with his late wife, Justine, founded the Wallace Nutting Collectors Club in 1973. "Now, every shop wants him." Initially, the club had three members; today it has nearly 350. 
 Maybe it is the conservative climate, or maybe it is just long enough after Dr. Nutting's heyday for his work to prove interesting once again. From 1912 to 1941, Dr. Nutting was America's premier preservationist and historian, known as the Father of American Antiques. In that, he was supported by an infrastructure of colorists, rug weavers, etchers and silhouette designers. Between 1917 or 1918 and the early 1940's, cabinetmakers at his factory in Saugus, Mass., turned out exact reproductions of Early American furniture.
His forte was hand-colored, softly focused platinum-print photographs of subjects guaranteed to put a smile on buyers' faces -- rose-clad cottages, birch-shaded streams, apple orchards in bloom. They were sold by the hundreds of thousands in the early 1900's for around $2.
A team of young women hand-colored, framed and mounted his photographs, which were sold singly or on holiday cards and calendars in galleries and 10-cent stores across the country. He also produced nearly 20 beautifully illustrated but clumsily written books on American architectural history and decorative arts, each a hardcover sermon pleading for the preservation of classic Americana. A three-volume set, "Furniture Treasury," a study of early Colonial furniture, remains a standard reference work among antiques dealers.
But after his death at age 79, many of the photographs were thrown away, derided as pseudo-Impressionist pablum in sophisticated urban circles where the work of Steichen and other art photographers held sway.
NOW, nearly a century after Dr. Nutting began taking his pictures, they are being collected again, and given the rate of inflation, the prices are still good, generally between $25 and $75. Equally desirable though harder to find is the handmade, hand-carved furniture -- from cradles to radiator covers to highboys -- that Dr. Nutting began manufacturing in 1917, most of the pieces copied or adapted from 17th- and 18th-century American originals in museums or his personal collection. Prices now range from $195 for a simple maple stool to more than $15,000 for a set of eight Windsor chairs.
If Linda Palmer has her way, Dr. Nutting's reputation will spread far beyond the community of collectors. Last year, Mrs. Palmer, a 48-year-old nursing student and Nutting collector in Kent, Conn., began a letter-writing campaign to the Postal Service for a Wallace Nutting commemorative stamp. So far, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, has joined the effort.
"What did Marilyn Monroe or Elvis do to deserve a stamp?" Mrs. Palmer said. "Nutting was the man who made Americans proud of America."
Among the collectors is William Hamann, 51, a Cleveland banker. He and his wife, Gretchen, bought their first Nutting photograph 15 years ago, "and the next thing I knew we had hundreds," Mr. Hamann said. And with his wife's bemused blessing, he has been decorating their house in the suburb of Shaker Heights with what Nutting nuts consider to be one of the finest collections of Nutting furniture, including nearly a dozen Windsor chairs.
Modern reproductions of Dr. Nutting's "original" reproductions can be had from Berea (Ky.) College, which inherited the unsold stock and blueprints after his furniture company closed in 1944. Prices range from $300 for a Sheraton-style stool to $10,600 for a walnut corner cupboard with pediment. Catalogues are available by calling Berea at (800) 347-3892.
Whether they consist of old or new pieces, Nutting collections have a way of expanding. "It's like potato chips," Michael Ivankovich. "You can't have just one of anything by Nutting. A Doylestown, Pa., auctioneer who has become an expert on Dr. Nutting, Mr. Ivankovich runs three all-Nutting sales each year. (The next will be at the Ramada Inn in Danbury, Conn., on Nov. 3-4.)
More than 200 people turned out for the last auction, in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in June, where they bid on 305 lots that ranged from a 1923 copy of Dr. Nutting's book "Connecticut Beautiful" (it brought $20) to a reproduction Philadelphia Chippendale mahogany chair ($650) to "Pilgrimage Prints," a rare intact collection of 25 signed photographs that Nutting took while he and 800 fellow ministers and their wives toured Palestine in 1904 ($5,800).
Among the bidders were Elizabeth Elliot and her husband, Lloyd, a dapper man in a slouchy white linen suit who designs leather goods for Guess and Avanti. They found their first Nutting photograph at a flea market in the Catskills: "It's like giving birth," Mrs. Elliot said, tucking her dog, a papillon named Rambo, under her arm. "You can never forget."
Dr. Nutting owed his fame to physical frailty. A fear of heights, which prevented him from ascending to the pulpit, and a nervous breakdown in 1904 forced him into early retirement at age 43 in the bucolic village of Southbury, Conn. His wife, Mariet, doubtless exasperated by his daily presence in the house, encouraged him to take his bicycle and go off on long relaxing rides. He took along his camera. Forty thousand photographs later, he was an industry.
His patriotic exhortations and his expertise in American antiques were heeded by even the most experienced collectors. John D. Rockefeller commissioned him to make furniture for the Raleigh Tavern and House of Burgesses in Williamsburg, Va. The Daughters of the American Revolution invited him to design a room at their headquarters in Washington. When money problems beset Dr. Nutting in the 1920's, J. Pierpont Morgan came to the rescue, buying his enviable collection of early New England furniture and ironwork and donating it, in Dr. Nutting's name, to the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, where it remains on permanent exhibition.
"Nutting was a true evangelist, the man who got people to shout 'Hosanna!' when they saw a Windsor chair," said William N. Hosley, the Atheneum's curator of American decorative arts. "He installed this apparatus that evoked the American way. It was a romanticized, Anglocentric view of America, but his genius was that he created multiple reinforcing agendas -- the books supported the furniture supported the house restorations supported the photographs and back again.
"It was a relentlessly clever piece of marketing, whatever the audience, though I've always suspected that the people who appreciated him most were paranoid, bigoted city women with a chip on their shoulder. What's really important about Nutting is that his pictures inspired people to hit the road and see the beauty of America."
EVEN preservationists, who once loathed Dr. Nutting's enthusiastic "improvements" to Colonial properties, have begun to revise their opinions. At the 18th-century Webb-Deane-Stevens Museum in Weathersfield, Conn., which was restored in the 1930's as one of Wallace Nutting's Chain of Colonial Houses, the design equivalent of roadside circus, Beth Ann McPherson, the museum's curator, is overseeing the restoration of a Nutting mural.
Covered by wallpaper in the 1970's, it depicts George Washington and his British adversaries in garish Technicolor reds, blacks and greens.
"He moved walls, added cupboards and paneling, anything to make rooms look more Colonial than they were, which is heresy in most circles," she said. "But what Nutting did here is part of the evolution of the house and should be studied."
Still, even Dr. Nutting's staunchest supporters sometimes have trouble keeping a straight face when confronted with his knack for faux-Puritan melodrama.
At the Saratoga Springs auction, Nancy Novick rolled her eyes at the sight of one of Dr. Nutting's "personals," so-called for the use of models -- occasionally his wife, but most often pretty young neighborhood girls -- placed in a historic interior. This particular example depicted a gently colored image of a spinning wheel operated by a winsome young woman in Williamsburg garb: mobcap, heavy shoes, downcast but ecstatic eyes.
"Kitsch, isn't it?" whispered Ms. Novick, a Manhattan graphic designer who is working on a book about Dr. Nutting. Though she suspects he was a "tremendous prig and a lunatic, too," she said she was amazed by Dr. Nutting's professional artistry especially the landscape and garden photographs. She compared their colors and composition with those of the paintings of the American Impressionist Childe Hassam.
For Dorothy Manville, a collector who lives in Southbury, Conn., where Nutting opened a studio in 1905, Dr. Nutting's appeal is more basic. "He captured something we cannot replace," she said. She and her husband, whose mother posed as a child for Dr. Nutting's personals, own more than 800 Nutting photographs. "So much of that landscape is gone today, and that's what Wallace Nutting was trying to preserve through his pictures. The walls, the apple trees, the little white houses -- those are what people see in their minds when they think of America."

Environmental Aid for Trenton

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Trenton will be one of 15 cities across the country to receive Federal money for a pilot program to redevelop abandoned, contaminated properties into new enterprises that can create jobs and tax revenues, The Associated Press reported. 
 City officials said they would use the $200,000 grant, awarded yesterday by the Environmental Protection Agency, to develop plans to give minority residents a say in how the sites should be cleaned up and used. Trenton's unemployment rate is 11.8 percent.

Treasury Prices Up as Orders Slow

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday after a report showed weaker-than-expected factory orders, easing investor concern that strong economic growth would accelerate inflation.
The Commerce Department said orders for big-ticket items designed to last for more than three years fell a tenth of a percent in June; a gain of seven-tenths of a percent had been expected. 
 Analysts said the report suggested an anemic economy that could lead the Fed to reduce interest rates again. But they cautioned that the report did not show an across-the-board weakness; indeed, the report indicated pockets of strength.
The 30-year bond rose 16/32 , to a price of 10929/32 for a yield of 6.84 percent, down from 6.88 percent on Wednesday, with rates on short-maturity bills down an average of 6 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
Elliott Platt, director of research at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said the durables report was very much a confirmation of a soft landing in the economy. He said he expected a continuation of moderate growth, averaging 2.5 percent in the long run.
"What the June statistics reveal," Mr. Platt said, "is a major slowing in the capital goods ordering process of the second quarter, relative to the first quarter, and that is going to translate into a continuation of subdued economic activity in the manufacturing sector, probably only for the next few months, with only slightly positive increases in industrial production.
"The market will probably remain range bound in the near term because it must come to grips with the fact that the economy is not plunging into recession, and that the Fed is not going to ease at August Federal Open Market Committee meeting. I suspect after a few months the market can improve significantly."
The Labor Department in its weekly report on the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits, said yesterday that 40,000 fewer, or 374,000, had filed. In the prior week new claims were put at 17,000 from an initially reported 18,000 gain, but analysts said the data had little impact on the market.
Traders said gains in Treasury securities yesterday were limited as the supply of new issues continued to hamper the market. Next week the Treasury will announce the size of its quarterly refunding and many expect the size to remain unchanged from February's $40 billion package, including $17 billion in 3-year notes, $12 billion in 10-year notes, and $11 billion in 30-year bonds. Others are projecting a rise to as high as $42 billion.
In the municipal bond market, prices gained as investors sought securities with maturities of 10 years or less. The short end of the market has become more attractive amid concern that proposed tax law changes could make some bonds less attractive.
New York investors are expected to demand extra compensation in the form of higher rates on next week's $1 billion sale of New York City's general obligation bonds.
New York State, New York City and their agencies plan to sell $7.3 billion in securities in the third quarter, according to State Comptroller H. Carl McCall. That is up $1.73 billion from the amount of debt sold last year in the similar quarter.
According to Bloomberg Fair Value Analytics, general obligation bonds due in 30 years and rated double-A are yielding 5.97 percent, up from 5.81 percent last Friday.
In only its second debt sale in a little more than a year the Province of Ontario sold $1 billion of 10-year global bonds through Merrill Lynch International and Lehman Brothers International at a price to yield 7.005 percent, or 57 basis points more than a 10-year Treasury. The debt is rated Aa-3 by Moody's Investors Service and AA- by Standard & Poor's.
In the corporate market, TCI Communications Inc., a unit of Tele-Communications Inc., priced $1 billion of debt securities in two parts through Merrill Lynch. Some $350 million of 10-year notes were priced to yield 8.074 percent, or 165 basis points more than a comparable Treasury, while $750 million of 20-year debenutures were priced to yield 8.81 percent, or 195 basis points more than a 30-year Treasury.
Underwriters said both parts were rated Baa-2 by Moody's and BBB- by S.& P. and Duff & Phelps.

HEADLINE: David G. Hays, 66, a Developer Of Language Study by Computer

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
David G. Hays, a social scientist and early practitioner of the budding discipline of computational linguistics, died on Wednesday at White Plains Hospital. He was 66 and lived in the Inwood section of Manhattan.
The cause was lung cancer, his family said. 
 Computer-aided linguistics -- akin to artificial intelligence -- uses computational procedures called algorithms, mathematical models and computer systems in researching language. It is applied in translation, documentation and lexicography and in the study of stylistics and content analysis.
Early in his career, Dr. Hays taught at the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif., and wrote about computer-assisted language processing as early as 1957. He was project leader on computational linguistics at Rand from 1955 to 1968.
From then until 1980, he was professor of linguistics, computer science, and information and library studies at the State University at Buffalo. He then worked as an independent researcher, writer and consultant in New York City and taught on-line courses at the New School for Social Research.
As a scholarly discipline, computational linguistics has been much refined since the models of the late 1950's. Part of its folklore is an early program that supposedly rendered the English sentence, "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak," into Russian as "The vodka is strong, but the meat is rotten."
More recent programs of the kind Dr. Hays worked with are far more discriminating. They feature immense dictionaries and are able to analyze the grammatical structure of sentences and to summarize dense legal documents.
David Glenn Hays was born in Memphis and graduated from Harvard College in 1951. He also received his master's and Ph.D. degrees in sociology from Harvard.
He wrote many scholarly articles and six books, including "Introduction to Computational Linguistics" (Elsevier, 1967) and "Cognitive Structures" (H.R.A.F. Press, 1981).
At his death, he was studying how motion elicits emotion, focusing on the ballets of George Balanchine.
Dr. Hays is survived by his wife, Janet Ginsberg Adelson Hays; a daughter, Dorothy A. Hays of Palo Alto, Calif.; two sons, Warren S. T., of Tokyo, and Thomas G., of San Francisco; a granddaughter; three stepsons, James Adelson of Harvard, Mass., Joshua Adelson of Sharon, Mass., and Andrew Adelson of Newton, Mass.; two stepdaughters, Lisa Eisenberg of Harvard, Mass., and Nancy Allison of Sharon, Mass., and 10 step-grandchildren.

Ghosts in Nicaragua? No, Somozas in the Flesh

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua

 BODY:
Their name may still be regarded here as a synonym for corruption and brutality. But ever so cautiously, the Somoza family is beginning to return to Nicaragua, hoping to find a place now that memories of its five decades of dictatorship are beginning to fade.
Three brothers, grandsons of the founder of the dynasty that ruled this country as a classic banana-republic dictatorship from 1933 to 1979, are leading that effort and say ordinary Nicaraguans are proving surprisingly receptive. Eduardo Sevilla Somoza, a 42-year-old Washington-based businessman, visited recently for the first time since the Sandinista National Liberation Front overthrew his uncle, Anastasio Somoza Debayle. 
 Eduardo's elder brother, Luis Sevilla Somoza, is a 48-year-old Miami resident who visits here regularly.
"We want to put right the family name and talk about the positive as well as the negative," Luis said.
A third brother, Alejandro, a 39-year-old marketing consultant, added that "there's a negative aura that the Somozas had, and we think it's unjustified."
Just a few years ago, when the Sandinistas were still in power, that argument would have been considered counterrevolutionary. But with the Sandinistas themselves now on the defensive and the Government of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro floundering, some Nicaraguans seem nostalgic for the old order.
Hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguans have personal mementos of the political violence that racked the country under the Somozas. Mrs. Chamorro still keeps the tan Saab that her husband, the opposition editor Pedro Joaquin Chamorro Cardenal, was driving when he was assassinated in 1978, setting off the final uprising that brought the Sandinistas to power.
But half of Nicaragua's population of 4.5 million is 16 years of age or younger, meaning that their first memories are of the Sandinistas' revolution and their struggle with American-backed contras.
"In school, they taught us that the Somozas were greedy and killed a lot of innocent people," said Carmen Buitrago, a high school student here, said. "But it was the Sandinistas who sent my cousins to fight at the front and now we are living in a state of crisis, so how much worse could the Somozas have really been?"
As part of their effort to rehabilitate the family's reputation, the Sevilla Somoza brothers have set up the Nicaraguan-American Humanitarian Assistance Foundation to aid health programs here. Projects they are supporting include a leper colony, a children's hospital and a clinic for disabled veterans of the decade-long civil war that followed the collapse of the Somoza dictatorship.
Visiting Children's Hospital this month, Luis and Eduardo Sevilla Somoza encountered fading posters that proclaimed "Somoza will never return." But the hospital's directors appeared interested, nonetheless, in the brothers' offer to bring a group of American pediatric surgeons here and send their local counterparts to Miami for specialized training.
While helping the less fortunate, the Sevilla Somozas have also been pursuing claims to scores of Somoza family properties the Sandinistas expropriated the day after they entered Managua in July 1979. These include houses, hotels and ranches as well as cement, beer, fishing, logging and mining companies, whose total value they estimate as more than $250 million.
"We know we are last in line and we understand why," said Alejandro Sevilla Somoza. "They've used us as the scapegoat for all the evil there could ever be in Nicaragua."
Luis, Alejandro and Eduardo Sevilla Somoza are three of the nine children of Lilian Somoza, the daughter of the founder of the dynasty, Anastasio Somoza Garcia. She is also the older sister of Anastasio Somoza Debayle, who was assassinated in Paraguay a year after being overthrown in 1979.
As Alejandro sees it, the Somoza family's was "a benevolent dictatorship" that achieved much and deserves credit for its accomplishments. "The last few years may have gone a little crazy, but there was progress here," he argued.
That opinion is now expressed with considerable frequency here, especially among those who opposed the Sandinistas and see their 11 years in power as the main source of Nicaragua's current political andeconomic ills. These include high unemployment, inflation, a weak currency and a huge foreign debt.
"Somoza was 10 times better than those thieves," said Jose Sanchez, a 48-year-old printer. "Yes, he stole. But our foreign debt was $1 billion after nearly 50 years of the Somozas, and a decade later it was $12 billion and we had nothing to show for it. So I ask you: who was the bigger thief?"
The emergence of such sentiment also helps explain another change in the political climate: the sudden resurgence of the Liberal Party, which for many years was a pliant vehicle of the Somoza dictatorship. All polls agree that the front-runner in next year's presidential election here is the Liberal nominee, Arnoldo Aleman, Mayor of Managua.
Liberal leaders are basking in that popularity but appear uncertain how to deal with the party's historical connections to the Somozas. At the party's convention July 11, speakers read off a long list of Liberal luminaries, but pointedly made no mention of any member of the Somoza family.
But the Sevilla Somoza brothers did attend the party gathering, greeted many former family friends and allies there and met with Mr. Aleman. "We're Liberals as a family tradition," said Eduardo Sevilla Somoza. "We have that in our blood and will help in whatever way we can."

HEADLINE: Port Agency Trims Budget And Its Scope

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Under pressure from the governors who oversee it, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has begun a round of budget cuts that appear to be a prelude to more drastic steps, indicating that the agency may soon be forced to scale back its historical role as a power in the region's economic development.
 The authority's new executive director, George J. Marlin, has moved forward in recent weeks on his mandate to trim its work force and costs by ordering a hiring freeze and reductions in travel and other expenses. Yesterday, the authority's board began examining the first results of a study on how the agency can reduce its spending by eliminating some jobs. 
 The actions demonstrate that Gov. George E. Pataki and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman are intent on subjecting the authority, which has often been criticized as bloated and inefficient, to the same regimen of budget and staff cuts that they have imposed on their own state governments.
"The organization is going to be smaller," said Charles A. Gargano, the vice chairman of the authority and Mr. Pataki's top economic adviser. "That is certain. The prudent thing to do is to look at the organization and try to save as much as we can in restructuring, as we have done in New York State government."
Mr. Gargano said that there had been no decisions on how the authority's $2.7 billion budget or 9,000-person work force would be trimmed. But some senior officials in the Pataki and Whitman administrations said they thought the work force could end up being reduced by 5 or 10 percent through attrition, buyouts and, if necessary, layoffs.
"It's very hard to argue that they are understaffed," said a high-ranking official in the Whitman administration, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The Pataki and Whitman officials said they envisioned a Port Authority that concentrates largely on transportation, possibly by shedding some of the other responsibilities that it has picked up over the years, like economic forecasting, policy analysis or its network of foreign trade offices.
In what may have been a preview of this new era of retrenchment, Mr. Marlin said recently that the authority would have to abandon its proposal to build a 22-mile railway between Manhattan and Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports in Queens because of rising costs.
What repercussions the new cuts will have on the authority's services is not known. Officials like Mr. Gargano said they believed that the budget could be trimmed without causing hardships to the hundreds of thousands of people in the region who use the authority each day.
But it is also clear that the agency may soon not have the resources to do some of the things that it has long been known for, like its surveys of the economic impact of tourism and the arts on the region, or the assistance it provides to small businesses that want to start exporting products.
The authority, which was chartered in 1921 by Congress, is the largest port authority in the country. It operates or owns the three major airports in the region, the George Washington and other bridges, the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, the PATH commuter line, the World Trade Center, most of the major marine terminals on New York Harbor and industrial parks.
Over the years, the Port Authority has taken on more and more commitments, acting as a financier, planner, analyst and, most important, sponsor of such projects as Kennedy and Newark International Airports. Its work force grew to nearly 10,000 people by the late 1980's before it pulled back because of the recession.
Though it has long been respected as the region's master builder, the authority has also been attacked as being wasteful and extravagant. Several times over the last few decades, it has been involved in scandals over the perks of its executives, who were found to have regularly traveled first class on airplanes and used helicopters for jaunts around New York City.
One issue that is driving the campaign to cut costs is the possible need for an increase on the tolls for the authority's bridges and tunnels, as well as a rise in the PATH fare. Stanley Brezenoff, Mr. Marlin's predecessor, said late last year that the agency would face a budget gap if tolls did not rise.
The one-way tolls, which are $4 into the city, have not changed since 1991. But aides to both Mr. Pataki and Mrs. Whitman said the two were unlikely to agree to any increase because they considered it akin to a rise in taxes. As a result, the gap in the authority's budget would have to be closed by cutting spending.
"If you don't do a toll increase, you have to do some fairly dramatic things," said a former senior official at the authority who has kept in contact with officials there and who insisted on anonymity. "So they are in the process of looking at a very dramatic downsizing."
The tolls and the future of the Port Authority are to be discussed next month at a meeting between Mr. Pataki and Mrs. Whitman, officials said. The two will also review the study that is being conducted on reorganizing the agency.
People who have seen the first results of the study, which is being done by the consulting firm of Deloitte & Touche and will not be completed for several weeks, said it identified areas where the authority could cut its staff. It noted, for example, that the agency often had managers and auditors at both its headquarters and its divisions doing the same work.
The authority also recently commissioned a study on whether it should sell all or part of the World Trade Center.
And the authority, which in the 1980's expanded into areas like industrial parks and office buildings, has in recent months stepped up its efforts to divest itself of such assets, thereby allowing it to focus more on transportation. It has sold some of its properties at its industrial parks in Yonkers and Elizabeth, N.J., and it has put the New York Vista Hotel at the World Trade Center on the market.
Mr. Marlin declined to comment about the cost-cutting at the authority. But people who work him say he is approaching the changes with more of a political perspective than Mr. Brezenoff. Mr. Marlin, who has long called for government to reduce its obligations, ran for New York City mayor in 1993 on the Conservative Party line.
"There are some people who feel that he has too political an orientation," said a senior official at the agency. "Frequently, he will think about issues in terms of how political officials, elected officials or others react. But I don't think that is a negative."
Rumors that are swirling around the authority's headquarters in the World Trade Center about large layoffs are unfounded, Mr. Marlin's chief deputy, John J. Haley Jr., said earlier this week. But Mr. Haley did say that in one or two years, the authority would be a different organization.
"The instruction that we have from both administrations and the board is that there are no sacred cows here," Mr. Haley said. "We have to look at everything. The Port Authority has what is a traditional militaristic structure that is heavily layered. It has a lot of layers of management. What we are doing is examining all that."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Urges Big Spending To Cure Capital's Problems

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
With Republicans everywhere else in Congress urging less spending and bureaucracy, five of them from the House today recommended an array of new programs for the District of Columbia that would cost the Federal Government billions of dollars.
Sounding unexpectedly like the Democrats they criticize for excessive spending, the Republican lawmakers said at a subcommittee hearing that the programs would help create a vision of the urban future that could serve as a model for other troubled cities. 
 But as urgent as the proposals sounded, the notion of making major changes in a largely Democratic city that has no voting representation in Congress struck the only Democrat present as heavy-handed and unfair.
"To me, this is a serious step back from home rule," said Representative Julian C. Dixon of California, former chairman of the panel, the Appropriations Subcommittee on the District of Columbia, referring to the limited autonomy that Congress granted the District in 1974. But he predicted that the price tag for many of the recommendations would make them "a long way from reality in this Congress."
With a newly appointed financial control board for the city focused on short-term budgetary problems, House Speaker Newt Gingrich asked five Republicans to investigate long-term solutions to Washington's problems, including middle-class flight, rising crime rates and the deterioration of public schools.
Their recommendations were presented in informal fashion today, with each lawmaker appearing for about 30 minutes. But Representative James T. Walsh of upstate New York, the subcommittee chairman, said that ideas earning the widespread support of the control board, Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., the City Council and public interest groups could be put into effect as part of the city's 1996 budget.
The most expensive of the recommendations appeared to be a package of economic initiatives proposed by Representative Amo Houghton Jr. of upstate New York that would cost $224 million next year and $2.76 billion over four years.
The essence of his plan is similar to ideas proposed by Jack F. Kemp, the former Housing Secretary, who has consulted with both Mr. Gingrich and Mayor Barry in recent months over ways to revitalize the city. In Mr. Houghton's proposal, the District would become an enterprise zone, providing employer tax credits and tax-exempt financing as a way to attract new businesses, and local residents would pay reduced Federal income taxes.
He also noted in written testimony for the subcommittee that "the D.C. tax base is insufficient," a conclusion that contradicts a view held by many Republicans, including Representative Thomas M. Davis 3d of Virginia, the Republican chairman of the District Subcommittee of the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, which drafted the legislation that created the financial control board.
Mr. Davis, who opposes any commuter tax for the thousands of people who work in the District and live elsewhere, has steadfastly insisted that Washington's financial problems have been caused by management failures, not the tax structure.
Representative Fred Heineman, a North Carolina freshman and former New York City police officer, also recommended increased Federal spending. In his analysis of the District police department, in which officers this year lost 4 percent of their base salary as part of the city's overall effort to balance the budget, Mr. Heineman said the $8.3 million in savings should be restored.
"The morale is devastating," Mr. Heineman said of the local police. He urged that annual salaries be raised by $5,000 for each of District's 3,700 officers. That's another $18.5 million in proposed spending.
Representative Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin said his recommendations for the school system would be presented next week, when Mr. Gingrich meets with local residents at a town hall type of meeting.
Addressing proposed changes for human services and welfare, Representative James M. Talent of Missouri recommended a series of new programs, including one that would eliminate welfare benefits for unwed mothers under the age of 21 and create group homes for them, and a program that would reward teen-agers who did not get pregnant.
Representative Rick A. Lazio of Suffolk said efforts to improve housing and community development should focus on helping residents become homeowners as a way to stabilize neighborhoods.

HEADLINE: Five Indicted in Extortion by Meatpackers' Union

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
Five current and former officials of a meatpackers' union extorted bribes from meat and food wholesalers and a supermarket chain in the New York region to guarantee deliveries and labor peace, Federal prosecutors charged yesterday.
Mary Jo White, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, said the union officials shared the bribes with the Gambino and Genovese organized crime families who, she said, "supervised and protected the criminal activities of the defendants and their co-racketeers." 
 In exchange for the payoffs, Ms. White said, the union officials also allowed some companies to freeze wages and shortchange pension and welfare benefit funds for their workers.
None of the victimized companies named in the Federal indictment were charged with any crime, however. Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for the United States Attorney's office, declined to comment on which companies had shortchanged their workers, whether their actions were illegal or whether they might face criminal charges themselves.
"We are not allowed to comment unless someone has been charged, and at this point, no one else has been charged," Mr. Smilon said. "However, the investigation is continuing."
The indictment charged that beginning in the early 1970's, the defendants used their positions as officials of Local 174 of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union "to enrich themselves with bribes they demanded and accepted from food wholesalers, retailers and processors within Local 174's jurisdiction."
The indictment said the defendants and the crime families extorted cash payments "by exploiting employers' fears of physical and economic harm, such as work stoppages and other forms of labor unrest."
Ms. White said one company, a chain of Associated Supermarkets operated by the R.B.G. Management Company of the Bronx, paid a total of $76,500 in bribes between 1985 and 1993.
The union officials named in the indictment were Robert Wilson, president of Local 174 from 1983 to 1993; Phil Falcone, a business agent of the local until 1989; James Coniglio, a vice president of the local until this year, and Jose Rodriguez and Heinz Ottmar, vice presidents of the local. If convicted, they face sentences of 45 to 50 years in prison. Each was released on $1,000 bail.
A sixth person, William Kissel, a former official of the local, was named as an unindicted co-conspirator and is expected to be a witness for the Government.
A woman who answered the union's telephone at 540 West 48th Street said no one could take a call requesting comment. An official at R.B.G. Management also declined comment.
The other companies named as victims of the extortion scheme were: Republic Food Corporation; Alliance Meats Inc.; Dilrich Provisions Inc.; S. Tichauer; the Republic Veal Boning Corporation; John W. Williams Inc.; Westchester Meats; GT Food Inc., and S & W Hotel Restaurant Supply. Telephone calls to each of the companies were not returned last night.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japanese Banks Find Themselves Under the Gun

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 27

 BODY:
Five years ago, Kichinosuke Sasaki was on top of the world, controlling $11 billion in real estate and riding a wave of optimism that saw property prices rise relentlessly.
These days, his empire has pretty much collapsed, amid a wave of pessimism that is relentlessly driving prices down. Now, he says his assets are worth less than the $3.4 billion he owes the banks. 
 That is not only bad news for Mr. Sasaki, but also for his bankers, for the Japanese economy -- and for the United States.
As business magnates like Mr. Sasaki struggle to pay back loans, Japan's banking system is left nervously clutching real estate deeds and stock certificates that are worth a fraction of what they were when the loans were made -- and which may be worth even less next month.
That is why some financial experts are whispering about an almost unthinkable possibility that sends chills down the spines of bankers around the world: a financial meltdown in Japan.
A meltdown could be set off by a sudden further plunge in real estate prices, leading people like Mr. Sasaki to default. The banks might then dump their real estate and stock holdings, sending prices plummeting even more and possibly precipitating bank runs and collapses. The resulting panic would spread in all directions, including to America's board rooms and trading floors.
To be sure, almost no one thinks a meltdown is likely. But not many rule out the possibility.
A somewhat more conceivable scenario is the collapse of a single Japanese bank, brought down by word -- or even rumor -- of acute financial difficulties. Analysts say that any crisis is unlikely to get far because the Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, would step in immediately to contain the damage.
Still, on Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin expressed concern that the Japanese authorities have not done enough to stimulate the economy and avert a banking crisis. When asked by reporters in Washington about worries that a big Japanese bank might fail, he said that the Bank of Japan was "simply going to have to do whatever is necessary to prevent that from happening," adding that "the earlier you act on these things, the better."
Regulators in the United States have been discussing the situation for months. Some financial experts fear that a sudden collapse of a big bank in Japan, if poorly handled by bankers and regulators, could inflict heavy losses on American banks and even disrupt the American financial system.
Japan is suffering from record-high unemployment, deflation, a depressed stock market and a stagnant property market at the same time. But looming over all those problems are the growing fears about the banks.
The Ministry of Finance has said that the nation's lending institutions are sitting on bad debt worth 40 trillion yen, $450 billion at current exchange rates, or 9.5 percent of Japan's annual economic output. This official estimate is about equal to the combined equity of all Japanese banks, but many analysts say the amount of bad loans may be significantly higher, perhaps as much as $800 billion.
Not all of the bad loans will have to be written off entirely; the Government apparently estimates that only about one-third will be complete losses. Nonetheless, the mountain of bad debt -- and the uncertainty over its exact dimensions -- is weakening the heart of Japan's financial system.
"The myth was maintained by the M.O.F. that it was almighty and could handle all situations," said Richard Koo, an economist at the Nomura Research Institute, referring to the Ministry of Finance. "As long as the M.O.F. maintains the myth, all the banks could technically be bankrupt," yet continue to do business as usual.
The question is whether the myth can be maintained much longer. Naturally, the Bank of Japan could guarantee funds in a banking crisis or loosen monetary policy to avoid severe economic contraction. And the Government could lift the economy with a huge spending spree. But so far, these steps have not been taken in a convincing way, economists say.
If a crisis were to occur, American banks face several risks, which because of scant financial details are difficult to assess, experts say.
The least threatening risk is that Japanese banks might be unable to repay loans or deposits from American banks, but international procedures for resolving such defaults minimize the threat to American institutions.
A larger risk lies in possible Japanese defaults on financial contracts with American banks that allow them to swap interest payments. The scale of this "counterparty" risk between American and Japanese banks is hard to determine.
Potentially the biggest risk, and the least understood, involves failures that might prevent a Japanese bank from honoring its foreign exchange contracts. In the interval after Japan has ended its business day and before the opening of the day in America, Japanese banks may have accepted payments in yen for currency deals and other transactions without making the corresponding payments in dollars to American banks.
With the enormous expansion of foreign currency trading in recent years, nobody knows precisely the dimensions of such risks to American banks.
Many economists say they are confident that business investment will pick up and that Japan's economy may bounce back by December, and some say growth could be significant next year. But others say a recovery is unlikely any time soon, noting that the economy grew only one-tenth of 1 percent in the first quarter. Indeed, some in this group believe Japan is now undergoing a slight contraction.
"It's Japanosclerosis," said Mi neko Sasaki-Smith, an economist at Morgan Stanley Japan Ltd.
After more than four years of economic troubles, experts say, there is a remote possibility that Japan's economy could deteriorate into a deflationary spiral and a prolonged recession of the kind that John Maynard Keynes cautioned about in his writings in the 1930's.
"Whoever resolves this recession will win the Nobel Prize," said Jesper Koll, an economist at J. P. Morgan Securities Asia Ltd.
The Bank of Japan has been dribbling funds into the financial system to get the economy moving again. The discount rate, the rate at which banks borrow from the central bank, stands at 1 percent, and interest rates are at their historic low. Economists expect the bank to lower rates again, raising the possibility of zero or even negative nominal rates.
A negative rate is extremely rare, for it means that banks charge customers interest on their deposits and pay them to borrow. A version of that happened in the late 1980's when speculators poured money into Hong Kong in expectation of an appreciation of the Hong Kong dollar. As a result, banks imposed interest charges on customers who placed large deposits in Hong Kong dollars.
But Mr. Sasaki, the beleaguered real estate tycoon, doubts that the economy will pick up "even at zero interest rates or negative 2 percent rates."
The problem with banks paying him to borrow, he said, is that he would still have to repay the loan. And with taxes and other high costs in Japan, he is not sure he could make money from an investment in property.
Such uncertainty has depressed demand for commercial real estate, and prices have fallen up to 90 percent in some areas. Residential prices have also fallen, by one-third to one-half, making homeowners feel poorer and less likely to fill up their shopping carts.
This languishing demand has spread to the banking industry, the stock market and slowly throughout the economy. Nationwide deflation is already beginning to bite, although partly because of cheaper imports resulting from the surge in the value of the yen. Now the term that elicits sighs of resignation from Japanese executives is "kakaku hakai," or "price destruction."
During the outlandish bubble economy of the late 1980's, when the economy was inflated to spectacular heights, the Japanese bubble kings moved about Tokyo in their Mercedes-Benzes and Bentleys, scouting for properties. Their quest for new acquisitions helped inflate prices to astronomical levels -- an apartment for a top foreign executive in Tokyo can rent for $30,000 a month -- and created the impression of Japanese invincibility.
Now, the creases on Mr. Sasaki's face tell of the battles he has endured. His staff has shrunk to 35, from about 100, and he has cut his operating costs to one-fifth of their peak levels.
"It's a nightmare," Mr. Sasaki said. "Since I don't see the economy improving, I think I'm facing an all-out failure. But if I fail, the entire country will fail."

HEADLINE: Clinton and the Economy;
Even if Growth Rebounds, the President May Not Win Comparable Political Gains

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
On Friday morning, the Commerce Department will issue a figure that until very recently the White House was dreading: an accounting of the economy's paltry growth in the second quarter of the year, a grim statistic that for much of the year looked as if it would be the first step off a steep cliff.
The number will likely be around five-tenths of a percent, a long, long fall from the economy's spectacular performance last year. But now there is a growing consensus among economists and traders that the figure will likely be the year's worst and that a rebound is already under way. 
 They are basing their optimism on the usual hodgepodge mix of home sales, the pace of exports, inventory levels and other straws in the economic wind that recently suggest that the worst is probably over. At the White House, officials are already declaring that the much talked-about "soft landing" has arrived.
"The second-quarter figure is coming out at a time that the second quarter seems no longer relevant," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who has predicted publicly for several months that the rebound would start in the second half of the year, said today. "The question now is how strongly do we resume growth."
The political import of all this is lost on no one in Washington: It has been more than 40 years since a Democratic incumbent ran for the Presidency with the economy seemingly strong, inflation under control and unemployment off the front page. Against all the speculation just a few months ago, Bill Clinton now looks as though he may break the spell.
What that means in concrete political terms -- the first primary is still seven months away -- is anyone's guess. Even if the economy does bounce back in coming months, it is far from clear that there will be corresponding political gains for Mr. Clinton.
Growth was strong and inflation was low last November, and the result was a Republican seizure of both the House and the Senate. In the postwar era, growth had to average more than 4.6 percent in the year leading up to an election for a Presidential incumbent to be re-elected.
And the stagnation of wages and the job insecurity felt by millions of Americans remain a major economic problem, and an even bigger political one, a point Mr. Rubin and other Administration officials acknowledge.
But an economy in downturn as the primaries approach seemed probable just a few months ago, and Mr. Clinton's economic advisers are delighting in the fact that the business cycle seems unlikely to give the Republicans any fresh ammunition.
"This gives tremendous momentum to the Clinton re-election candidacy," Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee who until a few months ago was considered a likely candidate to run the campaign, said in his office today. "We ought to take the quotes from all those guys on the Hill who were predicting doom and gloom and throw them back in their faces."
The Republicans, of course, will retort that the man who brought about the soft landing was not Bill Clinton but one of their own: Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. Last year he was regularly portrayed by the White House as the lurking force of evil in the economy, raising interest rates last year to head off inflation.
On several occasions the White House forgot its stated policy of never arguing in public with the Federal Reserve, carping about its approach and saying that it would cost jobs and growth. More than a few times Mr. Rubin had to call his colleagues in the Cabinet and ask them, politely, to shut up.
Now, after a considerable amount of revisionist thinking, Mr. Greenspan has become something of an economic hero in the White House. The interest-rate increases are now viewed in a kinder light, in part because they choked off inflation but especially because rates began to come down again last month.
Suddenly the most likely successor to Alan Greenspan, whose term runs out next March, is Alan Greenspan. (The reality is that probably no one else could get confirmed: The Republican leaders of the Senate would probably hold up the nomination of any other candidate until after the next election.)
Certainly not all the news has been good, and anyone wanting to construct a pessimistic outline for the months ahead has plenty to work with. In May, personal income declined slightly, the first fall since January 1994. In June, a leading index of manufacturing purchases declined for the second consecutive month, after nearly two years of growth. Car sales plunged alarmingly in the spring, leaving the chief executives of the Big Three shaken. Mortgage applications are down, even though interest rates have dropped nearly two points in eight months. The savings rate continues to fall.
Some economists maintain that any good news is simply a delay of the inevitable. "If the economy survives 1995 without a recession, next year will offer no respite from hazards," the Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Bard College wrote last week in one of the blitz of newsletter analyses that has preceded Friday's report on gross domestic product. "The probability of a recession beginning either this year or next is 60 percent."
If so, Mr. Clinton could find himself in exactly the condition he managed to exploit brilliantly against George Bush.
But inflation seems increasingly unlikely to be an issue as the election approaches; it is not only down in this country but around the world. The job market has remained surprisingly strong, an impression bolstered today when the Government announced a large decline in claims for unemployment benefits. Retail sales are up, though much of that comes from huge promotions that car makers are using after they were caught by surprise by slow sales early in the year.
There are three major issues that seem to bother the Administration's top officials when they talk about the economy: What will happen to personal income, whether a showdown with the Republicans over the budget sends the markets into a tailspin and what happens if the country's export boom suddenly dries up.
All the economic indicators in the country can turn up, but if income stays stagnant, Mr. Clinton's advisers agree, he will be unable to convince voters that much has changed. "It's the problem the President works on the most," Mr. Rubin said today, referring to proposals in his budget for training and education. "Because median real wages have not behaved well, too many Americans don't feel in their own lives what has happened in the economy."
The second concern is that the battle over the budget will bring the Government to a standstill in October, with all kinds of hard-to-predict economic fallout. "We've had the Government close for a day or two in the past, but what we are worried about is something much longer and worse," a top Administration official said recently. "And it is unclear who would be blamed for that, Bill Clinton or Newt Gingrich."
And the third concern is that the hidden miracle of the economy -- exports -- will finally cool off. Just how much exports are rising is a matter of how you measure, but the trend is pointing to a 15 percent increase over last year, fueled by the weak dollar. That is a remarkable achievement at any time, but particularly when the country's No. 2 and No. 3 trading partners, Japan and Mexico, are in the most dire economic trouble they have suffered in years.
Whether the country's economic growth can be sustained even if the domestic economy slows further, then, depends in large part on keeping up a huge flow of goods to Europe and Southeast Asia. And that means depending on economies over which Mr. Clinton has virtually no control.
"What no one has noticed in the past year or so is that now fully 50 percent of our exports go to the Pacific Basin," said Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative and another potential candidate to run Mr. Clinton's campaign. "That is why we have such a critical interest in continuing the market openings there and building those relationships."
But Asia is also where the United States has its biggest trade deficits, and they, too, have widened over the year. That could be the wedge the Republicans turn to first.

Durable Orders Drop

 WASHINGTON, July 27 (Reuters) -- Orders for durable goods edged lower last month, the Commerce Department said today, but economists said the report indicated factory activity was stabilizing.
Orders for items like cars and computers fell one-tenth of a percent to a seasonally adjusted $159.4 billion. While the drop was a weaker performance than expected, it followed a revised 2.6 percent rise in May orders and three months of larger declines.
Excluding the volatile category of aircraft and parts, orders for durable capital goods rose 2.5 percent in June and 5 percent in May.
Activity at factories has been weak in 1995, with orders for durable goods running 3.3 percent lower in the second quarter than in the first.
Separately, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing initial claims for state unemployment pay fell 42,000 last week, to 374,000. The four-week average for jobless claims, a less volatile gauge of employment conditions, rose to 389,000 from 387,750.

HEADLINE: Penny-Pinching on Nicaragua

 BODY:
Senator Jesse Helms's vindictiveness should not be allowed to threaten the tiny amount of foreign aid Washington now sends to Nicaragua. Mr. Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has cooked up a bogus issue to hold over the head of Nicaragua's President, Violeta Chamorro. He says her Government has not made enough progress in settling the claims of American citizens whose property was seized by the Sandinistas after their revolution in 1979.
Before Monday President Clinton must certify that Nicaragua's actions on settling the property disputes and on human rights is satisfactory. Otherwise aid will be cut off unless he grants a waiver. 
 In fact, progress on the property rights issue in the past six months has been better than ever, and the President should certainly go ahead with the certification. But a bill before the Senate would shift the power of certification to a hostile Congress. The bill would also force the Administration, in the absence of certification, to vote against loans to Nicaragua from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
A provision in the Senate's State Department appropriations bill would exclude anyone who owns or "traffic[ks] in" confiscated property from entering the country. This is a ridiculously onerous provision that could exclude virtually any politician from Cuba or Nicaragua, executives of multinational corporations and ordinary tourists.
Congressional supporters of former landowners tend to view all their claims favorably. Some are credible. But the Nicaraguan Government says that some people are asking for compensation for the full value of properties that were heavily mortgaged, or properties on which banks had already foreclosed. Fewer than one-third of the former landowners seeking redress were American citizens when their property was expropriated.
The land claimed by former owners amounts to a quarter of Nicaragua's arable land. The estimated cost of compensation is 35 percent of the country's gross domestic product. This is clearly beyond the financial ability of Nicaragua's Government to resolve immediately. Nicaragua has already resolved 2,200 claims and has 3,000 to go, including those of about 640 American citizens. Cutting the country's $30 million in projected aid is not likely to speed up compensation.
The timing of Mr. Helms's onslaught could not be more inappropriate. Recently an agreement was reached in Nicaragua by groups of farmers, holders of compensatory Government bonds and people who received urban properties after the revolution. Americans with property claims were represented at the meeting. Nicaragua has also signed an agreement with the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes, which is part of the World Bank. Claimants can bring property disputes to this body, and Nicaragua will accept its jurisdiction.
Most of Nicaragua's land was traditionally controlled by a ruthless elite. The Sandinistas' goal of redistributing land was a legitimate one, although the process was highly flawed and often unfairly administered. Land redistribution is also part of the peace process in El Salvador, a policy Washington supports and part of the peace negotiations now under way in Guatemala.
Mr. Helms cannot forgive Mrs. Chamorro for trying to work with the Sandinistas, whom she defeated in elections in 1990. Mrs. Chamorro is doing her best to stitch her tattered country together. She has made impressive progress on many other fronts, including privatization, eliminating hyperinflation and reducing the army. By trying to deprive Nicaragua of its aid, and the help of lending institutions, Mr. Helms shows a callous disregard for the Nicaraguan people.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Arresting The Negotiators

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
The top political and military leaders of the Bosnian Serbs must be arrested and held for war-crime trials if they appear in any country in the world. This decision by a United Nations tribunal pleases Western governments trapped in the Bosnian disaster as it will please millions passionate against the Bosnian Serbs.
All right, then, the question is: What now?
How do you negotiate with men you demand be arrested on sight? The answers I get from officials of the U.S., the U.N., the tribunal and diplomatic veterans of Bosnian peace negotiations are totally clear: "We don't know."
The price of making negotiations impossible by issuing arrest warrants for one side can be terrifyingly high. Without peace talks, the ever-deeper Western involvement can bring Europe to where it stood 81 years ago this week -- at the cusp of a world war.
The issue was what Bismarck had predicted would bring war one day -- "some damn foolish thing in the Balkans." It turned out to be Serbia. Crowds in Austria, which wanted to swallow Serbia, screamed, "Serben mussen sterben." Serbs must die.
The outlines of a Bosnian solution have been heartbreakingly obvious. Yesterday I received a faxed letter from one of the indicted men, the Bosnian Serb President, Radovan Karadzic. It came after I had inquired among supporters of the Bosnian Serbs in the U.S. about the Serbs' bottom line.
Dr. Karadzic said the "blueprint for peace" was a European plan of 1993, originated by Lord Owen of Britain and Thorvald Stoltenberg of Norway. It called for the recognition of Muslim, Croatian and Serbian republics within a loose Bosnian government. The plan gave 49 percent of the land to the Muslim republic, 33.5 to the Serbs and 17.5 percent to the Bosnian Croats, and proposed two years of U.N. administration of Sarajevo.
Dr. Karadzic said that the plan meant self-determination for all parts of the former Yugoslavia. Interpretation: The Serbs must have the same rights of self-determination and alliance that the Muslims and Croatia have won.
The Bosnian Serbs and Croats accepted the European plan; the Muslims did not. Two years later, the West has to recognize that putting pressure on the Bosnian Serbs will not bring peace unless some is also put on the Muslims.
But how to resume negotiations? One way would be for the top Serbs to fly off somewhere, maybe Pakistan or Iran, which have offered to jail them, and hold out their wrists. Or the West could do what the Muslims want -- stall negotiations until the Bosnian Serbs are smashed. That would take a massive Western invasion, followed by an occupation to keep the Serbs submissive, something not even the Nazis managed.
The other is to think of gimmicks to get around the negotiating roadblock of the arrest edict. Hold them in Bosnia? No, that would make the site an instant death trap. U.N. headquarters? Not legal, says the tribunal prosecutor. An Italian judge even raises the question whether any country can negotiate with indicted men. So -- "We don't know."
The concept of war-crime trials is important. But after the World War II trials, the nations lost enthusiasm. Saddam Hussein was not tried for invading Kuwait. Hafez al-Assad of Syria got away clean with capturing Lebanon. That fellow in Libya, whose terrorists the West says blew up Pan Am 103, still sits in his deluxe tent, receiving figs and ambassadors.
Pol Pot faced no court for mass murder in Cambodia. The Communist Chinese not only get away with using torture and slavery as tools in the international market, but have a judge sitting on that U.N. tribunal.
The nations run from every war-crime trial that is politically or economically inconvenient, which has meant everybody but the Bosnian Serbs.
Still, the world should not bury war-crime charges with the victims. The tribunal has not finished looking into charges against Muslims and Croats. Any trials should come when peace is negotiated -- and for accused from all sides at the same time.
Like Congressional pressure to arm the Muslims, the Serb-only indictments, coming now, postpone peace. Every delay kills more people, every single day, to no avail.
In that other July, in 1914, then too the great men of power did not believe it could ever really happen, the guns of August.

HBO-Showtime Clash Is Pretty Fine Bout, Too

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
As rain pelted an umbrella at Bryant Park shortly after Wednesday's Evander Holyfield-Riddick Bowe outdoor news conference was canceled, a well-dressed young man calmly ate a sandwich and discussed the bubbling excitement he felt about Mike Tyson's return. "I'd pay to watch him fight my mother," he said.
But would he pay for Bowe-Holyfield ("The People's Championship") and Tyson-His Mom if both aired on pay-per-view the same night? 
 That would mean $90 to $100 on the month's cable bill.
That's the choice fight fans face Nov. 4 if detente is not achieved between HBO's TVKO (Bowe-Holyfield) and Showtime's S.E.T. (Tyson versus His Mom).
"There isn't that much money in the market to make it comfortable," said Richard Aurelio, president of Time Warner's New York City Cable Group.
Gary Shaw, a spokesman for T.C.I.'s New Jersey cable system, said: "We'd prefer to have one pay-per-view fight per month."
Pragmatism suggests a settlement (greed will win), but let's hope for a smidgen more of the hostilities. For the sheer amusement found in corporate loathing, little surpasses the HBO-Showtime feud, born of the enmity between Seth Abraham, the president of Time Warner Sports, and Don King, without whom Showtime's boxing and Bruce Seldon as a heavyweight champ would not exist.
"We will not surrender at any cost," King vowed Wednesday via fax.
This is an ego-driven tale of who-came-firsts. Last month, TVKO and S.E.T. told Request TV, a key pay-per-view distributor, that they wanted to stage fights on Nov. 4. TVKO wanted the date for a George Foreman fight that never materialized, S.E.T. for Tyson's second fight. When Request requested that one party make a $50,000 deposit, S.E.T. paid up.
"Request never asked for that before," said Abraham, "and we never go to the cable industry without a signed fight and a site."
Before confirming late Wednesday that peace talks had begun with TVKO, McAdory Lipscomb, S.E.T.'s executive vice president, called his rival "a greedy company" that wants to "rob the viewer."
Added King: "We had the date first and we will not be bullied."
The two sides have accommodated each other before. In late May, King faxed the Nevada State Athletic Commission to reserve Sept. 16 for a Julio Cesar Chavez fight (on S.E.T.), 20 minutes before promoter Bob Arum's fax to get the date for an Oscar De La Hoya bout on TVKO. "Two weeks later, Arum moved De La Hoya to Sept. 9," said Marc Ratner, executive director of the commission.
For the Nov. 4 fight, Ratner said a fax sent by Rock Newman, Bowe's manager-promoter, beat King's, on behalf of Tyson, by two days.
Said Ratner: "We'd honor both fights but we'd need extra staff. We're preparing for both, but I don't think both will come off."
If the combatants prove to be economic rationalists, what factors will help them decide on a solution?
1. Having enraged cable systems with onerous demands to carry Tyson's Aug. 19 fight, S.E.T. may try to re-establish good relations by magnanimously offering to move the fight to December.
2. TVKO would find it tough to move its fight at the Caesars Palace outdoor stadium because nighttime in December is chilly. The Tyson fight is scheduled indoors at the MGM Grand.
3. Cable operators and the casinos that stand to lose a bundle if the two fights are broadcast at once may step in to force one of the parties into sanity.
4. Tyson's performance on Aug. 19 could embolden or weaken King's resolve. King may want to capitalize on a quick, brutal knockout of Peter McNeeley and boldly risk direct competition on Nov. 4; but if Tyson is unremarkable, King may feel that a retreat to December is beneficial.
5. One side could drop its pay-per-view plan and downshift its fight to its premium TV arm. The betting here is that switching Bowe-Holyfield from TVKO to HBO would wrest more viewers from the Tyson bout on S.E.T., than vice versa.
What's the real solution? Forget Tyson, Holyfield or Bowe. Make Don Fehr and Bud Selig square off in the "Ultimate Fighting Championship," a martial arts cockfight. For $19.95, it would outsell pugilism.
 
AIRWAVES
 "Kings on the Hill," about the Negro leagues (Sunday at 4 P.M. on NBC) is a terrific documentary that underscores black baseball's cultural potency for African-Americans. "It was our thing," said AUGUST WILSON, the playwright. "Then came integration, and we didn't have our nothing." . . . The LEN DYKSTRA segment on HBO's "Real Sports" (Sunday, 9:45 P.M.), produced by BARBARA KOPPLE, a two-time Oscar-winning documentarian, is a sharply-drawn profile that finds Dykstra introspective.
TNT named CNN's VINCE CELLINI the host of "Pro Football Tonight," the pre-game studio show that will be broadcast Sundays from 7-8 P.M. before TNT's nine games starting Sept. 3. . . . Chances are fading that MIKE WEISMAN will be president of the MSG Network because of his concerns about Madison Square Garden's dual ownership by ITT and Cablevision, said a person familiar with the talks. Said Weisman: "I've had conversations with DAVE CHECKETTS, whom I like very much, about a wide range of subjects." Checketts is president of the Garden. . . . WALT (CLYDE) FRAZIER, the Knicks' WFAN analyst, has agreed to a one-year contract renewal.

HEADLINE: About Real Estate;
Agents Say Home Sales Remain in the Doldrums

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
As the summer doldrums settle in, real estate agents across the metropolitan New York region are hoping for cooler weather -- and more sales.
With the exceptions of small bustling pockets of good business and a few agents who insist that this is one of their best seasons ever, the spring and the months of June and July have left many agents glum. 
 In Connecticut, William Raveis, who owns a company based in Shelton with 1,200 agents across the state, said house sales were "very difficult," adding that sales statewide were down about 15 percent this spring from last spring.
"And some markets are even worse," he said. "The shoreline east of New Haven was off 30 percent, New Haven was off 40 percent, Hartford was off about 20 percent and the town of Avon was off 40 percent." Sales in Fairfield County, with homes within commuting distance to New York City, he said, were off between 10 and 12 percent.
"We're going to just loll in this malaise for a long time," he predicted, citing the state's problems with layoffs in the insurance and military industries. "In 1996, it'll start trickling back but it's still been a struggle."
In 1994, agents said, interest rates were low and sellers had brought their prices down to a manageable level. When interest rates started to perk upward, a mini-boom began, which the more optimistic heralded as the end of the real estate recession. Now, many are not so sure.
In New Jersey, Peter L. Mosca, a spokesman for the New Jersey Association of Realtors, said that sales were off from 1994 partly because of a lessening of consumer confidence -- a factor that he said seems to have dipped further in the last couple of months.
He said that while 43,000 house sales had been reported in the second quarter of 1994, preliminary figures were "somewhere between 37,000 and 40,000 for the same period of 1995." He said exact figures would be released in two weeks.
In Summit, N.J., Marjorie K. Robertson, the agent who writes the newsletter for the Faitoute real estate agency, said volume was "down significantly" in the area of Summit, New Providence and Berkeley. In the first half of 1995, she said, overall sales in Summit were down 29 percent (with 123 closings in 1994 versus 87 so far this year); down 35 percent in New Providence and down 30 percent in Berkeley. In Short Hills, she said, volume was down 12.5 percent.
Among the reasons for the decline, she said, were that " Wall Street bonuses were significantly lower and there were a lot of layoffs in industry here." New listings of properties for sale are "twice what's going off," she said.
The lack of bonuses on Wall Street was also cited by brokers in New York City and by Deborah Beck of the Real Estate Board of New York. Although statistics were not available for total city co-op and condo sales -- not every real estate brokerage reports to the real estate board -- Ms. Beck cited a drop in average room prices from last year's second quarter to this year's.
The average per-room price of a one-bedroom apartment in sales reported to the board fell to $49,286 this year from $56,262 a year ago; a two-bedroom apartment to $81,250 from $86,400, and a three-bedroom apartment to $179,639 from $187,500.
Barbara Corcoran, head of the Corcoran Group in Manhattan, said her sales were off 8 percent from last year. This summer seems to be slower than past summers, she said, predicting that autumn "will bring fewer sales and higher prices on the really desirable properties."
At Julia B. Fee Real Estate in Westchester, a spokesman said that "as we headed into the summer, sales are falling off dramatically." And although there is a lag of two to three months from the time a contract is signed and a closing, "what we're hearing anecdotally from brokers about upcoming sales is small comfort," he said.
Nevertheless, there are markets that appear hardy. One broker in central Connecticut cited the low end of the market -- especially the first-time home buyers -- as business "that's keeping us alive."
Klara Madlin, whose company aims at the Upper West Side of Manhattan, said a huge chunk of this year's business -- which she reported was up 18 percent from the first half of last year -- was sales to young first-time buyers.
The situation is just the opposite in the Hamptons, where Philip Fenwick Elliott, who runs Sotheby's East Hampton and Southampton offices, said that it was the low end that was languishing -- not multimillion-dollar sales.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Edges Lower vs. Mark As Traders Await G.D.P. Data

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped slightly against the German mark yesterday as currency dealers adjusted their portfolios ahead of today's report on economic growth in the United States.
Currency dealers said they would look at the second-quarter figure for the gross domestic product for clues about how it might influence the Federal Reserve on interest-rate policy. 
 "We are sidelined pending tomorrow's G.D.P. numbers," Gabriele Schmitt, a vice president at Bank of New York, said yesterday.
Economists expect that the G.D.P. report will show the pace of growth to be slower than previously thought. They estimate that the report will show a growth rate of four-tenths of 1 percent, down from 2.7 percent for the first quarter and 5.1 percent for the last three months of 1994.
A weak report could improve the chances that the Fed will soon cut short-term interest rates. After the Fed lowered its target rate for overnight loans by a quarter-point on July 6, many dealers expected that it would cut rates again in August. But recent data provided signs that the economy was strengthening.
Lower interest rates tend to make a country's assets less attractive to international investors and place downward pressure on a currency.
"Nobody's really expecting a rate cut but all that really matters is the G.D.P. tomorrow and what the Bank of Japan and Bundesbank do with rates in the near future," said Charles Fago, currency dealer at Gulf International Bank.
Dealers said the dollar was caught in a downward trend against the mark, but it was also falling against weaker European currencies.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.3833 marks from 1.3877 marks on Wednesday. But the dollar edged up to 88.10 Japanese yen from 87.91 yen.
Dealers attributed the dollar's strength against the yen to uncertainty about whether the Bank of Japan would lower interest rates to stimulate a sluggish economy.

Off season in the National Football League is a time for each club to lick its wounds, to reload, to rededicate and to prepare for the grueling 16-game run to the playoffs and the Super Bowl. For the Minnesota Vikings, however, it has been sheer turmoil.
Their brutal off season began last winter after a stunning, listless 35-18 playoff loss at home to the Chicago Bears (a team Minnesota had beaten twice in the regular season) was quickly followed by accusations of sexual harassment against the Vikings' head coach, Dennis Green, and the team's defensive backs coach, Richard Solomon. 
 There were more embarrassing incidents but none as devastating as the one last week when the Vikings' star quarterback, Warren Moon, was arrested on a charge of assaulting his wife, Felicia.
These are hard times for the Vikings, who last Sunday opened training camp as a team on the edge of the National Football League's elite. The Vikings thought that the worst was behind them because the 1980's were full of misery. That decade included a series of drunken driving charges against several players, a management that players described as racist and one that was considered inept.
Remember the sour 1989 trade with the Dallas Cowboys for running back Herschel Walker for all of those Vik-
ings draft picks?
In hiring Green before the 1992 season and in acquiring Moon from the Houston Oilers before last season, the Vikings hoped they were putting an end to those problems. Green was cast as the new sheriff in town. Moon, after 10 gritty Oilers seasons, was considered the epitome of excellence in character and in integrity.
Now, in some circles, there is no escaping this idea: The solutions have become even bigger problems.
The Moon ordeal was the final, stinging stab for the Vikings, a mystifying occurrence for those who know him as a charitable man and an important role model.
On July 18, police in Missouri City, Tex., were called to the Moon home by either the family's housekeeper or the youngest of Moon's four children, 7-year-old Jeffrey. Felicia Moon told the police that after a heated argument Moon struck her in the head with an open hand and choked her to the point of losing consciousness.
Only a few months before, it had been revealed that Moon had been accused of sexual assault by a Vikings cheerleader, a case that was settled out of court and one that Moon today insists had no basis.
All of this was beyond comprehension for those who have followed Moon's brilliant career. Moon has known Felicia since he was 16. They met in their hometown of Los Angeles, and their 14-year marriage and nearly 23-year association had been full of teamwork, especially in their charitable organization, the Crescent Moon Foundation.
Though Felicia decided not to press charges against Moon, three days after the incident, last Friday, he was arrested, charged and released on a $1,000 personal recognizance bond.
"One of the goals for myself had always been not to get arrested in my life for anything," said Moon, who turns age 39 on Nov. 18. "It was a goal for my family as well as for me. After the press conference last Friday where I apologized to Felicia in front of our kids, in front of the world, and apologized to her family and my family and to my fans, I was told I would be arrested and to come to the police station.
"I pulled into the garage down under the police station and the judge was already there. I didn't even know the procedure. It was unreal. The fingerprinting. Taking the mug shots. It is something I will never forget, something you can never prepare for. But I must say that it set into quicker motion me getting help for myself. I had already begun to realize that I needed help in beginning to analyze why I have such a burning need to succeed and to keep busy and to take care of others more than myself. And how I had begun to take my marriage and my family for granted when they are the most important things in my life."
In counseling since, Moon said he has come to realize at least two things. In one session, a counselor asked Moon what were his hobbies, what does he do to relax and unwind.
Moon surprised himself because he could not answer. He did not have any except for running tirelessly from football to his work in television to his work in real estate to his work in his charities. And he found that his penchant for work might be traced to the day when his father died when Moon was 7, when his mother and five sisters told him that he was now the man of the household.
"I guess ever since that day, I have overloaded myself," Moon said. "I've taken on so many others' problems and never examined my own. And then my kids and my wife always expected me to be gone during the football season. But with all of the other business I began to take on, I was gone during the off season, too. We grew apart. The strain was too much. Nobody knows what Felicia and I have already been through. We've made it together and the love is still there. I've got a lot more work to do on myself and on us. And we will do it together."
Moon said it was the first and the only time he had hit his wife.
Moon, Felicia and their children held news conferences in Missouri City and in Minneapolis after the incident and Felicia repeated her desire that she did not want to press charges. The Fort Bend County District Attorney, John Healey, said this is why his office did so, anyway:
"In a hypothetical case such as this, prosecutors have been educated to the point where they are aware there can be many reasons as to why a complainant many not want to press charges. Among them could be a deep and abiding feeling that it has never happened before or won't happen again or a feeling of the threat of future physical harm or of economic or family pressures. A combination of these things can be in existence in any type of domestic violence case and the prevailing philosophy of health care professionals has been that it is best not to ignore the problem by dropping the charges at the request of the complainant."
Moon was criticized for having his children (girls ages 12 and 10 and boys ages 14 and 7) present at both news conferences. If he had it to do over, he said he would have them there again.
"What do you do?" he asked. "Put the children upstairs or outside or down the street and have it? They know what's going on. Do you think it was any worse that what they would hear at the Astrodome from unruly fans or at school on a Monday after a loss? I know it was not. I wanted them there to hear me apologize to their mother and to the world. Felicia and I consulted our counselor and our minister and all of us agreed that is the way it should have been done. We are going to tackle this as a family and we are going to make it as a family. There is no way to soften it for the kids or for us. Not only this, but everything from now on we are going to do as a family, enjoying the good and tackling the bad."
He said there is so much that he needs to work on that all starts within:
"All of my life there has been pressure, the pressure of being the leader of the family as a child, the pressures of proving myself as a black quarterback, the pressure of being passed over by most major colleges, and at first by the N.F.L. and then going to the Canadian Football League and then trying to earn my way in the N.F.L. The circus atmosphere in Houston and being the spokesperson and then the blame for everything that went wrong there.
"I've been doubted all of my life. I'll just have to show them and myself one more time, and if I'm healthy I will do that on and off the field once again. This is one more major hurdle. I know that life can be better now than it has been in a long time."
Green said he has told Moon that "there is always tomorrow" and added, "we both know about tough times."
Green has survived the accusations of sexual harassment, including one made by an office worker at Stanford, where Green was the head coach before taking the Vikings job.
The worker, in a wrongful dismissal lawsuit against the university, said Green had harassed her. The lawsuit was settled out of court, and Green denies the accusation. He has signed a contract extension with the Vikings through 1998.
Green knows that the Vikings have little time to regroup, especially since their season begins with four playoff teams from a year ago. The Vikings start with games against divisional rivals Chicago and Detroit followed by Dallas and Pittsburgh.
"We've had our program in place for three years and we've won divisional titles in two of those three years with a team that was 6-10 and 8-8 before we took over," Green said. "We've won 30 regular-season games in those three seasons. We set a club record for attendance last season. We've established we can be a good football team and can win and that we have quality people. That is why the league selected us to represent it in the bowl games in Berlin in '93 and in Tokyo in '94.
"I don't like the false perceptions that are said about our football team and I don't like the false whispering campaign. But our focus right now is on football and on winning. We have a chance to be very good this year. Our team and Warren are going to be like me: I was raised to be a very spirited and tough man."

HEADLINE: THREE BIG UNIONS ARE SET TO MERGE, CREATING A GIANT

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
In the face of the American labor movement's long-skidding fortunes, three of the nation's biggest industrial unions -- the steel workers, the automobile workers and the machinists -- declared today that they would merge. They invited other unions to join them.
The merger announced today will take five years to complete, the unions' leaders said, but the result will be a two-million-member behemoth. Together these unions' wage gains of the 1950's and 1960's led American blue-collar workers into the middle class. Now these workers are losing ground to inflation, cuts in benefits, and the shrinkage of manufacturing industries. 
 But there is little evidence yet that a General Motors will buckle any faster to a bigger union than it will to the auto workers alone, or that the unions will find it easy to blend their vast administrative organizations without the kinds of layoffs and anger associated with the contraction of a company.
"I'm so excited about this it almost brings tears to my eyes," said a man better known for his brawn and bravado, George Becker, 66, president of the United Steel Workers of America. "These are very turbulent days for trade unions in America." He added, "Workers want somebody to protect them, to stand up and fight for them."
Mr. Becker, who represents 700,000 workers, joined Samuel P. Yokich, 59, president of the 800,000-member United Automobile Workers, and George J. Kourpias, 63, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, with nearly 500,000 members, in announcing the agreement at a news conference here.
Dissident leaders within organized labor cheered the announcement. Dave Yettaw of Flint, Mich., president of the largest General Motors local and co-chairman of a campaign to reorganize the auto workers, said, "I'm pleased to see this."
He noted that the three unions had a fund of more than $1 billion to use for strikes and organizing. "That's a lot of money to muscle around," he said.
The agreement is a striking new development in a summer of turmoil for a labor movement that for decades has resisted the changes sweeping other big institutions, like the admission of women and minorities to leadership.
"As far as I can tell, this is unprecedented," said Peter Feuille, director of the Institute of Industrial Relations at the University of Illinois. "These are not three little bitty struggling unions that need a bigger union to gobble them up and give them safe haven." Still, he warned that unions were much harder to bond than businesses and that the accord could crumble.
Richard W. Hurd, director of labor studies at Cornell University, said, "In all these union mergers, they often end up talking about who's going to get what position and what the salaries will be." For the three leaders, however, that issue is moot. All will have retired by the merger's scheduled completion.
Unions -- and in particular their umbrella organization, the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations -- tend to deny their declining influence or blame others, primarily Republican Presidents.
President Ronald Reagan, for example, fired striking air traffic controllers in the early 1980's, an act that set a precedent in industry, and Republicans in Congress have blocked attempts to prohibit the practice.
"The Contract With America," Mr. Yokich said, referring to the Republicans' current political agenda, "means the contract on the workers of America."
Still, unions cannot ignore numbers that suggest trouble within labor's leadership. The number of workers who belong to unions has shrunk from nearly a quarter of the labor force in the 1950's to less than 16 percent today.
With diminished membership has come diminished clout. Employers routinely threaten to fire workers who try to form unions or strike, so the number of strikes has collapsed from an average of 352 in the 1950's to fewer than 50 a year since 1987.
As strikes have diminished so have wages. In terms of what they will buy, workers' average wages have been falling for 22 years.
Many analysts attribute labor's decline as much to a failure to organize new workers, especially in the fast growing service and retail industries, as to a hostile political climate. The three merging unions have won members outside their base industries: About 62 percent of the U.A.W.'s members work outside the automobile industry, for example. But the diversification has only helped slow the fall of membership.
The merger, Mr. Hurd, said, "has the potential to be very important if they can use it to shake up enough institutionally and get new resources into organizing."
"That's the key question for the future," he said, adding that at present unions were locked into "a certain institutional rigidity."
In addition, a single, merged union would have more resources to try to organize workers, and would eliminate the waste of money and manpower that comes from competing to enlist employees at the same company. A year ago, for example, the machinists and the steel workers went after 8,000 workers at USAir, a campaign that the machinists ultimately won.
The merger announced today seems part of a trend. It follows two smaller mergers this summer -- the steel workers' absorption of the impoverished United Rubber Workers of America and the combination of the two proud old New York unions, the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union and the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union.
Currently more than 80 national unions represent about 17 million workers. With 2.2 million members, just one labor organization, the National Education Association, is larger than the group announced today, but not all of its members are covered by collective bargaining agreements. It is now in the throes of merger discussions with the American Federation of Teachers.
Mr. Becker, Mr. Yokich and Mr. Kourpias are also leaders of an effort to topple the current leadership of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., whose member unions represent 13.3 million of all unionized workers.
They and the heads of several big service unions forced the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, 73-year-old Lane Kirkland, to abandon his attempt to run for another two-year term in elections in October. They also have declined to support his longtime deputy and heir apparent, Secretary-Treasurer Thomas R. Donahue, who will be 67 by October. Mr. Kirkland and Mr. Donahue, both erudite men and career-long administrators, have presided over the federation for 16 years.
The leaders of the auto workers, the steel workers and the machinists, along with the heads of several other of the nation's biggest unions, have aligned instead behind the John J. Sweeney, 61, president of the big Service Employees International Union, one of the few in the federation that has been growing.
Next week, Mr. Kirkland will officially resign, and the executive council of the federation, made up of the heads of most large unions, will meet in Chicago and appoint Mr. Donahue to complete Mr. Kirkland's term without opposition from Mr. Sweeney. That will come at the federation's convention in New York in October, when all member unions will elect three top officers.
Whatever their differences with Mr. Sweeney, Mr. Kirkland and Mr. Donahue saluted the merger. In a joint statement, they said: "The step taken today by three great unions to join forces sends a powerful message. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. congratulates them on their solidarity."
An hour before the news conference today, the merger announcement was approved at a breakfast attended by representatives of the three unions. There were three tables, one for each union, arranged in a triangle to show that no one of the unions will control the new organization.

HEADLINE: A Joining of Three Varied Old Warriors

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
Putting to rest the once-fierce division in labor ranks that time has made irrelevant, a merger of the auto workers, the steel workers and the machinists, if it takes place, will unite three still powerful if diminished unions with colorful, varied histories.
The steel and auto unions were formed during the Depression-driven rush to organize entire industries in the 1930's; the machinists, in contrast, trace their roots to the last century, when highly skilled mechanics who kept the railroads running organized themselves along craft lines. 
 During the labor wars of the 1920's and 1930's, the craft unions, gathered in the American Federation and Labor, stood largely aloof from the efforts to organize whole sectors of the economy regardless of craft.
As a result, both the auto and steel unions were organized with the help of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, headed during the 1930's by the formidable John L. Lewis. The two organizations have long since joined, leaving little distinction today between a craft worker and an industrial worker.
Although Mr. Lewis was instrumental in organizing both the steel and auto unions, he left distinctly different marks on them.
The first president of the steel union, Philip Murray, came from Mr. Lewis's coal miners union and concentrated power largely at the top, in coal miner tradition. Individual workers had little to say about the contracts that regulated their income and working conditions for decades, although in recent years the steel union has become more democratic.
The same thing might have happened in the auto union but for the presence of a self-taught machinist named Walter Reuther. Mr. Reuther, president of the union from 1946 until his death in an airplane crash in 1970, believed in democracy and institutionalized it in the union.
In the auto union, the rank and file have voted on contracts since Mr. Reuther's rise, and the individual members vote for the delegates to the convention that selects the union's top officers.
Both the steel and auto unions were organized only after bitter violence.
Early attempts to organize steel workers at what became U.S. Steel's sprawling plant at Homestead, Pa., were met at first with armies of Pinkerton guards who tried to drive the workers out of the plant. When the workers, firing a Civil War-era cannon loaded with scrap, defeated the Pinkertons, the company's management persuaded Pennsylvania's Governor to call out the state militia to break the union.
The automobile companies were similarly resistant to organization. Even after the passage of laws giving workers the right to organize, the companies riddled their plants with spies to identify union sympathizers, who were promptly fired.
When Mr. Reuther and some aides tried to hand leaflets to workers at the gate of the Ford Motor Company's sprawling manufacturing complex in Dearborn, Mich., the company sent out a squad of enforcers who battered the union men.
They did so despite the presence of news photographers. The images of a bloodied Mr. Reuther and the others became famous in labor circles, and the incident is known as the "battle of the overpass."
Other fighting occurred in Flint, Mich., which was the hub of manufacturing operations for the General Motors Corporation. The company accounted for 80 percent of the jobs in the city and dominated its political institutions, police and courts.
In early 1937, the union began a series of sit-down strikes in Flint, seizing control of plants and demanding that the company recognize the union as the bargaining agent for workers. At first the company tried to use the Flint police to dislodge the strikers inside.
The police tried firing tear gas through the windows but were driven off by workers firing hinges and other metal objects from slingshots made of tire tubes. When the strikes spread, G.M. tried to emulate the Pennsylvania experience by asking the Governor, Frank Murphy, to use National Guard troops to take control of the plants.
It was only when Mr. Murphy refused that the company relented and signed its first contract with the United Auto Workers.
After World War II, the steel and auto industries largely dropped their hostility to the unions so they could participate in the great consumer goods boom of the 1950's and 1960's. It was during this time that the auto and steel unions, in competition with each other, extracted wages that made their members among the best-paid industrial workers in the world.
Fringe benefits that now seem commonplace, like cost-of-living pay adjustments, pensions, medical insurance and paid vacations, were won, as the companies usually calculated that the increased cost would be less damaging than the loss of production to a strike.
That good life began unraveling in the 1970's, when cheap steel from efficient overseas mills and domestic mini-mills began taking sales from the established mills and motorists found that cars made in Japan went a long way on a little gasoline and were not as trouble-prone as Detroit products.
Meanwhile, deregulation of the airlines and the collapse of some carriers has put pressure on the machinists union. And the shrinking of the defense industry will have an adverse impact on both the auto and machinists unions, which represent workers in aircraft and components factories.

New Jobs, But Low-Paid

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: LIVINGSTON

 BODY:
New Jersey will gain nearly as many new jobs this year as last year (1.6 percent, compared with 1.7 percent), despite the continuing loss of manufacturing jobs, economic forecasters from Rutgers University said yesterday. The catch, though, is that many of the new jobs are in the lower-paid retail and service industries, said Norman J. Glickman, director of the university's Center for Urban Policy Research.

HEADLINE: We Won't Get Far Without Affirmative Action;
A Backward Move

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I applaud President Clinton for taking a strong position to uphold affirmative action. Republican attempts to dismantle this program designed to achieve equal opportunity for minorities and women in the work force is mean-spirited and antithetical to the aims of what we claim America to be as a democracy. 
 While former Communist nations struggle to achieve America's standard of equality and fairness, we are moving backward in race relations. Affirmative action provides people an opportunity to get in the door and should be strengthened, not abolished.
In the 1980's the Republicans abused their economic power. The result is a suffering economy and angst among many people, especially white men, that they will be jobless.
The Republicans have almost bankrupted our nation, our concept of a democracy and faith in our political establishment.
Racism is becoming as mean as it was several decades ago. If we want to improve our country, we cannot get caught up in language of quotas or preferential treatment. Such words are dangerous and impede our country's progress. Through affirmative action we can challenge injustices and move forward as a nation.

HEADLINE: We Won't Get Far Without Affirmative Action;
Not a Recompense

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Andrew Sullivan (Op-Ed, July 23) is right on some points. The criteria for affirmative action should not be racial. There is no valid reason for giving the children of black or Hispanic (not to mention Asian) academics or business executives or upper-echelon government officials or high-ranking military officers preference in hiring or admission to postsecondary education over those of working-class whites. 
 Nor should affirmative action be seen as a recompense for past wrongs. Those political leaders, white or black, who justify it on this basis are making a grave mistake. Affirmative action can be justified only as a means of giving everyone an equal chance at success.
However, when Mr. Sullivan defines the liberalism he upholds as "the only creed that can recognize and repulse the ethnic, collective urges that are darkening the Old World," I must part company with him.
It is part of people's nature as social animals that they sort themselves out into groupings according to various indexes -- purely biological at the early stages of development; ethnic, religious, linguistic, political or economic at later ones. Mr. Sullivan for some reason perceives these normal manifestations of human social nature as negative phenomena to be struggled against and if possible overcome.
He seems to envision a future world of dissociated human beings governed by some social equivalent of the laws of quantum mechanics -- individual human atoms, each one revolving in his or her private orbit, with no relationship with or obligation to anyone else, save those arising from freely concluded contracts.
As a person disabled from birth, dependent on the help of others in living from day to day in accomplishing whatever I accomplish (dependent, as all of us are, except that some are sometimes in a position to deny or ignore this dependence, as I never am), I find this prospect not only unattractive but grotesque. I find it, in a word, not liberating at all, but a prospect of slavery, misery and self-deception.

HEADLINE: Man Is Killed In Park Area Along Hudson

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
A man who appeared to be in his 50's was shot and killed in the middle of the afternoon yesterday in Riverside Park, and his body -- with a single bullet hole in the forehead -- was discovered sprawled beneath a park bench.
 Even though the shooting occurred between 91st and 92d Street in a section of the park usually filled in the afternoon with joggers and families, investigators said they were having difficulty finding reliable witnesses, and they did not know last night who the man was or why he was killed. 
 The victim, who had no wallet and no identification, was discovered beneath a bench on an asphalt walkway that runs along the Hudson River and becomes a dirt path about 10 feet from where the body lay.
 Parks enforcement officers on a routine patrol found the body at about 3:30 P.M. and called the police, who pronounced the man dead 20 minutes later. They said he had been shot about 3 P.M.
The police said the man appeared to be Hispanic and was dressed in a black T-shirt, black tennis shoes and faded blue jeans, with his pockets empty except for two dollar bills.
 "Nobody was seen running away," said Detective Thomas Barnes of the 24th Precinct, who added that despite the absence of a wallet, he did not think that the man had been robbed because his pockets were not turned inside out and there were no marks to indicate that rings or chains had been ripped off.
 "But we're not discounting anything at this point," he said. "We have no motive at this time."
 Mark DeKornic, a 39-year-old unemployed man who frequents the park, said he heard the shooting and had been questioned by the police, but officers said later that they were skeptical of some elements of his account. Mr. DeKornic said he told the police he had been walking along the pavement south of the shooting site when he heard a sound. "It sounded like a cap gun," he said. "One shot went off."
 "There was a bunch of high school kids down here," he continued. "It was like they were shooting a bird. I saw birds scatter." He also said he had seen two teen-age boys running away from the scene, but investigators were unsure about that assertion.
 Detective Barnes said investigators were trying to find another person, who either saw the shooting or heard it and was questioned by parks enforcement officers but left before the police arrived.
 Officer Joseph Shields, one of the first to arrive after parks employees called 911, said he did not believe that the shooting victim had been homeless. "He doesn't look like a homeless guy," he said. "He looks very clean. His clothes looked clean."
 Several people interviewed yesterday on the path near the site of the shooting, where the body remained for several hours, said they did not recognize the man. Others who passed by later said they did not know of anyone fitting the victim's description who frequented that part of the park.
 Many said they were shocked by such a shooting in a place where they feel safe strolling even at night and where they cannot remember a recent crime more violent than a mugging.
 "This happens in Brooklyn," said Bernard Skinner, 28, a pathology technician at Kings County Hospital Center who recently moved to West End Avenue. "But I'm surprised this happened here. I walk out here at midnight."
 In April last year, a 40-year-old woman was sexually assaulted while walking in the park near 89th Street at 2 A.M. Two weeks before that incident, another woman was attacked, but she fended off her assailant with an ice pick.

HEADLINE: Disney's Deal: A special report.;
A Mix of Glamour and Hardball Won Disney a Piece of 42d Street

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

 BODY:
It was 3 o'clock one morning in late 1993, when Frank S. Ioppolo Sr. decided he had had enough.
As the chief real estate negotiator for the Walt Disney Company, he had been meeting with New York City and state officials through the night about his company's interest in restoring the decrepit New Amsterdam Theater on 42d Street. But after several hours of trying to persuade the public officials to absorb more of the project's costs, Mr. Ioppolo grew incensed. 
 Snatching up documents and throwing them into his briefcase, he angrily declared that the company's interest in renovating the theater was dead. "That's it," he said, according to a person who was at the meeting. "We're finished."
Actually, they were not. A few weeks later, after the two sides reconciled, Disney got what it wanted. The city and state agreed to provide the company with low-interest loans to cover more than 75 percent of the $34 million restoration, in addition to other concessions.
Mr. Ioppolo's walkout and threat to call the deal off is a vivid example of how Disney wielded its power and influence to secure a set of economic incentives -- far beyond what other companies involved in the 42d Street project are getting -- before it finally committed itself to rebuilding the New Amsterdam.
In the eyes of city and state officials, the largess made perfect sense. To them, the company's decision to take on the New Amsterdam, announced with great fanfare last week, is the linchpin in their long and often frustrating effort to transform 42d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues from a shadowy strip of rundown theaters and sex shops into a boulevard of bright lights and tourist attractions.
With the move, Disney not only gets a home to produce musical spectacles, but it also gets a low-risk way of testing the urban entertainment market -- an area where the company is cautiously exploring opportunities. As in Las Vegas, where casino officials have said Disney is searching for a way into the gambling business without tarnishing its clean image, the company's move onto 42d Street was brokered in a way that protects its reputation, yet creates future growth opportunities.
"The city and state have made it easy for Disney to go there," said C. Bradley Mendelson, a New York real estate broker who has worked with companies involved in the project. "If Disney is successful, it will be a great deal for the city too. But if it is not successful, Disney can say it's because the city didn't create a good environment."
The players and methods used in business negotiations at Disney are rarely revealed. But interviews with government officials, development experts and Disney's real estate executives help illustrate not only how Disney was able to get substantial government subsidies for the New Amsterdam, but also how the company has influenced several other projects that are planned for 42d Street.
For example, Disney officials forced the city to find other family-oriented entertainment companies before finally committing to the New Amsterdam project, and they used their leverage to help determine which other companies should be a part of the project. Disney officials even requested -- albeit unsuccessfully -- a first right of refusal for every property on the street, which would have allowed them to match any offer, from any company.
Although the city paid to condemn sites that other companies will develop, Disney is the only one that has been offered public money to subsidize its costs. Other firms are unhappy that they have not received the same treatment. Viacom, for example, wants to develop production studios for its MTV unit on the block, but the government's refusal to provide subsidies has stalled those talks.
While the city and state expect to get about $600,000 a year from Disney in interest, rent and revenue sharing, the return on the public's investment in Disney's New Amsterdam is minimal. But if all goes according to plan, the real return will come in the jobs and tax revenues generated by other companies that gravitate toward Disney.
"I'm not going to claim we'll get a market return on the deal," said Clay Lifflander, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, which played a key role in the talks. "But we subsidized it to get the other activity on the street. In the retail business, it's what you call a loss leader."
 
The Disney Style
A Fuzzy Image, A Lion's Heart
 The New Amsterdam, a fabled theater that opened in 1903 and was once home to the Ziegfeld Follies, was in pathetic shape when it was bought by the state for $247,000 in 1992. There was water damage from holes in the roof, the smell of urine in the air, dead cats in the basement and mushrooms sprouting out of the main floor.
While other potential developers were scared off by the condition of the theater, Disney executives were keeping a close eye on the property. One of Disney's board members, Robert A. M. Stern, in fact, created the guidelines for much of the Times Square redevelopment.
But they were also concerned about the theater's condition. Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chief executive, who first toured the theater in the spring of 1993, told the New York officials that the extensive work required on the theater made it necessary to include public dollars in the project. Otherwise, it could not be done properly and profitably.
Public officials were elated at the prospect of Disney bringing its wholesome image to the nation's most notorious red-light zone. They readily agreed that public subsidies would be necessary before Disney or anyone else would take on the theater restoration.
"Disney brought to the table, all by themselves, the possibility that the project would get done, and that it would be done by the most important entertainment company in the world," said Rebecca Robertson, head of the 42d Street Development Corporation.
But local officials were about to learn, firsthand, that beneath Disney's warm and fuzzy image was a real estate developer with a lion's heart. Since the time that Walt Disney began buying land in California and Florida, the company has leveraged its glamour to control business negotiations and squeeze concessions from property owners and local governments eager to latch on to the Disney name.
Disney's development negotiators "are very good," said Mr. Lifflander, the president of the city's economic development agency. "They're clever and brilliant. They don't miss a single opportunity."
 
The Players
Two Deal Makers Take the Lead
 To begin discussing terms on the New Amsterdam, in the summer of 1993, Mr. Eisner dispatched David A. Malmuth, vice president of Disney's development unit. Mild-mannered and boyish-looking, the 40-year-old Mr. Malmuth was well suited to project Disney's neighborly image.
In the Disney organization and in Mr. Malmuth, the New York officials may have had something working to their advantage from the very beginning. The company was still smarting after losing a public battle to develop a historic theme park in Virginia, and real estate prices had also forced Disney to scale back plans to expand its Disneyland theme park.
Likewise, Mr. Malmuth had devoted two years to head up a plan to develop a theme park on the waterfront in Long Beach, Calif., and that project had been recently scrapped after fierce opposition from environmentalists.
So by the time he arrived in New York to discuss 42d Street, Mr. Malmuth was hungry for a big victory. "I'd committed to myself that I was not going to invest another two years of my life to a project that wasn't going to go forward," he said in a recent interview.
Though Mr. Malmuth was officially in charge of the talks, Mr. Ioppolo clearly took the lead in negotiations. A shrewd deal maker, the 53-year-old Mr. Ioppolo is a former senior partner and head of the real estate practice of the New York law firm Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Irvine. Among his clients was the New York State Urban Development Corporation, whose representatives he would now face from the other side of the table.
"He knew how deals got put together by the state," Mr. Malmuth said of Mr. Ioppolo. "He knew what they would and wouldn't do."
Like a classic pair of good and bad cops, Mr. Ioppolo's contentious style contrasted sharply with Mr. Malmuth's amicable demeanor, according to people who were involved in the talks. As one city official, who would only comment anonymously, said: "David was more enthusiastic, and Frank, as the quality control lawyer, played the skeptical role."
Through months of difficult and sometimes acrimonious talks, the two Disney representatives wrung concessions from the city and state. In addition to the government subsidies, the executives also requested that Disney be protected against any lawsuits involving the project. After a protracted fight, the city and state gave in.
 
The Demands
Haggling Over Stage Drapes
 Another contentious issue involved Disney's plans for top-quality theater production materials, like the latest sound and lighting systems. Although the city and state agreed to help pay for what could be considered "Broadway standard," Disney wanted more expensive custom-quality items.
For example, the stage drape that Disney intends to install costs $10,000 more than the one that the public officials were willing to help pay for. Such excess costs, or "scope items," as they were called during the talks, were Disney's full responsibility, so there was constant bickering over whether an item was Broadway standard or scope.
When negotiations started, Disney had no firsthand experience on Broadway. But all that changed in April 1994, when "Beauty and the Beast" made its debut at the Palace Theater. Soaring box office sales solidified Disney's desire to make the New Amsterdam project a reality. "The more 'Beauty' would be successful, the more we sparked to the idea of the New Amsterdam," Mr. Iopollo said.
During frenzied negotiations on New Year's Eve 1994, the city and state struck an agreement to provide Disney with a $21 million loan, at 3 percent interest payable over 30 years. Still several weeks later, the company began pushing for more money from taxpayers. Reluctantly, public officials agreed to an additional $5 million loan, payable at 3.5 percent over 30 years. With those terms, Disney would use $8 million of its own money to meet the $34 million budgeted for the project.
But then a few weeks ago, when final cost estimates came in excess of $34 million, Disney asked to return to the negotiating table. Finally, hours before last week's announcement, the two sides came up with a plan under which Disney, the city and state would share evenly any additional costs over $32.5 million.
The final terms also call for Disney to pay an additional $2 million for "scope items," and the city and state have to provide a $1.9 million contingency fund for unforeseen costs.
For its part, the city and state will collect 2 percent of the New Amsterdam's revenues, up to the first $20 million annually, and 3 percent above that figure. In addition, Disney will pay a small percentage of revenues in rent plus an additional sum in lieu of annual taxes.
Given the interest that is being paid on the loan to Disney and current market rates, public officials estimate the net value of the government's subsidy is about 35 percent of the project's total cost.
 
'They Were Tough'
Exerting Influence Down the Block
 Although they gave up a lot, the city and state negotiators held their ground on some of Disney's demands. For example, the two sides fought over a request by Disney that it have the right to match any offer that the city and state received to develop other property on the street. Fearful that such an exclusive right would chill interest from other companies, the public officials rejected Disney's request.
Still, the Disney executives exerted influence up and down the block. Mr. Malmuth introduced state officials to executives of American Multi-Cinema, a nationwide movie chain that has worked with Disney on other development projects and is also the largest distributor of Disney movies.
Mr. Malmuth said he told A.M.C. executives that a multiplex on 42d Street is "a hell of an idea if you do it right."
"Don't go in there and do it with just six screens," he told them. As a result, A.M.C. has an agreement to open a 25-screen theater on the street.
Disney officials also held conversations with officials of Madame Tussaud's, the London wax museum that also recently reached an agreement to open an attraction on the street. "I spoke to people in their development company and I spoke with Michael Eisner," said Martin King, Tussaud's general manager for new business development. Disney was "a factor in our negotiations," he said.
Disney's power was also apparent when the city and state selected a developer for a $303 million hotel and entertainment complex on the street. Although the Marriott Corporation was proposing to build a hotel with its own financing and was prepared to start immediately, Tishman Realty & Construction had Disney on its side.
Disney officials worked closely with Tishman, a construction company in Manhattan, helping to select the hotel's architect, and Mr. Eisner himself even met with the architect to discuss the hotel's design. Disney would also be the main tenant in the retail and entertainment area of the complex.
On May 11 of this year, Tishman won the competition. "We feel that the Disney name was most important to the people who were making the decision," said Susan Katz, president of Triarc Equities Corporation, Marriott's partner in its failed proposal.
In addition to the entertainment that Disney plans for the hotel site, the company also has the option to use part of the building to sell time-share units for its growing vacation club. And the company is also scheduled to open a new Disney Store a few doors east of the New Amsterdam in 1996.
With all the pieces that have been put together thus far, Disney can stage entertainment at the hotel, have motion pictures produced by Disney Studios playing at the A.M.C. theaters, provide time shares for Disney Vacation Club members, have a Disney musical running at the New Amsterdam and cash registers ringing up T-shirts and mouse ears at the Disney Store -- all at the same time, on the same midtown block.
Looking back at the two years of negotiations, public officials said that in many instances they had little choice but to acquiesce to the company's demands. After all, Disney was offering the first real opportunity -- in nearly two decades of trying -- to actually jump-start development on the moribund street, they said.
"They were tough negotiators," said Charles A. Gargano, who as chairman of the state's economic development agency. "When you're dealing from a position of strength, you can negotiate hard."

HEADLINE: Hanoi Joins a Club Created to Blackball It

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, July 28

 BODY:
Vietnam was admitted today to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the first Communist nation granted membership since it was founded 28 years ago, in part as a bulwark against Communism.
The admission of Vietnam is a critical step in Hanoi's integration into a region that includes most of Asia's fastest-growing economies. Its membership was formalized at a ceremony in which the Vietnamese flag was raised at the association's annual ministerial meeting, in Brunei. 
 The association, known by the acronym Asean, was founded in 1967, at the height of the Vietnam War, to promote political and economic solidarity among the non-Communist nations of the region.
But today it seems well on its way to becoming a partnership of all 10 nations in the area. The association has emerged as the premier diplomatic grouping for the region, and it has championed the creation of a free-trade area early in the next decade.
Only Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, formerly Burma, are not yet full members, and their inclusion appears to be only a matter of time. The military junta that runs Myanmar announced on Monday that it would take the first step toward membership.
Vietnam and its non-Communist neighbors still have broad ideological differences. But the other members appear willing to overlook them for now in hopes of cooperation in trade and investment.
Vietnam's rapid economic growth -- about 8.8 percent in 1994 -- and an educated, low-wage work force have made it an attractive market for foreign investors, especially since the United States ended the trade embargo it imposed at the end of the war.
At today's ceremony, Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Manh Cam, signed the association's membership declaration as foreign ministers of the other member nations watched. "You are just across the water from us, and for too long we have been distant strangers," Foreign Minister Mohamed Bolkiah of Brunei told the Vietnamese.
It has been a heady summer of diplomatic triumphs for Vietnam, which won full recognition from the United States earlier this month. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is to participate in the summit talks in Brunei next week and then travel to Hanoi, the first American Secretary of State to visit Vietnam in 25 years.

HEADLINE: On Issue of Family Values, Clinton Unveils an Agenda of His Own

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
Synthesizing many of his recent positions into a platform to compete with the reigning conservative manifestos, President Clinton today outlined a 14-point "American Family Values Agenda" ranging from a higher minimum wage to a national crusade against teen-age pregnancy.
Mr. Clinton made clear that he would not let the Republicans alone define family values. He outlined measures that he said would help families grapple with the economic and social problems they face, proposals for the preservation and expansion of gun-control laws, for instance, and for moderate increases in health insurance coverage. 
 "Families do not eat and breathe and sleep political slogans," Mr. Clinton said in an address to a conference of the American Federation of Teachers, the nation's second-largest teachers union.
In the first direct indication that he plans a campaign against tobacco use by young people, Mr. Clinton included a battle against teen-age smoking in his list. "If you want to cut health care costs and increase life expectancy, do something to stop all these kids who are beginning to smoke at early ages," he said.
Mr. Clinton was greeted with a standing ovation by the several thousand convention delegates gathered at a Washington hotel who clapped and chanted, "Four more years."
"I must say I enjoyed the class being a little rowdy this afternoon," Mr. Clinton joked.
The President did not make any direct comparison of his own agenda for family values with the House Republicans' Contract With America or the Christian Coalition's 10-point plan called the "Contract With American Families."
But since last November's Republican sweep of Congress, Mr. Clinton has been searching for some formulation of his own to pose against the Contract With America's 10 planks and the emphasis placed on cultural issues by the Republican Presidential contenders.
While agreeing with Republicans that Americans have to take more responsibility for themselves, he said that many of their problems stemmed from economic woes that government should help address.
"We don't have to have a partisan, divisive fight about family values," Mr. Clinton said. "And we don't have to argue whether we need improvements in personal conduct or political policies and economic policies. The truth is, we need a whole bunch of both."
Borrowing the language of the right though not its policy prescriptions, he said, "What we really need is an American family values agenda." He then rattled off 14 points, many of which were calls for protection of existing Government programs and Administration initiatives against cuts by the Republican Congress. He called for an end to cuts in environmental programs, supported public broadcasting and called for the preservation of a law that gives employees the right to family medical leaves from work.

HEADLINE: Blue-Chip Stocks Decline As Investors Take Profits

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks fell yesterday as investors took profits after the week's earnings-driven rally.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed off 17.26 points at 4,715.51, but ended the week with a gain of 73.96 points. 
 In the broader market, declining issues led advancing ones by 1,148 to 1,106 on volume of 311.6 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.29 points, to 562.93. The Nasdaq index ended 5.38 points lower at 1,005.28 after closing at a record 1,010.66 on Thursday.
Analysts said weakness in the bond market also put pressure on stocks. The 30-year bond dropped 25/32 , or $7.81 for $1,000 of bonds, to a price of 1094/32 and a yield of 6.90 percent, up from 6.84 percent on Thursday.
One reason that bonds fell was a rise in the University of Michigan's July consumer sentiment index to an unexpectedly strong 94.4 from 92.7 in June. Traders took it as an indication that the Federal Reserve would not be easing rates again soon.
"Today, good news was bad news," said Marshall Acuff, portfolio strategist at Smith Barney. "The confidence survey indicated consumers are inclined to buy more going forward." He predicted that stocks would remain volatile.
"The day-to-day profit reports and day-to-day indicators are going to bring a more volatile period for a while than in the first half" of the year, he said.
The market will face a host of economic reports next week, including those for personal income and consumption, the National Association of Purchasing Management index, leading indicators, and new-home sales.
Among individual issues, James River climbed 7 1/4 yesterday, to 33, in heavy trading after the maker of paper tissues announced a restructuring plan. Analysts upgraded the stock.
The Bank of Boston was up 2 1/8 at 43 3/4 after the abrupt departure of its chief executive, Ira Stepanian, late Thursday raised hopes that new leadership would finally result in a successful merger for the bank.
Computer Associates rose 2 3/8, to 72 1/4, after the Justice Department approved its much-delayed deal to buy Legent, whose shares rose 2 11/16 , to 47 13/16 .
Microsoft fell 3 7/8, to 92 5/8, on speculation that the Justice Department would sue the company to block it from building access to its planned on-line service into its Windows 95 operating system software.
The American Stock Exchange index rose 0.49 point, to 522.07. The New York Stock Exchange composite index of all listed common stocks fell 0.75 point, to 301.38. The average share was down 9 cents.
In Tokyo, stocks managed to recoup early losses and finish a little higher yesterday, aided by arbitrage-linked buying in the late afternoon. However, trading was subdued as many investors were reluctant to take positions ahead of the weekend.
The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 24.26 points, or 0.15 percent, at 16,649.45 after falling as low as 16,434.07.

HEADLINE: U.S. Offers China 2 Olive Branches, but Not on Taiwan

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
Hoping to halt the deterioration in its relations with China, the Clinton Administration has offered two positive gestures but ruled out the one concession Beijing wants: a ban on all future visits to the United States by Taiwan's President.
On the positive side for the Chinese, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today that the Administration had decided not to impose punitive economic sanctions on China, at least not for the moment, for selling missile technology to Iran and Pakistan. 
 And in another move that Beijing is likely to view favorably, President Clinton intends to send President Jiang Zemin a letter suggesting that they meet to work out their differences when he comes to the United States this fall, senior officials said.
Mr. Christopher made his remarks in a speech to the National Press Club that was intended to clarify the Administration's policy toward China before a meeting with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Brunei next week.
On the negative side for the Chinese, although Mr. Clinton's letter to President Jiang will affirm the Administration's commitment to its "one China" policy, it will not pledge to never again issue a visa to the Taiwan leader, Lee Teng-hui.
"The private visit by Lee Teng-hui was a special situation and a courtesy, consistent with American values and opinion," Mr. Christopher said, referring to Mr. Lee's private visit to Cornell University in June. "It did not constitute a shift in our policy toward Taiwan and China."
But asked whether the United States would rule out giving another visa to Mr. Lee, whose trip worsened relations between Beijing and Washington, Mr. Christopher said, "No, the answer is it will not."
In a separate interview, he explained, "We're not prepared to say that some comparable circumstances might not arise."
Mr. Lee's visit to the United States set off an angry reaction in Beijing, with some Chinese officials reportedly convinced that Washington is determined to deprive China of its rightful place as a world power. Apparently in an expression of displeasure, China fired test missiles off its southern coast this month, and the Beijing press accused Mr. Lee of plotting with "some people" in the United States to declare Taiwan officially independent.
Mr. Lee has no announced plans to seek another visa to the United States. The United States received a message from the Taiwan Government today that he has decided to decline an invitation by Senator Frank H. Murkowski, the Alaskan Republican, to a meeting on United States-Taiwan trade in Anchorage in September, a senior State Department official said.
The letter from Mr. Clinton to Mr. Jiang will also include the invitation for a meeting this fall, possibly in New York during celebration of the United Nations' 50th anniversary.
Mr. Clinton may go further than that. He told recent visitors to the White House that in principle he would like to invite Mr. Jiang for a state visit to Washington as one way out of the crisis, participants in the meeting said.
But there is a disagreement in the Administration about whether to invite Mr. Jiang to Washington, a gesture the Chinese have long sought.
Some officials believe that the Chinese would reject the offer since it would come on the heels of the visit by Taiwan's President; others are convinced that that the visit would not produce tangible progress on issues like human rights, and that Mr. Clinton would be criticized for being soft on the Chinese.
In any case, a visit to Washington would be politically impossible unless the Chinese released Harry Wu, the Chinese-American human rights advocate who has been charged with espionage. In his speech today, Mr. Christopher demanded Mr. Wu's immediate release.
There is also a deep division in the Administration about whether Hillary Rodham Clinton should proceed with plans to take part in the United Nations women's conference in Beijing next month.
As for the decision to avoid imposing sanctions on China for its weapons-related exports, Mr. Christopher said, "At the present time, although there is a fairly large body of evidence, we do not think there is the evidence there that would justify the imposition of sanctions."
Other Administration officials said the decision was based on the failure of intelligence agencies to agree on whether the Chinese deliveries constitute a violation of an international accord that bans the transfer of certain types of missiles and technology.
In the interview, Mr. Christopher said he sought in April to telegraph to the Chinese Foreign Minister that the official policy of barring entry by Taiwan's top leaders was rapidly being eroded by Congress.
"I tried my best to signal to him that the Congressional mood was a very serious problem," Mr. Christopher said. "I told him I pressed on the Taiwan situation several times, and I failed to persuade anyone that I had talked to."
But his warning was lost on Mr. Qian, who reported back to the ruling Politburo an ironclad reassurance he felt he had received.
"He said, 'I was assured a visa would not be issued,' " a recent American visitor to China paraphrased Mr. Qian as saying. "He said, 'Imagine what I thought and what was thought of me when the visa was granted.' "

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Falling U.S. Bonds Drag Down The Dollar Against the Mark

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against the German mark yesterday, dragged down by a decline in American bond prices.
A report indicating an upswing in consumer confidence prompted the selloff in Treasury securities. Falling bond prices hurt the dollar because when foreign investors sell American bonds, they convert much of the dollar proceeds into their own currencies. 
 "The bond selloff undermined the dollar a little bit," said Stephen Jury, chief currency dealer at the Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.
A drop in American stocks also weighed on the dollar. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 17.26 points, to 4,715.51.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.3807 marks from 1.3833 marks on Thursday. But the dollar was steady against the yen, at 88.11 yen, up from 88.10 yen.
"The dollar is showing some life against the yen," said Bob Gruber, senior currency salesman at Chemical Bank. With Japanese banks still facing huge losses and Japan's economy teetering on the edge of recession, "U.S. fund managers are lined up to buy dollars," he said.
Lingering speculation that Japanese interest rates will be cut soon helped bolster the dollar against the yen during Tokyo trading. Japanese overnight money rates have fallen close to the record low of 0.75 percent they set earlier in July, spurring talk that the Bank of Japan could soon trim its discount rate, which is already at a record low of 1 percent.
Lower rates hurt the yen by making bank deposits denominated in the currency less attractive.
"The market is once again gearing up for a cut in rates in Japan," said Tim Fox, international economist at Credit Suisse in London. "Money market rates are already low, which is why the yen is weak."
Three-month yen deposits last yielded 0.81 percent, compared with 5.88 percent for three-month dollar deposits.
The dollar also received some support from the Commerce Department's report on the gross domestic product, which showed that the United States economy grew by only half a percentage point during the second quarter. The sluggish picture confirmed expectations that the Federal Reserve would not cut short-term interest rates for a second time this summer.

This is the ideal for anonymous sperm donors set by Russia's largest private infertility clinic. Such a man is hard to find. There are plenty of Russian men who have fathered two children. But the dearth of men who neither smoke nor drink nor sleep around is not only something Russian women have complained about for generations, it is now the lament of Russian infertility specialists. 
 "We don't get volunteers," said Dr. Valery M. Zdanovsky, director of the center, EKO, which opened five years ago. "We pay all our donors, and we never have enough."
The clinic, which pays donors about $15, screens them for venereal disease and AIDS. Smoking and drinking are mostly taken for granted. Patients' husbands and clinic employees are often pressed into service.
Clinics like EKO are facing a rising tide of infertile women. Most are married, but in the last few years, there have been more and more single, older women who want a baby and prefer an anonymous donor. They are ready to pay for treatments ranging from artificial insemination to in-vitro fertilization, techniques that until recently were little known in Russia and socially taboo. There are only 12 such fertility clinics in a country of 150 million, and demand is growing almost as fast as the Russian birth rate is declining.
Taboos are fading, but not as quickly. Dr. Zdanovsky said that his clinic treated more than 2,500 patients a year and that its success rate was close to 25 percent, the same as in Europe and the United States. But he added that he could not be sure of the figures, because so many of the clinic's patients, particularly those from the provinces, receive the treatments, go home and, desperate to keep their mission a secret, never call in again.
But some women are becoming more open about their quest. "I want a baby more than anything in the world," said Antonina Sokhach, 37, a social scientist from Chita, Siberia, who was at the clinic for her fourth attempt at in-vitro fertilization. She grew tearful talking about it. "All my money and strength are going to this," she said.
She said her husband, an Aeroflot pilot, left her after she became pregnant during her last treatment and miscarried after eight weeks. She seemed sanguine about joining the huge ranks of Russian single mothers, saying with a shrug, "Men are much weaker than women." If she becomes pregnant, she said, she plans to move from Siberia to her native Ukraine, where her mother and sister will help her raise the child.
"I don't want to know who the donor is, but I'm not worried," Mrs. Sokhach said with a smile. "The male genes alone do not determine the character of a child."
Mrs. Sokhach said she was not sure what had made her infertile, but blamed the winters. "I lived in western Siberia for 10 years," she said. "I think the cold prevented me from getting pregnant."
One of her doctors, Aleksandr S. Dogobetsky, said it was more likely that she suffered from pelvic inflammation, a result of two abortions.
Dr. Zdanovsky said one of the major causes of infertility in Russia was scarring caused by abortion, which is still one of the most common methods of birth control here. Some women have had as many as nine. In 1992 in Moscow, official statistics estimated that there were 300 abortions for every 100 live births.
There are no reliable statistics on infertility in Russia, but the birth rate, 1.4 million babies in 1993, is down a whopping 44 percent from 1983.
For several generations, economic circumstances have forced Russian women to have small families, often only one child. Now women in their late 30's and 40's are looking to new technologies for their last hope of a second child.
"My daughter is 22, and I was 18 when she was born," said a 40-year-old woman who quit working two years ago to be a housewife to her newly successful husband, a banker. "I want a second chance."
Treatment in Russia is not as expensive as in the West -- EKO charges about $600 for artificial insemination, and in-vitro is about $4,000 -- but it is too costly for the average Russian. EKO's waiting room was filled mostly with well-groomed professionals, but Dr. Zdanovksy said the clinic offered free treatment to widows, mothers of sons killed in combat and women who lost a child under the age of 16.
Almost all the medical equipment is made in the West. But the clinic has retained a Russian sense of privacy. There is one examining room with four beds with stirrups. Sperm donors make their contribution in an unlocked closet-sized room with fading nude pinups for company.
There are other things that might appear jarring in the West. Dr. Zdanovsky explained that when husbands are discovered to have a deficiency, they are invited to bring their brothers and cousins to provide sperm for artificial insemination of their in-law. "If the husband wishes, we do it without telling the wife that it is not her husband's sperm," he said. "We don't deceive her, really, because genetically, it is just like his sperm."
But he said he would never give a patient artificial insemination without informing the husband. "That," he said gravely, "would be lying."

HEADLINE: Growth Stalled In 2d Quarter, But Signs Point To Resumption

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
The economy barely grew over the last three months as companies chose to forgo expansion and instead sold off part of their backlogs of goods, the Commerce Department said today.
But traders and financial economists, together with Clinton Administration officials, shrugged off the announcement that gross domestic output rose by only half a percentage point during the second quarter. They pointed to signs over the last month that economic growth might gradually recover in the second half. 
 "April and May were clearly weak months, what people talked about as part of a bumpy soft landing," said Joseph E. Stiglitz, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. "The indicators that came out in June and July have been more upbeat."
Sales of goods and services to consumers and other end users actually rose at a strong annual pace of 2.1 percent in the second quarter, allowing stores and other businesses to clear their shelves quickly of excess goods. "Assuming that the inventory correction was well advanced in the second quarter, growth should resume a sluggish pace in the second half," said Rosanne M. Cahn, the chief economist for stocks at CS First Boston.
Martin N. Baily, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, predicted that the pace of growth would rise through the third quarter and reach an annual rate of around 2.5 percent by the end of the year. Most economists believe that the economy cannot grow faster than 2.5 or 3 percent a year without producing uncontrollable pressures for higher inflation.
Strong business investment and consumer spending compensated in the second quarter for the shrinkage in inventories, a continued drop in Federal spending, a dip in housing construction and a persistent trade deficit.
Congressional Republicans were the least enthusiastic about today's announcement, which could point to a fairly strong economy in 1996 that might help President Clinton's reelection campaign. Representative Jim Saxton, the New Jersey Republican who is the vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, said that the weakness during the second quarter justified a move to stimulate the economy by cutting taxes, shrinking the Government and eliminating regulations.
"Although economic growth may revive in the future, we are clearly seeing the indications of a soft economy," he said. "This soft economy is the result of President Clinton's 1993 tax increase and the unwise policies of the Federal Reserve."
The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates seven times over a 12-month period beginning on Feb. 4, 1994, in an effort to prevent brisk economic growth from leading to inflation. The central bank then shaved one of the short-term rates that it controls on July 6 in response to the economy's weakness in late spring.
Most private economists and many Administration officials have viewed the interest rate increases as necessary.
Mr. Stiglitz played down potential risks to the economy's health in the coming months, particularly the threat of a deep recession in Japan. While exports to Japan would fall if its economy slumped, these exports play such a small role in the United States economy that a 5 percent drop in Japanese economic output may trim economic growth in the United States only by a tenth of a percentage point, he said.
Many private economists have begun warning that a recession in the United States becomes ever more likely as the current economic expansion continues into its fifth year, but Mr. Stiglitz took issue with this view. Historical studies show that the odds of a recession in any given year of an economic recovery are unrelated to the number of years since the previous recession, he contended.
Today's statistics also provided further evidence that inflation was under control. The prices of goods and services produced in the second quarter, as measured by the gross domestic product deflator, showed a 1.3 percent inflation rate, the same as the fourth quarter of last year and below the first quarter pace of 2.2 percent. The fixed-weight price index for domestic purchases, which in contrast to the deflator does not reflect the changing composition of output, crept up at a pace of 2.9 percent, compared with a 3 percent rise in the first quarter.

Global Services Pact Concluded: Good News and Bad for the U.S.

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 28

 BODY:
The global pact covering financial services was concluded here today. And even though the Clinton Administration has declined to join the new agreement that liberalizes trade in financial services, American banks, insurance companies and brokerage houses still have a chance to obtain new business in fast-growing developing countries because of the pact.
At the same time, however, American money managers may now face increased competition in seeking to manage Japanese public and private pension funds, officials at the World Trade Organization said today. The funds have a total value of about $1 trillion. 
 The global pact will remain in effect until the end of 1997, when countries will be free to improve or withdraw the trade concessions they have offered.
The United States would not join the agreement because it said the pact did not require the buoyant economies of Asia and Latin America to open their markets to foreign financial companies quickly enough.
Nevertheless, the rules of the World Trade Organization require that trade concessions extended to one member country be extended to all other countries. The United States thus will become a so-called free rider, with its companies picking up benefits in foreign markets even though it has not made trade concessions of its own.
That will give American financial companies the opportunity to win new business in such quickly growing markets as Thailand, Brazil, the Philippines, Egypt and India.
A total of 43 countries, including the 15 members of the European Union, agreed today to offer foreign companies access to their financial services markets that was more extensive than the access they had promised when the negotiations to liberalize world trade concluded in December 1993. The 1993 accord was conducted under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The countries did so largely at the urging of the Clinton Administration, which had found their initial access offers insufficient -- and is still not satisfied with what they are offering.
Nineteen of the countries are offering foreign insurance companies better access to their markets, while 23 are lifting restrictions on foreign banks and 14 on foreign securities companies.
About 50 other countries, mainly developing nations with relatively unimportant financial service markets, left their original access offers unchanged.
The United States has said that foreign financial firms already in the country may stay and that European companies may make new investments because the European Union is offering American companies free access. But financial firms from elsewhere may be excluded from the United States unless their home countries offer reciprocal access.
Officials at the World Trade Organization said Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, India, Brazil and Egypt were among the countries that agreed to lift significant barriers to foreign banks and other financial companies.
Thailand will license five new foreign banks by 1997 and will allow seven foreign banks that now are restricted to offshore business to start taking domestic deposits and making domestic loans.
The Philippines plans to license 10 new foreign commercial banks between 1995 and 2000 and will allow all foreign banks as many as four branches. It will raise the ceiling on foreign ownership of domestic banks to 49 percent from 40 percent and grant free access to foreign insurance and reinsurance firms.
India will increase the number of new foreign banks it licenses to eight a year from five and will allow foreign brokerage firms to own as much as 49 percent of brokerage firms set up in the country. But India still has not agreed to scrap its state-owned insurance monopoly.
Brazil has promised to lift its constitutional ban on new foreign insurance companies, banks and brokerage firms within two years. It will allow foreigners to buy state-owned banks and other financial firms as they are privatized. And it will permit foreign-owned banks to install automatic teller machines.
Egypt is eliminating the 49 percent ceiling on foreign equity in insurance companies and will guarantee all foreign equity holdings in banks established before 1992.
Japan already allows American investment firms to manage pension funds in the country. Its main contribution to the liberalization of trade in financial services will be to expand that provision to cover money managers from all of the World Trade Organization's 103 member nations.
It will also end a restriction that had allowed American managers to handle only new pension money, permitting foreign managers to bid for the right to existing funds in their entirety.

HEADLINE: Rise in Consumer Optimism Sends Bond Prices Lower

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities, after holding steady yesterday on the release of weak data on second-quarter economic growth, fell when a report showed consumer sentiment was stronger than had been expected.
The University of Michigan's final consumer sentiment index for July rose to 94.4, from 92.7 in June. The Michigan index is a component of the Government's leading economic indicators, and is seen as a sign of future consumer spending for homes and durable goods. 
 "However, it's not merely a measure of whether people will spend, because they will continue to buy the necessities no matter how they feel, but it's a measure of their willingness to take on debt," said Elliott Platt, director of research at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "The better they feel, the more willing they are."
Bond prices also fell because of supply pressure, as traders pondered government, municipal and corporate plans to issue debt. Next week the Treasury will announce the size of its quarterly borrowing.
The 30-year bond dropped 25/32 , or $7.81 for $1,000 of bonds, to a price of 1094/32 and a yield of 6.90 percent, up from 6.84 percent on Thursday.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities, said the only surprise in yesterday's report on gross domestic product was the extremely restrained pace of inflation.
"Real G.D.P. was well within market expectations, meaning that changes in business inventories were considerably less in the second quarter than in the first quarter, and as a result real final sales were up 2.1 percent," Mr. Fine said, "which means, away from the inventory adjustment process, the economy was growing at a rate of about 2 percent. The most important thing to note, however, is that the economy appears to be moving towards a soft landing."
The economy is currently growing year over year at a 3.1 percent pace, he said. "That's down from 4 percent in the first quarter," Mr. Fine said yesterday, "and assuming G.D.P. is 2 percent in the third quarter, which is a perfectly reasonable assumption given the final sales number today, year-over-year growth in the third quarter would be 2.6 percent.
"This is the Fed's perfect world -- the economy's trend rate of growth seems to be slowing to a pace of between 2 to 2.5 percent, while at the same time inflation remains benign. It's an economic environment that will allow the Fed to ease again, although not immediately at this juncture. I would expect another one-quarter-point easing move as early as September, or possibly as late as November."
Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston, said the G.D.P. report validated the Fed's wisdom in easing this month.
According to some economists, the numbers that are most likely to influence the market over the near term are the purchasing managers report, motor vehicle sales, and of course, the July labor market statistcs, which are due next Friday.
Eugene J. Sherman, director of research at M. A. Shapiro & Company, said the economy had largely adjusted to the overheating in 1994. "The report for second-quarter G.D.P. showed a sharp reduction in inventory accumulation, suggesting business has come close to restoring inventories to preferred levels," he said.
Mr. Sherman expects there will be some further adjustment in the third quarter. He noted there had already been signs of a recovery in housing, with a pickup in sales of existing and new homes. "That," he said, "should lead to some acceleration in housing starts and consumer spending for household goods and service."
"In short," Mr. Sherman said, "conditions are in place for renewed energy in the maturing expansion. At the same time, inflation, in G.D.P. terms, is still well contained."
