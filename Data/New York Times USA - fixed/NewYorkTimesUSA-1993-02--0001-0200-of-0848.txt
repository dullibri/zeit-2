HEADLINE: New York City Can Do Better With Underused Industrial Areas

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The New York City Planning Department is seeking new uses for industrial areas, you report Jan. 15. By this proposal Mayor David N. Dinkins's administration acknowledges its failure in industrial development; reaffirms its promotion of business services and information at the expense of industry, and advocates rezoning to reduce the city's stock of industrial land and buildings, and allow massive discount retail warehouses and supermarket use in them. 
 This is a prescription for disaster and must be prevented. It would preclude future large-scale industrial development; use up irreplaceable low rent large industrial buildings and reduce their job-producing potential. And it would destroy small-business entrepreneurship in minority areas, undermining one of the high priorities of the Dinkins administration.
A New York City Controller's Office study shows that since the late 1950's, 800,000 manufacturing jobs have left the city. Moreover, between April 1989 and June 1992, employment in the city fell by 370,000 jobs. This represents 10.2 percent of the city's work force (the largest proportion in the private sector) and 20 percent of the jobs lost nationally during the recession. These were primarily service jobs, illustrating this sector's increasing vulnerability.
For the city to throw all its eggs in one basket would be suicidal and preclude employment of most of its dependent population, who have no interest in or skills for office work. Local government must abandon its misconception that the city's future lies exclusively in the service sector.
If New York City is to solve its fiscal and social crisis, stem the migration of business and the middle class, and attract new jobs on a scale in proportion to need, it needs an increase in industrial land and building resources and an independent industrial and economic development strategy. That strategy would use the city's assets and resources (such as extensive waterfront, vacant piers, the Brooklyn Army Terminal, the Brooklyn Navy Yard and numerous vacant city blocks in all boroughs), train its work force and make doing business here cheaper and easier than elsewhere.
For more than 25 years, New York City has been sitting on a high-tech export tax-free zone light industrial development proposal that can do this without reducing revenues, creating unfair competition or requiring major capital investment. It would do for New York City what it has done for such places as Hong Kong, Taiwan and Shannon, Ireland.
This city has the ability and resources to solve its problems through its own efforts.

HEADLINE: Shareholders Exercise New Power With Nation's Biggest Companies

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
Only a week ago, James D. Robinson 3d appeared to have won the battle of the board room at the American Express Company, persuading the company's directors to keep him on as chairman. But within days, large shareholders began to sell stock or meet with the board and top executives, seeking his ouster. Friday night, Mr. Robinson gave in and resigned.
The news provided a dramatic end to a remarkable week in American corporate history. I.B.M. and Westinghouse, two very large corporations with many unhappy shareholders, announced that their chief executives would be leaving. And Sears, Roebuck & Company, also the object of shareholder criticism, said it would close its historic catalogue operations, lay off 50,000 workers and close 113 stores in an effort to increase profits and its stock price. 
 At all these companies, the changes were a sign of a shift in power, with shareholders gaining more leverage over the executives and managers of the corporate world. The shareholder rights movement, once a theoretical concept pushed by a band of academicians in the 1980's, is now reshaping the corporate landscape.
At American Express, for example, the largest shareholder, the J. P. Morgan bank, which owns 13.2 million, or 2.77 percent, of the company's shares, met with top executives to lobby against Mr. Robinson. So did other large stockholders, including Alliance Capital and Putnam Management.
 
'Many Companies Vulnerable'
 At Westinghouse, large shareholders began to meet with top executives in October, pressing for the sale of the company's troubled financial services subsidiary. The executives agreed, but the subsidiary was not sold. So the large shareholders pressed for a new management team, and the directors agreed.
"Shareholders have suddenly pulled together as a power base," said John Wilcox, chairman at Georgeson & Company, which helps companies manage shareholder votes by soliciting proxies from holders who cannot attend meetings. "They are talking about the real stuff of corporate performance, not just theoretical things. The economic problems at many companies combined with this increased power of shareholders have left many companies vulnerable."
The movement's leader is the California Public Employees' Retirement System. With $72 billion to invest, the fund owns stock in more than 1,000 companies. The state pension funds of New York, Massachusetts and Wisconsin are also very active.
The movement is based in the belief that the shareholders, either as individuals or collectively as mutual funds, pension funds or other institutions, should exercise power as influential owners of a corporation. Rather than accepting that the corporation is the fief of a chief executive and his hand-picked board, these investors say the corporation must respond to their demands for better performance and higher profits.
The blows struck by these shareholders have already been felt throughout America's executive suites and have brought about significant changes in companies' strategies and leadership. The movement has also forced corporate boards into a new stance that has turned them into tough overseers rather than silent partners.
"There's been a huge shift in power within companies," said Ralph Whitworth, president of United Shareholders Association, an investors' advocacy group in Washington. "We're seeing things move in the direction of major structural and managerial changes."
 
'Boards Have No Choice'
 Institutional shareholders, concerned about lagging corporate performance, were behind I.B.M.'s decision to seek a replacement for John F. Akers, its chairman and chief executive. And it was shareholders who successfully sought the ouster of Paul E. Lego at the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Earlier, shareholder pressure had been instrumental in galvanizing General Motors' directors to seek the resignation of Robert C. Stempel as chief executive.
"In these cases, boards have no choice but to act," said James E. Heard, president of Institutional Shareholder Services, a consultant to pension funds on shareholder issues. "How can they say to their largest shareholders, who are not quick-buck artists, they they have no right to raise questions about corporate performance? The ripple effect of what happened at I.B.M. and G.M. at other companies is bound to be significant."
As recently as three years ago, the shareholders rights movement was largely an academic exercise, as some pension funds led generally unsuccessful proxy fights against leading corporations. In many battles, shareholder advocates sought to gain board seats or to change rules so that it would be easier for those outside the company to be elected to corporate boards and their key committees.
The movement was born amid the takeover battles of the 1980's, as some institutional shareholders became dismayed that corporations erected elaborate defenses to avoid being taken over, in some cases denying large shareholders the chance to accept a would-be acquirer's top dollar for their holdings. And they were frustrated that some companies would pay "greenmail" -- a premium above market price for the shares of a corporate raider -- to halt a raid, while the large shareholders were never offered that price.
In the last few years, shareholders have focused on other issues, like executive compensation and whether it is tied to performance. And they have won some important battles at the Securities and Exchange Commission. In October, for instance, the commission made it easier for large shareholder groups to talk among themselves and take collective actions against corporations without violating proxy rules. The agency has also validated the attacks on executive compensation by requiring corporations to increase public reporting of executive pay packages.
Equally important, large shareholders have taken to meeting regularly with top corporate managers and discussing once-privileged business matters, like corporate strategy covering which divisions to sell or buy, and what businesses to enter.
The California pension fund, popularly known as Calpers, is so big that it cannot easily or quickly sell the stocks of companies it is unhappy with. So, as with many other institutional investors, it is trying to improve the performance of the companies it invests in.
"We are investors, and we are owners," said Dale Hanson, chief executive of the California fund. "Our focus is basically on the board of directors and making sure they understand they are responsive to the owners and providing oversight of management. So many are captive of the chief executive and, unless an outside force comes along to shake them up, there's not much oversight."
To do that, the big investors have been meeting with corporate executives and boards. And Calpers annually draws up a list of 12 underperforming companies and meets with them to devise ways to improve profits.
"There's been a culture change and a change in attitude and a change in the concept of the role of the board and large shareholders," said Ira Millstein, a partner at the law firm of Weil Gotshal & Manges and outside counsel to the Westinghouse and G.M. boards. "That's the big important thing happening now. In the future, boards will be there on their own without having to be pushed by shareholders."
The shareholder activity has drawn some complaints. Some executives worry that such shareholders could go too far -- using corporations, for instance, as a way to promote a social agenda or making business decisions in areas where they have little expertise. "Shareholders are here to stay; whether that's good or bad is not the question," said Mr. Wilcox, the proxy solicitor. "Will the power of the shareholders be too great, and will they want to make business decisions? You don't want shareholders running the company. And so far, they don't seem to want to."
Still, it is clear that corporations and shareholders are engaging in dialogues that two or three years ago would have been unthinkable. It is now fairly common for management and boards to negotiate quietly with the California fund and other groups to avert situations like those at G.M. or I.B.M.
"This has been an evolutionary process rather than a revolutionary one," Mr. Hanson said. "But the gains could be categorized as revolutionary." Among the companies that Mr. Hanson said have made changes as a result of discussions with shareholders are Avon, ITT, Lockheed, TRW, Champion International, Time Warner and Westinghouse.
 
Clear Thinking
 Many of these companies have eliminated anti-takeover measures, added more outside directors to their boards, limited executive pay and consulted with large shareholders before deciding whether to buy or sell a business.
One company involved in such discussions is the Ceridian Corporation, a Minneapolis-based information company created from the wreckage of the former Control Data Corporation. After meeting with Mr. Hanson's group, the company eliminated its anti-takeover measure, began changing the way votes are counted in proxy battles and reviewed corporate strategy and executive compensation.
Larry Perlman, chief executive of Ceridian, said many chief executives were becoming more responsive to shareholders because they are afraid of their power: "It's like what Dr. Johnson said: There's nothing so clear as the mind of a man who will hang in the morning."

HEADLINE: After the Deluge, Life in Tijuana Is Grimmer

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TIJUANA, Mexico

 BODY:
From the muddy hillside to which his tar-paper shack just barely holds, Ambrosio Castro can look up at a vision of Mexico's economic future. Behind him, American and Japanese assembly plants spread over the landscaped terraces of a busy industrial park, their mirrored windows glinting in the sun.
But for miles below the tiny home that Mr. Castro shares with his wife and three children, the view is crowded with the sort of frail lives that were broken and lost when it rained hard here over 12 days in January. 
 Nearly 10 years after Mr. Castro and other squatters began to invade the valley seeking a place to live, it bears no sign of sewers, storm drains or running water. Junked cars and old tires are everywhere, remnants of the garbage that dammed up natural drains and then burst, causing more severe flooding below. Hundreds of ramshackle homes like Mr. Castro's have been torn open by the waters or carpeted with mud.
"We thought it would be a little easier to get by here, but so many people came," said Mr. Castro, 41, who brought his family from a farm town in the central state of Guanajuato and has found work off and on as a laborer and taxicab driver.
In the aftermath of the mudslides and floods, the gap between the attraction of Tijuana for poor, ambitious immigrants like Mr. Castro and its failure to provide them with basic services has opened like a chasm before the city's hopes of booming again as a gateway for free trade between Mexico and the United States.
The problem is duplicated to varying degrees in other Mexican border cities. In almost all, the rapid growth of light assembly plants and other industries since the 1970's has transformed their economic base. But with minor exceptions, that change has taken place without corresponding investment in housing, sewers, roads and social services.
In Tijuana, the image of a seedy frontier town has worn away, replaced by that of a vital, if chaotic, metropolis on the forefront of Mexican economic and political change. Yet years of corruption, populist politics, environmental degradation and an utter lack of urban planning have also left a place in which many experts say disaster was only a matter of time.
"Tijuana is really at a crossroads," said Roberto Sanchez, an urban planning expert at the Colegio de la Frontera Norte, a research institute just south of the city. "Either it imposes dramatic measures to order its growth or it condemns itself to chaos."
 
Flood Damage in San Diego
 The havoc caused by the rains was by no means Tijuana's alone.
Just across the border in San Diego, the floodwaters caused $10.5 million in damage, said Dan McAllister, a city spokesman. At least 12 homes and 17 mobile homes were destroyed, and 23 other homes were badly damaged.
Across San Diego County, Mr. McAllister said, the flooding claimed three lives. In all of Southern California, the rough estimates are $100 million in damages, most of it to crops and homes.
Tijuana, with a fraction of the region's people and wealth, was left with more than 5,000 homeless and perhaps $40 million in damage, the city's new Mayor, Hector Osuna, said. (Some federal officials and nongovernmental experts rejected those figures as too conservative.) According to the counts of various government agencies, 30 to 35 people were killed.
In the 30-odd canyons that make up much of the watershed of the Tijuana River, squatter settlements and unregulated, upscale housing developments blocked the waters' natural course. Hillsides cut up for subdivisions gave way in sheets of mud. In the vast areas where storm drainage was inadequate or nonexistent, dams of garbage stopped up the waters temporarily and then burst, flooding areas below with torrents of muck.
Tens of thousands of homes were damaged. Poorly built roads and bridges washed away, leaving people stranded. Streets turned to rivers of mud or, where not paved, were carved up by the flows.
 
'Not a Single Service'
 In the working-class Gavilondo neighborhood, Jose Antonio Bernal, a 30-year-old waiter, looked out over the remains of a bridge that residents had been pressing local officials to repair for months.
"They always said they were going to do something about it, but they never did," he said.
Nor did residents seem pleased with the speed and scope of the governmental response to the disaster.
"This is just the latest of our problems," said Socorro Vidrios, 53, a housewife whose modest home was left knee-deep in mud. "There is not a single service here -- no water, no sewer. We need all sorts of things."
For the time being, Mrs. Vidrios, her husband and nine children are living in the empty warehouse of one of the city's 550 maquiladoras, or light assembly plants.
The plant manager, Jeffrey R. Gain, said that after 20 years of profitable business in Tijuana, he wanted to help out neighbors in a time of need.
A brochure for Mr. Gain's company, which assembles everything from computer components to pregnancy testing kits, describes Mexico as "a land of dynamic people and extreme labor savings."
Its skilled workers earn $1.40 an hour, he said.
 
Foundation for Development
 The rush of foreign manufacturers to take advantage of the inexpensive labor, tax exemptions and lax environmental regulation in the maquiladora program helped Tijuana to sell much of Mexico a shimmering image of economic well-being a stone's throw from the United States.
In the 1970's, Tijuana's population grew by almost 8 percent a year, according to Government figures. Although the annual growth rate has officially dropped to 4.5 percent, estimates of the city's population vary widely.
According to the 1990 national census, the municipality is home to 747,381 people, but city and state officials and academic experts say many of Tijuana's poor and transient residents went uncounted; some of them estimate its real population as high as 1.5 million. Its unemployment rate remains one of the country's lowest.
As early as the 1960's, when the national Government modified its inward-looking economic strategy to incorporate border areas, it sought to lay a foundation for development: big highways, industrial parks, a big thermoelectrical generating station.
 
Leading Squatter Invasions
 "They tried to invest so as to create an economic dynamism to the city," Dr. Sanchez, the urban planning expert, said. "But they left aside the social needs that this created."
Manufacturers were given no direct responsibility for their workers' housing. The tax they paid to finance the federal housing authority was largely squandered, Government officials say, by an agency that for years was rife with corruption. (The agency was finally stripped of its construction responsibilities last year.)
But as in other cities, local politicians of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party found that they could build constituencies almost overnight by leading squatter invasions of public and private lands.
 
Big Projects Needed
 Though illegal, colonias, or colonies, like the sprawling Camino Verde settlement to which Mr. Castro moved were tolerated as a matter of policy; they simply were not given running water, sewers or electricity. In poorer areas, diarrhea, hepatitis and other illnesses became endemic.
Until 1984, an urban master plan for Tijuana did not exist, and even after that zoning regulations were not enforced. So developers of more upscale housing projects built first and checked regulations later, paying bribes as necessary, according to officials. The city spread wildly over an area that is geologically unstable and in past years has flooded intermittently.
"It is an incredibly unrealistic place to build a city for two million people," said Lawrence A. Herzog, a professor of urban studies at San Diego State University. "It almost has biblical proportions."
In the late 1970's, a single engineering feat became the fulcrum of Tijuana's makeover. At a cost of about $100 million, a channel was built for part of the Tijuana River, freeing up acres of prime land for glitzy new development.
Yet as the 35-year-old Mayor, Mr. Osuna, ponders the oversized map in his office, the completion of the channel at a cost estimated at $80 million appears as only one of many big projects the city needs urgently and cannot afford. Traffic is often paralyzed because of a shortage of roads and bridges across the river. Because the city has no truck stops, 5,000 trucks park each night on its streets.
 
Vows to Control Growth
 The city government has direct responsibility for filling its potholes and building its bridges. Yet, as in other relatively prosperous areas along the border, Tijuana and Baja California Norte State are beholden to Mexico City for most of the money to pay for such investments. With the national Government giving back only about one-third of the tax revenue that the state generates, Tijuana's public works budget will be about $30 million this year, Mr. Osuna said.
"The rain we got here was unusual, but it was not so much more than other cities get," he said. "The fundamental problem is infrastructure. And on that, they have tied our hands."
As Tijuana began to dry out after the 12 days of rain that ended on Jan. 18, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari came promising new federal attention to its longer-term needs.
At the same time, the city and state governments, both led by the opposition National Action Party, vowed a tougher regulation of Tijuana's growth and a greater role for private business in building needed roads, bridges and drainage canals.
In what is the country's most important experiment in multiparty rule, the state administration of Gov. Ernesto Ruffo and that of Mr. Salinas have already been competing to provide Baja residents with some basic services.
But their focus has largely been on the sort of projects that residents most frequently demand: pavement, sewer lines, potable water and electricity. Until now, storm drains have been well down the list.

HEADLINE: A Texas-Size Scandal Seems to Blossom in Bonn

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Jan. 31

 BODY:
This is such a small town that even political scandals don't usually meet the international standards set by Washington, London and Paris.
A few weeks ago the German Economics Minister had to resign over a letter he wrote on behalf of a cousin's company, which made plastic tokens to spring shopping carts loose in supermarket chains. 
 The Housing Minister was accused of writing letters she should not have penned for a big real estate investment company.
 
Big Spending, Lavish Trips
 But an affair is brewing that has all the ingredients of a major scandal: European-American aerospace rivalry, charges of bribery reaching high up into the German ruling party, big-spending contractors, lavish trips to South America -- everything, so far, except sex.
The world, with bigger things to think about, has scarcely noticed, nor has it paid much attention yet, to the charges centering on a $1-billion contract for a high-altitude electronic reconnaissance system. An American company, E-Systems of Greenville, Tex., is the prime contractor for the reconnaissance system, known as Lapas.
The German Defense Ministry has already spent more than $500 million on the project, but temporarily halted the next phase, worth $220 million, last month after German prosecutors raised charges of bribery against the main German subcontractor here.
According to the prosecutors and to German press reports, the owner of Grob Air and Space Travel G.m.b.H. of Mindelheim, the German company, was generous to officials who were in a position to see to it that he got the contract.
 
The Aircraft Maker
 The German company makes the high-flying, nonmetallic turboprop aircraft, called the "Egrett D-500," that carries the airborne part of the system to heights above 50,000 feet. The Defense Ministry has ordered ten of them, plus the extensive air- and ground-based electronic equipment that goes with them.
The system, according to the authoritative Jane's Defense Review in London, can be used for everything from environmental monitoring to disarmament verification.
The prosecutors and press say the owner of the company invited a four-star general in the German Air Force, now retired, as well as the Premier of Bavaria, where the factory is, to lavish parties at an estate in Brazil in the late 1980's.
The retired general, Eberhard Eimler, and Premier Max Streibl of Bavaria have vigorously denied that they took any money from the company.
"I am not bribable, and I have never been bribed," Mr. Streibl said on Thursday in a tumultuous session of the Bavarian state parliament during which he was repeatedly called upon to resign.
 
Defended Their Visits
 General Eimler, formerly the senior officer in the German Air Force, said he saw nothing wrong with accepting Burkhart Grob's invitation to visit Brazil at his expense in the late 1980's, before the general retired in 1990.
And Mr. Streibl said on Thursday that he had gone to Brazil twice at Mr. Grob's invitation, which he said he regarded as completely private.
Mr. Streibl also acknowledged that he had taken a trip to Kenya at Mr. Grob's expense in 1985.
General Eimler told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper that he had never had anything to do with the German decision to procure the system, but that Mr. Grob was an old friend whose invitation he had accepted with pleasure.
General Eimler could not be reached on Friday, and the Grob company said it was not yet making any statements about the reported charges.
 
A Trip to Texas
 German newspaper reports have also said that E-Systems paid for a trip to Texas by a former official of the Defense Ministry, Norbert Gilles, in 1988.
Klaus Meyer, the E-Systems vice president in charge of the project in Bonn, said that the trip had taken place after Mr. Gilles's retirement.
Mr. Grob's companies also contributed 105,000 marks, more than $65,000, to Mr. Streibl's Christian Social Union Party in 1990, according to documents filed by the party with the national Parliament in Bonn.
Mr. Meyer of E-Systems said on Friday, "We are not aware of any investigation of us, and we have never been contacted by the prosecutors." He said that his company fully expected to continue with the contract after the German authorities resolved their problems with it, which he said he hoped would be soon.
But with the opposition Social Democrats raising charges that unfair methods had steered the contract into American hands and away from big German companies such as Dornier, also in Bavaria, the affair seemed, as Der Spiegel magazine pointed out last week, to be destined for a long run.

HEADLINE: Bigger Battle Expected on Spy Budget

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Clinton Administration officials say they expect to be drawn soon into a fractious high-stakes debate about how to reshape the nation's intelligence community and how much to spend on espionage now that the Soviet Union has collapsed.
Although President Clinton would like to postpone major decisions about the issue, the officials said it would be difficult to do so because the intelligence community's budget is one of the most tempting targets for those eager to cut Government spending to help trim the deficit. 
 The United States now spends nearly $18 billion a year to sustain the Central Intelligence Agency and its sister agencies; an additional $11 billion goes to the Defense Department for its intelligence operations. All of the agencies were originally fashioned to deal with a bipolar world that no longer exists.
 
'Information Is Easier to Get'
 One of those leading the charge to explore ways to find savings is Senator Dennis DeConcini, the Arizona Democrat who is the new chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
"Common sense tells me that intelligence shouldn't cost as much as it once did," Mr. DeConcini said in a recent interview. "I'm aware that the world may be no less a dangerous place than it once was, but to me that means information is easier to get now."
Mr. DeConcini was the moving force behind the efforts in Congress last year that resulted in $1.6 billion being slashed from the intelligence budget, an action that alarmed some national security officials. The Senator said that he favored additional cuts this year but that he had no figure in mind.
In a more telling sign of his approach, Senator DeConcini said he believed that the collapse of the Soviet threat meant that the United States espionage activity no longer needed to be on the cutting edge. "We don't have to be ahead of the curve as we once were," he said.
Mr. DeConcini's approach would seem to fit with Mr. Clinton's campaign promise to cut $7.5 billion in intelligence spending over the next five years. The person who will be the White House's principal adviser on how to reshape the C.I.A. and the rest of the intelligence agencies is R. James Woolsey, a retired admiral who is Mr. Clinton's nominee to be Director of Central Intelligence. But Mr. Woolsey has not yet been confirmed and, Administration officials say, is thus unable to take on the problem.
Mr. Woolsey is viewed by White House officials as someone who will be innovative in finding ways to save money. But he is certain to face formidable obstacles from an entrenched intelligence community.
Those views are best represented by Robert M. Gates, the man Mr. Woolsey would succeed as Director and who has become the most outspoken defender of the intelligence community's budget. Before leaving office earlier this month, Mr. Gates began a campaign to resist further budget cuts.
"If I'm on a crusade," Mr. Gates said in a recent interview, "it's to prevent a sharp cut in the budget similar to the one we took last year."
Mr. Gates, who is to become a consultant and writer on intelligence matters, argued that if Mr. DeConcini and the Clinton Administration slashed the intelligence budget by an amount similar to last year's cut the result would be catastrophic.
"A similarly sharp cut this year would do real damage to the intelligence capability of this country because many people would have to be laid off and real capabilities would be cut back," he said.
Mr. Gates has also criticized members of the Congressional committees who oversee intelligence operations for not doing their jobs well. "Very few members appear to devote much time to their intelligence oversight responsibilities," he said in a speech a few days before he left office, a parting shot that underlines the tension in the battle over the future of the intelligence budget.
Mr. DeConcini responded by tossing a few criticisms of his own. He said the C.I.A. had been woefully mistaken on two of the most important intelligence matters of recent years, the strength of the Soviet economy and the Iraqi Army.
"They told us the Soviets had a world-class economy," he said. "That was absurd, and I question whether that was really professional intelligence or something put together at the behest of higher-ups to build public support for our foreign policy." Mr. DeConcini said the agency also provided a misleading estimate of Saddam Hussein's army at the time of the Persian Gulf war, wrongly predicting tens of thousands of American casualties.
 
'Still a Dangerous World'
 "I hope Admiral Woolsey takes a sharp look at what's going on over there," Mr. Deconcini said.
Bobby Ray Inman, a retired admiral who has held several senior intelligence posts, said Congress and the Clinton Administration should delay seeking cuts in the budget until they first decided what kind of intelligence they needed to operate in the newly shaped world.
"It's still a dangerous world out there," Mr. Inman said.
"If the policy makers make a conscious decision that they can live without some of this, then fine," he said. But if they trim back the intelligence gathering capabilities, Mr. Inman added, they should no longer complain that the C.I.A. failed to serve them well.
Mr. Gates has argued that resources once devoted to the Soviet threat now have to be devoted to other problems like the proliferation of nuclear weapons among smaller countries, drug trafficking and economic intelligence that affects national security.
Roy Godson, a Georgetown University professor and an authority on intelligence matters, said the United States could get more accurate and cheaper economic intelligence from banks or financial consultants, rather than from the C.I.A.
Professor Godson favors narrowing the C.I.A.'s role in gathering secrets, particularly in areas where other parts of the Government have access to freely available information.
The C.I.A., he said, is currently the repository of all kinds of arcane information, like global warming and the wool crop yield in Mongolia.
"If there is to be savings and efficiency, the first thing to do is distinguish between intelligence and information," he said. "Intelligence should be concerned with secrets."

HEADLINE: Security Council Expected to Threaten Tougher Belgrade Sanctions

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 31

 BODY:
In an effort to press the warring factions in Bosnia to accept a peace plan, the Security Council is expected to threaten what remains of Yugoslavia with tougher economic sanctions that could include severing all transport links with the outside world, diplomats said today .
After talks in Geneva ended on Saturday without agreement among the three main factions -- Serbs, Croats and Muslims -- negotiations on the three-part plan were moved to United Nations headquarters in New York. The plan, drawn up by Cyrus R. Vance, former Secretary of State and Lord Owen of Britain, would divide Bosnia and Herzegovina into ten areas with only a loose central Government.
 
A Lesser Evil
 Britain and France, which have both sent substantial peacekeeping forces to Bosnia and lost troops in the fighting, believe that tightening the strictures of the embargo would force the Belgrade Government to put a stop to aggression by Bosnia's ethnic Serbs. The current Yugoslav federation includes only Serbia and tiny Montenegro. Such a tightening could involve cutting any remaining road, rail or river links and suspending Yugoslavia's membership in international bodies. 
 Their strategy also includes convincing the Bosnian factions that the peace plan, despite their objections to parts of it, is better than continued bloodshed or economic sanctions. Britain and France want the Security Council to endorse the plan and send the factions back to Geneva for further talks.
For this strategy to work, the United States must also convince Bosnia's Muslims that it is not planning to rescue them by military force.
 
Review of U.S. Policy
 Pressure to provide more military aid to the beleaguered Muslims is growing, and on Friday Islamic countries formally asked for an emergency Security Council meeting this week to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia so its forces could acquire the weapons they need to recapture territory seized by the Serbs.
It remains unclear whether the Clinton Administration is ready to throw its full support behind the peace plan. "We are very worried that the Americans might stab Vance and Owen in the back," a European diplomat said today.
The Administration indicated last week that it plans a thorough review of American policy toward the crisis in the former Yugoslav federation, but events are moving faster than expected and the decision to bring in the Security Council means the United States may need to formulate its policy by the end of the week.
Warren Christopher, the new Secretary of State, has criticized the Vance-Owen plan as unfair to Bosnia's Muslims. He and Madeleine K. Albright, the new United States chief delegate to the United Nations, will discuss the matter with Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Monday. They will meet Mr. Vance and Lord Owen.
European diplomats here argue that while the Geneva peace talks have become bogged down, they are nevertheless at an advanced stage.
Bosnia's Croats, lead by Mate Boban, have signed all three parts of the accord: a statement of the general principles; a detailed map of the partitioning, and a cease-fire.
 
Issue of U.S. Visa
 In the talks in Geneva, Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, refused to accept the map; President Izetbegovic would sign neither the map nor the cease-fire agreement.
Lord Owen and Mr. Vance said leaders of the three factions would all come to New York this week to settle their differences, but it remained unclear today whether the United States, which has placed Mr. Karadzic's name on a list of potential war criminals accused of atrocities, will give him a visa to attend the United Nations meeting.
France and Britain are also discussing sending NATO warplanes to enforce the ban on flights over Bosnia by shooting down violators.
While such a move would be of scant military value, it is seen as a further warning that the Security Council intends to compel the enemies to make peace.
 
Protection for Sarajevo
 France has suggested throwing a military cordon around the beleaguered Bosnian capital of Sarajevo to protect it from the encircling Serbian gunners.
But something very similar would happen anyway under the Vance-Owen plan, which requires the withdrawal of all armed forces from Sarajevo province and their replacement by new peacekeeping forces to ensure freedom of movement.
One remaining problem is the new fighting in Croatia. The Security Council must still deal with the Croatian attack on the United Nations-protected Serbian enclave of Krajina last week, which has raised the specter of a new war between Serbs and Croats.

HEADLINE: Jobs Promised in '91 Bill Have Yet to Be Realized

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
Viewed as a stimulus for an economy in the doldrums, a $151 billion transportation bill was quickly approved by Congress and signed into law by President George Bush in November 1991. The bill, the President promised, would quickly translate into "jobs building roads, jobs building bridges and jobs building railways."
But more than 13 months later, transportation planners say, the law has neither stimulated the economy nor created many jobs. It will take another year or two, they say, to produce concrete results. 
 "The legislation's total effect is underwhelming," said Representative Bob Carr, a Michigan Democrat who is vice chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation.
What happened? One important reason is that Congress, facing a growing Federal deficit, provided states with only 70 percent of the money authorized by the law, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. That was just a modest increase over transportation financing in previous years.
 
More Planning Required
 In addition, the law itself has slowed the process. It requires more planning and sets standards for meeting new Federal requirements on air quality and access for the disabled. It also requires more public participation in determining which projects should be built and whether they should be mass transit or highway projects. State agencies, which used to make most transportation decisions, must now consult with local and regional groups.
But perhaps the biggest reason for the delay is simply that transportation projects, by virtue of their size, take years to plan and build.
And that may be the bill's biggest lesson for the new Clinton Administration, which is considering a plan to spend an additional $15 billion to $20 billion this year on public works, including highway and rail projects.
"The experience with the Surface Transportation Act provides some cautionary flags about expecting fast results," said Steven D. Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States at Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany.
The 1991 transportation bill was heralded by all sides. Even Mr. Bush, who once opposed its mass-transit provisions, enthusiastically endorsed it as a symbol of his Administration's efforts to breathe life into a weak economy.
The measure increased transportation spending by 25 percent, to a total of $151 billion in the fiscal years 1992 to 1997. But Congress appropriated an increase of only 9 percent, to an average of $21.5 billion in the 1992 and 1993 fiscal years.
Still, the transportation law represents the first significant shift in national transportation policy since the Interstate System of highways was begun 35 years ago.
For years, that policy was defined simply as where to build new highways. But the new law forces the states to develop long-range regional plans that reduce traffic without increasing air pollution.
And in recent interviews, three dozen planners and government experts said the law seemed to be generally doing what it was intended to do: promote the wisest investment of Federal money, whether it is spent on highways, transit systems, bicycle paths or pedestrian bridges.
Jon A. Bloom, director of highway and area planning for the Minnesota Department of Transportation, said the law was promoting good policy. "The changes in the law are beneficial to the state," he said. "But we're not getting any more money than we used to get."
If the law had been fully financed, Mr. Bloom said, Minnesota would have received $86 million a year for highway repair projects. Instead, it will get only $47 million.
Because the law provides new Federal grants for projects to reduce congestion and improve air quality, some projects that would have remained on drawing boards are actually being built.
In San Jose, Calif., for example, the Santa Clara County Transportation Agency obtained a $500,000 Federal grant to build a children's day-care center next to a downtown train station. If the not-for-profit center for 150 children can attract more parents to the county transit system, which serves 200,000 passengers a day, the county plans to apply for grants to build centers at 24 other stations.
"Without the new law, the child-care center wouldn't have happened because we had no local funds for it," said Rod Diridon, a member of the Board of Supervisors of Santa Clara County, which includes San Jose and operates the local transit system.
In Boston, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority received $3.2 million to start restoring commuter rail service between Boston and 32 southeastern communities that was discontinued in 1959. The agency proposed the restoration two years ago, when Federal grants would have covered half of the project's $480 million cost. But now that transit and highway projects receive equal treatment, the transit agency expects the Government to pay 80 percent of the cost.
The new law often gives transit projects an edge over highway projects because the law incorporates provisions of the Clean Air Act of 1990, forcing states to consider the environmental costs of competing transportation proposals.
Although transit systems appear to get the most benefit from the new law, many transit officials are not ready to pass judgment.
"Like people in most communities and regions, we in New York are trying to figure out how to adapt ourselves to the new rules of the game," said Peter E. Stangl, chairman and chief executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
The agency is looking to the Federal Government for a significant part of its five-year, $9.6 billion capital improvement program. It received only $200 million last year, and Mr. Stangl said, "The test will be how well we do over the next four years."

HEADLINE: Governors Ask U.S. to Set Standards on Health Care

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
In a sweeping new policy statement, the National Governors' Association said today that the Federal Government should set nationwide standards for health insurance and should limit the tax deductibility of health insurance for both employers and employees.
But in a rebuff to President Clinton, the governors rejected his proposal to impose a national limit on all health spending, public and private. 
 The governors said all Americans should have access to health care. Such universal access is "both a moral imperative and an invaluable cost-containment tool," they said. More than 35 million Americans have no health insurance coverage.
The governors' position is important because the states will have a big role in carrying out any major changes in the health-care system approved by Congress. Mr. Clinton, a former chairman of the association, has invited all governors to a White House meeting on Monday and plans to address them at their winter meeting here on Tuesday.
 
Call for Definitions
 In their policy statement, adopted by voice vote without dissent, the governors demand "Federal minimum standards for the regulation of health insurance," which has historically been regulated by the states. The Federal standards should limit variation in insurance premiums and prohibit insurers from denying coverage to people with a history or a high risk of medical problems, they said.
The governors said the Federal Government should define a standard minimum package of health benefits, comparable to those now provided by the most efficient health maintenance organizations. Under the proposal, employers could not take a tax deduction for contributions to employee health benefits exceeding the value of the standard package. And employees would have to pay income tax on such excess contributions.
Under current law, there is no limit on an employer's tax deductions for employee health benefits, and none of the benefits are counted as taxable income to employees. Economists contend that this arrangement encourages overuse of health care because employees are shielded from the true cost.
Governors said they hoped that, by limiting tax breaks for health insurance, the nation could slow the growth of health spending, expected to total $940 billion this year, up $100 billion from 1992. People would still be free to buy coverage beyond the basic benefits, but the Government would no longer subsidize the extra coverage through the tax code.
 
Health Budget Opposed
 The governors did not specify how the unemployed or their families should be covered. But they said states should organize cooperatives through which individuals and small businesses could buy coverage.
In his campaign manifesto, Mr. Clinton said he wanted to "establish an annual health budget for the nation to limit both public and private expenditures."
But in their policy statement today, the governors said, "It is unrealistic to immediately enforce strict budget limits on health-care spending, since available data are not sufficient to set accurate spending ceilings."
At the White House on Monday, governors said, they will plead with Mr. Clinton to allow maximum flexibility to states, both in Medicaid and in any new national health-care program.
Mr. Clinton has endorsed the idea of "managed competition," in which large groups of consumers seek the most efficient providers from competing networks of doctors and hospitals. In general, the governors support this approach. But they warned that Mr. Clinton and Congress must pay special attention to the needs of rural areas.
Gov. George S. Mickelson of South Dakota, a Republican, said, "Managed competition is not relevant in 55 percent of my state, which is classified as frontier." In such rural areas, he said, there are not enough doctors or hospitals to have meaningful competition.
The governors' policy allows states to require employers to provide health insurance to their employees. But it does not endorse Mr. Clinton's proposal for a Federal law to impose such a requirement nationwide.
"I would not sign on to a policy that said we were going to have an employer mandate," said Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina, a Republican, who is vice chairman of the association.
The governors' meeting is dominated by talk of health care. "If we're to reduce the deficit and get some fiscal sanity in this nation and in our individual states, we must attack our health-care costs," said Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, a Democrat who is chairman of the association.
Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas, a Democrat, proposed an amendment to the health-policy statement that said, "National and state-level spending targets should be set," and cost-control techniques should be adopted as quickly as possible.
Mr. Campbell recommended that the first half of the amendment be deleted, to eliminate the idea of spending targets, and the other governors agreed. Mr. Campbell said he feared that such targets would be set unwisely and enforced rigidly by "Federal bureaucrats."
Doctors, hospitals, drug makers and manufacturers of medical equipment also oppose national limits on health spending. "If you can put a cap on illness, then we'll talk about a cap on expenditures," said Michael D. Bromberg, executive director of the Federation of American Health Systems, which represents 1,400 investor-owned hospitals.
In a separate statement adopted today, the governors asked the Clinton Administration for immediate relief from the crushing burden of Medicaid costs. They proposed changes in Medicaid rules to give state officials more discretion in managing costs, especially the costs of long-term care for elderly people and for children who are disabled or mentally retarded.
The governors also called for a change in Federal law to increase Medicaid payments to hospitals serving "a disproportionate number of low-income patients." The governors themselves agreed to limits on such payments, under pressure from the Bush Administration, in November 1991.

HEADLINE: Iran's Leader Challenges U.S. And Talks of Re-election Bid

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, Jan. 31

 BODY:
President Hashemi Rafsanjani confirmed today that he was ready to run for a second term in June and warned the Clinton Administration in unusually dismissive terms that it was up to Washington to improve relations with his country.
At a rare news conference to which more than 70 foreign journalists were invited, Mr. Rafsanjani accused the United States of a bias against Muslims and urged the Clinton Administration to release Iranian assets that have been frozen since the country's Islamic revolution in 1979. 
 "The West does not want independence and freedom based on Islamic thoughts for Islamic countries," the President said. "They are confronting an important movement and they do not like it."
 
A Harsher Tone
 The news conference was apparently scheduled to draw international attention to two weeks of celebrations commemorating the 14th anniversary of the Iranian revolution. The tone was unusually harsh for Mr. Rafsanjani, who has steered Iran toward greater economic and political liberalization over the last three years.
"We have always said that the United States must reconsider its policies toward Muslims and particularly the Islamic Republic," he said. "Why are they still holding our assets and giving unfair assistance to Israel or adopting a double standard on Iraq -- taking action so quickly there but not taking the disaster in Bosnia seriously?"
Mr. Rafsanjani emphasized that the resumption of relations with Washington "would not be in contradiction with Iran's objectives" if American policies were "truly corrected." The United States severed relations with Iran after militants seized hostages at the American Embassy in Teheran in 1979.
But the Iranian President rejected the assumption that growing trade relations with the United States, a development criticized by the country's hard-line press, would pave the way for diplomatic relations.
Mr. Rafsanjani implicitly confirmed his candidacy for the June presidential elections by saying that he had dedicated his life to the revolution. "If there is a need for me to remain in my responsibility, I will do so," he said.
He denied that Iran was challenging the influence of its oil-producing Arab neighbors or developing nuclear weapons, insisting that reports to that effect in the Western press were "utterly untrue" and "politically motivated."
Mr. Rafsanjani's appeal on the rights of Muslims and his vow to fight "imperialism" anywhere and uphold the principles of the revolution are viewed by political analysts here as themes for his election campaign, which he is beginning at a time of renewed anti-Western sentiment in the Iranian press and Parliament.
One sign that Mr. Rafsanjani is taking an increasingly militant tone was his repeated denunciation of Israel today as the "illegitimate state."
"All this mischief in the foreign press that presents Iran as a threat is intended to spread fear among the Arabs, diverting their attention from Israel," he said. "We believe that Israel should be rejected by all countries until the rights of the oppressed Palestinians have been returned."
Mr. Rafsanjani brushed aside questions on the fate of an American businessman, Milton Meier, 58, who was arrested in Teheran last October on charges of corruption and links with "foreign intelligence" agents. "In Iran, this was a legal matter, not a political one," he said. He did not say when or where Mr. Meier had been convicted. No details of a trial or conviction have appeared in the state-run press.

HEADLINE: Two Surveys Show Split On Clinton's Performance

 BODY:
Two new polls indicate that Americans are deeply divided over President Clinton's job performance so far, and are almost evenly split over the first major issue his Administration has tackled, the ban on homosexuals in the armed forces.
A poll conducted by the Gallup Organization for Newsweek magazine showed that although 51 percent of those surveyed approved of Mr. Clinton's job performance 32 percent disapproved. It is the highest disapproval rating for any new President since such surveys were begun in the 1950's. 
 For most other Presidents, disapproval ratings this early in their first term were in single digits. The only exception -- and the previous high -- was a 13 percent disapproval rating for Ronald Reagan after the first week of his Presidency in January 1981, Newsweek reported.
The latest poll, based on 774 telephone interviews conducted last Thursday and Friday, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
The same poll also indicated that Americans are divided over whether it is a good idea that the military will stop asking prospective recruits about their sexual preference, which is part of the compromise plan announced by Mr. Clinton on Friday. Forty-eight percent did not approve of halting the practice, while 44 percent approved.
In another poll, by Yankelovich Inc. for Time magazine and CNN, 68 percent of those surveyed said they had a favorable impression of Mr. Clinton.
The Time/CNN poll also showed close division over the new President's plan to allow homosexuals to serve in the military. Forty-eight percent said they opposed the plan, while 43 percent supported it.
For the Time/CNN poll, 1,800 adults were surveyed on Jan. 22-25. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

HEADLINE: Surprising Governor Keeps State Guessing

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANNAPOLIS, Md.

 BODY:
In 1988, when Gov. William Donald Schaefer was in his second year on the job, a member of the Maryland House of Delegates took the floor one day to offer a brief prayer.
"Good Lord," he pleaded, "help us to understand our Governor." 
 Five years later, halfway through Mr. Schaefer's second term, many state legislators, and many Marylanders in general, still await the answer to that prayer.
The 71-year-old Governor, who first came to national attention as the aggressive, innovative Mayor of Baltimore, is one of the country's most enigmatic elected officials, and seemingly growing more enigmatic by the day.
He is a politician of serious purpose and achievement. But lately he seems to be expending more and more of his time and energy on petty issues and squabbles, even venting his ire at times on private individuals. When a Baltimore man wrote to take issue with the Governor's handling of state affairs, for instance, Mr. Schaefer went to the critic's house and berated the man in person.
Some of his political friends say they now find him testily unpredictable, generous one moment and vindictive the next. His opponents say they can no longer predict whether he is going to crack a joke or a political skull.
 
At Odds With Lawmakers
 He is constantly at odds with the State Legislature, engaging in stinging public arguments with some members and flatly refusing to talk to others.
"Well, I've never been a predictable politics-as-usual politician," he said in his defense. "I don't mind going against the grain."
Certainly that is what he did when he delivered his 1993 State of the State message recently. The many governmental improvements and programs he proposed went all but unnoticed because he also chose to insert a suggestion that Maryland consider mandatory birth control for welfare recipients who have several children out of wedlock. He suggested using Norplant, the contraceptive implant for women, and vasectomies.
His suggestion shocked many elected officials and civil rights advocates. Some warned of clumsy, racist social engineering.
 
Birth- Control Plan Assailed
 "It's a ludicrous plan," said Carl Snowden, an Annapolis City Councilman. "The government trying to be Big Brother in people's bedrooms."
The Governor saw his suggestion as bold, not ludicrous, which is often the way the debate shapes up these days when there is a Schaefer brouhaha.
"I just threw that out to be provocative, to get some serious debate going about a problem that's costing the country millions and millions," the Governor said. "Sometimes you have to be bold in politics. I've never hesitated to be that way in 40 years or so of public life, and if I do say so, I've been pretty successful."
As the Mayor of Baltimore for 15 years, from 1971 through 1986, Mr. Schaefer won national fame and repeated re-election because of his tireless, "Do It Now!" efforts to revitalize the city's decrepit downtown waterfront and grim slums, and for his enviable ability to attract industry.
He was often hailed as the best mayor in America. And in that time and place he just might have been, even on that day when, ever willing to promote his beloved hometown with a bit of public buffoonery, he struggled into a striped Gay Nineties-style bathing suit and, rubber duck in hand, plunged in among the honking seals in a showman's attempt to promote Baltimore's new aquarium.
 
Change in Personality
 But some change in persona or political approach seems to have come over Mr. Schaefer since he moved to Annapolis.
As Governor, he has been no less eccentric than when he was Mayor, donning every crazy hat and pair of funky sunglasses proffered. But there has been much less applause for his achievements in Annapolis than in Baltimore, and those successes he has enjoyed have often been lost or submerged in unrelated squalls.
In his six years in the Governor's office, he has managed to persuade the Legislature to approve important education and transportation measures, and he has been a leader in efforts to clean up Chesapeake Bay and to limit and guide development on its shores. He has also pushed through an overhaul of the state's legal code and its workers' compensation system.
But to a large degree these achievements have been overshadowed by his vitriolic squabbles with legislators, state and national officials and voters.
 
Puzzling Kind of Disputes
 They are the kinds of disputes he generally avoided while Mayor. And they are especially puzzling given Mr. Schaefer's undisguised yearningfor public approval if not adoration; he once lamented that he had been politically "destroyed" when he won an election by a hefty 20 points.
Among the most recent Schaefer headline-making events are these:
*Though a lifelong mainstream Democrat, he came out in support of President George Bush in last fall's election, angering Maryland Democratic leaders. "George Bush has been good to me," the Governor explained.
*He outraged residents of Maryland's Eastern Shore by referring to that rural but politically important part of the state as an outhouse. "Just jesting," he insisted when a caravan of protesting Shoremen showed up at the Executive Mansion here.
*After his Lieutenant Governor, Melvin A. Steinberg, twice his running mate, objected to a tax increase, he kicked Mr. Steinberg off several committees, stripped him of some of his aides and then stopped talking to him.
"The Governor's a hard man to fathom," said Thomas V. Mike Miller, the president of the State Senate. "He's gotten to be more and more difficult, and there's no reason to be that way."
Another top State Senator, Laurence Levitan, the chairman of the Budget and Taxation Committee, says Mr. Schaefer has been less successful as a Governor than as a Mayor because the State Legislature is much more independent-minded than the Baltimore City Council.
"He ran Baltimore with an iron hand, had everybody and everything in his pocket," Mr. Levitan said. "But when he got to Annapolis, he found he couldn't control us, couldn't put us in his pocket. He's had a hard and frustrating time getting used to that cold fact, and it shows. It's a constant tug of war with him."
Mr. Schaefer's view is that the Legislature has "too many people who worry more about political consequences than about what needs to be done." He also makes the point that he, like governors all over the country, has spent a good part of his tenure contending with a recession that has left the state treasury sorely short of money.
 
When the Money Stopped
 Bob DiPietro, a Maryland developer who was among the first to urge Mr. Schaefer to run for Governor, also sees the recession and the resulting shortage of money as the main cause of the Governor's problems.
"Things went well for him in the first four years and he was enjoying the same kind of success he knew as Mayor," Mr. DiPietro said. "Then, suddenly, the money stopped coming in and the job didn't seem so rewarding, and there was the fear that people would remember only the second four years. It's that simple."
Mr. DiPietro, who worked as an aide to the Governor during the first term, contends that Mr. Schaefer is basically unchanged except for being frustrated.
"He's not all that complex," Mr. DiPietro said. "Sooner or later, if you're around him long enough, everybody -- friend and foe -- has a good argument and fight with him. I certainly did. But I'm still his friend, and I'll back him whatever he does and wherever he goes."
And where might Mr. Schaefer go next, since under Maryland law he can serve only two consecutive terms in Annapolis?
"I'm concentrating only on finishing my work as Governor," he replied.
But there is much speculation in state political circles that he is considering another run for Mayor of Baltimore. He still maintains a home there and visits often.
In a recent address to the Maryland Chamber of Commerce, he devoted a good part of his time discussing the city and its problems, which by most assessments have mounted since he left for Annapolis.
"I don't think the Baltimore business community has moved hard enough to push the economy in the city," he said at one point, his voice taking on the timbre of a disappointed parent scolding a naughty child.

HEADLINE: Gay Issue Mobilizes Conservatives Against Clinton

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Emboldened by the furor over President Clinton's proposal to allow homosexuals in the military, conservative and evangelical Christian groups are furiously organizing, raising money and looking ahead to the battles to come against the first Democratic President in 12 years.
"It's a bonanza for building organizations and raising money; the fund-raising letters are already in the mail," said John Green, a professor at the University of Akron who is an expert on the Christian right. "I've been talking to several of these people, and they all say that they could not have scripted Bill Clinton's first weeks any better." 
 Some of these groups have made homosexual issues their main focus for organizing and fund-raising over the past year. For moral traditionalists, many of them evangelical Christians, homosexuality is a more clear-cut issue even than abortion, Professor Green said, because it is explicitly forbidden in the Bible. And when the issue was fused to conservative views on the military and the objections of the nation's military leadership, it attained extraordinary emotional power, both for committed conservatives and for Americans in the political mainstream.
The issue is so potent that some conservatives, like Randall Terry, the anti-abortion crusader, are expanding their activities to become part of it.
"Clinton has done us a great favor," said Mr. Terry, who calls his efforts to mobilize opinion on the issue "the resistance." "This is going to help us mobilize people to take action for the next four years."
Because the question of homosexuals in the military is so volatile, some experts doubt that last week's furor is indicative of broader problems Mr. Clinton could face. Todd Gitlin, a sociologist at the University of California at Berkeley, said the current furor was a reminder of how split Americans were on social issues, but he added that he did not expect cultural issues to overwhelm economic ones.
"I wouldn't exaggerate the degree to which he's landed in a storm here," he said. "These may be just gusts."
Still, even liberal groups like People for the American Way concede the public opinion often flows toward the conservative side on issues like homosexual rights. No one doubts that Mr. Clinton won by focusing on the economy and by coming across as a moderate, bus-riding new-style Democrat rather than because voters endorsed liberal social policies.
And some experts say the intensity of the feelings last week reflects the depth of the cultural divide in America and the perils it raises for Democratic Presidents, in an era when no Democrat from north of the Mason-Dixon line has been elected President since 1960.
Professor Green, who is director of the Ray Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron, said: "This is a very conservative country, and cultural liberalism is a loser in American politics. There are more cultural conservatives than cultural liberals, and their ability to mobilize should not be underestimated. You've got 300,000 to 400,000 churches out there, and there's nothing like that on the left."
 
Strong Conservative Instincts
 As the departing Republican national chairman, Richard N. Bond, made clear last week when he warned his party against zealotry, the kind of strident conservatism that many saw at the Republican Convention last year can be as unpopular as liberal excesses. But poll results indicate just how strong the conservative instincts of the American people remain.
When voters leaving polling booths in November were asked whether it was more important for government to encourage traditional family values or tolerance for nontraditional families, 70 percent said traditional families. Although most Americans oppose efforts to ban abortion, a New York Times/CBS News poll in October found that only 43 percent of respondents felt abortion should be generally available to all who want it. Thirty-seven percent favored stricter limits than are in effect now, and 16 percent favored an abortion ban.
Although polls show Americans feel homosexuals should not be discriminated against in hiring, they show a majority of Americans say homosexuality is not an acceptable life style and more Americans feel homosexual relations should be illegal than think they should be legal. Other polls have indicated that more than three-quarters of Americans favor prayer in school and the death penalty.
"Democrats make a mistake in thinking that because the social issues won't hurt the Democrats when there's a failed Republican economic manager in the White House, that those same issues can be ignored when you've got a Democrat in the White House," said Kevin Phillips, the maverick Republican political analyst. "What you've got working now calls up the ghosts of 1972 and of things that don't resonate in the subdivisions and malls."
 
A Promise of More to Come
 Conservative groups are looking toward similar cultural issues they say could come up repeatedly during the Clinton Presidency, as the gay issue did last week. "This is a train wreck for Bill Clinton, and there will be more to come," said the Rev. Louis Sheldon, chairman of the conservative Traditional Values Coalition, based in Anaheim, Calif., which includes 25,000 churches.
Conservatives cite the coming debate over extending the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which is likely to include proposals to protect homosexuals; curriculum disputes around the country like the one in New York City over the Children of the Rainbow curriculum; National Endowment for the Arts financing for controversial artists; fetal tissue research and other issues as ones with the potential to polarize Americans on value-laden issues.
Not everyone, including some Republicans, is convinced that such issues need be losers for the Democrats. Vince Breglio, a Republican poll taker, said that despite the uproar over the military ban, the divide in American life had narrowed sharply since the 1960's. With their emphasis on meeting the social and economic needs of families, jobs, health care and education, the Democrats may be more in touch with the values people really care about than the Republicans, he said.
"If you limit it to a more restrictive set of social values, I would say the Republicans come out looking pretty good," he said. "But on the broader cross-section of cultural and economic values, I would have to say the Democrats strike a more resonating chord."
Even the most ardent conservatives say it's dangerous to read too much into a President's first two weeks. But many also say this week's uproar was neither manufactured nor a fluke.
"I think these cultural issues have an enormous opportunity to divide Clinton from this country, deeply and perhaps irretrievably," said Karl Rove, a Republican political consultant in Texas. "It's a marathon, and he can make a couple of mistakes. One would be to start too fast. He didn't do that. Another would be to start running in the wrong direction. I think he's making that mistake."

HEADLINE: When Good Will Is Not Enough;
Desegregation Project at Heart of Hartford School Suit

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST HARTFORD, Conn., Jan. 29

 BODY:
Twenty-six years ago, hundreds of black children from Hartford stepped onto buses to go to schools in five nearby towns. They were pioneers, the first to take part in Project Concern, one of the nation's earliest voluntary desegregation programs between a city and its suburbs.
The buses still run, yet Hartford's schools are far more racially segregated today. And so Project Concern finds itself at the heart of a lawsuit challenging the racial and economic segregation dividing Hartford from its suburbs, asking a judge to order what good will has not accomplished. 
 The suit, known as Sheff v. O'Neill, contends that the concentration of poor and minority children in Hartford denies them educational opportunities equal to those in neighboring towns. Project Concern's goal was to promote integration and to provide those opportunities by busing children out of the city.
It is the smallest of many ironies that the suit is being heard in a courtroom in a former school, long ago converted to other uses, that welcomed some of Project Concern's first pupils in 1966. For in that courtroom, Project Concern is being held up by the plaintiffs as proof that integration benefits children, and by the state as evidence that it does not.
Even so, the state, doubting its benefits, offers Project Concern as proof that Connecticut has actively encouraged integration. The plaintiffs, praising its benefits, hold the program up as ineffectual, as evidence of token intentions. The product of 1960's hopes and the victim of 70's and 80's realities, Project Concern has come to embody the entire contradictory record of school desegregation. It has produced successes and failures that can be seized upon by any partisan.
"It just doesn't cut it any more," testified John Allison, the director of the Capital Region Education Council, a regional agency that has sought unsuccessfully to expand Project Concern.
 
Analyses Questioned
 In court, the state has sharply questioned statistical analyses of the higher education and job choices of Project Concern's first graduates. Sociologists have used them as the basis of a "perpetuation theory": People who grow up amid segregation tend to accept segregation as adults, but those who grow up in integrated settings tend to work and raise their families in integrated settings.
A larger question, however, is whether the one-way busing program ever produced anything resembling integration, and whether it ever benefited Hartford.
Critics say that too few children have taken part to create meaningful integration outside the city -- in June, the 930th Project Concern student will graduate from a suburban high school -- or to halt the growing segregation in Hartford's schools, which are 90 percent black and Puerto Rican.
The strongest critics suggest that the program has had adverse effects, creating a false impression that the state and suburbs were acting against segregation, and allowing many of Hartford's most motivated parents to avoid the city's schools.
"The name of the game was 'jockey to get your kids in Project Concern,' " said Rudolph Arnold, a former Deputy Mayor of Hartford. "The more sophisticated, assertive parents would do that, and so they didn't have to worry about Hartford.
"It was also allowing suburban communities to say, 'We're doing something, we've got Project Concern, we've got X number of students in Project Concern,' which was not really doing anything to change the fundamentals of the situation," he continued. "So while Project Concern had some benefits, it really is just window-dressing. It's 25 years old now, it's gotten lots of accolades, but it hasn't changed anything. It's the easy way."
Project Concern arose from a 1965 study of Hartford's schools, which were segregated by neighborhoods into black and white schools. The study proposed integrating by building new middle schools across the city. Opposition from the white South End blocked the plan.
 
Began as Small Study
 The proposal to bus black children to suburbs also met opposition. So Project Concern began as a small two-year study, involving only 266 children in 1966.
"The concerns on the part of suburban people were: is this the beginning of the end of our local autonomy, and what effect will these youngsters have on our school systems?" said Project Concern's administrator, Mary Carroll.
Set up so researchers could measure its effects, Project Concern selected children randomly from schools in the largely black North End; a control group of children who remained in those schools was also identified. Parents had to give their approval, but the program sent counselors to answer their questions. Most said yes. By 1968, 690 children were involved.
But Project Concern, started with state, Federal and foundation grants, quickly ran into financial problems. By 1970, said Robert L. Crain, who has studied Project Concern's first graduates, outreach efforts were limited to the initial letters sent to parents, and only 25 percent were responding.
 
'Mom Pushed and Pushed'
 That ended the project's research value, he testified, because the children were, in effect, volunteers as opposed to a random sample. For Hartford, it began opening the program to parents who sought out Project Concern as a way to avoid the city schools.
"My mom pushed and pushed," said Antonio Champion, a Hartford police officer who entered Project Concern in the sixth grade. He graduated from Hall High School in West Hartford in 1981. "In her wisdom she realized there was a problem with the Hartford school system."
Alfred Lindseth, an Atlanta lawyer representing the state, who has helped several states and cities contest desegregation lawsuits, labored to have Professor Crain concede that Project Concern was a rare instance of a state voluntarily encouraging school integration.
But Mr. Lindseth also cast doubt on Professor Crain's research on the positive effects of Project Concern by suggesting that its students were unusually motivated.
The number of Project Concern students fell sharply in the 1980's as Hartford cut its support to spend the money on the children in its own schools. More recently, suburbs have encountered budget problems and growing enrollments, and so have accepted fewer children. From a peak of 1,175 children in 12 grades in 1978, Project Concern is down to 680.

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
Staten Island Packs One-Two Punch

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
IF AT FIRST you don't secede try, try again.
That could become the motto of Staten Island, whose voters may wield an ironic double wallop next November: In the very same election, they may choose the next mayor for the rest of New York City and then decide to form a separate city themselves. 
 This week, the New York State Charter Commission for Staten Island will report these two significant conclusions to the Governor and to the Legislature:
A City of Staten Island would have a revenue base strong enough to provide municipal services "without major dislocations"; and the preferred form of government for New York State's newest city would be a mayor, a 15-member common council with an elected speaker but no council president, a comptroller, a planning director and a five-member zoning appeals board, a nine-member elected school board, and a provision allowing voters to petition the council to act on legislation.
Ninety-five years ago, a referendum proposing the consolidation of greater New York into what are now the five boroughs got more support in Richmond, as it was known, than in any other county -- 79 percent.
Almost from the beginning, Staten Islanders had second thoughts. In 1947, after New York City decided that Fresh Kills would be just the spot to dump garbage from the other boroughs, a secession movement was begun, but it failed in the Legislature.
The nascent movement was galvanized again in 1989 when a charter commission, responding to court rulings, abolished the Board of Estimate, on which each of the five borough presidents had equal votes. Theoretically, that pretense of equality actually benefited Staten Island, which had fewer residents. Following the most fundamental restructuring of city government since consolidation, Staten Island was left with three representatives on an expanded 51-member City Council -- and the Fresh Kills dump.
By 1990, after the Governor and the Legislature gave a tentative go-ahead, Staten Islanders voted by 83 percent -- even more than the percentage for consolidation -- to begin the secession process again.
With State Senator John J. Marchi as its chairman and Dr. Joseph P. Viteritti, who heads the Center for Management at New York University's Wagner School of Public Service, as its director, the charter commission held hearings, conducted polls and finally concluded that a mayor-council form of government would be "consistent with the local tradition of Staten Islanders, but it additionally allows the government of the Island to provide maximum representation for its diverse population."
That the population is less racially diverse than the city's is not coincidental, either to the challenge by the other boroughs to the Board of Estimate or to the possibilities for ethnic cleansing that secession represents for some Staten Islanders.
One issue looms even largerthan diversity, though: taxes. The commission decided that a City of Staten Island could provide services with current revenues, but that secession could cost the remaining four boroughs about $300 million, or 1 percent of the current citywide expense budget. Garbage may have traveled a one-way street, but for years New York City subsidized Staten Island commuters going both ways by, among other things, maintaining the nickel fare on the ferry.
The commission estimated that as things stand, revenues associated with Staten Island totaled $955 million during the 1991 fiscal year and expenditures $1.13 billion -- suggesting that the borough may get more than it gives, and not just garbage (which is scheduled to go elsewhere eventually after making Fresh Kills the highest point on the eastern seaboard).
"It shouldn't be interpreted as saying that because this would be economically feasible, do it," Dr. Viteritti said.
Plenty of other transition issues would have to be resolved if Staten Islanders approve a second secession referendum in November and leave the final decision with the Governor and with state legislators, who passed the buck in the first place.
But at the same time that they are voting on secession, Staten Islanders may choose their former mayor. Four years ago, Rudolph W. Giuliani defeated David N. Dinkins by better than 4 to 1 on Staten Island. Voters there may prove pivotal if there is a rematch next November.
Kevin Simmons, the 6-foot-8 Tilden High School basketball star from Brooklyn, has won off the court as well as on. Mr. Simmons, the subject of a recent Metro Matters column, had been barred by the Public School Athletic League from playing for Tilden after he transferred there last September from a Virginia high school that he had attended for a few months after switching from Christ the King High School in Queens.
The question was whether Mr. Simmons was circumventing Board of Education rules that bar transfers "for the purpose of participating in athletics at the receiving school." Peter Parcher, a lawyer who had sued on Mr. Simmons's behalf, said on Friday that after several favorable rulings for Mr. Simmons, city lawyers have agreed that he is eligible.

HEADLINE: Congressional Brief;
Amid Calls for 'Change,' Senate Stays the Course

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
When the rest of Washington hums a mantra of "change," count on the United States Senate to stand fast against the kind of loose thinking abroad in the land that suggests the venerable Congressional way of doing business is, well, not quite adequate to the nation's needs.
The faint breath of reform in the Senate was stilled almost before it could be noticed last week when the minority leader, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, dismissed a series of very modest suggestions for speeding up the chamber's arcane ways. It was not that Senator George J. Mitchell, the majority leader, proposed anything really radical, like requiring amendments to have something to do with the bill they amend, or even something painful, like a five-day, or even a four-day week. 
 Mr. Mitchell's most dramatic proposal would have reduced to 2 hours, from the current maximum of 78, the time the Senate can spend before it gets to vote on whether to consider a particular bill. He said the change "could enhance the Senate's efficiency as well as its ability to act in a responsible manner in a changing world."
But Mr. Dole, whose own most radical proposal was limiting Senate sessions, which sometimes last until Christmas, to six months -- he didn't say how many days a week -- was unmoved. "Minority rights are precious in the Senate," he proclaimed, and should not be abridged in the name of reform. Since it takes 67 votes to end a filibuster over rules changes, there is no chance Mr. Dole can be beaten.
 
Stand By Your Man? Not These Democrats
 It is not only the Republicans who find the old ways comforting. For years some Democrats have been at odds with the leadership of their party, considering it out of touch and elitist. Eight years ago they founded the Democratic Leadership Council to try to have a greater voice in party affairs. And by the surest political measure of all, they succeeded; one of them, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, was elected President.
But the habit of fighting their party's leadership lives on. In Mr. Clinton's first two problems with Congress, the fights over the Zoe Baird nomination and over homosexuals in the armed services, it was Democrats from his own D.L.C. who complained first. Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, a founder of the organization, led Democrats in opposition to Mr. Clinton over gay troops, and Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, another prominent member, fired one of the first Democratic attacks on Ms. Baird.
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, one of several non-D.L.C. candidates whom Mr. Clinton defeated for the Democratic nomination last year, chided Mr. Breaux for not standing by his old chum. Another Senator reported that Mr. Breaux replied that he was, selflessly, only trying to make it easier for Mr. Clinton to withdraw the nomination.
 
Public Calls In With Requests and Advice
 It is doubtless too early for the public to have a fixed opinion of the new Congress. But if there is any early trend, lawmakers point out, it is that along with telling Congress what to do about Ms. Baird or homosexual soldiers, the voters are telling them not to be spending their time on such issues. "We sent you back to cut the deficit and fix the economy," Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas reported one constituent told him on the phone, before offering advice on the military issue.
But before Congress got around to these problems, there was some clear evidence that the public was even feeling hopeful about Capitol Hill. The New York Times/CBS News Poll, completed just before Inauguration Day, showed that 48 percent of Americans thought the influx of new members would enable Congress to do a better job, while only 4 percent thought it would do worse.
And 72 percent said they thought the Government would "work better" now that one party controlled both Congress and the White House. Of course, the last time that question was asked, 74 percent said so. That was in 1977. The Carter years ended with those hopes unfulfilled.
 
New Legislation, Same Compromises
 Nobody plans to cut the deficit or fix the economy any time soon. The Democrats are still waiting for Mr. Clinton's proposals. But as legislative batting practice, each house plans to pass two bills next week. The Senate plans to pass a health research authorization bill, the House plans to adopt a measure to ease voter registration, and both intend to pass the family-leave bill.
The timing is pure theatrics, intended to prove that now that George Bush is gone, progress can be made. But the legislation itself may carry a message for the future, because all the compromises put into those bills to woo Republican lawmakers in 1992, with the hope of overriding a veto, remain in 1993. Democrats thought of toughening them up, but they decided the long-range interest of good relations with moderate Republicans was worth the price of slightly weaker versions of these bills.

HEADLINE: Stalled Tobacco Suit Is Revived by Ruling

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
After winning a five-year battle to remove a Federal judge from sitting on their cases, cigarette companies defending against smokers' lawsuits found scant reason last week to cheer a ruling by the judge's successor.
The ruling by Judge Alfred J. Lechner Jr. of Federal District Court in Newark breathed new life into a stalled lawsuit contending that cigarette makers knowingly marketed unsafe products and conspired to conceal the dangers of smoking. 
 In his ruling, the judge said that the lawsuit, brought by a Philadelphia woman over the death of her father, was of "high public interest" and had brought to light "damaging" industry documents and that to allow her to be driven out of the case by the superior spending power of the tobacco companies would be "intolerable."
Judge Lechner thus rejected the application of lawyers for the woman, Susan Haines, to be let out of the case, which was filed in 1984 and has cost millions of dollars. While Ms. Haines -- whose father, Peter F. Rossi, died of lung cancer in 1982 -- voiced delight with the ruling, neither her lawyers from the firm of Budd Larner Gross Rosenbaum Greenberg & Sade of Short Hills, N.J., nor lawyers representing tobacco companies returned telephone calls seeking comment.
 
Viewed as a Setback
 Following by less than five months the removal of his predecessor, Judge H. Lee Sarokin, on the ground of an appearance of bias against the cigarette companies, Judge Lechner's action seemed to mark a setback in the industry's efforts to sustain a virtually unbroken record of success in the face of mounting liability lawsuits to which the Supreme Court opened the door last summer.
The Court ruled that while warning labels on cigarette packs shielded companies from some liability, smokers had grounds for action if they could show that companies concealed or misrepresented the risks. Internal documents produced by the companies under duress in the lawsuits are giving credence to such allegations.
But in a significant victory by the industry on Friday, a state circuit court jury in Belleville, Ill., rejected the claims of a 51-year-old lung-cancer patient and longtime Winston smoker, Charles Kueper, who was suing R. J. Reynolds and the Tobacco Institute for $48 million in damages for his illness. After a 10-week trial, the jury found his smoking, despite the known risks, a matter of free choice.
Only one plaintiff, Rose Cipollone of New Jersey, has ever won a damage award from a cigarette company, but the $400,000 verdict after her death in 1984 was later overturned and the case was never retried.
In Brooklyn, meanwhile, Federal prosecutors have been conducting what lawyers described as the nation's first criminal investigation of possible conspiracy and fraud by tobacco companies. In an extraordinary effort to seize confidential industry documents being held under seal in Judge Sarokin's court, prosecutors last year sought to obtain a search warrant for the material but were turned down at a higher level, said a lawyer familiar with the matter. The interim United States Attorney in Brooklyn, Mary Jo White, declined to comment.
Judge Lechner's decision in New Jersey on Tuesday revived a case that had lain dormant since shortly after Judge Sarokin's disqualification based on an opinion in which Judge Sarokin said "the tobacco industry may be the king of concealment and disinformation" and cited internal company documents that he said should be made public under "crime-fraud exceptions" to the lawyer-client confidentiality privilege.
Yet last November, his successor, Judge Lechner, was petitioned by Ms. Haines's lawyers to be allowed to drop the arduous and costly litigation, stalling the case. The lawyers had argued that the case, taken on a contingency-fee basis, was unlikely to yield anything close to the millions of dollars it had cost and that the lawsuit had already raised crucial public issues. The defendants -- the Liggett Group; Loews, the parent company of Lorillard; R. J. Reynolds, a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco, and Philip Morris -- took no position on the motion, although forcing Ms. Haines to drop the case or start all over with new lawyers could scarcely have been an unwelcome prospect.
 
'Burdensome and Expensive'
 But Judge Lechner ruled it was not in the interest of justice to allow that. Twice, he quoted a statement by an R. J. Reynolds lawyer, J. Michael Jordan, who had credited cigarette companies' courtroom victories to a strategy of making the lawsuits "extremely burdensome and expensive" for plaintiffs.
The Jordan statement as cited in the judge's opinion went on: "To paraphrase General Patton, the way we won these cases was not by spending [RJR's] money, but by making that other son of a bitch spend all of his."
To which Judge Lechner responded: "To the extent Jordan's paraphrase of General Patton correctly reflects the attitude of defendants, it is at odds with the purposes of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and is intolerable." He took note of the extensive depositions sought by the defendant companies.
Taking issue with a contention by Ms. Haines's laywers that it was not in the public interest to pursue a lawsuit lacking "economic viability," Judge Lechner said, "There is a high public interest in cases such as this."
Ms. Haines lauded the ruling. "I'm very happy," she said, although she acknowledged that there was a chance that Budd Larner might yet appeal. Calls to two of the firm's lawyers, Marc Z. Edell and Cynthia A. Walters, were not returned.
Repeated calls on Friday to lawyers for Liggett, Loews and R. J. Reynolds were also not returned.
Richard A. Daynard, a professor at Northeastern University Law School and chairman of the Tobacco Products Liability Project that tracks smoker lawsuits around the nation, said the ruling showed Judge Lechner was "tougher than Sarokin" and had no patience for delaying tactics. "They're going to be sorry they got this guy," he said of the defendants.

Investors Now Expect Inflation to Remain Low

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Inflation is down. That is documented in Government statistics. But what was not so sure until last week's bond rally is that investors and traders -- long known for their skepticism -- are actually beginning to believe that inflation will stay low for some time.
Some analysts and investors are citing that growing confidence about the inflationary outlook to explain the surprising rally that has dropped the interest rate on the 30-year bond to its lowest level in six and a half years. The yield on the 30-year bond ended Friday at 7.19 percent. 
 "We think that growth is going to be reasonable, but not spectacular, and that inflation is not coming back soon," John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said. "And if that is the consensus that is forming, it should lead to lower long-term interest rates."
 
 
'I Believe'
 Glenn E. Murphy, the chief investment officer at Travelers Asset Management International in Hartford, said, "I believe the inflation story." And because of that he has been buying long-term Treasury securities since autumn, and made especially sure that he "hopped on the freight train as it left the station in January."
Mr. Murphy's confidence reflects a shift in attitude that could open the way to the lower long-term interest rates that economists from the smallest of banks to the chairman of the Federal Reserve have said are needed to keep the economy on a sure-footed growth path. Lower long-term rates will give a boost to construction, to housing and home buyers and to businesses.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said last week that long-term rates could be two percentage points lower -- that is, around 5 percent -- given current inflation levels of 3 percent and a credible effort by the Clinton Administration to reduce the record Federal budget deficit.
But while Mr. Lipsky and Mr. Murphy said the inflation story should continue to bring rates lower over the year, they warned that the markets' adherence to this new low-inflation dogma would be tested in coming weeks. This means that trading is likely to remain volatile whether investors and traders decide to push yields lower or not.
 
 
'Real Challenge'
 Investors and traders seemed to dismiss a signal of strong growth in Friday's report of a sharp 9.1 percent increase in orders for durable goods in December. "That is a real challenge to our fundamental outlook of 2.5 percent sideways growth," Mr. Murphy said .
But several of the economic reports due out this week could disturb traders by forcing them to conclude that the economy is not growing more slowly at the start of 1993 than at the end of 1992. A belief that growth has slowed has contributed to the rally because slow growth increases the odds that inflation will stay low or even fall further.
These reports include the index of leading economic indicators on Tuesday and the January employment report on Friday. The jobs report will be watched especially closely because it will be the first detailed economic barometer of the year.
President Clinton will introduce his economic program before a joint session of Congress on Feb. 17. Mr. Lipsky said the market could be unnerved if the Administration did not come through with the kind of tough deficit-reduction policies that it had been talking about. It was that talk -- starting with comments from Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen about new taxes and reducing the deficit -- that started the rally last week.
 
 
Concerns About Policy
 "What will determine the speed of the rate decline is what will diminish the concerns about policy" disrupting the low-inflation outlook, Mr. Lipsky said. But he said the market had already anticipated positive developments before seeing any actual policy from the Administration or reaction from Congress. "I would have thought that investors might have been somewhat more cautious until the policy consensus of the new Administration was clear," he said.
Mr. Murphy is sure enough that the Clinton economic plan "will disappoint the optimists" that he is beginning to sell some of his long-term Treasuries to take profits. But he emphasized that because he believes inflation will remain tame, he is just cutting back a little and is still, on balance, betting that interest rates move lower.
"An awful lot of the juice has been squeezed out of the market in the first part of the year," he said. "We think that rates will work their way lower, but that the market will be fighting all the way."
Several other obstacles could trip up the market. One is the Treasury's quarterly auction of 30-year bonds and 10-year and 3-year notes in the second week of February. This auction can disrupt a rally if the new supply is hard to digest. And the auction could be a little more uncertain because it comes a week before Mr. Clinton announces his economic program. But well-orchestrated leaks could make much of the program known before then.
 
 
Size of Bond Auction
 Then there is the question of whether the Administration will reduce the size of the 30-year bond auction in an effort to reduce costs by shifting the borrowing to Treasury bills, which have a lower interest rate. Such a move could also help to lower long-term rates.
While there is debate over the precise benefits of such a change in borrowing, speculation about a cut in the issuance of the 30-year bond has already played a role in pushing the yield to six-and-a-half-year lows. A disappointment this week when the size of the refunding is announced could push prices lower and yields higher.
Even bond market bulls like Edward Yardeni, the chief economist at C. J. Lawrence, who forecasts a 30-year bond yield below 7 percent by the end of the year, are a little worried that the market could be undermined in the weeks ahead.
"There might be a lot of wishful thinking that could be built into the bond market that could get blown away in February," he said. But he is still not wavering in his long-term view. He said he just has to look at the Commodity Research Bureau futures index, a close-in barometer of prices, where he sees inflation remaining low. And in the end, he said, that will be enough to pull long-term interest rates lower.
 
 
Corporate Record
 With just a few million to spare, the corporate bond market managed to set a record for new issues in January. Total issues for the month, including sales by corporations and government agencies totaled about $37.1 billion, just over the record of $36.8 billion set a year ago.

HEADLINE: Greenspan the Politician

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the habitually cautious chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, appeared to have read the election returns when he gave a surprisingly strong endorsement last week to President Clinton's plans to stimulate the economy.
In suggesting that the President's stimulus package was not too large and his longer-term deficit reduction plan not too small, Mr. Greenspan seemed to signal an era of camaraderie with the new President. This should make life easier for Mr. Clinton by reducing the chances of interest rate increases and for Mr. Greenspan by reducing the criticism he faces. The harmony might also head off Congressional efforts to exert more control over the Fed. 
 The public clearly voted for faster economic growth in November. And if Mr. Greenspan had signaled that he would rain on their hopes by opposing an economic stimulus plan, he would have antagonized a new President as well as Congressional Democrats, who are already busy bashing him.
Indeed, if Mr. Greenspan had said an economic stimulus plan was unnecessary because it would overheat the economy, many members of Congress, and perhaps the Clinton Administration, would have read that as a declaration of war.
In his Congressional appearances last week, Mr. Greenspan faced the withering ire of several Senators who gave the Federal Reserve an "F" for its role in fighting the recession. These Senators blamed the central bank for the weakness of the recovery, saying it cut interest rates too little and too late.
By showing a pro-growth, pro-Clinton tilt, Mr. Greenspan, a long-time Washington insider who likes to be liked, probably hoped to defuse criticism from Congress and elsewhere. And perhaps he hoped a pro-growth posture might help protect his place in history from assaults by economic legends like Paul A. Samuelson, a liberal, and Milton Friedman, a conservative, who have lambasted the Greenspan Fed for hampering the recovery.
In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan all but told the financial markets to trust the new President. He said that if Mr. Clinton put together a credible deficit-cutting plan, then long-term interest rates might fall sharply, something that would stimulate growth and make Congress, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Greenspan happy.
With this statement, Mr. Greenspan simultaneously dangled a carrot in front of the President to get serious about deficit reduction and, at the same time, jawboned financial market players. No one respects financial markets more than the Fed chairman, but he seems frustrated that long-term interest rates remain so high.
 
Symbolic Stances
 Still, Mr. Greenspan maintained his anti-inflation credentials. In giving his seal of approval to Mr. Clinton's plan to stimulate the economy with about $20 billion in increased deficit spending this year, he made clear that he did not believe a $20 billion package would cause the economy to overheat and eventually force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to fight inflation. In fact, many economists say such a package would be so small that it would be mere public relations aimed at showing that the Administration was doing something to spur the economy.
Similarly, the Fed chairman gave away nothing when he promised that if a large deficit-reduction package were to slow growth, the Fed would take that into account in setting interest rates. This meant that the Fed could cut rates -- not necessarily that it would.
Mr. Greenspan's pro-growth remarks had an additional agenda: to derail Congressional proposals intended to reduce the independence of the Federal Reserve.
 
Looking Out for the Fed
 Henry A. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who heads the House Banking Committee, has proposed having the President rather than local bankers select the Federal Reserve's 12 regional bank presidents, who sit on the central bank's main policy-setting committee. Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, wants to deny the regional bank presidents a vote on that committee, known as the Federal Open Market Committee. Nineteen people sit on that Committee -- the Federal Reserve's 7 governors and the 12 regional bank presidents, 5 of whom are allowed to vote.
These proposals went nowhere in the last Administration because of rifts between President George Bush and Capitol Hill. But with Democrats in control of the White House and Congress, some Federal Reserve officials fear that these bills could move forward, especially if the Fed is seen as opposing faster growth.
The Fed's predicament is analogous to that of the Supreme Court in the 1930's when President Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to expand the Court, and fill it with his allies, after the Court kept overturning New Deal legislation. Facing the President's wrath and having read the election returns, the Court suddenly began to throw its weight behind the New Deal.
Explaining the Court's about-face, commentators quipped, "A switch in time saves nine." This time, Mr. Greenspan may hope that a switch in time saves 19.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
A Media King With Much to Prove

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 27

 BODY:
For someone who has just lost more than $640 million, Jean-Luc Lagardere looks singularly sprightly. The eyes of the ebullient chairman of Matra-Hachette still twinkle, and he remains a man with a ready smile.
But Mr. Lagardere, a flamboyant businessman, has changed after making a disastrous attempt to take Hachette into the television business. In place of the fast-talking entrepreneur of a few years ago who was busy buying magazines in the United States and planning a worldwide media empire, a quieter man now fiddles occasionally with worry beads on his desk, and says: 
 "When one has had an accident, one becomes more prudent. I have not changed in my desire to do things, but I recognize that I made a mistake, and my approach now is a careful one suited to the business atmosphere of the 90's."
Mr. Lagardere has much to prove. He has just completed the unlikely merger of Matra, the military contractor he controlled, with Hachette, the publishing house he acquired in 1980. In the face of skeptics who say that the merger was essentially a way to save Hachette after its failure in television, the 64-year-old executive must now make a success of this magazines-to-missiles monster, one with annual revenue of about $10 billion.
Jean Borjeix, an analyst at the Jean-Pierre Pinatton brokerage firm here, remarked: "The merger was an operation designed to use Matra's strength to cover the difficulties of Hachette. Mr. Lagardere is an expert in such financial acrobatics, but the market is still not sure what to make of him."
 
Ample Energy
 After a 30-year career, nobody doubts Mr. Lagardere's drive or creativity. But while he has built a vast business organization, his judgment is sometimes questioned. Forays into sectors like automobile equipment, personal computers and television sets have failed. His decision in 1990 to invest in a private French television channel, La Cinq, proved disastrous.
By the time the station collapsed last April, afflicted mostly by plunging ad revenue and costly regulatory restrictions on its programming, it had cost Hachette 3.54 billion francs, or $643 million. The loss effectively crushed Hachette's ambition to compete with the likes of the News Corporation, Bertelsmann and Time Warner as a stand-alone media company of world stature.
"I take 100 percent of the blame for this error," Mr. Lagardere said. "But the idea of trying to get into television was not wrong, and I refuse to become one of those businessmen you find so often these days who take pride in the risks they did not take."
Mr. Lagardere has always been known as a risk taker. John Veronis, of Veronis, Suhler & Associates, a New York investment bank specializing in media properties, calls him "one of the world's true entrepreneurs, a man who is bold and imaginative."
Certainly, his style has been forthright. Before the debacle at La Cinq, Hachette had embarked on a major expansion into the United States, paying $670 million in 1988 for Grolier encyclopedias and magazines, including Woman's Day and Road & Track. Unfortunately, the investment was made just as advertising weakened.
Having taken on close to $2 billion in debt, in part to make those acquisitions, Hachette had already been weakened when the television station closed. Some analysts question whether the company, which lost $550 million in 1991, could have survived on its own.
But Mr. Lagardere has long had two strings to his bow. An engineer by training, he made his fortune at Matra's military and electronics group, which makes missiles, telecommunications equipment, automatic subway systems, cars and space modules.
Matra suddenly appeared as a savior for Hachette. After long negotiations, during which the original offer to Matra stockholders had to be improved because of Hachette's worsening plight, the merger was completed last month. Matra stockholders received 13 Hachette shares for every 5 shares they held in Matra. A $509 million recapitalization of Hachette is nearing completion.
 
Facing Some Limits
 Mr. Lagardere is still in charge. But his position has been altered. New investors have required him to set up a holding company, Lagardere Group, under an unusual corporate statute that makes him liable, to the extent of his entire personal fortune, if Matra-Hachette fails. Although he controls Lagardere Group, the new shareholders, including Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris, will be looking over his shoulder.
"The fact that Lagardere has now engaged his personal fortune in the success of Matra-Hachette is seen positively by the market," Mr. Borjeix said.
But doubts remain about the very different natures of the merged companies' businesses. "In terms of their activities, the one company brought nothing to the other," said Jean-Paul Pierret, analyst at J. P. Morgan & Company in Paris.
Mr. Lagardere replies: "People say you have to have a single business -- tires or cars or food. But I believe that today, an industrial group has to be widely diversified. That is the best way to guard against the impact of business cycles."
As for synergy, he scoffed, "Synergy does not exist, not even between books and newspapers."
Analysts see some positive signs for the merged company. As the American economy improves, Hachette Magazines Inc., with its 17 titles, is beginning to pick up. This follows a very difficult few years, during which Woman's Day was put up for sale before being withdrawn because the offers were too low.
Last year, revenue for Hachette Magazines grew to $636 million from $587 million the year before, mainly on a 26 percent surge in ad revenue at a revamped Woman's Day. David Pecker, chief executive of the group, said that only Elle continues to present problems, with the number of advertising pages dropping 13 percent last year from 1991. He added that the group's profit margin on sales was slightly above the American industry average of 10 percent.
Mr. Veronis said it now appeared that the acquisition of the magazines, which include Metropolitan Home and Popular Photography, "will prove to have been a good strategic move for Hachette."
And Mr. Lagardere suggested that Hachette would like to increase the share of its American business, to rise to 50 percent over the next decade, from about 30 percent now.
Still, he said that no new debts would be incurred. And while conceding that Hachette needed a television business to complement its print activities, he said his experience with La Cinq had made him wary.
"This is a big hole, and one day we need to fill it," he said, "but I've been burned once, and I'd look very carefully before making any new television venture."
 
Optimism on New Company
 As for Matra, which accounts for about 45 percent of the group's sales, analysts see encouraging signs. A $265 million investment last year by Northern Telecom Ltd. in the company's telecommunications business has strengthened that sector, particularly in cellular phones.
"We knew about the losses at La Cinq," said Paul G. Stern, Northern Telecom's chief executive, "but what impressed us were our complementary businesses in telecommunications and their highly capable management team. Lagardere is straight talking, quick to make decisions, and not risk averse. I liked him immediately."
The military unit has benefited from Matra's share of a $3.5 billion order to sell 60 Mirage jets to Taiwan, and its order book had risen to $3.62 billion at the end of 1992, from $1.99 billion at the end of the previous year. And the company's auto sector, long in the doldrums, is riding high on the extraordinary success of the Espace mini-van it designed and makes for Renault.
As for Mr. Lagardere, he has already predicted "a very significant improvement" in 1993 on the merged company's 1992 results, which are expected to show a profit between $63 million and $82 million. He shrugs off suggestions of retirement, saying he still has much to do.
"I am a man of the land, a good Gascon peasant, and when a peasant is 80 or 85 he is still planting trees," he said. "The trees are his heritage, even if he knows he will never see them fully grown."

Middle-Class Rage: Like in History, Only Different

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT

Boiling Point
Republicans, Democrats and the Decline of Middle-Class Prosperity
By Kevin Phillips
Illustrated. 307 pages. Random House. $23. 
 As he takes pains to remind us at least half a dozen times in his disturbing new study, "Boiling Point: Republicans, Democrats and the Decline of Middle-Class Prosperity," Kevin Phillips is the political analyst who in his 1969 book, "The Emerging Republican Majority," predicted that the worn-out New Deal Democratic coalition was breaking up in favor a new Republican Presidential majority based on a new middle-class populism and a new Southern-Western alignment, which he called the Sun Belt.
More than two decades later, his sixth book, "The Politics of Rich and Poor," became what was described as a "founding document" of the 1992 Presidential campaign. So when Mr. Phillips talks about the mood of American voters we had better pay attention.
But in his new book, "Boiling Point," he is not so much concerned with predicting the behavior of voters as he is with analyzing what their present feelings are and the reasons for those feelings. Taking off from "The Politics of Rich and Poor," which portrayed the very rich as the major beneficiaries of the Reagan and Bush eras and the very poor as the losers, Mr. Phillips turns to the people between these extremes, or the middle class, which he believes to be the engine of great financial empires. As he writes, "Outbursts of bourgeois spirit and inventiveness, the triumph of middle-class values over those of established elites, have often prodded countries toward peaks of economic and political achievement."
What he finds is not too surprising. In the years of the Reagan and Bush Presidencies, the middle classes of America declined precipitately. No group has been hurt more by rising taxes, declining real income, escalating expenses, a shrinking job market, deteriorating public services, falling home values, growing health costs, weakening safety nets, the loss of savings and the threat of collapsing pension and insurance funds.
Near the bottom of the middle class, people were dropping out as a result of the loss of jobs in the industrial sector of the market. Near the top, people were running faster to stay in place on a treadmill. "For young Americans, those under 30 or 35," Mr. Phillips concludes, "two decades of polarization had brought a special, though widely unappreciated, irony: not only were they (and those younger) in danger of being the first generation of Americans to suffer a lower standard of living than their parents, but they would be the first generation to receive -- or not receive -- much of their economic opportunity from family inheritance, not personal achievement."
Now, the idea that middle-class prosperity is declining may not be a very exciting thesis, given its obviousness to most readers and the somewhat repetitive, helter-skelter way that Mr. Phillips marshals his extensive evidence. But he lends his theory considerable excitement by pointing out that America's present situation mirrors "those of history's two previous bourgeois zeniths -- 17th-century Holland and late-19th-century England."
Those empires, Mr. Phillips writes, "had also fallen from their middle-class zeniths when manufacturing, trade, nationalism and bourgeois spirit gave way to 'financialization' -- the cumulating influence of finance, government debt, unearned income, rentiers, overseas investment, domestic economic polarization and social stratification."
This implies that given its present conditions, especially its national debt and trade deficit, the United States is about to suffer the fate of the Netherlands and Britain. So we thrash our way eagerly through Mr. Phillips's thickets of tables and statistics to see what if anything can be done to save the country.
But near the end of his book, Mr. Phillips shifts his ground somewhat. For one thing, he writes that there is cause for optimism after all. "Unlike Holland and Britain in their heydays, the United States was not a relatively small maritime power lacking great natural resources or a large domestic market and thereby vulnerable. On the contrary, because of its size, resources and the possibility of a larger North American economic union, the United States had no reason to expect the Dutch and British fate, provided its policy makers learned from earlier downturns that imperial overreach, mushrooming debt and increased emphasis on finance, money and the interests of rentiers rather than on manufacturing were more than a source of great-power decline." Now he tells us, you want to cry out.
For another thing, he writes as if what really interested him all along is the behavior of the frustrated middle-class voter, which historically has involved "a mixture of cultural conservatism, apprehension about economic status, nativism and anger at the new rich." For a while there, he observes, it looked as if this voter were turning to candidates like Patrick Buchanan, David Duke and Ross Perot. But then Bill Clinton made all the right promises and rode away with the brass ring. It now remains to be seen if the President will refrain from further burdening the distressed middle class and succeed in rebuilding our diminishing industrial base. If he fails, we can expect to see the revival of voter frustration and the continued rise of a broadly based third party. In short, Ross Perot lives.
But this is not exactly stunning news. So while "Boiling Point" may analyze our immediate past with exhaustiveness and acuity, it really doesn't tell us much about the prospects of America that we couldn't have figured out for ourselves by reading the front page of our daily newspaper. And while it may constitute a dire warning, it does not compare to Mr. Phillips's earlier books as a herald of what is to come.

HEADLINE: The Talk of Sundance;
The Winners and Notable Losers at Sundance

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARK CITY, Utah, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Mainstream was once a derisive word at the Sundance Film Festival.
Only a few years ago, audiences and judges at the nation's major showcase for independent films embraced arty, esoteric movies and snubbed those dreaded Hollywood-style products. But the increasing influx of the Hollywood crowd -- coupled with changing styles of film makers -- was evident on Saturday night when audience awards were presented to films that are -- let's face it -- mainstream.
"El Mariachi," a comedy-drama by Richard Rodriguez, a 24-year-old Texas film maker, won the Audience Award for a feature film, which is given on a vote by the festival's 5,000 filmgoers and is a good gauge of a film's commercial prospects. The film, about a mariachi musician who enters a Mexican border town at the same time as a hit man, was made by Mr. Rodriguez and his friends for only $7,000. Initially made as a quickie for the Spanish-language video market, it is about as arty as "Lethal Weapon." But much funnier.
(Not as funny, and overlooked in the awards, but still the most talked about film, was "Boxing Helena," about obsessive love gone haywire. Audiences reacted in two ways: they loved it or they hated it.)
Mr. Rodriguez, an engaging, coolly confident film maker whose movie is to be released by Columbia Pictures in January, said on Saturday night, "I just hope this inspires people to make their own movies, no matter who they are, no matter how rich or poor."
 
A Winning Documentary
 The Audience Award for a documentary was given to "Something Within Me," an affectionate portrait of St. Augustine's School of the Arts in the South Bronx. This unusual elementary school uses music and other forms of artistic expression to nurture a sense of responsibility and pride among its poor, minority students. The movie won two other awards: the Film Makers Trophy and a Special Jury Award for Merit.
The documentary's producer, Jerret Engle, a former editor at the Dutton publishing house, initially heard about the school on the evening news in New York City about five years ago. Since then, she has worked at part-time jobs and spent years raising $250,000 to make the film.
"I'm just floored," she said on Saturday night. "I love these kids and their teachers, but I didn't know anyone else would be interested." The film, set for a modest commercial release, has already drawn the interest of the Public Broadcasting Service and Home Box Office.
 
Four Grand Prizes
 In presenting the awards, the audience was somewhat out of sync with the more traditional Sundance jury. The panel split the Grand Jury prizes among two dramas and two documentaries.
The dramas are "Ruby in Paradise," Victor Nunez's rambling film about a young woman who flees her Tennessee town to find her sense of self on the Florida coast, and Bryan J. Singer's "Public Access." The latter is about a slick, slightly eerie newcomer to a fictional Midwestern town, Brewster, who takes over the public-access cable network and asks the question: "What's wrong with Brewster?" The result is nothing less than paranoia.
The jury's documentary awards were given to two powerful works: "Children of Fate: Life and Death in a Sicilian Family," a heart-wrenching portrait of three generations of a Sicilian family, and "Silverlake Life: The View From Here," a harrowing film about AIDS.
(Other prize-winners included Steve Gomer's "Fly By Night," a drama about New York rappers; Tony Chan's "Combination Platter," about illegal Chinese immigrants; Everett Lewis's "Ambush of Ghosts," about a dysfunctional family; Leslie Harris's "Just Another Girl on the IRT," about a black Brooklyn teen-ager, and "Lillian," about the struggles of a black woman. A documentary prize also went to "Earth and the American Dream," about the destruction of the nation's environment).
"Silverlake Life" traces the final journey of a film teacher, Tom Joslin, and his companion of 22 years, Mark Maasi, both of whom had AIDS. The two men lived in the Silverlake area of Los Angeles, and both videotaped the film themselves. The graphic film, which includes a hard-to-watch death scene, was completed by a friend, Peter Friedman, a documentary director.
Mr. Friedman, 34, a former student of Mr. Joslin's at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., said he culled 40 hours of videotapes to produce the 99-minute film. "It is a direct and a difficult film which shows the realities of day-to-day life with AIDS," Mr. Friedman said after the awards. "The whole spirit of the film is to confront the pain and the love shared by these two men." In recent days, he said, television and theatrical distributors have expressed interest in the documentary.
 
A Few Words From the Founder
 Sundance is plainly going a bit Hollywood; at least six agents from United Talent Agency, one of the festival's numerous sponsors and more aggressive agencies, were seeking new clients. Still, the awards ceremony hardly resembled the Oscars.
Robert Redford, the founder of the festival, was welcomed onstage with applause and whistles. He wore boots, jeans, a leather jacket and a striped sweat shirt.
Mr. Redford, one of the few millionaire movie stars who have actually paid back the industry by nurturing new film makers, told the packed crowd in a converted basketball gym in this ski resort town: "Nobody can understand the blood, the sweat, the dedication it takes to make these films. Nobody can understand that except the film maker."
He said the festival stands for "innovation, for the avant-garde." But other film makers and executives say it was virtually unavoidable for Sundance to turn, unwittingly, into a hunting ground for Hollywood. In many ways, Hollywood is less interested in the films shown here -- which often flounder at the box office -- than in new film makers with commercial potential.
"It really is a festival of agents," said Jonathan Dana, the president of Triton Pictures, an independent film company, who has been visiting the festival for several years. "It's a barter economy. Everyone's trading information. But it's a tricky conversion from the narrow world of independent films to the market place."
Mr. Dana speaks from personal experience. Last year, Triton bought two of the big prize-winners at Sundance: the comedy, "In the Soup," whose star, Seymour Cassel, was master of ceremonies at this year's awards, and the documentary "A Brief History of Time."
Mr. Dana, standing outside a movie theater in Park City, said simply, "One worked; one didn't."
Like another big favorite last year, "The Waterdance," "In the Soup" failed at the box office. But "A Brief History" succeeded. Mr. Dana shrugged and voiced the oft-heard Hollywood complaint: "Who knows what works?"
 
'Orlando' and 'Helena'
 Curiously, the two pictures that were most widely discussed at Sundance went unmentioned last night.
One of them, "Orlando," an adaptation of the Virginia Woolf novel by an English film maker, Sally Potter, had its United States premiere at the festival but was not in competition for prizes. (The festival divides films into two major categories, those in competition and those having premieres.) By virtual consensus, "Orlando" was the most dazzling film at the festival.
And then there was "Boxing Helena."
No film at the festival provoked as much rage, hisses, applause and debate as this one. The film was directed and written by Jennifer Chambers Lynch, the daughter of David Lynch. Even before it was shown here, the movie created an unusual amount of talk because of the last-minute withdrawals of Madonna and then Kim Basinger from the lead role. Helena is now played by Sherilyn Fenn.
The film deals with a lunatic surgeon (Julian Sands) obsessed by an elusive, beautiful woman named Helena. To keep her, he transforms her into his own Venus de Milo by cutting off her arms and legs and placing her on a pedestal. Hard to believe, but the film is a comedy, albeit very dark.
Ms. Lynch, like many of the twentysomething directors here, is a very confident, assured film maker, without a hint of self-doubt.
Sipping coffee and chain-smoking the other morning in a hotel dining room, Ms. Lynch said she was startled by the almost violent reaction to her film. The film has been called anti-feminist, anti-male and exploitative.
"People want the film abolished," she said. "They scream at us. I wish they would talk to me. I want to hear them. They don't want to have a discussion. They just get up and leave."
Ms. Lynch, who never went to college, grew up in Los Angeles and attended Interlochen Arts Academy in Interlochen, Mich. Upon graduation, she said, she went on a "fairly extensive hike with my boyfriend," lived in Baltimore for several months, and then moved to Los Angeles at 19 to work for her father and write the movie. She's now 24. The movie is awaiting a distributor in the United States
"My whole intent was to parody and to show seriously what we do to each other in relationships," she said. "It's about how we try to change each other. We are equally vulnerable to self-hatred, to obsession, and we try and change each other. It's about how we try to break each other down and control each other -- the thievery that goes on in obsessive relationships."
Although other film makers here find it hard to believe, Ms. Lynch said being her father's daughter was not a blessing.
"Believe me, people wanted nothing to do with me," she said. "I was 19; it was a risky script; I was some big director's daughter and female. There's something about being a daughter. You would think it gives you some credibility. It doesn't."
At least, Ms. Lynch had no trouble getting through the doors of agents and executives.
 
A Long Island Story
 At the other end of the spectrum is Rob Weiss, 26, whose father, Carl, runs a touring business for gamblers in Cedarhurst, L.I. To raise money for his son's film, "Amongst Friends," which turned out to be one of the strongest at the festival, Mr. Weiss sent out letters to his customers.
Rob Weiss, who wears his cap backwards and speaks with an unmistakable New York accent, said: "My dad's friends are pretty much high rollers. The letter wasn't done in a schlock manner. It was classy. It said, like: 'Hey, if you're going to bet on ball games your entire life, if you're going to bet on horses, do something good with the money for a change. Bet it on the kid."
The bet on the kid seems to be paying off.
The movie is a gritty exploration of a group of wealthy high-school graduates, most of them Jewish or Italian, from the Five Towns of Long Island who drift into boredom, drugs, petty crime and tragedy. The director, who grew up on Long Island and attended the Parsons School of Design for about a year, said this was the world in which he grew up. Mr. Weiss said he owed a great deal to the works of Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Oliver Stone. He said he had seen Phillip Kaufman's "Wanderers," about 40 times. (Mr. Kaufman was honored at this year's Sundance Film Festival.)
Mr. Weiss now has an agent, a lawyer, a manager and a publicity agent. Studios are beckoning. But he's not going Hollywood, he insisted. "You've got to know where you came from," he said. "I live in South-Central L.A., by U.S.C., with my girlfriend. The neighborhood is predominantly African-American and Mexican. It's reality. That's what I want. That's what I need. Nothing's going to change."

Reuther, The Big 3 And Days Of Sit-Ins

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
The gritty pictures from the 1930's, the union tunes and the reminiscences of United Automobile Workers old-timers bring back the organizing battles of what became America's biggest industrial union. But the hero of tonight's hourlong documentary, "Sit Down and Fight: Walter Reuther and the Rise of the Auto Worker's Union," remains a distant figure.
The sit-downs and sit-ins that Reuther improvised became powerful weapons in the workers' Depression-era assaults on their industry's big three, General Motors, Chrysler and Ford. As tonight's narrator says, "By doing nothing they achieved everything." 
 With a respectful narration that offers only sketchy historical context, the program is thin by the standards of "The American Experience" series. But it does capture exciting moments from the 1936 worker takeovers of General Motors suppliers. When the police attacked with tear gas and guns, they were driven back with door hinges fired from slingshots. You can see the boyish National Guardsmen being faced down by the determined strikers.
The strikebreakers used by Harry Bennett, the hard-boiled Ford security chief who became famous for setting goons on union leaders (beating up Walter Reuther among others), are seen skulking around like B-movie heavies. But by 1941, the automobile industry was organized and the workers' lot had improved dramatically.
"Sit Down and Fight" tells in passing of Reuther's fights against Communist elements within the union. His social vision, untypically broad for a union leader, comes through best in a recording of a talk he gave long after he was established as president of the United Automobile Workers. He asked his members, "What good is a dollar an hour more in wages if your neighborhood is burning down?"
When he died in an air crash in 1970, the movement he had done so much to build was already facing changes in the American economy that would prove even more formidable than the automobile barons of the 1930's. Sketchy though it is, the program leaves the impression that Reuther was so special a labor leader that he might have foreseen and confronted those, too.
 
'Back to Africa'
 PBS, tonight at 8
 (Channel 13 in New York)
Toward the end of his journey to Nigeria in an effort to reclaim his heritage, Ferdinand Dennis finds himself at a pageant put on by the Africa Reparation Movement. As the players re-enact the beating of a slave, the camera focuses on the wide-eyed reactions of a few children in the audience. It is a strong moment, the only one in this installment of "Travels."
The rest of the hour is given to a mildly interesting 625-mile trip from Kano south to Lagos. Mr. Dennis, a sociologist who was born in Jamaica and grew up in London, makes a pleasant companion as he bargains with taxi drivers, talks with an American student at Ahmadu Bello University, takes a boat down the Niger River, meets a politician and a king and reflects on the relevance of it all to himself. He is too honest to pretend that he is making dramatic connections with an ancestral past, but without such connections the trip does not have much punch. Still, he earns an Emmy nomination for never using the word "roots."

Ads Down, Los Angeles Times Again Cuts Staff

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Under pressure to cut costs amid a severe advertising slump, The Los Angeles Times is carrying out a voluntary buyout program, its second in 18 months. The program will trim the staff by 9 percent, but also strip The Times, the nation's largest metropolitan daily newspaper, of some of its most respected reporters.
The paper, flagship of the Times Mirror Company, announced on Thursday that 668 of its 7,500 employees had accepted the buyout, which is considered generous. It provides as much as two years' salary and 18 months of medical benefits for employees and their dependents. 
 This buyout, the previous one, and other recent measures like the closing in November of the paper's San Diego edition, are expected to save The Times a total of about $16 million.
 
Blues in the Sun
 Every dollar will help. The Times is published in what is now one of the country's weakest economic regions. Recovery is slow in Southern California, and newspaper ad revenues remain depressed. Classified advertising has fallen 16.5 percent since 1991, national advertising 15.8 percent and retail advertising 3 percent, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulation.
The paper planned to eliminate 500 jobs through attrition and the severance program, which was offered to 5,200 employees. Editors and reporters familiar with the process, and who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 800 to 850 had signed up for it.
So popular was the buyout that many high-profile reporters subscribed, prompting top editors to hold private meetings with several reporters and editors and persuade some of them not to accept. Some other employees who signed up for the buyout did not qualify.
In typical buyout arrangements, newspapers seek to persuade older, higher-paid employees to retire early, which can result in large savings.
But The Times is losing some outstanding journalists. Of 88 news and editorial-page employees who took the buyout, some names stand out: Paul Conrad, its political cartoonist, who has won the Pulitzer Prize three times; Bella Stumbo, a highly regarded writer known for her profiles; Laurie Becklund, a top metropolitan reporter, and Robert Scheer, who writes special articles.
In addition, three of the five reporters who made up the investigative-reporting team took the buyout.
Laura Morgan, a spokeswoman for the newspaper, said that despite the loss of some talented reporters, The Times retained considerable talent, including one of the largest news staffs of any American newspaper.
Many writers and editors who are taking the buyout said in interviews that they had decided to do so because the offer was so generous that it would allow them to pursue other projects, like writing books and starting private ventures. Those interviewed said they would receive between $100,000 and $200,000.
But some said they were leaving The Times because they were dissatisfied with the working environment and the policies of the current management, mentioning David Laventhol, the publisher, and Shelby Coffey 3d, the editor.
 
Pay Discrimination Charged
 Ms. Stumbo said she was leaving because she learned when discussing the buyout with other reporters that male counterparts were making $10,000 to $30,000 more than she did.
"I make the same as some entry-level reporters, and I find it degrading, and I won't do it anymore," said Ms. Stumbo, 49, who has been at The Times for 21 years and is paid $67,000 a year. "I can do better slinging hash down at Denny's and certainly with more dignity."
Mr. Coffey declined to respond directly to Ms. Stumbo, but said that since he had become editor in 1989, The Times had often examined the salaries of women and members of ethnic minorities and made adjustments in individual cases.
Speaking more generally of the buyouts, he said, "It's not an easy process, but it certainly speaks to the quality of the company that we are doing it with buyouts and not layoffs."
He indicated that The Times would be pursuing various ways of replacing those who accepted buyouts -- including some new hiring and some transfers within departments. Efforts would be made to keep the hiring at a minimum, Mr. Coffey said.
Some reporters had mixed feelings about leaving. Tracy Wood, a member of the investigative reporting team, said she had been treated well by the paper. "It was a difficult decision for me to leave," she said, "but right now it's the perfect opportunity for me to do something different." She plans to write a book.
Times Mirror plans to take an accounting charge against earnings in the fourth quarter to pay for the employee-reduction program. It declined to say how much that would be, but indicated that it would release fourth-quarter earnings this week.
In addition to The Los Angeles Times, Times Mirror's big dailies are Newsday, The Baltimore Sun and The Hartford Courant. The Times and Newsday are its two largest operating companies and together account for $1.5 billion in revenue.
"Theoretically these cuts will have little impact on the news side," Edward J. Atorino of Salomon Brothers said, "but if at some point the consumer or reader notices that a certain columnist is gone or that the quality and sophistication of the reporting has declined, it could begin to affect circulation. If they are cutting fat no one will notice, but if they cut some muscle they certainly won't be as strong, and we all know that it takes time to rebuild strength."

HEADLINE: Fund-Raising Efforts Reveal Mayoral Candidates' Strategies

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
The angry sound bites of the New York City mayoral election are months away, but for more than a year a quiet campaign has been busily afoot: the race for millions of dollars to make it all possible. The candidates' cash says much about them and their strategies for winning.
Mayor David N. Dinkins, though scarred by three tumultuous years in City Hall, is also flush with the powers of incumbency, and it shows in his most recent fund-raising reports, released last month. 
 Not only has the Democratic Mayor collected money from the municipal unions that long supported him but he has also drawn tens of thousands of dollars from Wall Street bankers who were not always his friends but now want the city's bond business, which he helps dispense.
City Council President Andrew J. Stein, who has said he intends to challenge Mr. Dinkins in the Democratic mayoral primary in September, is relying on a relative handful of large contributions from old friends. His parents have given him $200,000 -- one-sixth of all the money he raised in the last six months.
 
Countering an Advantage
 Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican former Federal prosecutor who lost to Mr. Dinkins by just two percentage points in 1989 and who plans a rematch this November, has tried to show he can counter the Democrats' huge advantage in registered voters with grass-roots fund raising that has produced thousands of smaller contributions. His contributors include scores of Korean-Americans still smarting at Mr. Dinkins's handling of a black-led boycott of two Korean-owned groceries in Brooklyn in 1990, though many are undoubtedly new immigrants and ineligible to vote.
"Everybody starts with their strengths, and then you move out," said Norman Adler, a Brooklyn-based political consultant and a veteran of many city campaigns. "My mother likes to say that in the winter there are three ingredients for success in the fall. The first is raising money. The second is raising money. And the third is raising money."
By the end, all the candidates will have scoured every corner, and Mr. Dinkins can count on hundreds of small contributions from his supporters in black churches and community organizations.
But for the moment, the contrasts among the candidates' coffers are striking. In the last six months, Mr. Giuliani raised just over $1 million from 2,100 contributors, for an average gift of about $485. Mr. Dinkins took in just over $1 million from 847 contributors, or an average of nearly $1,200 each. Mr. Stein raised just under $1.3 million from only 212 contributors, or an average of more than $6,000 per giver.
A fourth potential candidate, Herman Badillo, a Democrat and former Bronx borough president who hopes to lure enough Hispanic and Jewish voters to hold Mayor Dinkins to less than 40 percent of the primary vote and force a runoff, says he is only now beginning his fund raising. Mr. Badillo, a lawyer, has taken in $112,000 -- $100,000 of it as a loan from a friend, Raymond Greenwald, a Manhattan landlord.
Altogether, Mr. Stein has raised the most in absolute terms, $4.7 million, compared with about $3 million for Mr. Dinkins and $2.25 million for Mr. Giuliani, but he has also had the highest expenses, for fancy parties and high-priced consultants. The three major candidates all have roughly comparable amounts on hand -- around $2 million, including the matching public funds for which Mr. Giuliani and the Mayor are eligible because they have agreed to abide by voluntary limits on contributions and spending. In the end, the race will cost more than $20 million.
 
Leading in Polls
 Recent polls have shown Mr. Dinkins leading Mr. Stein by double-digit margins, and slightly ahead of Mr. Giuliani. That is an improvement from his standing at the height of the city's fiscal troubles 18 months ago, but the race remains volatile.
Television advertising will be the biggest expense, and Mr. Stein has made clear that he wants to be first on the air, probably by early March, with a series of Perot-like "infomercials" stressing his as yet unspecified prescriptions for fixing the city's ills.
The Mayor's aides believe that Mr. Stein will broadcast the commercials and then see how they alter his standing in the polls, and that if he does not like what he finds, will bow out.
"Wishful thinking in the extreme," said Mr. Stein, who twice defeated Mr. Dinkins in Manhattan borough president races a decade ago. "I am in the race and will be in the race and will beat Dinkins. I beat him twice, I know the guy and there's no doubt in my mind that I can do a better job."
But so far Mr. Stein's fund raising reflects his status as a not entirely welcome challenger in his own party. Mr. Dinkins has more or less of a lock on municipal unions and other Democratic regulars, and Mr. Stein is relying on rich businessmen and longtime friends of his family. His supporters are led by his father, Jerry Finkelstein, a former publisher of The New York Law Journal who is now a majority owner of a company that owns several community newspapers.
 
Limits on Contributions
 Alone among the candidates, Mr. Stein has declined to join the city's public campaign finance program, which limits individual contributions to $6,500 for the primary and general election combined, and a candidate's spending to $4 million in each election. Under state law, he may accept contributions of up to $50,000 each in the primary and general elections and has no limits on overall spending.
His rivals and many civic groups have criticized this, but he counters that the public opposes taxpayer-financed campaigns. "If your parents aren't your biggest supporters, who's going to be?" Mr. Stein asked. "Nobody's going to buy the election. The election's going to be decided on positive ideas."
But Mr. Stein acknowledged that "I haven't crystallized as a really strong alternative yet."
By contrast, Mr. Giuliani, a lawyer, has labored to show he is a credible alternative in a strongly Democratic city. He has held small house parties throughout the five boroughs, starting at $125 a person, and offered a choice of $500 or $1,000 tickets at his two major hotel banquets. One result of that is a campaign ledger littered with $50 and $75 contributions.
 
'Much More Difficult'
 "I think that may be a better indication than any poll of the depth of his potential," said David Garth, the media consultant who led both John V. Lindsay and Edward I. Koch to mayoral victories and is now helping Mr. Giuliani. "It's not everything, but it points in the direction of how many people across this city are willing to support him. For some of these people, it's a much more difficult contribution to make in terms of their income."
Perhaps most significantly, it maximizes Mr. Giuliani's potential to win matching public funds since the city matches contributions from city residents dollar per dollar only up to the first $1,000 of any contribution.
In fact, since Mr. Stein is not participating in the public system, Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Badillo will probably each be eligible to receive matching money at twice the usual rate -- $2 in public funds for every $1 they raise -- though still only to the limit of $2 million in matching funds for each.
"In terms of the Rudy-Stein competition for who's going to be the Mayor's opponent, it's a significant symbol," Hank Morris, a Democratic consultant not tied to any of the candidates, said of Mr. Giuliani's efforts.
For his part, the Mayor is not only depending on his solid base of support among black voters -- who account for as much as one-third of the primary electorate. He is also taking advantage of incumbency, raising tens of thousands of dollars from concerns that must do business with the city.
Like his predecessors, Mr. Dinkins has had particular success among investment banking houses competing to share in the city's lucrative bond underwriting business, for which new contracts are to be awarded this spring under bid proposals that are now circulating. Mr. Dinkins and Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman make the awards jointly.
Determining how much Mr. Dinkins has raised from Wall Street is difficult because the state financial disclosure forms his campaign has filed do not list the business addresses of givers, so it is not clear when individual partners at a single firm "bundle" gifts together. The city forms, to be required when Mr. Dinkins applies for matching funds this summer, are more detailed.
Mr. Dinkins's aides are happy to acknowledge his advantages.
"I think the Mayor is comfortable," said his press secretary, Leland T. Jones. "The basic fact of political life that both Stein and Giuliani and Badillo and anyone who runs against him is going to have to face is the comfort curve."

The three announced candidates in the New York City mayoral race have all been busy raising money. Mayor David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani are participating in the city's campaign finance program, which limits individual contributions to $6,500 for the election cycle. City Council President Andrew J. Stein is allowed under state law to accept contributions of up to $50,000 each in the primary and general election.

Ads Down, Los Angeles Times Again Cuts Staff

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Under pressure to cut costs amid a severe advertising slump, The Los Angeles Times is carrying out a voluntary buyout program, its second in 18 months. The program will trim the staff by 9 percent, but also strip The Times, the nation's largest metropolitan daily newspaper, of some of its most respected reporters.
The paper, flagship of the Times Mirror Company, announced on Thursday that 668 of its 7,500 employees had accepted the buyout, which is considered generous. It provides as much as two years' salary and 18 months of medical benefits for employees and their dependents. 
 This buyout, the previous one, and other recent measures like the closing in November of the paper's San Diego edition, are expected to save The Times a total of about $16 million.
 
Blues in the Sun
 Every dollar will help. The Times is published in what is now one of the country's weakest economic regions. Recovery is slow in Southern California, and newspaper ad revenues remain depressed. Classified advertising has fallen 16.5 percent since 1991, national advertising 15.8 percent and retail advertising 3 percent, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulation.
The paper planned to eliminate 500 jobs through attrition and the severance program, which was offered to 5,200 employees. Editors and reporters familiar with the process, and who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 800 to 850 had signed up for it.
So popular was the buyout that many high-profile reporters subscribed, prompting top editors to hold private meetings with several reporters and editors and persuade some of them not to accept. Some other employees who signed up for the buyout did not qualify.
In typical buyout arrangements, newspapers seek to persuade older, higher-paid employees to retire early, which can result in large savings.
But The Times is losing some outstanding journalists. Of 88 news and editorial-page employees who took the buyout, some names stand out: Paul Conrad, its political cartoonist, who has won the Pulitzer Prize three times; Bella Stumbo, a highly regarded writer known for her profiles; Laurie Becklund, a top metropolitan reporter, and Robert Scheer, who writes special articles.
In addition, three of the five reporters who made up the investigative-reporting team took the buyout.
Laura Morgan, a spokeswoman for the newspaper, said that despite the loss of some talented reporters, The Times retained considerable talent, including one of the largest news staffs of any American newspaper.
Many writers and editors who are taking the buyout said in interviews that they had decided to do so because the offer was so generous that it would allow them to pursue other projects, like writing books and starting private ventures. Those interviewed said they would receive between $100,000 and $200,000.
But some said they were leaving The Times because they were dissatisfied with the working environment and the policies of the current management, mentioning David Laventhol, the publisher, and Shelby Coffey 3d, the editor.
 
Pay Discrimination Charged
 Ms. Stumbo said she was leaving because she learned when discussing the buyout with other reporters that male counterparts were making $10,000 to $30,000 more than she did.
"I make the same as some entry-level reporters, and I find it degrading, and I won't do it anymore," said Ms. Stumbo, 49, who has been at The Times for 21 years and is paid $67,000 a year. "I can do better slinging hash down at Denny's and certainly with more dignity."
Mr. Coffey declined to respond directly to Ms. Stumbo, but said that since he had become editor in 1989, The Times had often examined the salaries of women and members of ethnic minorities and made adjustments in individual cases.
Speaking more generally of the buyouts, he said, "It's not an easy process, but it certainly speaks to the quality of the company that we are doing it with buyouts and not layoffs."
He indicated that The Times would be pursuing various ways of replacing those who accepted buyouts -- including some new hiring and some transfers within departments. Efforts would be made to keep the hiring at a minimum, Mr. Coffey said.
Some reporters had mixed feelings about leaving. Tracy Wood, a member of the investigative reporting team, said she had been treated well by the paper. "It was a difficult decision for me to leave," she said, "but right now it's the perfect opportunity for me to do something different." She plans to write a book.
Times Mirror plans to take an accounting charge against earnings in the fourth quarter to pay for the employee-reduction program. It declined to say how much that would be, but indicated that it would release fourth-quarter earnings this week.
In addition to The Los Angeles Times, Times Mirror's big dailies are Newsday, The Baltimore Sun and The Hartford Courant. The Times and Newsday are its two largest operating companies and together account for $1.5 billion in revenue.
"Theoretically these cuts will have little impact on the news side," Edward J. Atorino of Salomon Brothers said, "but if at some point the consumer or reader notices that a certain columnist is gone or that the quality and sophistication of the reporting has declined, it could begin to affect circulation. If they are cutting fat no one will notice, but if they cut some muscle they certainly won't be as strong, and we all know that it takes time to rebuild strength."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 2, 1993, Tuesday / February 3, 1993, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
A chart on the Media Business page of Business Day yesterday with an article about staff reductions at The Los Angeles Times carried incorrect dates in some copies for quarterly operating income of the newspaper group of the parent company, Times Mirror. A corrected chart appears today on page D20.
An article on the Media Business page of Business Day on Monday about cost-cutting programs at The Los Angeles Times misstated the expected saving. The combined annual saving from an early-retirement program in 1991 and the closing of the San Diego edition last December is $24 million. The Times expects the saving from a recent voluntary employee buyout program to be at least another $24 million.
Because of an editing error, the article also misstated the source for the paper's advertising figures. They were provided by the newspaper, not by the Audit Bureau of Circulations.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT ALLOWS STATES FLEXIBILITY ON MEDICAID FUNDS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
President Clinton today ordered the Federal Government to make it easier for states to use Medicaid funds to introduce new health-care programs for the poor. His goal is to add much greater flexibility to a health-care system often constrained by Federal regulations.
The red tape Mr. Clinton seeks to loosen has hindered states seeking to experiment and innovate, making it difficult, for example, to take money earmarked for nursing-home care or for care in state mental institutions and spend it instead on home care for the same patients. Many patients prefer to be treated at home, and such care is usually less expensive.
 
Chance to Tailor Programs
 Mr. Clinton obtained approval for such a shift in spending when he was Governor of Arkansas. 
 The change in regulations ordered by President Clinton will not by itself automatically save any money for either the states or the Federal Government, except by reducing paperwork. But White House officials and governors said the increased flexibility would allow them to better cover the growing number of Medicaid applicants by tailoring programs to meet a state's particular needs.
For instance, a growing number of states have gained or sought waivers allowing them to enlist Medicaid recipients in health maintenance organizations, so they will go there for primary care instead of costly emergency rooms, and be seen by the same doctor or group of doctors to provide continuity. Such an experimental program begun in southwest Brooklyn recently is scheduled to be extended throughout New York City within five years.
 
First in Series of Moves
 Medicaid waivers have also been granted to states that have wanted to experiment with novel ways of paying hospitals, doctors and nursing homes. Not every application has been approved: for instance, Oregon's proposal to expand health care for the poor through a system of rationing was rejected. Oregon is in the process of renewing its application for a modified system.
Mr. Clinton made the announcement at a meeting of the nation's governors, who are in Washington for their annual conference and had planned to seek such an easing of controls on states. The initiative is the first of a series that the President plans this week to try to refocus attention away from contentious issues, like the military's ban of homosexuals, that have dominated his Administration's opening days. He is seeking to turn attention instead to the core issues on which he ran for office: affordable health care, changes in the welfare system and economic recovery.
In a speech on Tuesday to the conference of the National Governors' Association, Mr. Clinton is scheduled to sketch out his ideas on welfare reform. During the campaign he said he would press for programs to increase education, training and child care for welfare recipients, in return for stricter requirements for them to obtain work in a set amount of time.
In a speech tonight, Mr. Clinton told a fund-raising dinner of the Democratic Governors Association that he did not think a few rough moments had tarnished "a pretty good start" in office. "If you just wanted me to do things that are easy you should have elected somebody else President," he said.
The Medicaid program, through which the Federal Government and states pay for health care for 30 million low-income Americans, welfare recipients and blind or disabled people, Medicaid is the fourth-largest item in the Federal budget, but the money is sent to states under a set of tightly defined rules established by Congress and monitored by the Department of Health and Human Services.
The Federal share of Medicaid last year was $67.8 billion, while states spent more than $50 billion.
 
'Byzantine' Paperwork
 States frequently apply for exemptions from the rules to introduce innovations they expect to save money or allow them to adapt to new health-care demands, while still covering all Medicaid applicants. But obtaining such exemptions has required bureaucratic paperwork that Mr. Clinton called "Byzantine and counterproductive." As a result, the programs covered by waivers account for only a small portion of the total spent on Medicaid.
Mr. Clinton told the governors in their two hours of talks today that he was ordering the Health and Human Services Department to streamline the process in two ways immediately.
To begin with, the department and its health-care financing agency, will no longer be allowed to make numerous requests for information and clarifications on a state's waiver application. From now on, Mr. Clinton said, the department and its regional centers "will have only one opportunity to ask for additional information and clarifications on a state's waiver requests."
The President also said he was ordering the Health Care Financing Administration to develop a list of state programs that have already been approved, so other states seeking to start similar programs could adopt them immediately without having to go through the paperwork themselves.
In addition, the President said he was ordering the agency to consult with the National Governors' Association to conduct a "rapid review of the entire waiver process," which will come up with more streamlining methods within 60 days.
"If I could put it in simple terms," said Mr. Clinton, summing up his announcement today, "it amounts to this. The Federal Government requires the states to provide a certain number of health services in a certain way to people who are poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. The states very often believe that they can provide more services at lower costs if we don't impose our rules and regulations upon them.
"For years and years and years, governors have been screaming for relief from a cumbersome process by which the Federal Government has micromanaged the health-care system affecting poor Americans," added Mr. Clinton, who labored under these restrictions in his five terms as Governor of Arkansas. "We are going to try to give them that relief."
 
Negotiations on Taxes
 He also said his Administration would reopen negotiations with the governors over taxes that some states charge doctors and hospitals. Many states use the taxes to gain Federal matching money for Medicaid, then return the taxes back to doctors and hospitals by increasing the fees they receive, while using the Federal matching money to expand their Medicaid programs. In 1991 Congress restricted such tax maneuvers, a restriction many states opposed.
Assessing the proposed changes on waivers, Trish Riley, director of the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonprofit research unit for state health issues, said: "It is an important step. It will save untold administrative dollars, because anyone who has had the unpleasant experience of writing a waiver application knows they are long, tedious and time-consuming."
Welcoming Mr. Clinton's moves today, Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas said: "At last, the states are going to be given an opportunity to deliver health care." That sentiment was shared by the governors at the White House session, as well as important members of Congress.

HEADLINE: ISRAEL TO RETURN 100 PALESTINIANS IT HAD DEPORTED

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Tuesday, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Yielding to international pressure and convinced that its relations with the Clinton Administration are at stake, Israel agreed Monday night to send home immediately about 100 of the Palestinians it had deported to Lebanon and to cut the exile period for the remaining 300 in half, to a year.
In return, the Israelis said, they had assurances from the United States that it would block United Nations sanctions, which have been threatened because Israel defied a Security Council resolution demanding that all the deportees be brought back to the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin announced that the Americans had also promised to try to breathe new life into the stalled Middle East peace talks. The future of the negotiations has been uncertain since the Dec. 17 expulsions of 415 Palestinians accused of being militant Islamic fundamentalists and threats to Israeli security.
 
'Not Salami Tactics'
 "These are not salami tactics -- it's a package deal," Mr. Rabin said at a late-night news conference. Israel also agreed to let helicopters deliver relief shipments to the deportees who remain, he said.
It was far from clear early today, however, if the banished Palestinians would accept an arrangement that brings some of them back but leaves most still sitting in a makeshift tent camp on frozen ground between Israeli and Lebanese Army checkpoints. Initial signs were that their answer would be no, even though 19 of them have come home in the last few weeks because they fell ill or were found to have been deported by mistake.
 
A Hamas Leader Rejects Offer
 After hearing unofficial reports of the compromise as it was being submitted to the Rabin Cabinet but before it was approved unanimously, the group's spokesman, Abdul Aziz al-Rantisi, a Gazan leader of the Hamas Islamic movement, rejected the idea of allowing only some of the deportees to return home.
Although she was in no position to speak for the deportees, Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, also insisted that the Security Council require that Resolution 799, calling for the exiles' return, be carried out in full.
"If this is a deal with the United States, it is obviously in violation of its own vote at the United Nations," she said.
But Mr. Rabin said that his bargain was with the Americans and that its enforcement "does not depend on whether the Hamas deportees respond to it."
If the 100 or so men being offered a chance to go home do not accept the offer, "then that's their problem," a senior official said.
 
Details Remain Unsettled
 Officials said early today that the mechanics of selecting these deportees, not to mention how they will physically be brought back, still had to be worked out. Just about all would probably wind up in detention camps or prisons, they said.
The Palestinians eligible to be brought back right away are those who were expelled for up to 18 months, a group comprising roughly 100 men. The other 300 or so were deported for two years. They will now have that period sliced to a year, although some reports said they could be gradually taken back even sooner.
According to officials, all the cases are to be studied as part of a review of security files being conducted by special military committees established last week under conditions outlined by the Israeli High Court of Justice. Mr. Rabin said that the United States had promised to try to find a third country to receive the remaining Palestinians, since Lebanon has refused to accept them, but the likelihood of quick success on this score seemed small.
For Mr. Rabin, there were two dominant considerations for backing down on the expulsion of hundreds of Hamas leaders and sympathizers accused of responsibility for anti-Israeli violence.
One was the threat of United Nations sanctions, which Mr. Rabin warned would "wipe out the chances for peace in the Middle East." The other was his desire to start off on the right foot with the new American Administration. The Administration advised him that while it opposed sanctions, it also expected Israeli help in avoiding the point where it would feel compelled to use its Security Council veto.
"We should have prepared ourselves for the struggle in the international arena with the reality of a new Administration in the United States," Mr. Rabin acknowledged.
In addition, support for a hard line had begun to wane within his own Cabinet as it became increasingly clear that the crisis was not about to disappear and that Israel's diplomatic standing would suffer. An anonymous poll of 18 Cabinet ministers conducted recently by Israel Television showed that a majority supported an early return of the deportees.
 
Talks With U.S. Officials
 Finally, after a series of weekend discussions with American officials, including Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Mr. Rabin agreed to the "package deal."
"I don't pretend to present this as an easy decision," he said.
Moshe Katsav, parliamentary leader of the opposition Likud Party, denounced the arrangement as "a surrender to terrorist organizations," but Government officials rejected that characterization.
"Retreat? Certainly not," said Gad Ben-Ari, the Prime Minister's spokesman. "Compromise? Yes."
Environment Minister Yossi Sarid said after the Cabinet vote Monday night that "whoever thought the whole issue could end without a compromise, without a contribution by Israel, was being either naive or disingenuous."
"We are getting full backing from the United States," he said. "There is no more fear that sanctions will be imposed."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Christopher Backs Move
 UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 1 (Special to The New York Times) -- Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today that the Israeli formula to resolve the status of the Palestinian deportees was a "breakthrough" consistent with a Security Council resolution demanding their immediate return to Israel.
As a result, Mr. Christopher said, there would be no need for Security Council sanctions against Israel.
"As a consequence of the steps that Israel will take, we believe that further action by the Security Council is unnecessary and could even undercut the process which is under way," he said.
The United States consulted with allies and other Council members, and will continue to, he said, but repeated the message that sanctions against Israel were not warranted.
In Brussels tonight, Niels Helvig Petersen, the Danish Foreign Minister and chairman of the European Council, called Israel's actions "very helpful in improving relations." But he did not say whether negotiations would open on extending the European Community's economic cooperation agreement with Israel.
Shimon Peres, the Israeli Foreign Minister, had appeared at the monthly meeting of the community's foreign ministers to discuss updating Israel's 1975 economic agreement. The foreign ministers had implied that the economic agreement would not be discussed until Israel changed its policy. To Israel, the agreement means about $20 million a year in development loans and access to the lucrative European produce market.

HEADLINE: White House Memo;
President's Early Troubles Rooted in Party's Old Strains

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
When Bill Clinton was a candidate, his electoral promise was that he could straddle the gulf between populism and elitism, between the concerns of the middle classes that provide the Democratic Party's electoral muscle and those of the more liberal academic theorists who provide its ideology.
But so far, Mr. Clinton has appeared to embody that struggle rather than resolve it, sending signals late in his transition and in his first two weeks in office that blended the suburban populist concerns of his campaign with the special interests of the party elite.
 
Seeking a New Focus
 With the President's political advisers concerned over the perception thus wrought, the Administration is trying aggressively this week to refocus its image as a Government of broad middle-class interests. 
 Today, in the first of a week's worth of gestures intended to showcase such an image, Mr. Clinton ordered Federal bureaucrats to make it easier for states to administer their health-care programs. Tuesday, he plans to deliver a speech to the National Governors' Association reprising the promises of welfare changes that helped win him support among working-class Democrats who had voted Republican in recent Presidential races.
The shift in attention is crucial to the Administration after a week dominated by the politically unwelcome fight over whether homosexuals should be allowed to serve in the armed forces.
"It was unfortunate that gays in the military was the President's first major issue," said one White House official. "The danger is that people around the country are saying to themselves: 'Oh, My God. So this is why this guy sought office.' It was an accident. It wasn't like Clinton said 'O.K., it's Day 1 and I want to put down my marker on this Presidency, and I want that marker to be gays in the military.' "
And so Mr. Clinton will work to remind middle-class voters that he is one with them, stressing his commitment to a welfare overhaul, even though he has nothing much to say on the subject that he did not say a thousand times last year.
"This is not a substance speech," said the White House aide, speaking on a condition of anonymity. "This is not the legislative package. This is the President saying: 'This is important to me. These are my goals. Work with me.' "
The sudden imperative for Mr. Clinton to remind middle-class voters that he shares their concerns grows directly out of a tension that has long strained his party.
Nowhere is this tension more perfectly embodied than in Mr. Clinton. He is the son of a working-class family and a low-rent state, a man whose tastes are as naturally middle-brow as Harry Truman's. A founding member of the Democratic Leadership Council, set up to counter what some saw as the party's overly liberal tilt,he has succeeded in the past as a political middle-of-the-roader.
 
Which Clinton Ran?
 But Mr. Clinton is also a member in excellent standing of the intellectual elite, at least as at home in the academy as he is in a bowling alley. He is the product of Georgetown, Oxford and Yale, a lawyer and a career politician and a longstanding participant in the endlessly running liberal policy debate the political writer Sidney Blumenthal calls "the Conversation."
It was the middle-class Mr. Clinton who ran for President, and his ability to define himself as the quintessential candidate of suburban populism won the election. "I am the one person in this race who really comes from the great American middle class and understands the American dream," Mr. Clinton said.
He would use the White House, he said, to build "a plan for America's renewal," to cut middle-class taxes, to "end welfare as we know it," to make the streets safer and the schools better, to provide "basic health care to all Americans." He would soak the rich and put the poor to work. He would protect Social Security and Medicare recipients from Washington budget cutters. He would do away with the sleazy, bloated "business as usual" in Washington.
Now, some of Mr. Clinton's supporters are wondering what happened to that candidate.
 
Both Wrong and Stupid?
 "Here he is 10 days into his Administration, and all the signals he is sending are to the opposite of what he conveyed in the campaign," said Ben J. Wattenberg, a political analyst and neo-conservative Democrat who endorsed Mr. Clinton but now says he is seriously reconsidering. "It's worse than wrong; it's stupid."
Over the course of his transition and first days in office, Mr. Clinton moved in a number of ways that went sharply against the middle-class concerns and values he championed as a candidate, but were perfectly attuned to the party elite.
He filled 13 of his 18 Cabinet seats with well-heeled lawyers, giving the important business seats of Commerce and Trade Representative to, respectively, the lawyer-lobbyists Ronald H. Brown and Mickey Kantor, men who had made their riches doing the bidding of corporate clients.
He abandoned the campaign pretense that his wife was more cookie baker than policy maker, and Hillary Rodham Clinton moved into the West Wing as the President's most important adviser.
 
Whither the Tax Cut?
 He seemed to abandon as well the old campaign promise of a middle-class tax cut, as Administration officials floated the possibilities of consumption taxes, energy taxes and even cuts in Social Security benefits.
Ahead of the economic concerns on which he had promised to "focus like a laser," he allowed his Adminisration to focus first on the divisive issue of homosexuals in the military.
"He ran as a populist, and now he has surrounded himself with the intellectual elite of his party, and is devoting himself to their concerns." said one Democratic consultant. "I don't think anyone ever expected that gays in the military -- which is a classic example of an issue of great concern to the intellectuals but not what the middle class wants to focus on at all -- would be the primary focus of the first week of a Clinton Administration. There never was a sign on the wall in Little Rock, Ark., that said, 'It's the gays in the military, stupid.' "
 
An Act of Brilliance?
 Robert Borosage, a former adviser to the Rev. Jesse Jackson and a policy maven at the liberal Campaign for New Priorities, sees Mr. Clinton's dichotomy as an act of political brilliance, in which the agenda of the left-leaning intellectual elite of the party was protected, and to some degree hidden, by Mr. Clinton's skill at keeping the attention focused on himself as a populist on economic issues.
"What Clinton did was combine a populist economic agenda on jobs, re-investment and health care with a remarkably liberal agenda on social concerns, such as choice, feminism and gays and lesbians" he said.
"What has happened now is that the populist economic agenda has gotten submerged, which is bad. It's not the emphasis on gay and lesbian issues lately that has hurt Clinton; it's the lack of attention at the same time to the economic agenda."

HEADLINE: Governors Praise Ex-Colleague in the White House

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
President Clinton spent 12 years building good will with the nation's governors, and today they went to work to pay him back.
Clearly pleased to have one of their own back in the White House, the governors were not as quick as many members of Congress or the news media to write off his first days in office. They were encouraged, both Democrats and Republicans said, by Mr. Clinton's announcement today that the Administration will give them greater leeway on health care. 
 "It was simply unbelievable to have the opportunity to exchange ideas with someone who understood what we were talking about," Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas said after leaving the White House with members of the National Governors' Association, which Mr. Clinton led in 1987.
But the Texas Democrat said that, sadly, the President's honeymoon was already over. "I don't think anyone allowed him what is customarily the honeymoon period," she said. "They didn't give Clinton that. And it is a gift. And I think he's very upbeat, and he has, fortunately for the country, a long-term view of the things he needs to do. He's pretty focused on that."
 
Advice on News Media
 Gov. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, a Democrat, was not about to characterize Mr. Clinton's first days in office as stumbling. His harshest appraisal was that the Administration may be off to "a very public start."
Mr. Nelson went on to say: "If you look at what we're talking about in deficit reduction and health care, there isn't stumbling. It's appropriate that everything's on the table right now rather than having him to come to us with 'Here's my 21-point plan.' He's continuing his style of doing what he does best and in the manner he does best."
Mr. Nelson also offered unsolicited advice for reporters: "My belief is that if the media and everybody else would give him a break on some of this, and adapt to his style rather than try to put him into a pigeonhole or some other category, things would be O.K."
Perhaps because they had worked closely with Mr. Clinton, or perhaps because they wanted the new President to look kindly upon their states, many Republican governors also praised him.
"I don't fault him," said Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts. "I think it may take away some momentum when the press writes about what they've been writing about instead of the economic plan. But I can tell you he focused with laserlike intensity on the economy in the three-hour session this morning. He's thinking about the right things." (Last summer, Mr. Weld did not offer such kind words; he traveled to Little Rock, Ark., on behalf of the Bush campaign to attack Mr. Clinton's record as Governor.)
Even Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina, an outspoken Republican, sounded encouraged after meeting with Mr. Clinton. "This President came in as a governor having been on the front line with the practical experience," he said, "and that may increase sensitivity to the specifics of what we talked about."
Mr. Clinton made it plain to the governors today that he expected to continue to turn to them for support. "The day before my inauguration, on one of the last days people called me Governor, I had lunch with many of the Governors here and many others with whom I had served over the past 14 years," he said. "I pledged to them a partnership between the country's governors and this Administration, rooted in our common experience on the front lines of people's lives."

HEADLINE: Dallas Journal;
Big Victory In Football Encourages Wider Hope

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Feb. 1

 BODY:
The venerable, fedora-topped Tom Landry was revered as the coach of America's Team, as the Dallas Cowboys were called in the 1970's. But what about Jimmy Johnson, his helmet-haired, ice-water-in-the-veins successor?
The Cowboys are back, and it was Mr. Johnson who masterminded a remarkable turnaround in the fortunes of a team that had not made it to the Super Bowl since 1979. As fans here wildly celebrated the team's 52-17 trouncing of the Buffalo Bills in Pasadena on Sunday, they readily proclaimed a new era of Cowboy dominance, and some even saw the victory as a harbinger of a much-needed economic resurgence for their city. 
 But many seemed much less sure about elevating Mr. Johnson to the mythic stature accorded Mr. Landry.
"I don't know," said Donna Eddins, a nurse who had driven 90 miles from the North Texas town of Honey Grove this morning to be among the first to buy an official "Cowboys -- Super Bowl Champions" shirt at the team's official licensed-products store here.
"You are talking about two very different personalities," Ms. Eddins said. "I mean, Landry was kind of a national hero. Somehow, I just can't imagine any of his players doing a Gatorade dunk on Tom Landry."
Mr. Johnson, his stern demeanor notwithstanding, was drenched Sunday night, perhaps the only time all season that a strand of his hair could be seen out of place.
But even if sports-obsessed Dallasites have not yet come to revere Mr. Johnson, they seem immensely grateful for his success. With a baseball team that has never made it to the playoffs, and a basketball team that is on course this season to set an N.B.A. record for losses, this city found the Cowboys' world championship particularly welcome.
And it sure seems to have salved the anger at Mr. Landry's unceremonious dismissal by the Cowboys' new owner four years ago.
Even though many felt the time had arrived for Mr. Landry to be eased out gracefully, there was near-mutiny when he had to learn from a radio report that he was out of a job and when the new owner, an Arkansas natural-gas baron named Jerry Jones, hired Mr. Johnson, his fellow lineman on the 1964 University of Arkansas squad, as coach. Tens of thousands turned out in the streets for a thank-you procession that basically martyrized Mr. Landry, and the new leadership was both vilified and ridiculed when the team finished 1-15 in the 1989 season.
Mr. Jones was even jeered by Texans as "the Hillbilly of Valley Ranch," a reference to his Arkansas roots and the name of the Cowboys' training camp.
But as people here came to find out, some Arkansans know a thing or two about how to win. "These guys may come from Arkansas, but they didn't come into town on a wagon load of hay," said Tom Blackstone, a fan from Richardson, a Dallas suburb.
"Nobody liked the way they did it," Mr. Blackstone said of the dismissal of Mr. Landry. "But the other side of the coin is, they're winning again."
Beyond the sweet satisfaction of winning a 60-minute football game, some people in Dallas think their team's triumph after a decade of frustration could mirror a rebound for Dallas after a decade of rising crime and unemployment.
"We both went into the same tank and stayed there for the same period of time, said Mayor Steve Bartlett. "Now America's team rebounded, and in many ways Dallas is on the road to becoming America's city again." He cited slight job growth in recent months and the fact that 40 big companies had relocated or expanded operations here last year.
Whether a sports team can engender profound social or economic shifts remains to be seen, of course. But it is clear that the Cowboys have proved a short-term boon to some segments of the local economy.
Still, not everybody here, it should be noted, is a Cowboys' fan. Tammy DeMarco moved to Dallas from Niagara Falls, N.Y., six years ago only because her employer, the Occidental Chemical Corporation, moved some of its offices here.
"I'm still a Bills fan and proud of it," said Ms. DeMarco, a customer service representative. "I'm not going to just jump on some bandwagon because I live here now.
"I don't think you can find any fan truer than a Bills fan. If you haven't sat through a game in sleet, snow and freezing rain, you're not a fan."

HEADLINE: Missouri Senator Won't Seek 4th Term

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Senator John C. Danforth, an influential Republican moderate from Missouri, announced today that he would retire rather than seek a fourth term in 1994.
The 56-year-old Mr. Danforth, an Episcopal priest and a lawyer, said in an interview that he was looking into the possibility of working for the church and might also become associated with a law firm. 
 He said he would retire because he did not "want to end my days in government, and I didn't want the claim of government, the claim of politics, to be total."
Instead of running again, he said, he would "rather go back and start the next phase of my life."
He said his departure was not out of frustration with the Senate or his party. Speaking of his 24 years in public office, which began as state attorney general in 1969, he said, "It's been more interesting, more exciting, more challenging than anything I would have expected."
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, expressed regret when he heard of Mr. Danforth's plans to retire, saying in a statement, "Whether it's taking on the tough issue, making the tough votes, or moving us with his rare eloquence, Senator Danforth has earned the lasting respect of Republicans and Democrats."
 
One Moderate Voice
 Mr. Dole may miss Mr. Danforth's voice in the Republican conference, where there is increasing pressure from exponents of harder-edged conservatism. Mr. Danforth tangled with that side of his party repeatedly in 1991, when he led Republican efforts to agree on a civil rights bill that wouldundo several Supreme Court decisions making it harder to sue in job discrimination cases. His efforts, which Mr. Dole did not join but sometimes encouraged, forced President Bush's Administration to retreat and deal with Democrats led by Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.
Just a few days before the civil rights struggle, Mr. Danforth had prevailed in one of the toughest fights of his career as the Senate narrowly voted to confirm Clarence Thomas as a Supreme Court Justice. Justice Thomas was a protege and former aide of Mr. Danforth's in both the Senate and the Missouri attorney general's office.
He also led efforts last fall to override Mr. Bush's veto of legislation to reimpose some regulation on the cable television industry -- the only one of Mr. Bush's 35 vetoes to be overridden.
 
Candidate Emerges
 Representative Alan Wheat, a Democrat from Kansas City, put out the word that he was considering running for the seat. Mr. Wheat, a black who represents a district with a white majority, may be only the first of many Democratic hopefuls.
Of the 34 Senate seats up for election in 1994, Democrats are expected to be on the defensive, because they now hold 22 of them. But Mr. Danforth's retirement will give them a better chance of picking up the Missouri seat than they would have had if he had run again. There are now 57 Democrats and 43 Republicans in the Senate.
Mr. Danforth, an heir to the Ralston-Purina fortune, announced his retirement at a news conference at the airport in St. Louis, saying he and his wife were "overjoyed by the thought of starting a new phase of our lives with our family and friends" in St. Louis.
 
Work for Church
 In the telephone interview later, he said, "I want to make a better contribution to the church than I have to date." While he said he did not believe the parish ministry was his role, he said, "I have talked to my bishop about some kind of contribution to the church beyond what I've done."
But he also stressed, both in St. Louis and again in the interview, that he looked forward to a final two years in the Senate, where the Finance Committee will deal with the economy and health care. He has been an increasingly insistent advocate of shifting the basis of the tax system from taxing income to broad-based taxes on consumption, arguing that this change was essential to investment.
On the Commerce Committee, where he is the senior Republican, he said he would push efforts to bolster the nation's airplane manufacturers and airlines.

HEADLINE: 1,000 SAID TO DIE IN MUTINY IN ZAIRE

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, Tuesday, Feb. 2

 BODY:
A spokesman for the Prime Minister said today that at least 1,000 people had been killed in several days of fighting between rebellious soldiers and forces loyal to Zaire's authoritarian President.
Forces supporting President Mobutu Sese Seko sealed off the center of the capital on Monday as both foreigners and Zairians packed riverboats and roads to flee the widening battles. 
 "The estimates that we have allow us to confirm there were at least 1,000 dead, mostly soldiers," said Jean-Joseph Mukendi, a spokesman for Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi.
There was no way to verify the toll. But Western diplomats said Monday that hundreds of people had died over the last few days as Mr. Mobutu's presidential guard put down a mutiny.
 
The Lineup of Power
 In Brussels, Foreign Minister Willy Claes said Monday that at least 300 people were believed to have been killed since Mr. Mobutu sent in special forces to suppress army riots.
Mr. Tshisekedi is the chief rival to President Mobutu, who has ruled the country for more than 27 years, and the violence has become a power struggle between the two men.
Mr. Mobutu has accused Mr. Tshisekedi of causing the violence by urging soldiers to refuse to accept newly printed 5-million-zaire bank notes as pay. A statement read on state television Monday night said that anyone refusing to accept the new zaire notes would be guilty of treason, and that 10-million-zaire notes (worth about $4) would soon be introduced.
Zaire's economy has collapsed, but Mr. Mobutu has refused to cede control of the treasury to the transitional Government led by Mr. Tshisekedi. Mr. Mobutu named the Government under pressure from the United States, France and other aid donors.
France and Belgium sent troops over the weekend to Brazzaville, Congo, across the Congo River from Kinshasa, to evacuate foreigners; the French Ambassador to Zaire and six other foreigners were shot dead last week.
Presidential guards blocked off the Gombe district, where hundreds of foreigners have sought refuge, on Monday, when about 500 Belgian, French and Italian refugees left for Brazzaville, escorted by presidential guards. More than 1,000 foreigners had been evacuated earlier.
The unrest is the worst since Belgium and France sent soldiers in September 1991 after riots by unpaid troops triggered the evacuation of 20,000 foreigners.
There were reports Monday that the riots had spread to eastern Zaire. North of Goma, on the border with Rwanda, about 600 refugees fled to Uganda over the weekend, a spokesman for the the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said. The agency's representative in Uganda said Zairian troops were harassing the refugees and stealing their belongings.

HEADLINE: Cambridge Edges Out Chicago

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
In the realm of economics, the arrival of President Clinton means that the liberals from Cambridge have been anointed and the conservatives from Chicago have been banished.
In making several sages with M.I.T. doctorates the new suzerains of economic affairs, the Clinton Administration has endorsed the Cambridge school's prevailing view that government has a powerful role to play in building a stronger economy. 
 That ends the reign of the free-market Chicago school -- under the influence of the University of Chicago -- which infused the Reagan and Bush Administrations with the notion that whenever government sticks its nose into economic affairs it is bound to mess them up.
"The Clinton Government promises to do exactly the kind of economics that M.I.T. is all about," said Rudiger Dornbusch, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "That means a lot of belief in the market, but determined government intervention when there is a need for it."
For example, with the wages of more and more full-time workers falling below the poverty line, the Cambridge approach would be for the Government to help low-wage workers get training for high-wage jobs.
So many economists with M.I.T. doctorates have been funneled into the new Administration that the economics department there might well replace its placement office with a direct pipeline to Washington.
Consider this. Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley and the chairman-designee of the Council of Economic Advisers, received a doctorate in economics from M.I.T. in 1974. Alan Blinder, chosen for a second council seat, earned his M.I.T. doctorate in 1971 before becoming a professor at Princeton. Creating a possible hat trick for M.I.T., Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Stanford professor with a 1966 M.I.T. doctorate, is being considered for the council's third seat.
Lawrence F. Katz, a Harvard professor selected to be the Labor Department's chief economist, received his M.I.T. doctorate in 1985, while David M. Cutler, a Harvard professor expected to work for the National Economic Council, received an M.I.T. doctorate in 1991. And that's not to mention Secretary of Defense Les Aspin, who received an economics doctorate from M.I.T. in 1965.
"We feel very good about all this," said Peter Temin, the chairman of M.I.T's economics department. While faculty members are not breaking out champagne, they hope M.I.T.'s success will help attract top-notch students the way an N.C.A.A. basketball championship helps a college woo high school all-stars.
Describing the M.I.T. economics philosophy, Mr. Temin said, "We believe the market is good for most things, but not for everything, as opposed to a more Chicago view where they think the market is good for everything."
The Chicago school gets its name from the University of Chicago, whose faculty included several seminal free-market theorists, including Milton Friedman and George Stigler.
"I worry about their activism," William A. Niskanen, a University of Chicago Ph.D., said of the arrivistes from M.I.T. He is chairman of the Cato Institute, a free-market research group in Washington, and was a member of President Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers.
 
Contrasting Views
 How will the Cambridge approach translate into policy? While many Chicago adherents support vouchers that would subsidize students to go to public or private school, the Cambridge approach would focus on education as a government function that needs to be improved. Cambridge folks are far more likely than their Cook County colleagues to favor increased deficit spending to pull the nation out of recession.
Chicago schoolers back lower income taxes and capital gains taxes, saying such taxes discourage work and investment. The M.I.T.-Cambridge people are not reflexively negative toward taxes. They are more open to raising taxes on the rich as a matter of equity, but many support an investment tax credit to encourage investing.
It should come as no surprise that these Cambridge views sound similar to Bill Clinton's campaign proposals: many of these M.I.T. people advised him during the campaign.
 
Partisan Differences
 "As President Clinton looks around for eminent people he would feel comfortable with, it's not surprising that he would go to M.I.T." said Gary S. Becker, a University of Chicago professor who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics last year. "There has always been more of an association with the Democratic Party than the Republican Party in Cambridge."
As M.I.T. people see it, their department is to economics what Mr. Clinton's law school alma mater, Yale, is to law -- each has a heavy focus on public policy. One professor said M.I.T.'s brand of economics was "technobabble with a heart."
To be sure, M.I.T.'s professors and students toss around highfalutin terms and complex econometric equations as effortlessly as anyone. The M.I.T. faculty boasts three Nobel laureates -- Paul Samuelson, Robert M. Solow and Franco Modigliani.
From the early 1960's through 1985 or so, these three attracted -- and churned out -- the best economics students in the nation, most economists agree. But with the Republicans in power for the last 12 years, M.I.T. produced an excess supply of Democratic economists yearning for their day in the Washington sun.
Then came Bill Clinton. Explaining why Mr. Clinton has plucked so much fruit off M.I.T.'s tree, Professor Samuelson said, "We're seeing the lagged harvest of M.I.T.'s being a crack world economics department."
Mr. Temin, the department head, insists that M.I.T.'s success in Washington shows that it still has the nation's best economics department. His colleagues across town at Harvard disagree, noting that two young stars with Harvard doctorates have received high-level economics posts.
 
The Harvard Contingent
 Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard professor, has been nominated Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, while Alicia Munnell, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston, has been chosen to be the Treasury's Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy. Harvard boosters note that despite all the M.I.T. doctorates, three of the new economics officials teach at Harvard.
But M.I.T. also claims Mr. Summers because he received his bachelor's degree from there, taught there for four years, and took graduate courses there while studying for his Harvard doctorate. Not only that, Professor Samuelson is his uncle.
"You'd have to cut up Larry Summers two ways," Professor Samuelson said. "His gizzard is M.I.T. and his liver is Harvard."
Mr. Katz, a Harvard professor with an M.I.T. doctorate, tries to play Solomon in assessing the two economics departments, saying, "Right now, M.I.T. and Harvard would be viewed as fairly even."
The new appointees deny that having the same pedigree means they are an insular, like-thinking clique. "Believe me, we're not a monolithic group," Mr. Katz said.
Still, Mr. Katz once studied with Ms. Tyson; Mr. Summers was an adviser to Mr. Cutler, and many of them wrote economics papers together. What is more, they all studied at the feet of Mr. Solow.
Proof that not everyone with an M.I.T. degree thinks alike is another M.I.T. product in Washington: David W. Mullins Jr., vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Mullins, who received an M.I.T. doctorate in economics and finance in 1974, is a well-known conservative and could use his position to dampen the liberal activism of Mr. Clinton's Cambridge crew.
Conservatives are criticizing Mr. Clinton's economic choices, contending they do not have enough faith in free markets and will build a mountain of regulations.
 
Praise With Reservations
 Milton Friedman, a Nobel laureate and professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, said he was uneasy about the invasion from Cambridge, even though he said several of the nominees were technically superb as economists. "It's a great mistake obviously to have an interventionist government," he said.
His Chicago colleague, Mr. Becker, was more optimistic, suggesting that the new crowd might not do things so differently from the Chicagoans because they would be smart enough to know what does and does not make good economic sense. Mr. Becker and other economists note that the 1990's brand of Cambridge economics is less liberal than the 1960's variety.
Mr. Blinder, the choice for the Council of Economic Advisers, sought to reassure conservatives, saying, "I think there are precious few in the group that can be called lefties, but certainly we're more liberal than the people leaving Washington."

Chaus Hires Ex-President Of Esprit

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
Richard Baker, who left the post of president of Esprit de Corp Womenswear in November, yesterday was named president of Bernard Chaus Inc., the women's clothing manufacturer based in New York.
Mr. Baker, 46, will report to Josephine Chaus, who became chairman and chief executive following the death of her husband, Bernard Chaus, the company's founder, in July 1991. She will now relinquish the post of president, which she held before her husband's death. 
 After joining Esprit de Corp in 1986, Mr. Baker became president of its Womenswear division in December 1987. He entered the retailing business in 1971 through the Bullock's division of Federated Department Stores. In 1984, he became chief executive and president of the Izod Lacoste division of General Mills, and participated in the spinoff of that and other labels into a new public company, Crystal Brands, in November 1985.
Mr. Baker, who now lives in San Francisco with his wife and son, will be moving his family to New York to take on his new duties, a company spokesman said.
Bernard Chaus Inc. was founded in April 1975, and was a pioneer in marketing stylish sportswear at moderate prices. The death of its founder, which followed a monthlong illness, came at the end of a very difficult period for the company. Hurt by the retailing recession, the company posted a loss of $12.8 million in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 1991. That compared with a profit of $1.52 million, or 8 cents a share, the previous fiscal year.
 
Back in the Black
 But the company's prospects brightened in the first fiscal year of Mrs. Chaus's tenure, during which it made $5.5 million, or 30 cents a share. The first quarter of its current fiscal year was also very strong, with profits of 13 cents a share, triple those of the period a year earlier.
Mr. Baker, nevertheless, has his work cut out for him. Industry analysts report that retailers' demands for discounts on prices have turned fierce, and Chaus is expected to report quarterly profits that are essentially flat. Estimates for the current fiscal year's profits range from 35 to 45 cents a share.

HEADLINE: 3 Top Editors and Columnist Leave Post for Daily News

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
At least three top editors and the columnist Mike McAlary left The New York Post yesterday to work for The Daily News amid growing anger toward the man who aspires to be The Post's next owner.
The moves came as The Post, struggling to remain afloat, took the highly unusual step of offering free classified advertising to people looking for either jobs or employees. The paper also announced plans to base advertising rates on how successful the sales advertised turned out to be. 
 As the changes were announced, those who quit The Post sharply criticized Steven Hoffenberg, the controversial investor brought in to give The Post a quick shot of cash.
"He is totally untenable as a newspaper publisher," said Richard Gooding, the former metropolitan editor of The Post, who said he will assume a similar position at The News today. "He totally lacks credibility. I think in the end he's going to do a lot of damage to the paper."
Mr. Hoffenberg is still negotiating his purchase of The Post from Peter S. Kalikow. By the end of this week, he said he hoped to clarify when the sale would be final. In the meantime, he has assumed management control and the title of publisher.
"No matter what they say about me, they say one thing," Mr. Hoffenberg said. "I'm not afraid to fight."
In a news conference yesterday afternoon, Mr. Hoffenberg confirmed that Mr. McAlary and the editors, who he did not name, were going to The News. Later in the day, The News announced that Lou Colasuonno, currently The Post's top editor, would become its editor. The News made no announcement regarding its current editor, James P. Willse or any of its other top editors.
Sources at both papers confirmed that another Post editor going to The News was James C. Lynch, one of two managing editors at The Post.
 
Rumors of More Departures
 Newsrooms across the city sizzled with rumors yesterday. The columnist Amy Pagnozzi declined to comment on whether she was leaving The Post. The sports columnist Mark Kriegel, another name frequently mentioned, could not be reached.
In a speech to staff members after the news conference, Mr. Hoffenberg announced replacements for those leaving. He said Gerard Bray, The Post's financial editor, would be the editor; Mark Kalech, an assistant city editor, would be the metropolitan editor, and Steve Cuozzo would remain in his post as managing editor.
At the staff meeting, employees said, Mr. Hoffenberg allowed Mr. Colasuonno to speak, but repeatedly interrupted him. After protests from the audience, the editor was permitted to finish.
Mr. Gooding said that yesterday morning, he and the two other editors told Mr. Hoffenberg that they had discussed going to The News with Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the paper's new owner.
"His response was to walk out of the office and then come back in with Bray and say, 'This is my new editor,' " he said. "He looked at me and said, 'I'm ordering you not to talk to the staff anymore.' "
 
Considering Suing
 The Daily News, which is protected from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, cut 170 employees on Jan. 7. At the time of the dismissals, The News said it hoped to use the money saved to hire new people.
Mr. Hoffenberg said at the news conference that his lawyers were investigating the possibility of suing Mr. Zuckerman, for pirating his staff. Mr. Zuckerman did not return calls for comment.
Mr. Hoffenberg called an article in The New York Times yesterday about his litigious financial history "baloney." He said an investigation of his dealings by the Securities and Exchange Commission was only to give Federal employees "something to do during the day."
 
New Advertising Policies
 Expressing concern about unemployment, he said The Post would begin to offer free classified advertising space to any company or individual looking to hire employees, as well as any individuals wanting to advertise their availability for work. He said The Post was willing to publish as many as 20 such pages indefinitely, at a cost of $900 a page. "We feel terrible that these people are unemployed," he said.
Mr. Hoffenberg's new plans for charging for advertisements reflected his previous suggestion that he be would open to barter. He said The Post would become a buyer of close-out or marked-down merchandise, paying for the merchandise with ad space.
In other comments, Mr. Hoffenberg said he hoped to avoid having The Post formally file for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. He said he would restore 10 percent of the 20 percent pay cut that the staff agreed to last week. He said this Friday's paper, like last Friday's, would be 100 pages, a level not reached even during the December holiday season, when advertising increases.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 22.15 After Foreign Markets Gain

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks moved higher in heavy trading yesterday, led by blue-chip issues and aided by the tempo set earlier overseas. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 22.15 points, to 3,332.18.
Advances yesterday in overseas markets -- The Financial Times-Stock Index of 100 leading issues in London gained 44.40 points, and the Nikkei index of 225 issues in Tokyo rose 109.86 points -- helped create a positive tone in New York. 
 American Express, up 1 3/8, to 24 5/8, led the Dow, accounting for 16 percent of its rise. The company's chairman stepped down over the weekend and a replacement was named yesterday.
Several other blue chips were up a point or more, including Philip Morris up 1 1/8, to 75 7/8; A.T& T. 1 1/8, to 54; Chevron 1 1/8, to 73 7/8; Goodyear Tire and Rubber 1, to 69; United Technologies 1, to 47 7/8, and I.B.M. 1 1/8, to 52 5/8.
Traders described volume as heavy at 238.6 million shares, but investors moved cautiously ahead of the employment report for January, which is scheduled on Friday. Some market strategists expect the figure to show weakness in the economy, a feeling they said might have limited the size of yesterday's advances.
Yesterday's purchasing agents' index for January suggested, however, that the recovery was gathering steam. The index rose to a four-year high, paced by healthy new orders and production.
The numbers, analysts said, were in line with the similarly robust January readings of the regional indexes reported recently by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank.
"Yesterday's purchasing managers' index numbers bode well for the economy," said Robert C. Walberg, equity analyst at MMS International, an economics research firm. "I think the market's focus will now shift to the employment number."
He said yesterday's market was helped by technology stocks, which were "underproducing the last few days."
Intel rose 4 1/2, to 111 1/4; Motorola 2 3/4, to 53 3/4; Texas Instruments 2 3/8, to 56 3/8; Apple Computer 1 3/4, to 61 1/4; Compaq Computer 2 3/8, to 53 1/2, and Microsoft 1, to 87 1/2.
RJR Nabisco rose 5/8, to 8 7/8, on heavy volume of 6.9 million shares. An Illinois jury ruled unanimously for the tobacco company and the industry trade association in a suit filed by a smoker with lung cancer. In addition, an article in The Wall Street Journal yesterday said that the company was considering creating a class of stock linked to its foods unit.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index added 1.89 points, to 243.81. Advancing issues led declining stocks almost 2 to 1 on the Big Board.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 3.74, to 442.52, while the Nasdaq composite index gained 5.43, to 701.77. The American Stock Exchange composite index advanced 0.55 point, to 411.63.

Treasury Prices Shrug Off Report

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Treasury prices were little changed yesterday, holding up well in the face of another report showing that the economy may be moving spritely into the new year.
The closely watched index of the nation's purchasing managers jumped to 58 percent in January from 55.4 percent in December. This was the index's highest level since the summer of 1988. 
 "What was good about the report was that it was broad-based," Stuart G. Hoffman, the chief economist at the PNC Financial Corporation in Pittsburgh, said.
While such news would normally disturb the bond market because economic growth can lead to higher inflation, yesterday's report came as investor confidence was growing that the rate of inflation will remain low this year and into next year.
 
Long Bond Yield Rises Slightly
 After the morning release of the purchasing managers' report, the price of the 30-year bond fell almost half a point. But by late afternoon, the price was off just 3/32 to yield 7.20 percent, up from 7.19 percent Friday. At 7.19, the yield on the 30-year bond had been at its lowest level since August 1986.
Prices of Treasury notes were also little changed. At the weekly auction of Treasury bills, the three-month bill had an average discount rate of 2.97 percent, down from 2.98 percent last week, and the six-month bill had an average discount rate of 3.10 percent, up from 3.09 percent a week ago.
The White House said yesterday that President Clinton was considering a fiscal stimulus package of around $30 billion. But while the estimate was slightly higher than the $20 billion that many analysts have been using, it did not seem to bother the market.
 
M-2 Growth Debate
 The Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve, is meeting today and tomorrow to set its policy course for the year. But Fed watchers do not expect any policy change that should affect short-term interest rates.
Darwin L. Beck, director of the economics department at the First Boston Corporation, said he expected the Federal Reserve's target for the Federal funds rate to stay "stable through most of the year." The Fed funds rate, the interest rate charged on overnight loans between banks, is the short-term rate that the Fed uses to enact its monetary policy goals. The current target is 3 percent.
The only thing that would change the Fed's mind, Mr. Beck said, would be a significant change in the performance of the economy. But he said that if economic growth held in a 2 percent to 4 percent range there should be no need for the Fed to shift short-term interest rates.
The big Fed debate will concern the annual growth range for M-2, the key money supply barometer that includes currency in circulation, checking accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit.
Fed officials say the decision would not have an impact on maintaining the Federal funds rate at 3 percent.
But a change could have political consequences. Under discussion will be a proposal to lower the M-2 growth range from a current spread of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent. Lowering the range could concern members of Congress and some Clinton Administration officials that the Fed might raise short-term interest rates sooner than they would like, given the moderate growth rate of the economy.
 
February Auction
 Tomorrow, the Treasury will be making an announcement that could have some impact on the bond market, expecially the 30-year bond.
This is the announcement of the details of the quarterly auction of 3-year and 10-year Treasury notes and 30-year bonds. Many in the market are waiting to see whether the Treasury, to reduce borrowing costs and to help bring down long-term interest rates, will reduce the size of the 30-year bond auction.
In November, the Treasury sold $10.25 billion 30-year bonds. If the size of February's 30-year auction is not cut at least a little, the price of the 30-year bond could fall because part of its recent jump in price has been attributed to a bet that the Treasury would make such a move.
Following are the results from the Treasury auction yesterday of three-month and six-month bills:

Morgan Fund To Invest In Banks

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
J. P. Morgan & Company, combining its tradition of bailing out troubled banks with its desire to become an aggressive investment firm, said yesterday that it had raised $1 billion for a fund to invest in commercial banks worldwide.
With money from corporate pension funds and wealthy individuals around the world, the fund, called the Corsair Partnership, is similar to the leveraged buyout funds that were popular in the late 1980's, except that it will focus on the banking industry and buy only minority stakes.
 
Two Years in the Making
 Morgan began to organize the fund in 1990, when several major banks appeared to be near collapse. The bank's management worried that it would be asked by Federal regulators to bail out failing institutions as it had in years past, said Nicholas B. Paumgarten, a longtime investment banker with the First Boston Company who was hired by Morgan to run the fund. 
 Before the Federal Reserve System was created, Morgan acted as a de facto central bank, providing cash to needy institutions, and as recently as the 1980's lent money to banks weighted down by troubled energy loans, Mr. Paumgarten said.
Instead of using capital simply as an aid to the industry, Morgan identified a new business opportunity. It established a fund that intends to buy stakes of 10 to 15 percent in overseas and domestic banks and to take positions on their boards.
But in the two years that it took Morgan to raise the money, the United States banking industry has largely returned to health and finds capital readily available through the sale of stocks and bonds.
 
 
Europe's Appeal
 As a result, the Morgan fund expects initially to invest in European banks, which are still saddled with the type of bad loans and depressed economies that had previously hurt banks in the United States. Morgan sees an opportunity to profit as the European banking industry consolidates.
Over the six-year investment period of the fund, Mr. Paumgarten expects to find opportunities in the United States as well. "The big U.S. banks don't need us now," he said. "But this is a bubble-and-burst business, and some will need us again in two years."
The fund is not interested in banks in Japan, Mr. Paumgarten said, because Japanese companies typically resist foreign influence. The Morgan fund expects to be involved in the major decisions of the banks in which it invests.
Though banks, including Morgan, have been using their own money to invest in other companies, the Corsair fund is the first large investment pool from a commercial bank, furthering the industry's move into businesses traditionally dominated by Wall Street.
It is also the first fund of its size to invest in a single industry. Last year Goldman, Sachs & Company and the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities unit of the Equitable Companies each established funds of about $1 billion to invest in leveraged buyouts and other opportunities, regardless of industry.
"It's a difficult environment to raise money for private equity funds; investors are being very cautious," said Steven P. Galante, publisher of Private Equity Analyst, a West Newton, Mass., newsletter. "There has been a big falloff since the peak of leveraged buyout activity in 1987."
Morgan was successful, Mr. Galante said, because of its contacts with investors and the reputation of its analysts. Moreover, the bank put up $100 million -- 10 percent of the fund, compared with the 1 percent that is typical in the industry.
Morgan is also charging investors fees that are lower than customary. Instead of a 2 percent annual fee, it will charge a one-time 2 percent fee when the investments are made, and the bank will invest that fee in the fund. When the fund is closed out in 10 years, Morgan will earn 20 percent of the profits, but only if the return exceeds 20 percent a year. Such a fee structure, placing a high performance requirement on the fund manager is unusual, Mr. Galante said.
Mr. Paumgarten said that he expected the fund to earn a 30 percent annual return.
 
Private Placements
 Rather than buying banks' stock in the open market, Morgan hopes to make its investments through private placements, an approach that will allow the fund managers to gain access to financial information not available to the general public. Morgan expects bank executives to be open to its requests because of its reputation and resources, Jeff M. Garrity, a vice president in Morgan's private placement department, said.
"From a C.E.O.'s perspective, if you have J. P. Morgan as an investor and on your board," he said, "it gives your bank a blue-chip panache."
Morgan also hopes to sell its services to the banks in which it invests, Mr. Garrity said.

Europe's Monetary Turmoil Adds Fuel to Dollar's Rally

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar continued its rally yesterday, benefiting from turmoil among European currencies and more favorable news about the American economy.
Gold prices were mostly lower. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $330.30 an ounce, up 10 cents from Friday. But the Republic National Bank said gold slipped 10 cents an ounce to a late bid of $329.60. 
 The day's heaviest currency trading occurred in Europe, where dealers had their first opportunity to react to the weekend devaluation of the Irish pound. The 10 percent reduction caused a wave of concern to sweep through trading floors overseas.
The British pound fell sharply. The Government in London said the devaluation of the Irish pound strengthened its case for overhauling Europe's 13-year-old Exchange Rate Mechanism, which was intended to stabilize currencies in preparation for establishing a single currency for the 12 members of the European Community. Britain withdrew from the mechanism last year.
"This is adding more fuel to the argument for lower European rates, either through formal devaluations or coordinated cuts" of interest rates, said Ronald Holzer, the chief dealer at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
Lower rates overseas make yields on dollar-denominated investments more attractive.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.95 yen, up 0.65 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 124.93 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 125.05 yen, up from 124.65 on Friday.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.4538, down from Friday's $1.4873. In New York, it cost $1.4595 to buy one pound, down from $1.4865 on Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.6358 German marks, up from 1.6110; 1.5180 Swiss francs, up from 1.4880; 5.5310 French francs, up from 5.4495; 1,514.00 Italian lire, up from 1,493.50, and 1.2630 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2678.

HEADLINE: Purchasing Managers Find Economy Is Gaining Ground

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
American manufacturers virtually roared into 1993, according to a report yesterday that was the first solid data on the economy's momentum so far this year.
The closely watched purchasing managers' index, a measure of a half-dozen aspects of manufacturing, jumped from 55.4 percent in December to 58 percent in January, its highest level since the summer of 1988, the economy's last really good year. 
 "It's a strong report, one of the strongest in years," said Robert Bretz, chairman of the National Association of Purchasing Management survey and director of corporate purchasing at Pitney Bowes.
Instead of faltering, as some had feared, the recovery seems to have gotten on more solid footing. A reading over 44.5 percent indicates that manufacturing is expanding; a reading over 50 percent is a sign that the whole economy is gaining ground.
"It's powerful stuff," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence. "It should be enough to affect the Administration's perception of the need for stimulus."
A separate report yesterday on the construction industry, however, showed that sector was still struggling at the end of 1992. The Commerce Department said outlays for new construction fell four-tenths of a percent in inflation-adjusted terms in December from November. Worse, October and November outlays were revised sharply lower.
 
Signs of Stronger Future
 Home building was the bright spot in the month and is likely to continue strong, given robust sales and mounting mortgage applications in January. But all other construction, from apartments to offices to stores, remained stalled.
The purchasing survey found that factory production in January grew at the fastest pace in five years. Even more encouraging, new factory orders zoomed to their highest level since 1983. Order backlogs, which were shrinking for much of last year, got fatter. And one of the favorite indicators of the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan -- suppliers' delivery times -- suggested that factories were so busy that more customers were reporting delays in January than in December. Rising orders and backlogs and longer waits for supplies all point to further production increases, economists say.
"This means that the economic expansion is not going to evaporate," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch.
The strength in orders, moreover, was clearly because of stronger domestic demand. Export orders, still surprisingly solid, have merely been bobbing around in recent months.
Manufacturers are still not adding new workers, however, and the strong growth of production is almost entirely because of rapid gains in factory productivity. Nonetheless, the purchasing managers' hiring measure, which was edging down in several of the last six months, did strengthen a bit in January, suggesting that the contraction in the factory work force may be easing.
"It's been my feeling for some time," Mr. Bretz said, "that order backlogs will have to grow for several months in a row before employment expands again. This is a good start."
 
Better Profit Outlook
 Meanwhile, the purchasing managers' report suggested that the profit picture in manufacturing, already quite bright last year, is set to become even brighter in 1993 -- and for a widening circle of industrial companies. The biggest gains in orders and production were in plastics, paper, chemicals, metals, heavy machinery and -- no surprise -- computers.
Though companies are still having a hard time raising prices, the survey showed that more companies were able to make their price increases stick or avoid price decreases in January than in December. Together with rising sales volume and improving efficiency, that suggests that profit margins are getting fatter.
The purchasing managers survey has tracked the ups and downs of the gross domestic product reasonably well, according to economists. "It's quite reliable," said Mr. Yardeni of C. J. Lawrence. "Right now it's basically confirming other indicators."
Despite the flurry of good economic news in the last week, including a 9.1 percent increase in orders for durable goods in December, most forecasters still expect the economy to settle down from the robust 3.6 percent rate of growth in the second half of last year.
Job worries and slow employment growth, for example, may prompt consumers to pull back a bit. The University of Michigan reported on Friday that consumer confidence in the economy leveled off in January after a post-election surge, edging down from 91 points to 89.3 points.

A Chance to Crow
Donna Karan should be kvelling. Her "cold shoulder" black dress finally made it to the White House. 
 On Sunday night, Hillary Rodham Clinton wore Ms. Karan's best-selling dress, which has long sleeves and cutouts at the shoulders, to her first official White House dinner. The dress, which was ubiquitous at inauguration parties, was worn by Candice Bergen at last year's Emmy Awards.
 
Dressing a Show Quickly
 Ellen Shanley, the curator of "Dress for Excess: Mainstream and Extreme in Men's Wear," the new exhibit at the Fashion Institute of Technology, is trying to catch her breath.
A curatorial coordinator at the Shirley Goodman Resource Center, which includes F.I.T.'s museum, Ms. Shanley had only three and a half weeks to pull the show together; its opening last Thursday was scheduled to help celebrate the 100th-anniversary of the Daily News Record, the men's wear trade paper. Ms. Shanley was asked to put together her very first show after the school's longtime curatorial team, Richard Martin and Harold Koda, left to run the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
On Jan. 4, with only the title to guide her, Ms. Shanley began pulling items from the F.I.T. archives, where she found a breathtaking array of clothes that look quite contemporary: a circa-1895 American-made, beige-linen sack suit that might be mistaken for a 1993 Calvin Klein; plush striped waistcoats from the 1920's that Romeo Gigli could send down the runway today; a circa-1930 tweed "breakfast jacket" with a shawl collar in two-faced wool with braided frog closings that looks just like a Matsuda. "I was surprised by how much detail used to go into men's wear," Ms. Shanley said.
She also chose some items that are easily dated, like an Italian brown wool double-knit leisure suit (circa 1970), and a blue tie-dyed corduroy suit that Bloomingdale's carried in 1973. Anyone who thinks the current bell-bottom boom is license to wear any clothes that were considered fashionable 20 years ago is well-advised to check out the exhibit, which brings to mind Santayana's dictum, "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."
 
The de la Renta Shuttle
 If nothing else, the airline industry is benefiting from Oscar de la Renta's debut as a haute couturier.
Last week, when the designer presented his first couture collection for the House of Balmain in Paris, he was surrounded by a legion of New Yorkers who'd flown over for his debut, fans like Mica Ertegun, Nan Kempner, Jerome Zipkin, Barbara Walters and Linda Wachner. Now, Mr. de la Renta is flying the collection and fitters to New York, where they will take up residence at Bergdorf Goodman from Feb. 23 to 26.
The store is planning to give Mr. de la Renta a haute homecoming, with the de rigueur luncheon, fashion show and Fifth Avenue windows.
 
Mail-Order Fakes
 If you're looking for counterfeit Chanel bags and faux Louis Vuitton luggage in Manhattan, you head for Canal Street. If you want to buy them in Sweden, you can order from a mail-order catalogue called Fake.
"We just discovered it, and we don't know who's behind it yet," Christian Blanckaert, the president of the Comite Colbert, a French trade group, said from Paris last week. "We are talking with the Swedish authorities."
The Comite Colbert, which represents 70 French luxury-goods manufacturers with $6 billion in sales, is also concerned about counterfeiting elsewhere. It has issued a report calling the Italian Government's battle against counterfeiting "very weak" and will publish a report about the problem in Turkey next month.
"This is not just an economic problem," Mr. Blanckaert said. "It threatens our patrimoine, our cultural heritage, too."

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Opening Day for N.H.L.'s First Commissioner

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE

 BODY:
The first week of the shortest month of the year offers professional hockey a rare share of the American sports spotlight. Football is finally finished, and the baseball players won't report for spring training for another couple of weeks. The sports news media poke their collective heads above ground, see Charles Barkley's shadow and realize there are six more weeks of college basketball until the Final Four.
So the stage was set yesterday at National Hockey League headquarters in Manhattan, where Gary Bettman took office as the first commissioner in the league's 76-year history. 
 His inauguration didn't include a swearing-in ceremony or an inspirational poem, but it was just as important to the progressive constituency of owners who hired him after 15 years of the muddled regime of former President John Ziegler.
 
His 'Do' List
 Bettman's mission is simple: Put a stop to labor unrest; sell the product in television's mainstream marketplace; change the violent image of the game; curb salary inflation; force enlightened self-interest on reluctant, old-fashioned owners; expand contacts with European developmental leagues and markets; settle the divisive issue of possible Olympic involvement, and help launch several new expansion teams.
If Bettman can do all this, he will be a bargain at his salary of more than $1 million a year.
"I think there is a perception that the sport needs to be improved from a public relations standpoint and a marketing standpoint," said Bettman, 40, who was hired from the National Basketball Association after 12 years as its third in command. "Some of the criticism and negativism has been overblown. We've got a great product that is underappreciated."
The negative perception of hockey, Bettman said, is "a pretty good snowball, some might call it an avalanche."
When someone noted that NBC showed the Super Bowl on Sunday without promoting the N.H.L.'s All-Star game, which it will carry Saturday afternoon from Montreal, Bettman didn't directly comment, but said: "Obviously, I was envious of the attention the Super Bowl got. We're going to have to improve the way we are perceived, the way we are followed, the way we look. We can be worthy of attention. The goal is attention so that NBC would love to promote us during the Super Bowl the way it did the N.B.A, for example."
 
To Be Considered
 Bettman spoke with reporters in his office and on a conference call with points from Ottawa to Tulsa. He went over issues he has been discussing continuously since his hiring was announced in December. He will keep an open mind, he said, to suggestions of rules changes about eliminating the center red line as a restraint to passing and about further toughening the rules against fighting. He is concerned that the Edmonton and Minnesota franchises might move, he said, but he hopes they don't. Yes, he'd like to see more fans in the seats in Hartford, Long Island and New Jersey.
He already has talked informally with Bob Goodenow, the head of the players union, and hopes to soon move the dialogue toward serious negotiation aimed at developing a true partnership before next season.
He might consider a draft lottery, like the one in the N.B.A., and a conference-based playoff formula, like the one in the N.B.A., and a salary cap, also like the N.B.A.'s. But for those nervous Canadians and hard-core fans in the United States, Bettman said he won't "disturb the basic framework."
"We want to expand our fan base," he said, "but we don't want to turn off our existing fans." If the N.H.L. imitates the N.B.A., Bettman said, that's fine "if that means to be more successful and go through a boom period." That period might not include Olympic participation. Bettman said the Board of Governers will discuss that issue this weekend at the meetings in Montreal, but a decision might again be postponed.
He said he wants to make the game "user-friendly," and part of that means selling it to and through television.
 
The Conservative Party
 No one mentioned the Chicago owner William Wirtz by name, but it was clear that a question about the league's old-line leadership alluded to the former chairman of the Board of Governors, who heads the conservative faction that has lost power.
"I'm going to talk to them, I'm going to communicate well," Bettman said, referring to conservative owners. "It may be that we are going to head in new, progressive directions that will make sense to every one immediately. For some, it may take a little more time."
Fighting, despite an attempted crackdown this season, is making a comeback, as some referees refuse to enforce rules against instigators and punching specialists follow their own agenda to get around the spirit of the law. Bettman called fighting "something we need to look at" before telling the players: "This is the amount, these are the rules. We're going to enforce the rules and put it to rest, do it on a buttoned-up basis."

HEADLINE: Q&A

BYLINE: By C. CLAIBORNE RAY

 BODY:

L-Sugars, D-Sugars
Q. I remember hearing a few years back about a sugar substitute that was molecularly the opposite of regular sugar so that it could not be absorbed by the body. What happened to it? 
 A. The company that developed such sugars says it has found something better and has patented it and submitted it for safety testing.
Some molecules have isomers, left-handed and right-handed versions of the same atoms. In "left-handed" L-sugar molecules, three or four carbon atoms have other groups of atoms attached in positions that are mirror images of the same atoms in naturally occurring D-sugars. They have many of the properties of regular sugar and are not fattening, but they are expensive to produce.
In the course of working with L-sugars, Biospherics Inc. of Beltsville, Md., found a D-sugar, called D-tagatose, that has only one group attached to a carbon atom in a mirror-image position. At a molecular level, it is D-fructose after inversion of the hydroxyl and hydrogen groups at the fourth carbon atom, the company says.
In physical characteristics like taste, bulk, browning ability, etc., D-tagatose is "virtually indistinguishable from table sugar," said Dr. Gilbert V. Levin, an environmental engineer who is president of the company, but it has proved to be nonfattening in rats.
"D-tagatose is rare in nature but does occur in some foods like cheeses and cocoa in small amounts, but not enough that they could be concentrated readily," Dr. Levin said. "We have developed a chemical method for making it economically out of whey, a byproduct of cheese making."
Dr. Levin developed the L-sugars; Dr. Lee Zaner of the company obtained a patent for D-tagatose as a low-caloric sweetener and bulking agent. the company has sent it to an industrial toxicology laboratory for testing needed in order to seek approval from the Food and Drug Administration for its use as a food additive.
 
Big Fish, Little Fish
 Q. In the big tank at the New England Aquarium in Boston, all the large fish seem to stay at the surface while the smaller ones stay at the bottom. Why?
A. Because of the design of the tank, modeled after waters off a Caribbean coral reef, big fish have more swimming room near the surface, while the little fish are content with the more limited area below, said Dan Laughlin, an ichthyologist in the fishes department of the aquarium.
The tank is 23 feet deep and 40 feet across and holds 200,000 gallons of water, he said. The reef contour spirals up from the bottom and reaches halfway through the tank, he said, so that if the big fish want to swim their laps in a full circle, they are forced to do it higher up.
Some smaller fish do live near the crest of the reef near the surface, he said. Those at lower levels sometimes feed off morsels dropped by larger fish in the midst of feeding activity, he said, but that is not why they choose to inhabit lower levels; they simply need less room.
There are 600 to 800 fish of 100 different species in the tank, Mr. Laughlin said. Some of the larger ones are the little tunny, which is the smallest tuna, and the permit, tarpon and amberbjack, he said; the smaller ones include the blue chromis, the hamlet and the squirrel fish.

HEADLINE: A Test Case: Airplane Wars

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
THE competition to dominate the world market for commercial aircraft is a textbook example of the very modern clash over subsidies to high-technology industry. It is one that occupies a prominent place in "Who's Bashing Whom" (Institute for International Economics), the new book by Laura D'Andrea Tyson, President Clinton's chief economic adviser.
Modern jet airframes and engines cost billions of dollars to design. So, too, do the factories and tools to make them. But once beyond the tool-up stage, the cost of assembling an extra copy is relatively modest. So the more planes a single manufacturer builds, the lower will be the average cost and the greater the competitive advantage. 
 Each segment of the market -- say, long-range jumbo jets -- may well be what economists call a "natural monopoly," in which increasing returns to the scale of output leave room for only one low-cost producer.
Indeed, the total market may not be large enough for more than one producer to make a profit. And the company that gets there first -- or simply shows a credible determination to get there first -- may end up as the only manufacturer.
A combination of luck, skill, willingness to gamble and generous indirect subsidies from military contracts left Boeing as the only successful airframe maker in the business by the mid-1970's. Its effective monopoly with the 747 allows it to make an estimated $45 million profit on every $150 million copy.
But European governments struck back in the mid-1970's with Airbus, a heavily subsidized French-German (and now British) consortium to manufacture commercial jets. Richard Baldwin and Paul Krugman estimate that Airbus introduced its mid-size, medium-range A300 model with the equivalent of $4 billion in taxpayer subsidies.
Did the subsidy pay off? It certainly failed by one test, failing to deter Boeing from turning out a competitive model (the 767), and thus dividing the market.
Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Krugman estimate that it failed in other senses as well: the gains to European and American consumers from greater competition and lower prices were more than offset by the losses to European taxpayers and to Boeing shareholders.
But Ms. Tyson does not think the lesson is so simple. The European subsidies generated a windfall of high-paying jobs in Europe -- at a direct cost to highly paid aircraft workers in America. Moreover, none of the studies of Airbus reckons with the technological spillovers gained through the experience of designing a modern jet from scratch.
A full accounting is thus difficult, if not impossible. That leaves room for both sides in the subsidy debate to draw their own conclusions.

HEADLINE: High-Tech Industry Is Hard to Help

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Is Washington about to make a grand splash in aid of commercial innovation? Bet on it.
The Bush Administration stuck its toe in the waters, offering modest technology grants through the Commerce Department and encouraging Federal laboratories to strike deals for cooperative research with private concerns. But President Clinton seems determined to plunge, and there is little opposition in Congress to the notion that the Government should put more money behind projects that generate high-technology exports and high-paying jobs. 
 The unanswered question is whether a far more intimate alliance between government and private producers of what enthusiasts call "critical" technologies can meet expectations. Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and most other economists agree that there is "an ironclad theoretical case" for believing free market incentives alone cannot sustain adequate spending on research and development.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the new chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, goes much further, asserting that an activist technology policy is crucial to maintaining the nation's global lead in science-based industries.
But both history and cool-eyed analysis suggest that a new public-private partnership forged with billions of dollars more in Federal subsidies will be anything but problem-free. To be sure, there have been plenty of success stories. Postwar American prowess in both electronics and aviation was certainly nurtured with Defense Department dollars. But two economists, Linda Cohen of the University of California at Irvine and Roger Noll of Stanford University, have documented a doleful list of Federal efforts to develop commercial technology that were undermined by interest-group politics and bureaucratic imperatives.
The foreign experience, moreover, is not confidence-building. The Economist magazine recently concluded that Europe's hands-on support of cutting-edge technologies looks "increasingly out of date." And after a mixed record punctuated by the collapse of the much vaunted fifth-generation computer project, even the Japanese are having second thoughts. Indeed, notes Gary Saxonhouse, an economist at the University of Michigan, "just as Washington is moving downstream toward commercial development, Tokyo is moving upstream toward basic research."
 
The Background
Glorious Past, Dubious Future
 American support of commercial research and development has a long and sometimes glorious history. In 1836 Congress gave Samuel Morse $30,000 to subsidize an experimental telegraph line linking Baltimore to Washington. And agricultural research sponsored by the Federal Government helped turn the country into the bread basket of the world.
In the postwar decades, roughly half of all financing of research and development has come from Washington. And although more than half of that money went into military-related projects, there were important spillovers into commercial aircraft, computers, energy and telecommunications in the 1950's and 1960's. For example, the phenomenally successful Boeing 707 was underwritten by military orders for a flying tanker. And all the jumbo jets use engine technology developed for the giant C-5A military transport.
Just how much Americans' rise in living standards can be attributed to technological advancement in general and the Federal contribution in particular is a matter of dispute. F. M. Scherer, an economist at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, estimates that half the growth in average hourly output in the postwar years is linked to new technology. While other estimates are considerably lower, there is little doubt that technology matters a lot. Hence the worry that the engine powering innovation is out of tune, and the enthusiasm for a Federal fix.
Paradoxically, this concern seems to have peaked at a time when high-technology companies like Intel, Motorola and Hewlett-Packard are overwhelming foreign competitors, and the United States is exporting a record $35 billion-plus a year more in advanced technology products than it imports.
But other trends are disturbing. The flow of technology from military research to private commerce has slowed, and perhaps on balance even reversed. Most microprocessors in weapons, for example, are now derived from civilian designs. And the portion of national income spent on nonmilitary research and development is considerably lower in this country than in Japan or Germany.
 
The Theory
When Industry Is Reluctant
 A skeptic might still ask why economists are so ready to second-guess business on research and development spending when they seem content to let the hidden hand of the market determine the output of, say, corn flakes or drill bits. There is an answer -- or rather, many answers.
The most venerable, which goes by jargon "appropriability," holds that an innovative company may fail to invest for fear it will not capture the full fruit of its labors. Despite patent and copyright protection, much of the gravy from private innovation ends up on the plates of imitators and consumers.
Martin Baily, an economist at the University of Maryland, estimates "with great confidence" that society's overall return on research and development is at least twice the private return. Thus Consolidated Widget may find that it does not pay to invest that extra $20 million in developing a laser-powered bread knife even though the new technology would add $30 million to total output.
Then there is the problem of risk. When businesses jump into unexplored technology they generally do so only if the potential rewards are very large. Well-heeled giant corporations like A.T.&T. can afford a half-dozen losers in order to come up with one huge winner. But William Baumol, an economist at New York University, notes that an important and perhaps increasing share of technology comes from small companies that cannot bet the ship on one idea.
Even big companies may be biased toward technological conservatism, since the careers of individual managers often turn on the outcome of a single project. Thus innovation, particularly the costly process of commercializing technology, may be slowed unless it is subsidized.
This brief for Government intervention can be found in any Economics 101 textbook, and could have been made with as much force in 1953 as in 1993. But other arguments for research and development subsidies, arguments with enormous political weight, have only emerged in the last few years.
Start with the New Trade Theory. Classic international trade theory is built on the idea that countries specialize in goods that exploit their most abundant human and physical resources, and then gain through exchange with others. Argentina, for example, grows grain and cattle on empty, fertile pampas and trades them for shirts sewn by the teeming multitudes of Bangladesh.
But resource abundance seems only weakly related to the pattern of trade specialization in a vast array of modern products -- everything from automobiles to memory chips to video recorders. And here, many economists believe that the simple rules underpinning free market competition do not apply. Being first or most aggressive in marketing a new product can generate unassailable production cost advantages, they argue, perhaps deterring competition for years.
By this "strategic trade" logic, most prominently embraced by Ms. Tyson, the Presidential adviser, subsidies for research and development can pay off in two ways. Rapid commercialization aided by government can give domestic companies and their workers exceptional profits and wages at the expense of foreigners. Or, looking at the other side of the coin, subsidies can prevent foreigners from gaining the power to exploit consumers back home.
Yet another very modern argument for subsidies is linked to military conversion. With the end of the cold war, the Pentagon is under great pressure to cut research on weapons and military technologies, most notably the "Star Wars" antimissile research project. That will free tens of thousands of scientists and engineers who will presumably be absorbed by private industry in the long run.
But the long run could prove a very long time. And during the Presidential campaign, Bill Clinton proposed to short-circuit the process by shifting roughly 10 percent of the $70 billion Federal budget for research and development from military to civilian research.
Ira Magaziner, an influential member of President Clinton's kitchen cabinet, wants to go further, converting military contractors to producers of high-technology public investment like magnetic levitating trains.
 
The Skeptics
Nationalistic Way Called Obsolete
 The collective weight of these arguments is certainly sufficient to nudge policy makers in the direction of spending more on technologies that can be commercialized. But it has not silenced the skeptics.
One problem, write the economists Richard Nelson of Columbia University and Gavin Wright of Stanford University, is that much of the benefits could end up in the pockets of foreigners because national borders are becoming ever more porous to technology flows between enterprises and within multinational firms. Once nations create an adequate base in science and engineering, they argue, foreign innovation is easily appropriable. Thus, they wrote in a recent journal article, "techno-nationalism policies" do not work very well anymore.
Both the United States and Europe, for example, used a combination of subsidies and threats of trade retaliation to prevent Japan from gaining a dominant market share in computer memory chips. In the meantime, South Korea has used knowledge generated elsewhere to became a formidable low-cost competitor.
Surprisingly, another skeptical voice belongs to Mr. Krugman of M.I.T., who was a pioneer of the New Trade Theory. Mr. Krugman believes that a good chunk of the external benefits from innovation end up close to home, spawning higher national productivity. "Otherwise," he asks, "why the success of Silicon Valley" and other pockets of immensely successful high-tech firms? But Mr. Krugman doubts that the gains from strategic trade, of getting there first in critical technologies, can mean a big difference in wages or living standards.
The very idea of "critical technologies" bothers Ms. Cohen of the University of California. Many groups have indeed pondered what critical means. But when examined closely, Ms. Cohen argues, their conclusions are disturbingly vague. "Most lists," she said, "turn out to contain everything."
Perhaps the most tangible idea of "critical" is technology with a very high rate of return that is also hard to protect with patents or copyrights. That explains why many advocates of increased Federal intervention are focusing on "generic" or "precommercial" technologies. For example, the design of a new pain-killing drug is commercial technology. By contrast, the design of computer software for searching for synthetic chemicals that inhibit the body's pain receptors is very difficult to protect, and thus a better candidate for subsidy.
But Ms. Cohen's and Mr. Noll's book, "The Technology Pork Barrel" (Brookings Institution, 1991) does not encourage optimism that Washington has the will or the knowledge to choose well. Four major Federal efforts at precommercial and commercial technology of the last two decades -- the supersonic transport, the Clinch River breeder reactor, the space shuttle and synthetic fuels program -- proved economic failures.
Arguably, they were worth less than nothing because they diverted money from promising competing technologies or pushed efforts toward premature commercialization that discredited the whole concept. The one project studied that seemed destined to generate a major social payoff, NASA's work in communications satellites, was aborted by Congress in 1973 after the project was challenged by private satellite manufacturers.
 
The Alternatives
Taking the Cue From the Military
 One alternative would be to subsidize all private research and development rather than try to pick winners. Such a program, a Federal tax credit for research and development, was on the books until last summer; the renewal effort fell victim to partisan maneuvering. And the credit is reportedly almost certain to be included in President Clinton's economic stimulus package, expected this month.
But even enthusiasts like Mr. Baily concede that a tax credit is not a substitute for a more targeted subsidies. A very generous credit covering every form of research and development would be too costly. A modest credit, like the one that just expired, would not generate the kick that engineers dream about.
The model more widely favored is a civilian equivalent to the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (Darpa), the small, apparently unbureaucratic group within the Pentagon that has subsidized successful "dual use" civilian and military technologies ranging from packet-switched data networks to carbon fiber materials. A 1992 report from a National Academy of Sciences panel headed by Harold Brown, the former Defense Secretary, proposed to create a civilian technology corporation, which would operate with great independence from Congress.
Something along these lines is likely to emerge from the White House. But Ms. Cohen cautions against high expectations. She pointed out that Darpa worked in the rarefied world of military procurement, where there was a single giant client and little real intraindustry competition. An agency dealing in the fragmented commercial marketplace would have a far tougher time remaining above the political fray.
Almost everyone agrees, though, that adhering to a few basic principles could reduce the risk of boondoggles. One is cost-sharing, in which private money is always at risk. Another is broad diversification, reducing the chance that the Government will be mesmerized by any particular technology or approach to research. Still another is regular, independent evaluation, which would help insulate the agency from politics.
Mr. Wright of Stanford, who doubts that interventionist schemes in the works will generate a big payoff, still sees a silver lining. This is an era, he notes, in which Americans increasingly view the gains of Japan and Europe as their own losses, and are tempted to declare economic cold war. Government aid to research and development, he argues, may prove the least provocative and least costly political response to the frustrations of global competition.

HEADLINE: Mickey Kantor's Historic Task

 BODY:
When historians take the measure of the Clinton Presidency the verdict might well depend heavily on the performance of Mickey Kantor, the new Trade Representative. The world is struggling to complete an epic agreement -- the Uruguay Round of international trade talks -- that could add trillions of dollars to the world's economies through increased trade by the end of the decade. Nothing President Clinton is likely to do to spur economic growth can come close to packing the wallop of a completed trade pact.
Mr. Kantor's foremost responsibility is to resume and complete the Uruguay Round. His next responsibility is to put the finishing touches on the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as NAFTA, with Mexico and Canada. And he needs to fend off protectionist efforts by the automobile, textile, steel and other industries seeking to win in the political marketplace what they could not achieve in the economic marketplace. 
 Mr. Kantor starts out with virtually no familiarity with the subject and scant direction from President Clinton, who downplayed trade policy throughout the campaign. But Mr. Kantor's inexperience need not be a serious liability. Carla Hills, President Bush's Trade Representative, was similarly unschooled in trade policy when she took office. But she tapped a strong deputy, Julius Katz, and she proved a shrewd negotiator. Her office brought steady progress on the Uruguay Round, completed a NAFTA accord and avoided a trade war with the European Community by negotiating a compromise on agriculture policy.
The Uruguay Round would for the first time bring trade in agriculture, services, intellectual property and foreign investment under international rules. The U.S. would come out a winner on almost every score -- gaining vast markets for its exports. NAFTA, the first free trade pact between a developing and industrial country, would establish innovative provisions on resolving disputes, protecting the environment and eliminating non-tariff trade barriers. Mr. Clinton promised to improve upon the labor and environmental provisions of NAFTA; they could stand improvement. But the agreement would be fine even as is.
Ms. Hills's job was made easier by the fact that Mr. Bush gave her clear marching orders to negotiate free trade pacts. So far, Mr. Clinton has revealed no such resolve. Some of his advisers preach the virtues of unfettered trade. Other advisers propose that the U.S. take reprisals against trade partners even if the action violates international rules.
The mixed messages have led a number of industries -- steel, autos, textiles, semiconductors, oil and motion pictures -- to pressure the Administration to erect tariff walls or, worse, block the pending Uruguay and NAFTA accords. These pressures go well beyond legal sanctions against unfair trading practices -- like those imposed yesterday by the Clinton Administration on the European Community for discriminating against U.S. telecommunications and electrical suppliers.
Mr. Clinton will soon have to decide whether he will be the new-generation, pro-market Democrat he proclaimed throughout the campaign -- or will pander to powerful constituents clamoring for protection. Mr. Kantor can do his boss, and all Americans, immeasurable good by pushing Mr. Clinton to live by his lofty pro-growth rhetoric.

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Error Still Bloats Our Military Budget

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Our peace dividend has effectively been stolen by the failure to reduce bloated defense expenditures more rapidly, as you convincingly point out in "Uncertain Trumpet at Defense" (editorial, Jan. 17). In addition, it is important to emphasize that United States military expenditures since the late 1970's have been much higher than they would have been had the Central Intelligence Agency not made a serious error on the growth of Soviet military spending, an error admitted but never properly corrected in official records. 
 In 1980 the C.I.A. announced that over the previous five years the rate of growth of Soviet military expenditures had been maintained at 4.5 percent annually despite decline in growth of gross national product to about 2 percent. This led the agency to increase the ratio of military expenditures to G.N.P. to 12 percent to 14 percent. In 1983 the C.I.A. belatedly admitted to Congress that the rise in the total Soviet cost of defense since 1975 had been about 2 percent a year, like the overall economic growth. Despite the admission, the C.I.A. did not revise its ratio of military expenditures to G.N.P. downward.
The alleged rise in Soviet military spending had an important impact on United States military spending. Raymond Garthoff of the Brookings Institute stated in "Detente and Confrontation": "During the late 1970's, new emphasis was given to the perceived military spending gap as an indicator of the alleged relentless Soviet military buildup."
President Carter's Secretary of Defense, Harold Brown, reacted similarly: "The present disparity in defense spending between the United States and the Soviet Union -- and still more the trend -- is disquieting as an index of both Soviet capabilities and Soviet intensions." President Reagan, in his 1981 State of the Union Message, tied his military buildup pledge to the alleged large United States-Soviet military spending gap.
Had there not been a C.I.A. error followed by a cover-up, our military spending might have continued to increase at a slower rate. It is estimated that for the decade 1979-88 the United States would have spent on defense approximately $800 billion less in present-day prices.
Had there been no C.I.A. error, our military spending in 1989 might have totaled only $224 billion, some $80 billion less than the actual expenditure of $304 billion (in 1989 prices).
The Pentagon used exaggerated estimates of Soviet military spending to help get enormous budget increases. Now that the cold war is over, this overspending should be taken into account in evaluating the Pentagon's claims to severely stretched resources. These huge stolen peace dividends should go back to the civilian economy.

HEADLINE: Expert on Demographics Testifies at Hartford Trial

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST HARTFORD, Conn., Feb. 2

 BODY:
Five days after state officials proposed a timetable for Connecticut communities to integrate their schools by crossing town lines, lawyers began the state's defense today against a lawsuit challenging the racial and economic segregation in Hartford's schools.
From the time the suit, known as Sheff v. O'Neill, was filed in 1989, state officials have said they supported its goals of improving the quality of education in Hartford's schools and achieving greater racial balance in schools statewide. 
 The state, however, contends that it is not responsible for the segregation, and that desegregating schools across a large metropolitan region is too complex a task for a judge. It is better left to the state's elected officials, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has said in his own integration proposals.
John R. Whelan, the assistant attorney general leading the state's defense, said today, "What we're trying to do is present the judge with as much, and as accurate, information as we can, first of all to present the complexity of the case."
The second aim, he said, is to "present the court with some of the positive things that are going on, both in terms of demographics, and in terms of positive efforts by the state to address both the issue of diversity and the needs of disadvantaged children."
Over the next three weeks, the state will focus on its financial support of Hartford's schools, on special programs it has made possible to meet the needs of the city's poor children, and on its efforts over more than 25 years to address the growing segregation in city schools.
It will also present cautionary testimony on the record of school desegregation plans in other cities, suggesting that court-imposed plans can cause white flight, and that desegregation has not yet been proved to have had significant effects on the academic achievement of black children.
Mr. Whelan's first witness, however, was an expert on population trends, who testified that the Hartford metropolitan area's growing minority population began to disperse in the 1980's, particularly into the first ring of suburbs around the city.
The witness, Thomas E. Steahr, a demographer at the University of Connecticut, testified that nearly all of the 21 towns that the plaintiffs' lawyers want to include in a desegregation plan with Hartford showed large percentage increases in black and Hispanic residents in the 1990 census.
In towns he referred to as "leaders" -- like West Hartford, Bloomfield, Windsor and East Hartford, which adjoin the city -- "the pattern is one of increasing racial diversity," he said.
As black and Hispanic families follow whites to the suburbs, he said, the proportion of minority residents in the region who live in Hartford has declined.
But just as the plaintiffs took risks in their testimony over the last six weeks -- their detailed portrayal of the problems that poor children bring to school, for example, is not likely to make suburban parents keen to have their children join them -- the defense's demographics carried a double edge.
The suburban minority population may have grown, but so did Hartford's. The city -- home to 68.8 percent of the region's blacks, and 78.7 percent of its Hispanic residents -- saw its white population decline to 30.5 percent in 1990, from 44.6 percent in 1980.
And the growing minority population in older, adjacent suburbs like Bloomfield, which is 40.9 percent black, could be evidence not of lasting integration, but of towns in transition from white suburbs to black suburbs.
With blacks making up 12.6 percent of the region's population, 18 of the suburbs identified in the suit are less than 4 percent black, and 12 are less than 2 percent black, noted Philip Tegeler, a lawyer for the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union working for the plaintiffs.
Census data also showed that Puerto Ricans, by far the largest group among the region's Hispanic residents, were the most segregated minority group; 86.7 percent live within Hartford.
Overall, however, Professor Steahr's analysis buttressed reports by state education officials over the years that Connecticut's population is becoming more diverse as the number of whites declines and other groups grow in number.
The need for people to live and work amid that diversity is a main argument of Governor Weicker and education officials in proposing legislation to require towns and cities to draft plans for reducing racial isolation in schools across the state.
The legislation, made public last Friday, proposes that regional education councils submit integration plans to the state by August 1994 and begin carrying them out the next year.
Towns would be encouraged to establish magnet schools to attract students from more than one town, or to establish new interdistrict schools to take students across town lines. The state would pay for up to six new magnet schools and 12 interdistrict schools a year.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Overseas Selloff Dampens Bonds

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Treasury prices retreated yesterday because of selling abroad, several reports of positive economic data and concerns about the Treasury's plans for February's quarterly auction, which will be announced today.
Most of the decline came before trading began in New York. Traders said there was a lot of selling overseas, especially in Japan, where they said there was also concern about the Treasury auction announcement, which some expect will contain a reduction in the number of 30-year bonds offered for sale. 
 Once New York trading began, the recent positive news about the economy, which was re-emphasized in two reports yesterday, seemed to prevent the market from recovering.
"We didn't get news that is constructive for the bond market," said Matthew Alexi, government trading strategist for the First Boston Corporation. Other traders said trading was slow and that there was not much retail buying or selling.
In late trading in the secondary market, the 7.625 percent 30-year bond was offered at 10421/32 , down 16/32 to yield 7.24 percent, up from 7.20 percent on Monday. The current 6.375 percent 10-year note, due in August 2002, was off 15/32 to yield 6.43 percent, up from 6.25 percent the day before.
The prices of other Treasury notes were also down, including the five-year note, which fell 10/32 to yield 5.62 percent, up from 5.55 percent the day before. The discount rates on six-month and one-year Treasury bills moved higher, while the 2.95 percent rate on the three-month bill was unchanged.
 
Statistics Show Growth
 Several economic reports yesterday seemed to indicate that the economy may be growing this year at a pace close to the 3 percent-plus annual rate at the end of 1992. In January, a belief that the pace of growth may have slowed a little bit was a contributing factor to the rally that pushed the yield on the 30-year bond to 7.19 percent, a six-and-a-half-year low.
One of those reports yesterday was the Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators, which rose 1.9 percent in December -- the largest monthly increase in nearly 10 years. The December increase was a little higher than was predicted in many forecasts.
In addition, the Johnson Redbook report on chain-store sales showed that sales were up 4.6 percent in January over December.
These reports followed a jump on Monday in the January index of the nation's purchasing managers to a four-year high of 58 and the 9.1 percent surge in orders for durable goods in December, which was reported last week.
Some traders and investors had expected this to be a testing week for the bond market rally.
One reason for this view was that prices of Treasury notes and bonds had already moved very high and were due for some sort of correction. Another was that the economic data due this week, including the employment report for January to be released on Friday, might show the economy moving ahead a little faster than expected.
In addition, there is a chance for disappointment today when the Treasury announces the details of its quarterly auction of 3-year and 10-year Treasury notes and 30-year bonds. Many in the market are expecting a cut in the size of the 30-year bond auction, which was $10.25 billion in the last quarterly auction in November.
 
Concern About Refunding
 There has been a lot of speculation recently that the Treasury under the Clinton Administration will shift some long-term borrowing to short-term bills to reduce the Government's cost of borrowing and help bring down long-term interest rates. A cut in the size of long-term bonds at the auction would help support Treasury bond prices because the available supply would be reduced at a time of healthy demand.
"It is people looking at the refunding," said Steve Ricchiuto, chief financial economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, explaining the drop in the Treasury prices.
He said that one of the reasons the price of the 30-year bond rose so sharply recently was that traders who wanted to sell were unwilling to do so because of the uncertainty surrounding the Treasury announcement. If the Treasury decided to reduce the size of the quarterly auction of 30-year bonds those who had sold would face big losses.
But he said that the Treasury announcement on Monday that its borrowing needs in the second quarter would total $67 billion, which was basically unchanged from the November estimate, indicated that there may be no major reduction is the 30-year bond auction. He said the estimate also is a reminder that there is still "a lot of Government borrowing to be done out there."
While some analysts are expecting a cut in the size of the 30-year bond auction, this alone might not indicate a shift in policy to move some longer-term borrowing to shorter terms. It may just reflect an across-the-board cut in the size of the auction. This would mean that a decision on a new Treasury policy would have to wait until the May quarterly auction, which would continue the uncertainty in the market.

HEADLINE: Stocks Are Little Changed As Dow Retreats by 3.51

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
A selloff in medical stocks, stricken again with the regulatory virus, offset gains elsewhere to leave the major market averages little changed yesterday.
Nasdaq stocks continued to recuperate from last week, however, with an improvement of 3.35, to 705.12, yielding a two-day advance of more than 1.2 percent. The health fears that had beset cellular telephone stocks receded somewhat, and the stocks bounded ahead. 
 Considering the weakness of the bond market and medical issues yesterday, some strategists said, stocks were surprisingly resilient. "Today was not a bad day if you make those handicaps," said Ronald A. Clarke, director of active equity portfolios at Aetna Financial Services.
The Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.03, squeaking to a new record, for the second straight day, of 442.55. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.51 points, to 3,328.67.
Yesterday's encouraging economic news, with the leading economic indicators and single-family home sales soaring in December, suggests to Mr. Clarke that corporate earnings can, for the time being, continue to grow.
But for all the efficiencies companies are achieving, he said, they eventually will need improved sales to become more prosperous. "We need the consumer back," he said. "We want to see that top line grow."
Investors are awaiting this Friday's unemployment report to see whether the recovery is finally generating the new jobs that can produce better sales.
Some companies that can ride the domestic recovery without suffering from weaker markets abroad continued to gain yesterday. The Dow Jones transportation average was up 11.28, to 1,528.78, on the strength of railroad and trucking issues, with CSX, Conrail and Xtra each up by at least a point.
 
Big Board's Most Active List
 Medical stocks went in the opposite direction, as the Big Board's most active list was clogged with the industry's accidents. Merck, the busiest stock, fell 1 1/4, to 37 5/8; Glaxo 1, to 18 5/8; Bristol-Myers Squibb 1 3/8, to 58 1/8; Pfizer 2 7/8, to 63 1/8; Schering Plough 1 1/2, to 58 5/8, and Abbott Laboratories 1 3/8, to 26 1/8.
Few strategists had the stomach for defining a bottom. "No one knows," said Robert Heisterberg, global policy analyst at Alliance Capital. "No one's written down all the major health-care changes coming in the United States."
A Salomon analyst braved an estimate that drug stocks could fall another 15 percent, and slashed a load of them from her buy list. Investors heard yesterday that President Clinton was considering a plan to hand out children's vaccines at no charge, possibly setting a precedent for Government regulation of the drug industry.
Nasdaq stocks continued their recovery, after pulling back from record levels last week. Cellular issues, buffeted by health fears lately, were aided by news reports and a Congressional hearing that eased some of these worries.
McCaw Cellular gained 1 7/8, to 35 1/4; Fleet Call 2 5/8, to 23, and Lin Broadcasting 2 1/8, to 82 3/4, though they are still off substantially since the health scare hit. Motorola, on the Big Board, added 1/2, to 54 1/4.
Such Nasdaq technology issues as Microsoft, Lotus, Cisco Systems and Adobe gained more than a point, although biotechs slipped.
Lone Star Steakhouse vaulted ahead 3 3/8, to 41 3/4, on its ambitious expansion plans and an analyst's more generous earnings estimate. Some other restaurant stocks tagged along, with Cracker Barrel rising by 1, to 45.

HEADLINE: Study Says Trade Pat Will Aid U.S. Economy

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
The first comprehensive assessment of the North American Free Trade Agreement by a Federal agency has found that the pact will help overall American economic output and employment slightly, while producing job losses in the auto, household appliance and apparel manufacturing industries.
The study by the International Trade Commission, an independent Federal agency, buttresses claims made for the agreement by the Bush Administration and rebuts some of the criticism from labor unions and some members of Congress who have predicted huge job losses.
 
 
First Independent Evaluation
 The study, to be made public later this week, has been awaited on Capitol Hill and at the White House as the first independent evaluation of the pact's merits. It was sent to the Senate Finance and the House Ways and Means Committees Monday night, and a member of Congress allowed a reporter to examine it this afternoon. 
 The report provides little ammunition for critics who have called for extensive renegotiation of the agreement.
If approved by Congress, the trade agreement would eliminate -- over the next 15 years -- virtually all import-export barriers among the United States, Canada and Mexico.
President Clinton promised during the campaign to negotiate three side agreements covering workers' rights, environmental issues and import surges, but said that he would not renegotiate the half-foot-thick basic text of the agreement. But Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, muddied that issue at his Senate confirmation hearing on Jan. 19, when he said that he hoped to address the sugar industry's concerns through one of the side agreements.
The free-trade pact is one of several large trade issues facing the Clinton Administration. Also today, Senator Max S. Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee's trade panel, introduced legislation to revive the expired Super 301 law, which had set a fixed schedule of Administration action against foreign countries that trade unfairly, as opposed to indefinite negotiation. The law expired at the end of 1990.
President Clinton endorsed Super 301 during the election campaign, and it is expected to become law this year. Mr. Baucus also introduced a measure today that would allow domestic industries to force the Federal Government to take action if foreign governments appear to break commitments in past trade pacts.
Also today, a Congressional aide said that the Administration was reviewing with Congress whether to seek a limited renewal of the so-called fast-track legislation, which allows the President to submit trade agreements to Congress for expedited consideration with no amendments allowed. The Administration is considering a six-month renewal for multilateral agreements -- such as the 112-nation world trade pact now being negotiated in Geneva -- and a four-year extension for bilateral and regional agreements.
The International Trade Commission's report concluded that if the North American pact was approved by Congress, employment would eventually drop by up to 5 percent in the automotive and apparel industries and up to 15 percent in the major household appliance, glass and ceramic tile industries. The report attributed the job losses to extra competition from Mexican imports and the construction of new factories there.
But the study estimated that compared with employment forecasts without the agreement, total employment with the agreement would gradually rise by up to eight-hundredths of a percentage point in the United States, up to six-tenths of a percentage point in Canada and up to 6.6 percent in Mexico. The American auto parts, computer, industrial machinery and textile industries would gain jobs.
The commission's report also projected that the long-term effect would be to increase annual economic output by up to three-tenths of 1 percent in the United States, by up to five-tenths of 1 percent in Canada and by up to 16.2 percent in Mexico.
Economic studies have consistently predicted that the pact would have the greatest effect on Mexico because its economy is only one-twentieth of the size of the United States economy, and because Mexico already relies heavily on trade with the United States.

HEADLINE: Banks Post a Drop in Yields

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit for the week beginning today are down slightly from those offered last week.
In the New York market, six-month C.D.'s were lower than at the 20 major banks across the country, with the decline about the same everywhere in money market account yields. 
 At the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills, average discount rates were just slightly mixed, with the three-month bill down modestly for the fifth consecutive week and the six-month up for the first time in five weeks. The Treasury's auction is regarded by many as a harbinger of deposit rate changes that banks might put into effect in the weeks ahead.
The average rate at auction yesterday was 2.97 percent for a three-month Treasury bill, down a basis point and 3.10 percent for a six-month bill, up a basis point. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
According to the latest survey by The Bank Rate Monitor, New York area money market account are down an average of 2 basis points, to 2.67 percent. Analysts note that the slide in money market accounts is now nearly two months old.
The average New York rate for a three-month certificate dropped a basis point, to yield 2.77 percent, while the average yield on a six-month certificate, also off a basis point, is 2.95 percent.
New York banks posting the sharpest changes this week included First Nationwide, which dropped 26 basis points from its money market account, to 2.17 percent, and 15 basis points off its six-month C.D., to 2.70 percent. Carteret Federal Savings in New Jersey lowered its three-month C.D. by 10 basis points, to 3.05 percent.
Outside the New York market, yields at 20 large banks were down a little, with the average money market account off two basis points, to 2.64 percent, and a six-month C.D. off a basis point, to 2.99 percent.
Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor, said that savings deposits have yet to react to positive business signals, with the last six weeks showing the number of banks decreasing their deposit rates exceeding the number of those increasing rates. The ratio during that period has been six to one in favor of decreases, Mr. Heady noted.
"Don't expect rates to rebound on one week's worth of good economic news," he said. "It will take a steady series of economic signals before rates recover for depositors."


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, Feb. 3, 1993. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: B.A.T. Splits Top Jobs in Management

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
B.A.T. Industries P.L.C., the tobacco and financial services group, has split the roles of chairman and chief executive.
The company said today that Martin Broughton had been named the first chief executive in its 90-year history, effective April 1. Sir Patrick Sheehy will remain chairman, and Mr. Broughton will have the additional title of deputy chairman. He will manage the group's business and develop business strategy. 
 Mr. Broughton, a 45-year-old accountant, joined the British-American Tobacco Company as a traveling auditor in 1971 and held a variety of positions in the group's tobacco business before becoming finance director of Eagle Star, B.A.T.'s British insurance arm, in 1986. In 1980, Mr. Broughton moved to B.A.T. Industries' Brazilian subsidiary, becoming finance director in 1984. He joined the board of B.A.T. Industries in 1988 and became a member of the chairman's policy committee in 1990. Mr. Broughton is currently managing director, financial services and chairman of Eagle Star, having previously been the group's senior finance director.
Sir Patrick, 62, said the decision to split the roles of chairman and chief executive would be reviewed when he retired. Commenting on the appointment, Sir Patrick said: "Martin's innate ability and his considerable experience of both tobacco and financial services will make him a first-class chief executive for the group. Dividing the roles of chairman and chief executive is very much a new and untried development in the 90-year history of B.A.T. Industries."
Aided by a substantial contribution from B.A.T's insurance businesses, and despite depressed world economic conditions, pretax profit for the group rose by 56 percent, to $1.6 billion, for the first nine months of 1992. Farmers Group, B.A.T's California-based financial services arm, which escaped any impact from Hurricane Andrew, saw trading profit increase 18 percent, to $600 million, from $225 million for the corresponding period a year earlier.
The company's cigarette brands include Kent, Lucky Strike, Barclay and Capri. Its first initiative in Central Europe came last March with the acquisition from the State Property Agency of Hungary of Pecs Tobacco, the largest cigarette manufacturer in Hungary.

HEADLINE: Europe Gripes About Clinton Trade Stance

BYLINE: By PAUL L. MONTGOMERY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Feb. 2

 BODY:
The 12 members of the European Community let loose a few preliminary grumbles today about what they perceive as the emerging trade protectionism of the Clinton Administration.
"Two examples in two weeks can hardly be an accident," said Niels Helveg Petersen, the Danish Foreign Minister, who speaks for the community on foreign affairs during the six-month Danish presidency that began Jan. 1. 
 Mr. Petersen, concluding the monthly meeting of community foreign ministers here today, cited the announcement Jan. 27 by the United States that it would impose tariffs on flat-rolled steel from 19 countries it said were selling at unfairly low prices in the American market. He also pointed to Monday's announcement by the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, that nations of the community would be barred from bidding on Federal utility and service contracts. Mr. Kantor said the actions were in response to community restrictions on American imports of electrical and communications equipment.
 
 
'Completely Unjustified'
 Mr. Petersen said that the initial actions of Mr. Kantor's department were "worrying" and "completely unjustified." Robert Urbain, the Trade Minister of Belgium, said that the American actions were "provocative in the extreme."
Such words would have been the equivalent of a glove across the face a century ago in a dueling situation, but in modern capitalism, they are only shots across the bow in negotiations.
There is much negotiating time before the American actions take effect in the spring, and Sir Leon Brittan, the community's trade negotiator, is to meet Mr. Kantor in Washington for a get-acquainted session on Feb. 11. Mr. Petersen plans to go to Washington at the end of the month.
The current tensions are an abrupt change. The Bush administration, which had its differences with the European Community, was generally perceived in Europe as a free trader. And President Clinton, in his election campaign, made clear that his concerns to spur the domestic economy would come before foreign concessions.
 
'Very Important Products'
 But Mr. Kantor, in his nomination hearings on Jan. 19, said that his top priority was to attack the European Community's public procurement directive, which gives European advantage to contracts for telecommunications, power and transport. "This is a nontariff barrier to entry for very important products from out country," Mr. Kantor said at the time.
Mr. Petersen said that Mr. Kantor and the United States had misunderstood the original European directive. Actually, he said, it opened the public market to foreign competition.
Mr. Petersen said that the community was not yet thinking of retaliation, which would amount to a trade war. "This is not the time," he said. "The thing now is to tell the United States that they are doing the wrong thing and to stop doing it. What is at stake here is global recovery."

HEADLINE: Moscow Insists It Must Sell the Instruments of War to Pay the Costs of Peace

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Struggling to earn hard currency and preserve jobs, Russia and the other republics of the former Soviet Union are selling arms and technology to Iran, China and other countries whose military buildups are causing great concern in the West.
The Russian arms exports in particular rankle Washington even though they are down sharply from cold-war days and appear to have little ideological motivation. Critics of the sales also concede that Moscow has extensive control over high-technology arms sales and that it tries to adhere to United Nations arms embargoes. 
 Defending the sales, Russians point out that American arms sales are also extensive, now accounting for more than half the world market. Indeed United States officials, mindful of the vulnerability of President Boris N. Yeltsin and of Moscow's need for cash, are loath to criticize Russia too loudly.
 
Where the Arms Are Going
 Among the transactions causing concern are sales of submarines to Iran, Patriot-style surface-to-air missiles and advanced fighter-interceptors to China, T-72 tanks to Syria and advanced rocket engines to India. Other buyers include North Korea and Libya.
These sales pose a quandary for the Clinton Administration.
"Anybody can sell arms," a senior Western diplomat said. "But Russia's list of buyers is essentially our list of nasties."
Of even more concern, the diplomat suggested, is the danger that dangerous new technologies will spread as Russian factories win more freedom to seek customers and as highly trained military scientists and engineers are offered large amounts of money for their expertise. Russian officials say a group of missile engineers -- not nuclear engineers, as originally reported -- were detained at the Moscow airport last fall on their way to North Korea.
 
Meanwhile, in Ukraine
 Newly independent states, like Ukraine and Georgia, are seeking their own customers outside the Russian system, and impose few export controls on low-tech weapons like rifles, artillery and ammunition. There are also persistent reports that Ukraine, for instance, is seeking Greek and other buyers for ships of the Black Sea Fleet, which is under the joint control of Moscow and Kiev.
But Russian officials say, and Western diplomats agree, that factories outside Russia were designed to make routine parts or to assemble weapons, while highly sensitive parts were almost all made in Russia and still come under Russia's export controls.
 
Washington Does Likewise
 And for all the anxiety about proliferation, Russia has a fairly well-defined system to approve sales of advanced arms. Western diplomats say there has been little cause for concern thus far about unauthorized sales or exports of complex technology.
Russian officials make no apologies for selling arms abroad or seeking to sell more, stressing a system of oversight to prevent sales that might destabilize countries. They also note that despite the smaller world market, the United States has maintained the level of its arms sales abroad while Russian sales have fallen sharply.
Russian officials acknowledge that much of the Soviet Union's arms revenues were on paper, since allies like Vietnam, Cuba and others rarely paid what they owed. According to the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, arms credits constitute more than 40 percent of the $146 billion owed to Moscow, and are considered uncollectible.
Russia now demands hard-currency cash from purchasers, while the United States is able to grant concessionary credits. Russian officials also acknowledge that enormous problems in supplying spare parts and servicing have diminished their competitivity, especially for aircraft.
 
Problems for Old Customers
 The collapse of the Soviet Union has also meant big problems for traditional customers like Syria and India. No longer able to deal with a single Soviet ministry for parts, they must now run from factory to factory, from republic to republic, trying to arrange separate contracts, or they simply cannibalize new planes, tanks and machinery.
Because of the parts problem, Western diplomats suggest that old Soviet customers will soon find it hard to keep their armies functioning, making them reluctant to buy new weapons from Russia despite their technical excellence and lower prices.
An adviser to Mr. Yeltsin, Mikhail Malei, also complains that adherence to United Nations arms embargoes on Libya, Iraq, Bosnia, Croatia and Yugoslavia cost Russia $7 billion last year.
The Soviet arms industry suffered an embarrassment during the Persian Gulf war, when American and allied forces destroyed the Iraqis' Soviet equipment. But Viktor K. Glukhikh, chairman of the Russian Defense Industries Committee, said that for security reasons, Iraq did not get top-of-the-line arms, and that many of the arms were old or used poorly.
 
Desperate for Sales
 All these difficulties add to the desperation of Russian officials and factories to sell arms to any country within reason if it has the cash, or to fulfill older Soviet contracts, like Iran's purchase of three Kilo-class submarines for some $750 million.
Much-ballyhooed plans for the widespread conversion of military enterprises to civilian production, first announced by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1988, were largely ignored by managers who are only now beginning to take structural change seriously. Even now, managers of sophisticated plants resist making non-stick pots and prefer to talk of advanced products like microwaves that they cannot yet make efficiently and that most Russians cannot afford.
Mr. Glukhikh said that with more than six million people dependent on more than 1,700 military-dominated enterprises, the Government must help them to find buyers in order to keep them in work and to earn the hard currency necessary to convert to making more civilian goods.
 
Yeltsin Vents Resentment
 Russian officials also say they resented the Bush Administration's often undiplomatic efforts to restrain Moscow's freedom to sell its arms as the United States does.
President Boris N. Yeltsin gave vent to that frustration recently when he said "it would be shameful" not to fulfill Russia's agreement to supply rocket engines to India, despite complaints by the Bush Administration that the technology could be used for anti-ballistic missiles. He said future policy "depends on the reason and common sense" of the Clinton Administration.
This resentment is reinforced by criticism in Parliament that Russian policies are dominated by Washington.
"If we sell SU-27's to China, and it's our legal business, the United States objects," said Pyotr G. Litavrin, head of export control for the Foreign Ministry. "Then they sell F-16's to Taiwan -- 150 aircraft! And then they say it's their response! It's ridiculous -- two dozen SU-27's versus 150 F-16's!"
More delicacy is particularly required now, he suggested, when Mr. Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev are being criticized so strongly by opponents of his economic policies and by self-styled nationalists.
Mr. Glukhikh said: "There is resentment, but it's subjective. My resentment is one thing; for someone who loses his job, it's another. But there is a competition for arms sales, and when we win, as we did for the Indian rocket engines, the United States complains that we cheat or destabilize."
Bush Administration officials respond that Washington was conscious of Mr. Yeltsin's difficulties; otherwise they would have reacted more harshly.
 
'People Depend Upon It'
 Mr. Malei argues that defense industries must earn hard currency to finance their own conversion. "The lives of people depend upon it," he has said. "If we have to choose between the life of a child and the sale of a cannon to Qaddafi, we will choose the life of the child."
In the next year or so, officials see Russia's main customers as China, Iran, Syria and India, which now account for 80 percent of arms exports, and possibly Taiwan and Malaysia. Malaysia is considering 30 MIG-29's to balance recent purchases by Singapore and Thailand of the more expensive F-16's. But Malaysia is said to be concerned about servicing and the supply of parts, and annoyed by would-be "mediators" who arrived from Russia seeking commissions.
Cuba also continues to buy as much as $200 million a year in weaponry.
Mr. Glukhikh said he is also looking to the Middle East, with special emphasis on Persian Gulf states like the United Arab Emirates, which are watching Iraq and Iran with unabated fear. "The United States is much interested in our position there," he said, "but I can assure you we will be competitive."
 
Leading Buyers of Russia's Arms in 1992
 CHINA
 Some $1.4 billion for 24 top-of-the-line SU-27 fighter-bombers. Also advanced S-300 surface-to-air missiles. Exploring the purchase of an aircraft carrier, MIG-31 fighter planes, diesel-powered submarines, bombers and rocket engines.
 
 IRAN

Twenty-four Su-24 bombers, spare parts for Iraqi planes flown to Iran for "safekeeping" during the Gulf War and never returned. Unconfirmed reports of 50 MIG-29 fighter planes, MIG-31s and SU-27s, and 200 T-72 main battle tanks.
 
SYRIA
 Reports of a $2 billion sale of 24 MiG-29s, 12 SU-27s, 300 T-72 and T-74 tanks, S-300 surface-to-air missiles and SA-14 shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles.

U.S. Economic Reports Lift The Dollar to a Higher Close

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
A batch of positive United States economic data helped push the dollar to a higher close yesterday, while the British pound extended recent declines.
Gold prices rose 10 cents on New York's Commodity Exchange, where bullion for current delivery settled at $330.40. A late quote from the Republic National Bank said spot gold dipped 20 cents, to $329.65.
The dollar got a mild lift from a 1.9 percent rise in the December index of leading indicators, a 6.3 percent December rise in sales of new single-family homes and a Johnson Redbook report that said retail sales climbed 4.6 percent in January.
"I guess you could walk away concluding a recovery is in place which we know is not robust but moderate," said Richard Trainer, an economist at Bank of Tokyo in New York.
 
Fears of a German Rate Cut
Analysts noted that much of the dollar's recent strength had largely come from expectations that Germany would lower its official interest rates and increase the attractiveness of the dollar against the high-yielding German mark.
"Everyone still believes they will lower rates but the timing is what's difficult to call," said Tom Hoge, a trader at Credit Suisse in New York.
Comments today from Reimut Jochimsen, a member of the Bundesbank's central council, that easing German rates would not help the country's economic problems added caution to dollar bulls.
In New York, the dollar settled at 1.6410 marks in late afternoon trading, up from 1.6350 marks late Monday. Earlier in London, the dollar dipped to 1.6298 marks, from 1.6340 marks Monday.
 
Dollar at 124.985 Yen in Japan
 In Tokyo, the dollar ended at 124.98 yen. Later in London, it fell to 124.75, from 124.80 yen Monday. In New York, the dollar fell to 124.69 yen, from 125.05 yen late Monday.
In London, the British pound settled at $1.4635, up from $1.4540 late Monday. In New York, the pound slipped further to $1.4435, also below $1.4590 late Monday.
Other late dollar rates, compared with Monday quotes, included 1.5205 Swiss francs, up from 1.5181; 5.5520 French francs, up from 5.5340; 1,522 lire, up from 1,515, and Canadian $1.2646, up from $1.2633.

HEADLINE: Revenue Bonds For Arizona Unit

 BODY:
The Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District of Arizona tentatively priced $261.6 million of electric system revenue refunding bonds yesterday. Proceeds of the issue will be used to refund bonds sold when interest rates were higher and to lower the district's debt costs.
Underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company said the maximum yield was 6.15 percent for an issue due in 2019. The taxable equivalent of that bond for an investor in the 28 percent tax bracket is about 8.54 percent. 
 Shorter maturity serial bonds, which are noncallable, were priced to yield from 2.75 percent for a bond due in 1994 to 4.60 percent in 1998 to 5.40 percent in 2003, 5.90 percent in 2008 and 6 percent in 2010. Another long bond due in 2013 is priced to yield 6.10 percent.
The taxable yield equivalent for those in a 28 percent tax bracket ranges from about 3.82 percent in 1994 to about 8.33 percent in 2010, and about 8.47 percent in 2013.
Underwriters said the financing was rated double-A by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: U.S. Resumes Granting Patents On Genetically Altered Animals

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
The Government has ended a self-imposed moratorium and has again begun approving animal patents, nearly five years after Harvard University made history by patenting a genetically engineered mouse.
The United States Patent and Trademark Office issued patents in late December to three organizations covering "transgenic" mice specially suited to research in human medicine. These were the first new animal patents since Harvard received approval in April 1988 for a genetically altered research mouse that was predisposed to getting cancer. 
 The Harvard mouse prompted a backlash from animal-rights groups and some environmentalists, but with the latest approvals industry experts expect a surge of new patents covering mice, pigs and even cows. The trend should make the filing and approval of animal patents much more routine and make it much easier for biotechnology companies to raise money.
 
Switch in Emphasis
 More than 180 applications for animal patents are awaiting Government action, many of them having been pending for years. And while much of the earlier emphasis in so-called bioengineering was on breeding superior farm animals -- cows that give more milk, for instance, or pigs with leaner meat -- the current push seems to be in manipulating animal genes for the benefit of human health.
Near term, scientists expect to see such developments as laboratory mice made genetically suited for research on AIDS and other human diseases; genetically altered pigs that produce human hemoglobin for use in blood substitutes, and bioengineered cows that produce milk with the proteins found in human mother's milk.
The most ambitious and very likely the most controversial of these efforts is in "xenografts" -- developing animals that can supply organs like hearts, livers or kidneys for human transplant recipients. The DNX Corporation, a biotechnology company in Princeton, N.J., is working to develop pigs with genes that mask the immunological markers of "pigness," which normally provoke a human immune system to wage all-out war against an alien body part.
 
Timetable for Transplants
 Officials at DNX, which in 1991 developed a pig that produces human hemoglobin, said the first swine-to-human transplants could take place by the late 1990's.
"My understanding is that these first few are just the beginning," James McCamant, publisher of the Ag-biotech Stock Letter in Berkeley, Calif., said of the recently issued patents. "To me, the most important impact is that it will allow us to find out who's got a strong patent position. Over the next 12 months, we should have a lot clearer idea of what's going on."
The approval of new animal patents, while good for the United States biotechnology industry, is almost certain to reignite political opposition in Congress from animal-rights groups and some farmers. In 1989, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would exempt farmers from paying royalties on the offspring of genetically engineered livestock, but the measure never advanced very far in the Senate.
But much has changed in the last five years. Industry executives say their shift away from farm animals had little to do with the political controversy. Rather, most say the decision stemmed from technical issues and a concern that farm animals simply would not produce big profits
"The science wasn't ready yet to make it economically feasible," said James Sherblum, president of the TSI Corporation in Worcester, Mass. TSI dropped efforts to develop a "super pig" whose meat would have less cholesterol, largely because of persistent problems with the animal's immune system.
 
Move Into Drug Testing
 Hoping for more immediate profits, TSI put most of its money into developing mice that could be used as laboratory models and is using them to carve out a position in the drug-testing market. During the last three years, the company bought eight drug-testing laboratories and plans to introduce genetically engineered mice in the next 18 months that develop Alzheimer's disease and AIDS.
"The animals give our scientists a distinct advantage because we can understand better how the human drug will work in humans," Mr. Sherblum said.
Most of the other biotechnology companies that were interested in farm animals have also changed course. The Granada Corporation, a cattle breeder in Houston, virtually shut down a unitthat was working on fast-growing, genetically engineered cattle. DNX shelved its work on fast-growing pigs, bought two testing laboratories and is planning to introduce a mouse that develops insulin-resistant diabetes.
Central to such efforts, however, is breaking the logjam on patents, which give a company the right to stop anyone else from using or selling its invention for 17 years. The Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that novel living organisms can be patented, and thus far the Federal courts have not objected to applying that doctrine to novel animals produced through gene-splicing.
Companies involved in "transgenic" animals say patent protection is crucial, because otherwise they have no way to prevent customers from simply buying one animal and breeding as many others as they like.
But the Patent Office, which was besieged by controversy when it issued the first animal patent to Philip Leder and Timothy Stewart, two Harvard researchers, apparently got cold feet. Though dozens of other applications had been filed, and the number multiplied quickly, no new patents were issued until five weeks ago.
Now a new round of attacks is likely, particularly from farmers and animal-rights organizations. Such groups say that splicing genes into animals willhurt family farmers, have cruel effects on many animals and could endanger many species of animals.
"We believe the gene pool should be maintained as an open commons, and should not be the private preserve of multinational companies," said Jeremy Rifkin, head of the Foundation on Economic Trends, a nonprofit organization in Washington. Mr. Rifkin, who has lobbied for legislation to block animal patents, said he was organizing a new political coalition in response to the latest patents.
"This is Government giving its imprimatur to the idea that there is no difference between a living thing and any inert object," Mr. Rifkin said. "It's the final assault on the sacred meaning of life and life process."
An animal patent covers animals with particular gene sequences that do not exist in any natural animal species and which give the animal identifiable, unique characteristics. The patent allows a company to prohibit anyone else from using or selling such animals without its permission for 17 years, and may also cover the pharmaceutical proteins or antibodies the animals might produce.
The patents also cover the offspring of such animals, even though the chromosomes of offspring are always different from those of parents. To enforce the patent, however, a company would have to show that a pig or a mouse still has the transplanted genes and possesses the characteristics described in the patent, like the capability of producing human growth hormone.
So far, the gene patents have moved much more slowly than applications for other types of inventions. While the average application now takes 18 months to reach a final decision, the three mice patents that were issued Dec. 29 had all been pending for about four years.
Patent Office officials said they did not impose a formal moratorium on transgenic animals. "These things just take a long time to work through," Oscar Mastin, a spokesman for the agency, said. "They have been working on these applications the whole time."
In the absence of a fuller explanation, some industry experts believe that a fear of possible Congressional restrictions had a chilling effect on the Patent Office. But others see the delay as a result of the agency's attempt to carefully define and limit the patents to specific animals with particular genetic characteristics.
Steven Holtzman, executive vice president of DNX, said the new patents are crafted much more narrowly than the one covering the Harvard mouse. That patent actually covers any animal with a particular gene that predisposes it to develop cancer.
The three new patents are restricted to genetically engineered mice, and each is restricted to a particular set of transplanted genes. Dr. Leder, the Harvard scientist who obtained the original mouse patent, has won a second one with a colleague, William J. Muller. This patent is for a mouse that develops an enlarged prostate, a common problem of older men.
Also, researchers at Genpharm International in Mountain View, Calif., patented a mouse without a working immune system, developed for use in AIDS research. And researchers at Ohio University patented a virus-resistant mouse, for use in developing agricultural livestock less vulnerable to disease.
"The Patent Office is being very tight," Mr. Holtzman said. "They are saying that a patent is only being given with the limits of the example you provide in your disclosure. Simply writing a paper disclosure doesn't carry the day."
Information made public by the European Patent Office shows that universities and companies are developing an expanding army of small animals that are genetically programmed to suffer. Several European companies have applied for patents covering mice that are prone to get AIDS, tumors, leukemia and something akin to Alzheimers.
Except for the United States, no country has approved an animal patent. Indeed, in December, the European Parliament recommended that the European Community reject such patent applications.
The animal-rights critics notwithstanding, most experts believe a big wave of animal patents is imminent in the United States. "I think we're going to see an increase in the pace," said Eugene Moroz, a patent attorney at the law firm of Morgan & Finnegan in New York who specializes in biotechnology issues.
Several companies appear to be placing their biggest bets on molecular "pharming," the technique of using genetically engineered animals to produce valuable drugs. Companies have applied for patents on animals that produce drugs like human growth hormone, the heart-attack- prevention drug TPA and insulin.
Genpharm International is seeking patents for a transgenic bull it has developed in the Netherlands. The bull sires cows whose milk contains lactoferin, a protein unique to human mother's milk that inhibits bacteria growth and helps a baby retain iron. David Winter, president of Genpharm, said the protein could be sold as an additive to infant formula or the milk itself could be developed as an approximation of human milk.
Genpharm is also developing mice with human immune cells that could develop antibodies to dangerous human illnesses and could even attack tumors. At the moment, humans develop severe allergic reactions to antibodies made in other animals, and the hope is that antibodies made with human immune cells will avoid that problem. "Most people don't think it can be done," Mr. Winter said. "But we know it can."

HEADLINE: Personal Health

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody

 BODY:
A SIX-PAGE letter arrived last month that aroused first outrage, then sadness and prompted this public response.
It was a plea from Dr. Joseph DiGennaro, a professor of exercise, sport and leisure sciences at Lehman College, a division of the City University of New York, to help keep physical fitness an integral part of a college education. A recommendation by an advisory committee to the board of trustees to eliminate tax-supported physical education throughout the city university system is under discussion as one of many cost-saving measures for the struggling system. 
 The CUNY proposal is far from unique. Abandonment of fitness and athletic programs seems to be a common solution these days to budgetary problems at educational institutions throughout the country, including prestigious and wealthy schools like Yale University.
Whatever the merits of the argument for the necessity of such cuts, the institutions that are especially hard hit are the public schools where children, teen-agers and young adults are supposed to be learning habits that foster a long and successful life. And the argument against such cuts can be made not just by fitness professionals who stand to lose jobs in education but by people concerned about health consequences in all areas of society.
An important goal of a well-rounded education is producing sound minds in sound bodies, to prepare young people to meet the challenges of a complex, ever-changing and increasingly sedentary world. The loss of physical education in any public institution affects a system that serves many young people who could not afford things like private tennis lessons, swimming and skating lessons and memberships in health clubs or even the Y.
 
Inactivity the Norm
 Discounting the importance of physical education in public institutions at any level is also unfortunate because after the so-called exercise explosion of the 1970's and early 80's, many Americans have returned to or never relinquished their favorite physical pastime: sitting and pressing the pedals of cars and the buttons on the television remote controls.
Dr. Paul Z. Siegel, who directs the Adult Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Surveys for the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, says, "It's a myth that Americans are becoming more active." The fact is that the small percentage of Americans who are physically active now is about the same as it was in the mid-1980's.
Nearly three out of five adults in this country lead sedentary lives, spending less than three 20-minute sessions a week at leisure-time physical activity, national surveys show. While some people classified as "sedentary" may spend one two-hour session a week at an activity like tennis, half of them do nothing at all. Three 20-minute sessions: that is only one hour out of 168 hours in a week. Many people spend more time than that in the shower, and most do not even have any sweat to rinse away.
For the poorer people in our society (those with incomes below $20,000 a year), the inactive share is even higher, consistently above 60 percent throughout the second half of the 80's. It is notable that the highest shares of sedentary adults were found in areas with large low-income populations, like New York, Kentucky and the District of Columbia. In the district, where former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George Bush regularly jogged and President Clinton is now doing the same, 73.3 percent of adults are sedentary and 51.9 percent get no physical activity at all.
For the nation as a whole, 28.7 percent of adults get no physical exercise, and Dr. Siegel pointed out that Americans are far from the goal for the year 2000 established by the Public Health Service of reducing the prevalence of inactivity to below 15 percent among all people over the age of 6.
 
High Costs

As the professor who wrote to me described the plight of his students, "College physical education courses represent the only avenue through which inner-city residents of low economic status can learn exercise skills as well as the kinds of information and knowledge requisite to their attainment of optimum levels of physical health and fitness."
Dr. DiGennaro further said that the "blanket elimination of physical education" will end up costing society far more than would be saved.
"The dollar costs attributed to elevated levels of disease and ill health (such as obesity, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, back pain and coronary heart disease) associated with poor nutrition and the inactive life style stand only to soar to higher than current, alarming levels as a consequence of this ill-conceived action," he wrote.
Indeed, Dr. Siegel noted, "Lack of physical activity is the most prevalent behavioral risk factor for heart disease in this country, far surpassing smoking and obesity." And, of course, inactivity fosters another of those risk factors, obesity, which is linked to high blood pressure and diabetes as well as to heart disease.
There are other potential costs in eliminating physical education, like the difficulties of teaching academic skills to children who are restless and inattentive when deprived of the calm induced by physically venting their youthful exuberance or socially destructive activities pursued by some teen-agers and young adults if their abundant physical energies remain unchanneled toward more healthful expressions.
 
Keep Movement Alive
 Turning this trend around requires public pressure from all corners of society on the people who establish the funds and curriculums for education, both public and private. These include elected representatives at all levels, schools chancellors, university presidents and school boards.
The pressure must come not only from professors, teachers and coaches who stand to lose their jobs when physical education is cut, but also from parents and students who stand to lose their health and their potential for being productive citizens. Many parents need only turn to themselves for examples of the consequences of lifelong inactivity; a march on Washington for fitness education could be the only exercise that some protesters get all year.

HEADLINE: A Dietary Debate: Is the Mediterranean A Nutritional Eden?

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
AFTER years of dredging up data and issuing conflicting advice, dietary researchers and agricultural economists, food lovers and food manufacturers are looking for common ground. They dream of a place where public policy and the latest dietary trend can cohabit tastefully, affordably and healthfully ever after -- a simpler place, where the food is less processed, the produce fresher and the nutritionist returned to the happy role of giving the kind of advice that people want to hear.
For decades, dietary experts battled hunger, nearly obliterating diseases of malnutrition, like rickets and beriberi, by prescribing more of certain foods or by fortifying foods with vitamins. But today, said Adam Drewnowski, director of human nutrition at the University of Michigan School of Public Health in Ann Arbor, "We have to contend with dietary excess." 
 Instead of lobbying to feed America more, he said, the challenge to dietary experts is to wrest excess -- particularly the excessive fat that is linked to obesity, coronary heart disease and some forms of cancer -- from the American table. As their mission has changed, so has the role of nutritionists. They've gone from being do-gooders to being deprivers.
Now they are looking for seductive ways to package the bad news. "We've been telling people the same thing for 20 years," said Marion Nestle, the chairwoman of the department of nutrition, food and hotel management at New York University and the managing editor of the 1988 Surgeon General's Report on nutrition and health. "The problem with nutrition isn't that it is confusing. It's that the best advice is boring."
But consider the nutritional packaging potential of the Mediterranean, a place where siestas and daily walks endure, a place where the traditional peasant diet -- high in vegetables and fruit, and low in animal products -- fosters a lower rate of heart disease than the diets of American and northern European countries. There is still disagreement about certain aspects of the diet. But among dietary experts, there is no question that touting a "Mediterranean diet" is sexier than telling people to eat more fruits and vegetables and less fat.
More than 200 scientists and economists joined food lovers, growers and processors in a four-day conference last month in Cambridge, Mass., to consider the merits, pleasures and feasibility of the Mediterranean way of eating in America. The meeting was organized by the Harvard School of Public Health and Oldways Preservation and Trust, a food research organization.
Food lovers have long championed the sun-kissed flavors of southern France, Italy, Greece and Morocco. Playing against the background of rare olive oils, redesigned pizzas and hand-hewn pastas that have become chic in America, the mellifluous Mediterranean diet seems to weave a velvet glove around the steely reality of a low-fat regime.
Sipping one of the two glasses of wine that are part of the daily Mediterranean way of life, a researcher from the National Cancer Institute was enthusiastic about stemming the flow of animal fat onto the American table. "Everybody has a romantic fantasy about that part of the world," he said. "All we need is some cooperation from the growers and processors."
Of course, there were nutritional details to be resolved. Dr. Walter Willett, the chairman of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, extolled the virtues of a "plant based" diet, especially its reliance on olive oil. His recommendations first appeared in a 1991 editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine.
"We have little evidence that nonanimal fat correlates with an increased risk of coronary heart disease or breast cancer," he said. But he acknowledged a significant correlation between animal fat and colon cancer and said there are "centuries of epidemiological evidence about the benefits of olive oil."
But Dr. Dean Ornish, the author and cardiologist whose no-fat regime has been shown to reverse heart disease, said that olive oil is no "magic bullet." He said that he was appalled by the amount of olive oil (up to 40 percent) that Dr. Willett included in a Mediterranean variation of the United States Department of Agriculture's food pyramid, and that he was unconvinced by Dr. Willett's assertion that fat from meat, rather than oil derived from plants, is the real dietary demon.
Yet, in the style of politicians finding common ground, the researchers agreed that, at the very least, the low-meat content of the traditional Mediterranean diet made it recommendable. By embracing such a diet, Dr. Nestle said, scientists can forgo scientific hairsplitting that confuses the public.
This "nutrient splitting," as Dr. Nestle calls it, can be disruptive on the nation's diet. In the last decade, sugar, then salt, then cholesterol were branded menaces to the public health. Later, when additional evidence revealed them to be less than lethal, the substances were restored to a modicum of respectability. But not before thousands of new grocery products, substitutes, fast-food items, cooking techniques, cooking equipment and cookbooks had sprung up.
Currently, the numbers look bad for eating butter and meat fat, and the low-fat market is flourishing. Fat stands accused of deeds far more dastardly than those of sugar, salt and cholesterol combined: in addition to contributing to obesity and coronary heart disease, a diet high in animal fat increases the risk of getting some cancers.
But so far, the taste for french fries and beef, milk and rich ice cream hasn't been completely quelled by these warnings. Unlike sugar or salt, fat is a dense and efficient source of nutrition, one that delivers a primitive message of well-being to the consumer.
As potent sociologically as it is metabolically, fat has become the nadir of traditional nutritionists: the appetite for it can't be combatted simply by clinical findings, its effects can't be offset by vitamins or fortification. And the public's support for the current dietary message is uneven.
"The same people who championed the fight against hunger get very nervous when the issue of dietary excess is addressed," Dr. Drewnowski of Michigan. Rather than simply reminding people to take their vitamins, he said, dietary experts now question people's food choices, and "inevitably, that raises issues about morals, values, and life style."
Even with their sights set on the fruits and vegetables and pastas of the Mediterranean, the conference attendees themselves had trouble resisting culturally ingrained eating patterns. Each night, contingents of up to a dozen scientists fled the fiber- and olive-oil-rich dinners and, like so many fat-junkies looking for a fix, went to a steak house in Boston for dinner.
Dr. Drewnowski, saw this reaction as neither individual sloth nor failed willpower. "A diet high in meat fat is the hallmark of an affluent culture," he said. "People naturally resist giving up something that generations before them have struggled to achieve."
He was pessimistic about his colleagues' attempts to cajole America into sprightly new eating patterns. "The only thing that's going to make a dramatic difference in the amount of fat we eat is an economic depression," he said.
Curiously, a shift from meat and potatoes to a Mediterranean diet could initiate a fiscal decline, some experts said. And this fact clouded the sunny image of the Mediterranean for both dietary experts and food lovers.
The proposed dietary change, said Theodore Panayotou, an agricultural economist at the Harvard Institute for International Development, "would dislocate agriculture from the Middle West to either coast," he said. In addition, since the United States climate cannot sustain the quantity of olive and fruit trees and garden vegetables that the Mediterranean can, there would be an increased dependence on imported goods.
Joan Gussow, professor of nutrition at Teachers College at Columbia University, added, "It would be a total disaster agriculturally and economically." There are smaller stumbling blocks, too. Scientists debated whether the vegetable oils that can be produced in the United States, like corn, safflower and canola, might not be just as beneficial as olive oil. Food manufacturers wondered whether the little-processed foods of the Mediterranean diet could be viable economically in an industrial society. Public-policy makers couldn't imagine bringing the beef and dairy lobbies into the Mediterranean fold.
But these issues seemed contendable to those at the conference, issues that the public, if bitten by the romance of the Mediterranean, could sway. Only the expense of reproducing a traditional diet of poverty in America looked insurmountable.
"It's one thing to craft Mediterranean food in the elite bistro ghettos," said Dr. Warren Belasco, professor of American studies at the University of Maryland and author of "Appetite for Change: How the Counterculture Took On the Food Industry" (Pantheon, 1989). But a mass-market Mediterranean diet is another proposition.
In an industrial society, the price of handmade bread, garden vegetables and time-consuming food preparation is daunting. Ultimately, the economists said, it would whittle prosperity and limit dietary choices for economic reasons, rather than for the sake of health.
This paradox wasn't lost on dietary experts. Ultimately, it would restore them to their earlier role.
"It's difficult to have a diet of poverty without the poverty," Dr. Drewnowski said.

HEADLINE: As Schools Trim Budgets, The Arts Lose Their Place

SERIES: Missing Muses: First of two articles.

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA

 BODY:
Arts education, long dismissed as a frill, is disappearing from the lives of many students -- particularly poor urban students. Even though artists and educators argue that children without art are as ignorant as children without math, their pleas have gone unheard as schools have struggled with budget cuts.
Now, in a new campaign to preserve the arts in schools, supporters are taking a different tack. They argue that art classes teach the very qualities that educators believe can reinvigorate American schools: analytical thinking, teamwork, motivation and self-discipline.
 
A Vanishing Subject
 "Arts education in the public schools is very much at risk of being eliminated if we are not more vigilant," said Carol Sterling, director of arts education for the American Council on the Arts. "We must demonstrate that when children do arts, they are doing critical thinking and problem-solving and learning about civilization. Unless we categorize this in terms people understand, arts will always be considered a frill." 
 There is little reliable up-to-date information on how many schools actually teach art, music, dance or drama. In states like Minnesota, Oklahoma and South Carolina, arts education is thriving. But in many cities and towns, tight budgets mean that arts are the first to go. In California, fiscal problems have wiped out art classes in many schools, particularly in Los Angeles.
In New York City, a mecca for artists, two-thirds of public elementary schools have no art or music teachers. Many highly regarded programs are suffering, including the selective-admissions high schools for which New York was once renowned. Not only have teachers and classes been eliminated, but even supplies and instruments for after-school activities like band or theater productions are gone.
By contrast, Japan and Germany require schoolchildren to study the arts every year, and their schools devote more classroom time to arts than American ones.
Yet America's changing economy and its increasing ethnic diversity make arts education more important than ever before, experts argue.
 
The Case for Arts
What the Arts Can Teach
 Few educators dispute the arts' importance, but they argue that hard times demand hard choices. "Yes, I want more art, but my priorities are what?" said James S. Vlasto, a spokesman for the New York City school system, which has seen tight budgets cut arts classes severely. "Do I preserve class sizes from kindergarten through sixth grade at less than 40? We need more art, we certainly do, but we need more bilingual teachers."
Yet arts are vital, supporters argue, because they can help develop the very skills employers say they want, offer lucrative job opportunities and teach sensitivity to other cultures. Arts education, its supporters say, helps children develop their own artistic talents, encourages some to stay in school, builds future audiences and teaches them about past civilizations. Moreover, new theories about how children learn and think suggest that the arts can inspire children often dismissed as failures.
"When there is no art in school, there is usually no alternative to learning by the written and spoken word," said Carol Fineberg, an arts education consultant who has examined how children developed analytical abilities through studying art. "Kids who have a capacity to communicate visually have no avenue for expression. They feel themselves with each year increasingly a failure."
Take a recent art class at Colorow Elementary School in Littleton, Colo., taught by Angelique Acevedo, who was named the 1992 Art Teacher of the Year in the American Teacher Awards.
Running so fast he lost his breath, a boy rushed into Ms. Acevedo's art room and handed her a bag. "Blue bottle caps!" shouted the teacher, who seemed as excited as the boy. "Awesome!"
The bottle caps will become objects of art. They might become the eyes on an African mask, or the buttons on an American Indian dance costume.
"If you're painting, roll up your sleeves," Ms. Acevedo called to children clustered in groups of eight around three big round tables. "Let's go!"
The fourth graders knew just what to do. They scurried in all directions. Some children pulled their Japanese paintings off a clothesline strung across the room. Others took out knives to work on origamic architecture, a three-dimensional Japanese paper design.
At the end of the hour, Ms. Acevedo told her students not to worry if their projects were incomplete. "You can come in at break or after school," she said, and there was not a word of protest among the students about the suggestion of giving up free time to do unfinished schoolwork.
 
The Past and Present
Mrs. Molloy's Piano Or Nothing at All

Formal arts education in the United States began in the late 19th century, with the rationale that future workers needed to be able to design competitive industrial goods. Many artists, in particular minority artists like the conductor Michael Morgan, had their first contact with art in public school.
That is not to say that arts education was uniformly good.
"I don't know when the Golden Age was," Dr. Fineberg said. "In the 1950's, when I went to elementary school and Mrs. Molloy played the piano, we had what laughingly passed for music education."
In fact, 75 percent of Americans in a 1989 National Endowment for the Arts report said they had never had any art appreciation classes, and 43 percent had never had art lessons.
Yet if arts education has always been spotty, experts say things are worse now.
A nationwide survey of arts education conducted in 1989 by the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana found that the amount of classroom time devoted to the arts and the number of schools that taught children to play instruments had declined since 1962. Most schools say they offer music and art, but the National Center for Education Statistics estimates that nearly half of American schools have no full-time arts teachers.
Although 42 states require schools to teach the arts, and 30 states require graduates to take courses in the arts, these requirements are so sometimes vague that students can meet them by taking a foreign language. In 1987, the typical high school graduate had taken one and a half arts courses, according to the National Center on Education Statistics. Nor do most regular classroom teachers receive much training in the arts in college.
Some places are committed to arts education. Minnesota offers grants to help school districts design comprehensive arts programs. Oklahoma passed a law that requires all schools to teach arts. And South Carolina includes arts among the basic subjects that students must demonstrate they have mastered to graduate.
But there is evidence that hard times in the last few years have whittled away at arts classes across the country. A survey conducted last year by the National Association of Elementary School Principals found that nearly half had made cuts in music and arts programs.
With arts education in jeopardy, its backers have embarked on a new campaign to convince the American public, school administrators and classroom teachers that the arts are not only vital to children's basic education, but are a necessary part of the drive to improve the nation's schools. The idea is for arts educators to join the national debate about educational change, and be part of any solutions.
Over the past year, arts educators and advocates have joined forces to begin writing arts curriculum standards and devising national tests to see whether students are meeting those standards -- part of a effort begun by President George Bush, and expected to be continued by President Clinton, to create voluntary standards and tests in every subject. The arts standards are expected to be ready next year; the first pilot tests, by 1996. And this week the Getty Center will hold a conference on how arts education can be a catalyst for educational change.
 
Case Study: New York
A Proud Tradition Is Eroded
 One of the bleakest pictures in the country is that of New York City, once a national leader in arts education. The country's first high school for the arts, the High School of Music and Art, was created there during the Depression, and many high schools had noted art departments that drew students from throughout the city.
Since the city's fiscal crisis of the 1970's, however, arts education has steadily lost ground, according to two panels studying the issue in New York. Teachers scramble for arts supplies. Many schools have lost not only classes but also band, chorus and even the spring musical. Of the 32 school districts in New York City, just two have an art and music teacher in every school, a situation that makes it impossible for schools to meet state requirements that students take one arts course before graduation.
That also means that the city is failing poor schoolchildren in particular, Dr. Fineberg said. "Here we are serving those who cannot turn to parents and say, 'Pay for piano lessons,' " she said. "School must be the source of inspiration and instruction."
Even the city's vaunted specialized arts schools are suffering. "They were unprecedented in the U.S. at first," said Diana Cagle, principal of the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan. "Now they are being surpassed."
The country's most prestigious arts colleges have told her that New York City students are no longer competitive with those coming from other cities, like Miami, with better-endowed arts programs. The provost of Miami's New World School of the Arts, Richard A. Klein, who used to run New York's LaGuardia High School for Music and Art and the Performing Arts, said his students now sweep national arts competitions that New York high school students used to win.
Keeping arts programs alive in regular New York City high schools has required political vigilance and entrepreneurial hustle. Naomi Lonergan, an assistant principal at New Dorp High School on Staten Island, has seen her arts program shrink by three-quarters from 1973, when the school had seven full-time arts teachers. The school has cut courses in fashion, computer graphics, printmaking, sculpture and advanced ceramics and photography -- fields in which New York City offers considerable career opportunities.
Ms. Lonergan's students provide most of the money for art supplies themselves through their thriving arts businesses at fence shows throughout the city -- selling silkscreened T-shirts, street portraits, printed calendars and envelopes, calligraphy and buttons. Her students not only make money -- half the profits go to them, half for supplies -- but they also learn that their art is valuable and that art is also a business, she said.
And New York City school officials say they have tried to restore art by working with other agencies, cultural institutions and private groups and training more regular classroom teachers in the arts. They are also updating the curriculum. But they say they are hobbled by budget cuts.
 
Case Study: Miami
Teachers Maintain A Devotion
 Excellent arts programs exist in individual New York City schools. But what impresses experts about Miami is that arts classes are consistently available to all children, have won top administrators' support and have been retained despite fiscal strains.
Every pupil in Miami takes 60 minutes of art and 90 minutes of music a week, and every elementary school has an art and music teacher. Dade County offers special arts programs for gifted students in elementary, middle and high schools. Students from across the city audition for schools with programs in art, music, dance or drama. They then specialize in that one field, taking 90-minute to two-hour art classes four days a week in addition to their regular classes. As a result, Miami cultivates gifted arts students from fourth grade on.
In a rare example of commitment to the arts, Dade County's Board of Education defines the arts as a basic skill. All high school students must take at least one semester of art to graduate. And despite school budget cuts of 6.5 percent, 11 percent and nearly 5 percent in each of the last three years, the arts took the same proportional cuts as other subjects.
Miami's schools have such artistic vitality because arts teachers have organized to form a powerful lobby, enlisting the support of the school board, business leaders, local arts organizations and parents, said Lilia Garcia, who supervises art education in Dade County. "We became a force to be reckoned with," Ms. Garcia said of the movement she helped lead 20 years ago. "We just don't let people forget we're here."
Now the impact of that campaign can be seen in classrooms across Miami. At Charles Drew Elementary School in the impoverished Liberty City neighborhood, students in Marie Mennes's art class work on a vivid and expressive array of ceramic tiles and wrap them as presents in paper they have designed and printed.
Down the hall, Virginia Shuker admonishes her young dancers, who are preparing for a performance of "The Nutcracker."
"Don't let me see lobster claws," she says, reminding students to unclench their hands. Across the city at South Miami Elementary School, Andrea Busher tries an experiment with her fourth, fifth and sixth grade school chorus: asking them to sing a capella.
These are sophisticated demands made of students who have mostly been identified as artistically gifted. But even in some regular schools, the arts are thriving.
At Cutler Ridge Middle School south of Miami, Marilyn Polin decided she wanted to offer a more intensive study of arts to students outside the gifted and talented programs. The school's principal and schedulers created two-hour blocks of time for arts, and Ms. Polin invited all students who could maintain a C average to apply for programs in art, music, or drama.
The day a reporter visited the school, vandals had broken in and sprayed graffiti on murals students had created painted, one of Elvis, another of a vivid tropical scene. But students fanned around the school, whitewashing the walls. And when the walls were dry, they set to work painting their murals again.

HEADLINE: OFFER BY ISRAELIS IS PRAISED BY U.S.

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 2

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration sought today to cast the offer of Israel to take back about 100 of 400 deported Palestinians in an optimistic light as Arab countriespressed ahead here with their campaign for Security Council sanctions against the country.
In Washington, the State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, called the Israeli decision "a breakthrough" and said the "important process that has been established obviates the need for further action in the Security Council." 
 Mr. Boucher said it was now time "to concentrate our efforts on invigorating the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations," adding that the United States would soon be consulting with Russia, the other co-chairman of the Middle East peace conference, about dates for the next round of talks, the ninth.
 
U.S. Hoped for More
 But the 100 Palestinians that Israel has agreed to take back fall well short of earlier American hopes that it could be persuaded to accept at least twice that number immediately and the rest shortly afterward, thus answering Arab charges that it is in violation of the Security Council's order that all 400 deportees be allowed to return..
Many Council members said today that the Clinton Administration's call for the Council to drop the whole Palestinian issue was making their position very difficult because it seemed that the United States was trying to block discussion of an issue that still angered many countries. Arab and many other nations feel that the Council is imposing a double standard at American insistence whereby it punishes countries like Iraq, Libya and Yugoslavia for defying its orders but excuses Israel.
Arab countries appeared to harden the sanctions they want the Security Council to impose on Israel until it complies with the Council's demand.
They dropped a previous suggestion that Israel be banned from future human rights meetings organized by the United Nations, including the world conference on human rights due to take place in Vienna in June. Instead they asked the Council to order all countries to withdraw trade concessions or other preferential economic treatment given Israel, including its important preferential trade arrangements with the United States and the 12 European Community countries.
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali appeared to add his voice to those, saying Israel was still not in full compliance with the Security Council's orders.
Lester Pollock, chairman of the Organization of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, quoted the Secretary General, after meeting with him today, as saying he still had "reservations about whether they are in compliance, reservations about whether a partial return is good enough."

HEADLINE: EARLY MAMMOGRAM GETS ENDORSEMENT

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
Addressing what it called a public confusion about whether women in their 40's benefited from regular mammograms, the American Cancer Society said yesterday that they should continue to have the breast X-rays it recommends in its guidelines.
At a two-day workshop in New York, the seven men and one woman on a panel of experts agreed that there was no ironclad evidence that women under 50 benefited from mammograms. But they said there was enough presumptive evidence to make them leery of changing the screening guidelines. 
 In reviewing the available studies, "we have found more than sufficient data to support the usefulness of mammography as a life-saving procedure for women 40 to 50 years of age," said Dr. Walter Lawrence, the past president of the cancer society and chairman of the meeting.
The cancer society and the National Cancer Institute now recommend that women in their 40's have mammograms every one to two years and that women in their 50's have the tests annually. But it has been surprisingly difficult to find if the X-rays lower the death rate of women in their 40's. In contrast, study after study has shown that older women benefit from mammograms.
 
Canadian Study Plants Doubt
 The cancer society called the meeting after the Canadian National Breast Cancer Study, involving nearly 40,000 women, failed to show that younger women benefited from mammograms. As a result of that study, many cancer experts questioned the current guidelines, in part because mammograms are expensive, costing $50 to $100. Recommending the X-rays for younger women has also been questioned because the screenings may lead to unnecessary biopsies and miss cancers in younger women, giving them a false sense of security.
But participants at the workshop said that not enough time had passed to know whether the mammograms helped these women and that mammography had vastly improved in the decade since the study began, making it easier to find tiny tumors in the younger women.
The participants at the meeting agreed that the data were not adequate to prove that mammograms benefited younger women, whose denser breasts can make the X-rays more difficult to read. But Dr. Daniel B. Kopans, a radiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital who was a panel member, said a clinical trial to answer the question definitively would involve 500,000 women in their 40's and would take 10 to 15 years to obtain results.
Dr. Kopans added that he thought it might be difficult to find women willing to participate in such a study because half would be randomly assigned to forgo mammograms. In any event, no such study is planned, so radiologists and epidemiologists must rely on what Dr. Kopans and others said they regarded as suggestive, but not definitive, data.
 
Support for Annual Tests
 Another panel member, Dr. Lazlo Tabar, a radiologist at Central Hospital in Falun, Sweden, said that although figures were not statistically significant, when he combined studies and analyzed them, the data indicated that women in their 40's did have a slightly lower mortality rate if they received mammograms. When he analyzed his data from a study in which women received mammograms every other year, he concluded that younger women should have mammograms every year.
Dr. Tabar also said he and others saw no difference between cancers found in older and younger women, indicating that if mammography was less effective in younger women, it was because of the quality of the mammograms, not the intrinsic characteristics of the tumors.
Dr. Kopans added that he thought the debate over mammograms was "purely an economic issue," adding: "If mammograms were free, we wouldn't be having this discussion. Our best medical information is that it is of benefit. It may be too expensive for society, but if so we should say so."

HEADLINE: Panel Set to Urge Overhaul Of Aid for College Students

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
A commission selected by Congress and former President George Bush to study revamping financial aid for college students will recommend today that the current patchwork of loans, grants and work-study programs be replaced by an integrated approach. Under the plan every student would automatically become eligible to receive one level of aid -- $14,000 a year -- regardless of income.
But the type of aid will vary. Poorer students will get more in grants; those who are better off, more in loans. 
 The recommendations of the National Commission on Responsibilities for Financing Postsecondary Education will also include making loans directly to students, not through banks, and a community-service repayment option, similar to President Clinton's proposal to forgive a part of the loans in exchange for work in disadvantaged communities or in public-service jobs like teaching or cleaning parks.
Executives of the bipartisan commission, which has been holding public hearings around the country for two years, said they hoped that the recommendations they were presenting to Congress would, if enacted, make college affordable again.
"College was much more affordable in the 1970's than it is now for all families," said Jamie P. Merisotis, executive director of the commission. "As a result of that increasing unaffordablity of college, there are growing concerns about access to higher education and what role higher education is really going to play in the social and economic revitalization of the country. That message came through very clearly in our hearings."
Although the commission was created by Congress, Congress must vote to enact the recommendations, and that is not at all a given because the Higher Education Act was just reauthorized a year ago -- after two years of debate -- and is due for renewal in six years.
Still, the Bush Administration, which strongly opposed ideas like direct loans, has been replaced by an Administration that campaigned on such ideas. And the recommendations are expected to have the support of influential members of Congress like Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, after whom the main college grant program is named, and Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, who has strongly supported the concept of direct student loans.
"I have discussed this possibility with Dick Riley, the new Secretary of Education, and other key people in the Administration," Senator Simon said. "I'm not saying it is definitely going to be done, but it's safe to say there is a review that will be taking place in the coming weeks."
 
Federal Aid Is Lagging
 In all, the Government spends $20 billion a year in college financial aid, Mr. Merisotis said, about twice what it spent in the early 1980's, a rate that did not keep up with costs.
One of the commission's main recommendations is to combine the different aid programs in one package that would be pegged each year to the actual cost of college. The current estimate is $14,000.
Mr. Merisotis said a student from a poor family going to a school that cost at least $14,000 a year could receive a large grant, a small loan and a work-study subsidy. A student from a middle-income family would receive a smaller subsidy in the form of a grant, a larger loan and a work-study component. A student from a family without financial need could get an unsubsidized loan for the $14,000. If college costs are less than $14,000 a year, the packages would be adjusted.
The recommendations, if fully adopted, would increase Federal spending on financial aid by nearly $7 billion, mostly for increases in the Pell grant program, Mr. Merisotis said.
Several repayment options would be available. In one, loan repayments would vary depending on a graduate's income. In another, students who perform community service for a year could have 20 percent of their loan forgiven, up to a total of three years or 60 percent. A loan could be completely forgiven for five years of service in an area considered critical.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Clinton's Support of Abortion Rights Has Catholic Leaders on a Tightrope

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
For 12 years the Roman Catholic Church enjoyed a happy solidarity with the White House on the issue of abortion. It was an emblematic alliance of the politics of the 1980's: Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, shoulder to shoulder with cardinals and bishops from Democratic redoubts like New York and Boston, standing firm on the issue that has consumed the church hierarchy in recent years.
Now the bishops have a new President, one who carried the Catholic vote last fall, who is a graduate of a Catholic university and who has endorsed much of the social welfare agenda that the National Conference of Catholic Bishops has advocated for years. But this President also chose, as one of his first acts, to begin to roll back 12 years of Republican abortion restrictions, and he has promised to do more. 
 The relationship between President Clinton and the Catholic Church will be very, very complicated.
 
Different Responses
 The Vatican's response to Mr. Clinton's abortion orders was quick and unequivocal, a thundering editorial in its semi-official newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, denouncing the new President for putting the United States on "the paths of death."
But the response of the American bishops to the Clinton Administration is more complex. They are struggling to maintain an unwavering stance on abortion while trying to adjust their strategy to a political scene that makes the outlawing of abortion increasingly unlikely.
They are trying, their spokesmen say, to preserve a relationship with Mr. Clinton that would allow them to work with his Administration on other issues. They say they had their differences, as well, with the Reagan and Bush Administrations, and that they always approach their work in a bipartisan spirit.
They are trying, in short, to avoid open warfare with the President.
"The expressed goals of the Clinton Administration include things we're very interested in, such as universal entitlement to health care," said Msgr. Robert N. Lynch, general secretary of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. "Obviously, the crunch moment came very quickly on abortion. But we will continue to try to work with the Administration on those things we agree on, and voice our disagreement on those things we disagree on."
An equally diplomatic response comes from the White House. "President Clinton, who as you know is Jesuit-educated, has a lot of close relationships with Catholics and Catholic priests," said Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, alluding to Mr. Clinton's undergraduate degree from Georgetown University. "They share many goals, including social and economic justice and religious freedom."
And Catholic Democrats on both sides of the abortion issue say it is in the interest of the bishops and Mr. Clinton, a Southern Baptist, to get along.
Still, the abortion issue is already causing major strains. Mr. Clinton was seen by some in the church as needlessly provocative when he chose to sign his abortion-related orders on Jan. 22, the anniversary of Roe v. Wade and the day abortion opponents descended on the nation's capital for their annual protest against the Supreme Court ruling that established a constitutional right to abortion. More than a dozen bishops and cardinals attended that event, along with a crowd estimated by the police at 75,000.
 
'Political Insensitivity'
 "It showed a real political insensitivity to these folks who care about this issue very strongly," said the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, a Jesuit who is a senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown. "He could have at least waited until they left town."
But critics of the Catholic hierarchy contend that it is simply getting a taste of what it is like to play politics and lose.
"The bishops simply do not have the Catholic constituency behind them on this," said Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice. "That is known to Catholic politicians. There are none left who believe the bishops can deliver the Catholic vote on this issue."
That view was supported by a poll conducted last November by Voter Research and Surveys, a consortium of the four major television networks. It showed that voters who identify themselves as Catholics hold about the same views on abortion as the population at large: a strong majority want to see it available in most cases. Indeed, Mr. Clinton's support for a woman's right to choose abortion did not prevent him from receiving the support of 44 percent of Catholic voters in the November election, to Mr. Bush's 35 percent.
 
Clinton's Catholic Vote
 "American Catholics, knowing full well Clinton's pro-choice position and the quite blatantly pro-choice tone of the Democratic convention, nevertheless voted for Clinton at slightly higher levels than the population at large," said the Rev. Richard McBrien, a theology professor at the University of Notre Dame.
Adding to the political difficulties of the church hierarchy, some of the most prominent Catholic politicians support abortion rights and criticize the church's handling of the issue, even though some have been publicly rebuked in recent years from Catholic leaders like John Cardinal O'Connor, the Archbishop of New York.
In an interview last week, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York said, "For the Catholic Church to try to win the United States of America over to the Catholic position on abortion -- which is no abortion, period, not even to save the life of the mother, not for rape or incest -- for the Catholic Church to say that is what you must believe and that is what you must legislate, I don't think it's appropriate and I don't think it will work."
"As I said at Notre Dame," Mr. Cuomo added, alluding to his seminal speech there in 1984, in which he sought to draw the line between an elected official's personal faith and public responsibility, "you cannot stop abortion by prohibiting it. You can curtail abortions by helping men and women avoid unintended pregnancies."
 
Political Counterpressures
 There are some strong political counterpressures. Representative Henry J. Hyde, an Illinois Republican who is a Catholic and one of the Congressional architects of anti-abortion strategy, says his church should be taking an even stronger stance against abortion. "I think the church ought to take on anybody and everybody if they're wrong," Mr. Hyde said in an interview. "The church's mission has been muted, it seems to me, by their failure to be more involved in this issue."
There are few signs that the church is flagging in the abortion struggle. The United States Catholic Conference said five million postcards were distributed to parishes for mailing last month urging Congress to vote against the proposed Freedom of Choice Act, which would prohibit states from enacting a variety of restrictions on abortion. The President has said he would sign such a measure if it reached his desk.
Helen Alvare, spokeswoman for the bishops' Secretariat for Pro-Life Activities, said the church had reassessed its strategy since the Supreme Court's ruling last June reaffirming a woman's basic right to choose an abortion. While it will continue its legislative activity, she said, the church will also escalate its educational efforts, publicizing alternatives to abortion for women in crisis pregnancies.
 
Struggle Against Violence
 Roger Cardinal Mahony, the Archbishop of Los Angeles who has succeeded Cardinal O'Connor as the chairman of the bishops' Committee for Pro-Life Activities, gave a homily on the eve of the Jan. 22 anti-abortion protest here in which he cast the abortion struggle as part of a broader struggle against violence in the culture. He called for a renewed dialogue on the issue.
At the same time, Ms. Alvare said, the conference could work with Mr. Clinton on other issues. "We will have a relationship," she said. "He can count on our support when he affirmatively promotes the human rights of the most vulnerable."
Many Catholic Democrats say they are hoping the relationship can work. Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston said he had discussed the issue with both the President and the President's wife, Hillary. "They've convinced me that while there's a difference of opinion on the abortion issue, there's no difference of opinion on the need to work together for social and economic justice and to correct some of the injustices and inequities in society," Mr. Flynn said in an interview.
John Carr, secretary of the United States Catholic Conference's Office of Social Development and World Peace, said, "It may be the reverse of our relationship with Bush, where we had common ground with him on abortion but were opponents of him on a whole host of other issues."

HEADLINE: Coal Miners Begin Strike in 4 States

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Faced with a threat to its members' high-wage jobs in a layoff-ridden economy, the United Mine Workers Union appeared prepared today for a long strike against the nation's largest coal producer, the Peabody Holding Company of St. Louis, a subsidiary of a large British company.
Richard L. Trumka, president of the union, ordered his Peabody members to stop work just before midnight on Monday. The striking workers -- who the union says number 7,700, but Peabody says amount to 5,000 -- work for two of the holding company's coal operations, the Peabody Coal Company of Henderson, Ky., and the Eastern Associated Coal Company in Charleston, W. Va. They have stopped work at 22 mines in four states -- Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky and West Virginia. 
 Negotiations on a new contract between the union and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, the bargaining agent for 12 companies that mine about 30 percent of the nation's coal, collapsed Sunday during a session at a hotel here. Both sides said that because of conflict over procedural questions they had not even begun discussion of such basic issues as wages and working conditions.
 
Possible White House Test
 If the strike persists a few weeks and spreads to other coal association members -- a real possibility, the union says -- the Clinton Administration will face a test of commitment to unions that supported its election. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich has not intervened, but he is staying in touch by telephone with Bernard E. DeLury, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the agency that tries to resolve labor-management disputes.
"He's monitoring the progress," Mr. Reich's spokeswoman, Mary Meagher, said. "He's letting the director do the job he's very good at doing."
For the union, the central issue is a growing practice among coal companies to hire nonunion miners when they close exhausted mines and open new mines. "The average remaining life of a B.C.O.A. mine is seven years," Mr. Trumka said. "The average age of my members is 40 to 44 years. Unless I can get them some job opportunity beyond that, they're going to be out in the cold."
Morris D. Feibusch, a spokesman for the coal operators, argued that opening mines is little different from opening a factory with nonunion workers. Nothing prevents a union from enrolling the workers.
Unions consider the practice a variation on one in construction known as double-breasting: A construction company that has a contract with a union will disguise its ownership in hiring nonunion workers for a new project so it can pay lower wages.
 
Issue of Nonunion Mines
 Union leaders also say opening nonunion mines is a variation of industry's growing use of nonunion workers to replace union members permanently when they leave work on strike. Many unions have made stopping permanent replacement their top goal in Congress this year, and President Clinton has assured them of his support.
But the issue of unionized mines is not yet on the table, participants in the coal negotiations say, because of a procedural matter. Before it can be dealt with, Mr. Trumka asks that the next contract be negotiated not with the subsidiary companies, like Peabody Coal and Eastern Associated Coal, but with Peabody Holdings and with the companies that control other members of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association.
Otherwise, he says, a holding company can ignore a contract and set up new companies to operate mines. "Whatever I sign can be circumvented," he said.
Peabody Holdings is a part of Hanson Industries in New York, which is the widely diversified American subsidiary of Hanson P.L.C. of London.
Hanson P.L.C.'s profits dipped a bit last year, to $2 billion from $2.1 bilion in 1991. But it and its coal operations are prospering.
Although negotiations began Nov. 6, Mr. Feibusch said, "they hadn't gotten to Step 1."
Mr. Trumka said that at the Hilton meeting Sunday he offered four companies' negotiators, including George S. Shiflett, president of Peabody Coal and chairman of the association, a 60-day extension beyond the termination then of the last five-year contract.
In return, he said, he wanted the companies to provide information about their ownership and other matters. He said that three negotiators were willing to go along but that one, Mr. Shiflett, refused.
Several major companies operate nonunion mines along with union mines, but in a statement late today, Mr. Shiflett noted that Peabody Coal and Eastern Associated Coal do not.
He also said, "There are many issues that are much more important to job security than the petty issues being addressed" by the union, like nonunion mines and the industry's difficulty in selling high-sulfur coal because of constraints arising from the Clean Air Act.
Mr. Shiflett also said his association wanted to extend the labor agreement during negotiations but that it was the union that refused.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT MOVES IN FAVOR OF LABOR

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
In a move of symbolic importance to labor unions, President Clinton has revoked two election-year orders by former President George Bush that were particularly hated by labor leaders who supported Mr. Clinton in his Presidential bid.
Late Monday afternoon, Mr. Clinton signed an executive order rescinding an order issued by Mr. Bush on April 14 that had required Federal contractors to post notices informing nonunion workers that, under the terms of a Supreme Court decision, they were not obliged to join unions and had the right to stop unions from using money collected in lieu of dues for political activities the workers opposed. 
 The President also reversed an executive order signed by Mr. Bush on Oct. 23 that prohibited Federal agencies and contractors hired by the Government from requiring workers on federally financed construction projects to be union members.
In a nation where only 16 percent of the work force is unionized, Mr. Clinton's orders will directly affect a relatively small number of workers, but they could signal a major change in attitude toward unions at the White House.
 
An '8' on Labor's Scale
 The Bush Administration generally sided with those who argued that unions had too much power in the workplace and that the Government should encourage the spread of measures that reduced the ability of unions to limit hiring to union members.
Mr. Bush's executive order in April was especially abhorred by the unions. The importance of overturning the order "ranked an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10," said Rex Hardesty, director of information of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
During the Bush years, union officials had difficulty even getting telephone calls through to White House officials. But Mr. Hardesty, in an interview on Monday, said the A.F.L.-C.I.O. had been working with Mr. Clinton's aides on the matter for weeks, sending information at the request of the White House to Bernard Nussbaum, the White House counsel.
The April executive order, described by Mr. Bush as a way to enforce a 1988 Supreme Court decision in the case of Communications Workers of America v. Beck, hit directly at the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s ability to raise money for political activity through fees from workers.
In a lawsuit brought by Harry E. Beck, an electronics technician, the court had ruled that workers who choose not to join a union but who work in states that require nonunion workers employed under a union contract to pay union fees may not be forced to pay for any activities other than collective bargaining and union representation on labor-management issues.
The Clinton Administration is now striking the first clear note that it will not follow this approach but will hew more closely to the traditional pro-union Democratic line.
Mr. Clinton made the shift explicit in a statement concerning the executive order.
"Today, I am taking two actions to restore a needed balance in America's workplace," he said. "I believe that these steps, by reducing unnecessary Federal Government intrusion into workplace relations, ultimately will promote the shared goals of American workers and management and strengthen the ability of this country's businesses and industry to compete in the world economy."
But the White House gave the order none of the trumpeted attention it accorded to his earlier decisions on abortion and political ethics.
Those who supported Mr. Clinton's action and those who opposed it addressed the matter in terms of politics and symbolism.
"We welcome President Clinton's actions in rescinding these executive orders as the first symbol of a renewed commitment to the national labor policy as set out in the Federal labor laws and to the fair and vigorous enforcement of those laws," said Lane Kirkland, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
The National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, a group that urged the Bush Administration to take its course of action, took a different view.
"President Clinton yesterday paid the first installment of his debt to big labor," said Rex H. Reed, the group's executive vice president. "By repealing the executive order to inform forced dues payers of their right not to pay for union politics, Clinton has shown that he cares more about paying off his political debts than fulfilling his inaugural promise to 'reform our politics so that power and privilege no longer shout down the voice of the people.' "

HEADLINE: Budget Official Sees No Savings in Clinton's Health-Care Plans

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office said today that neither consumers nor the Federal Government would get any short-term savings from proposals to overhaul the nation's health-care system put forward by President Clinton as well as by Republican and moderate Democratic lawmakers.
That conclusion, delivered by Robert D. Reischauer, director of the budget office, prompted expressions of frustration from members of Congress at a hearing of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. 
 It also touched off a political brawl as lawmakers reacted to Mr. Reischauer's testimony, a sign that bodes ill for efforts to forge a bipartisan consensus on the complex issues involved in health legislation. Normal partisan strains are intensified by the fact that the President's wife, Hillary, is in charge of drafting a health proposal for the Administration.
Mr. Reischauer's position is important because he is the official scorekeeper on whom Congress relies to assess the cost of legislation.
 
Contrasting Viewpoints
 Representative Bill Thomas of California, the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, criticized Mr. Reischauer, saying his estimates implicitly favored "centrally planned and dictated budgets" of a type favored by many liberal Democrats. "It's a cheap and easy way to get paper savings," Mr. Thomas said.
By contrast, Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who heads the subcommittee, welcomed Mr. Reischauer's testimony as supporting Mr. Stark's skepticism about "managed competition," in which consumers band together and buy care from competing networks of doctors and hospitals.
Mr. Stark said the testimony showed that "managed competition is to health care what the Laffer curve was to economics: a hope and a prayer and an untested theory."
The Laffer curve illustrated the theory, favored by Reagan Administration officials, that a cut in certain tax rates would lead to an increase in government revenue by giving people new incentives to work, save and invest.
The Congressional Budget Office, repeatedly embarrassed by its underestimates of Medicaid costs, has been extremely cautious in computing the costs and benefits of proposals to revamp the nation's health-care system.
 
Limit on Health Spending
 It is willing to recognize savings from a statutory limit on health spending, but only if there is a way to guarantee tough enforcement of the limit.
At today's hearing, on the rules for calculating the costs of health-care legislation, Mr. Reischauer said he saw no short-term savings from a strategy of managed competition.
In last year's Presidential campaign Mr. Clinton said he favored managed competition within the framework of a national budget to limit all health spending, public and private. Since the election, Clinton aides have said they hope to use the savings to cover the cost of guaranteeing health-insurance coverage for all Americans.
But Mr. Reischauer testified today that managed competition would not produce any "significant savings in national health expenditures" for at least five years. Whether it will save money after that is unclear, he said.
 
Extending Health Insurance
 In September, a group of moderate and conservative Democrats led by Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee introduced a bill embodying the idea of managed competition. Under the bill, they said, doctors, hospitals and insurance companies would form networks, and the networks would vie to offer the best care at the lowest price.
Mr. Reischauer said this bill would provide health insurance for 15 million to 20 million people who now have no coverage. Assuming that the Government requires all health plans to provide a comprehensive set of benefits, Mr. Reischauer said the bill would initially increase health spending. But he added that after a few years, health spending would be about the same as under current law.
The nation spent $838 billion on health last year, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that, if current trends continue, outlays will double, to nearly $1.7 trillion, by the year 2000.
By contrast, Mr. Reischauer estimated that a bill introduced by Mr. Stark, which relies more heavily on Federal regulation, would reduce health spending about 5 percent, as against what it would otherwise be in the year 2000.
 
Price Limits Sought
 Mr. Stark's bill would establish a yearly national health budget. It would authorize the Government to set maximum prices that could be charged by doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, laboratories and manufacturers of drugs and medical equipment.
These limits would be calculated by the same methods now used in Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly, but they would be somewhat higher than current Medicare rates.
Mr. Reischauer said fee schedules and rate-setting procedures had been reasonably effective in controlling Medicare spending. But, he said, "we are much less sanguine about the effectiveness of limits on other health spending."
Mr. Reischauer acknowledged that the five-year period normally used by the Congressional Budget Office in its cost estimates was not long enough to show the effects of comprehensive health-care legislation.
Such legislation will have gradual, profound and probably unpredictable effects on the behavior of consumers, doctors and other health-care providers, he said.

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Nominee Wary of Budget Cuts

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
President Clinton's nominee to head the Central Intelligence Agency refused today to endorse any immediate cut in the nation's estimated $29 billion intelligence budget, warning of multiplying threats to American security.
Resisting invitations to describe a new era of austerity for the nation's intelligence agencies, the nominee, R. James Woolsey, instead outlined what he said were widening and vexing challenges. He used vivid imagery to paint a portrait of the country's task with the cold war won. 
 "Yes, we have slain a large dragon," Mr. Woolsey told the Senate Intelligence Committee. "But we live now in a jungle filled with a bewildering variety of poisonous snakes. And in many ways, the dragon was easier to keep track of."
 
Wary of a Debate
 Mr. Woolsey, whose nomination won praise from Republicans and Democrats, appeared headed for certain Senate confirmation. But his reluctance to join in the debate about potential budget cuts left him oddly disengaged from a Congressional battle that began to flare even as he spoke.
In declining to outline specific budget cuts, Mr. Woolsey insisted that his testimony did not reflect any formal Administration conclusion about the proper level of intelligence spending. But his strong warnings about the gravity of threats appeared intended to serve notice that he would be highly wary of budget-cutting efforts that might weaken intelligence programs.
As a former arms-control negotiator and the most conservative member of Mr. Clinton's national security team, Mr. Woolsey also seemed determined to establish his independence from the new Democratic chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, who has indicated that he plans to seek cuts beyond the $1.6 billion that Congress stripped from the budget last year.
As they left office last month, both former President George Bush and the departing Director of Central Intelligence, Robert M. Gates, warned bluntly that such an effort would lead to disaster. But President Clinton's calls for sharp cuts across the military budget has led to expectations that he would impose a similar levy on intelligence accounts.
 
More Threats, Not Fewer
 Mr. Woolsey said he remained acutely aware of the need for economies in government, and he indicated that he would try in coming months to identify areas in which intelligence spending might be prudently reduced. But he said he would be reluctant to identify specific targets before an intensive review.
Pressed to be more specific, Mr. Woolsey indicated only that he would be more willing to endorse reductions in spending than to countenance a cutback in manpower at a time when the number of serious threats to American interests, despite the collapse of the Soviet Union, had "grown, not shrunk."
"In many ways, today's threats are harder to observe and understand than the one that was once presented by the U.S.S.R.," Mr. Woolsey said. He went on to liken ethnic violence in the former Yugoslavia to a cancer that could metastasize anywhere, and to list a host of other problems, including the spread of weapons of mass destruction, as "extraordinary" challenges.
The confirmation hearing, held in a stark and modern chamber, was convened amid tight security because of the unsolved killings last week of two C.I.A. employees as they sat in traffic outside the agency's headquarters in suburban Virginia.
 
Strong Endorsement Seen
 Mr. Woolsey, a 51-year-old Washington insider who has traversed the barriers between public and private life for more than two decades, met with scant criticism from committee members. The panel limited its questioning to a day, and it is expected to recommend overwhelmingly on Wednesday that the Senate confirm his nomination.
That swift embrace of Mr. Woolsey stands in sharp contrast to the 11-day ordeal to which the panel subjected Mr. Gates during combative hearings in the fall of 1991 before recommending, in a divided vote, that he be confirmed.
But it was plain from the beginning of today's session that Mr. Woolsey, who like Mr. Clinton is a Rhodes Scholar and a Yale Law School graduate, was among friends. So plentiful were other Rhodes Scholars among the senators who introduced Mr. Woolsey or were serving on the panel that Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, groused good-naturedly about what he called "a Mafia that's taking over the Administration."
But within the Intelligence Committee there were clear indications of recurrent tension over the question of budget-cutting. As Mr. DeConcini and some other Democrats made plain that they intended to pursue deeper cuts, Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming, took issue with the chairman's contention that intelligence agencies might have to accept less than state-of-the-art technology.
"If we're not ahead of the curve, we're going to be behind it," Mr. Wallop said. "If we're not on the cutting edge, we're going to be under it."
He added, "What you don't know can hurt you."
 
An Owl Who Spies?
 Mr. Woolsey, whose bespectacled face and balding pate can give him an owlish look, spoke with confidence but maintained a studied caution as he sat alone at a witness table, a battered leather briefase at his feet. He answered questions during open sessions in the morning and afternoon, and he later testified behind closed doors on more sensitive issues.
He said he had not reached a final decision on what he termed the "hottest" issue facing the agency: whether intelligence information should be shared with private American companies. He pledged if confirmed to order a "thorough review" early in the Administration to come up with a "systematic policy" on economic intelligence.

HEADLINE: Washington Shifts Gears;
'Motor Voter' Accelerates

 BODY:
President Bush vetoed the "motor-voter" bill last year, offering all sorts of flimsy reasons that barely hid cynical political calculation. Fortunately, democracy won't die that easily. The bill, designed to make it easier for all Americans to register and vote, is due to clear the House Rules Committee today and to hit the House floor for a vote by the end of the week.
The common-sense measure's nickname describes its core provision: States would be required to permit voter registration when people obtain or renew a driver's license. The law would also require that states offer registration by mail and at unemployment, welfare and other government offices. Those states that already have well-structured "motor-voter" programs posted significantly higher voter registration and voter turnout rates in the 1992 election. 
 President Clinton has endorsed the bill, removing any White House hurdle to enactment. As a result, leading House Republicans have turned to fear tactics in a last-ditch effort to block the reform.
Hoping to exploit concerns about illegal aliens recently heightened by the Zoe Baird mess, Robert Michel, the House minority leader, Newt Gingrich, the minority whip, and two other key Republican Representatives have signed a letter that depicts the measure as a "Non-Citizens Voting Rights Act." They assert it will invite an epidemic of illegal voting.
Yet it's hard to see why registering at the Department of Motor Vehicles would encourage any more fraud than doing so at the Board of Elections. Indeed, states that now allow such registration have seen no increase in cheating. And nothing in the statute interferes with the stern enforcement of voting requirements by the states.
What Mr. Michel and the other G.O.P. opponents really fear is that the unregistered may tend to vote Democratic. The best response to that, however, is not to block the participation of potential voters but to woo them with attractive candidates and positions on the issues -- in other words, to show some faith in democracy.

HEADLINE: Let's Go Back to Before Reagan's 'Tax Reform'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Congress and Clinton: A Handshake if Not a Kiss" (The Week in Review, Jan. 10): You are to be commended for quoting Prof. Charles Jones of the University of Wisconsin asking, "How are we going to solve these problems within the constraints of the great Reagan debt?"
Why do so few have the courage to state openly that our runaway national debt is the Reagan debt continued into the Bush Administration? The debt incurred during these 12 years is more than the indebtedness accumulated over 200 years of borrowing since the birth of the Republic. We all know this to be so. 
 When President Reagan invited David Stockman into the woodshed, he was told by his budget director that the figures didn't add up, that his proposed tax cuts coupled with increased military spending would lead to huge deficits. This warning was ignored on the theory that lower taxes would encourage economic expansion and growth, and thus wipe out the deficit. It didn't work, and the deficit continued to grow.
We've gone through a period of sybaritic license for the rich, coupled with failure of investment to keep up with the country's needs. It was safer to lend money to the Government than to risk loans for innovative investment. There was no money for adequate investment in infrastructure or housing. Revenue went to build up the military. Tax policy made the rich richer, while falling rate of investment led to falling employment and an increase in the number of poor. Past Reagan debt is so staggering we no longer feel free to use deficit financing to deal with our serious socioeconomic problems.
To avoid repeating our mistakes, it is imperative to recognize that the massive indebtedness that limits our ability to deal with problems is due in large part to the Reagan tax cuts.
Is there an American leader with the courage to declare that to deal with the mess that President Reagan got us into it is necessary to re-examine our entire tax and budget policy?

HEADLINE: Let's Go Back to Before Reagan's 'Tax Reform';
Structural Recession

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Economists Meet, and Puzzle Over a Slump" (Business Day, Jan. 9), reporting on the American Economic Association meeting in Anaheim. Calif.: Economists will remain puzzled as long as they insist on talking about "the recession" because there are two different recessions at work, one cyclical -- which seems to be over -- the other structural, going strong and with no end in sight. The structural recession is characterized by a reversal of the usual cause-effect sequence. Layoffs, especially at high wage levels, are its main source rather than its result.
The two recessions interact: a cyclical downswing in 1990, combined with drastic cuts in defense spending and with growing global competition, have acted as catalysts to accelerate the restructurings of the workplace. They were driven in part by the efforts of businesses, mainly in the service sector, to reap long-overdue productivity returns from a huge investment in information technology. 
 There are different roads to productivity gain. One is to take advantage of technology to obtain more and higher-quality output with better trained personnel. Another is to operate with a reduced -- in the latest euphemism, "right-sized" -- work force. In the face of shrinking demand, most companies opted for the second route, which led to a self-feeding chain: layoffs, deterioration of disposable income and consumer confidence, demand retraction, more layoffs. (According to an American Management Association report, one of four surveyed companies has had three or more downsizing rounds.)
Conventional economic measurements are misleading: unemployment statistics do not reflect the many jobless who have given up trying, nor downward migrations to lower-level or part-time jobs. Besides, in an economy increasingly dependent on information and knowledge work, we measure the utilization rate of industrial equipment, but are blind to huge capital squandered when scientists drive taxis and college graduates sell fast food.
The productivity-employment dilemma and the massive vanishing of high-wage jobs are a few of the critical issues the new Administration must address in fighting the structural recession, by far the more dangerous.

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeking $31 Billion in Stimulus

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Laying the political groundwork for economic battles to come, President Clinton has told governors and members of Congress that he wants $31 billion in new spending on jobs and on tax breaks for business this year to stimulate the economy.
Mr. Clinton also emphasized some domestic goals in a speech to the nation's governors today, asking them for help in reorganizing the welfare system. To that end, he said, he plans to name a group to study the best way to make welfare a form of temporary support with the goal of limiting payments to two years. He did not provide a schedule for putting his ideas into action.
 
Unpleasant Choices
 Addressing the National Governors' Association in his first policy speech as President and meeting privately with Congressional leaders in sessions that will continue Wednesday, Mr. Clinton embarked on a strategy to win support for the politically unpalatable choices he is likely to present in coming weeks on taxes, Social Security and the deficit. 
 Even as Mr. Clinton made his rounds today, the economy showed signs of rebounding on its own as consumer confidence strengthened. The Government's chief economic forecasting gauge, the Index of Leading Indicators, had its biggest gain in nearly 10 years in December, and statistics showed that home sales also increased markedly last year as interest rates fell.
White House officials said the positive economic news was welcome but would not deter Mr. Clinton from trying to stimulate the economy further with spending programs that could stymie his efforts to reduce the budget deficit.
 
More Jobs Needed
 George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, said the good news had not extended to jobs. "We need to have long-term job growth," he said. "We need an economy where incomes are growing."
In his meetings with lawmakers today, Mr. Clinton did not discuss how much his plans would cost. Many senators have said they will fight any proposals for an energy tax and cuts in Social Security benefits.
Instead, Mr. Clinton altered his plan of inviting lawmakers to the White House in favor of making a trip to Capitol Hill that lent symbolic heft to his pledge to work with Congress. After a week in which Mr. Clinton was forced to battle members of his own party over whether to allow homosexuals to join the military, he appealed today to his fellow Democrats for unity and for support for the economic program he will present on Feb. 17, said lawmakers who were present.
"There was a very broad consensus about dealing with reality and getting the deficit down in a real way," said Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts.
Mr. Clinton is using this week to solidify support for his domestic program among political leaders who share some of his goals: the governors, who are holding their annual meeting here. They asked the President to increase spending on construction projects to create jobs and stimulate further investment.
In recent weeks, economists and Administration officials have suggested they were considering economic stimulus packages worth $15 billion to $60 billion. Last week, after Administration officials had suggested $20 billion as a likely target, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress he approved of the Administration's plan to speed growth with short-term spending.
But as the date for submitting the package has drawn closer, officials have settled on a somewhat higher figure, divided roughly between spending and tax breaks. But they have said every day that no final decision has been made.
"We generally agreed that if there is going to be a short-term stimulus in the 10-, 20-, 30-billion-dollar range that it has to be something that can be done quickly, in 30- to 60- to 90-day period," said Gov. Ben Nelson of Nebraska.
 
Reorganize structuring Welfare
 Mr. Clinton's proposal to reorganize welfare, which would limit how long recipients would get benefits without working and provide worker training for recipients, is particularly popular among governors in both parties.
"No one likes the welfare system as it currently exists, least of all the people who are on it," Mr. Clinton told the governors. "The taxpayers, the social service employees themselves don't think much of it either. Most people who are on welfare are yearning for another alternative, aching for the chance to move from dependence to dignity. And we owe it to them to give them that chance."
During the campaign, Mr. Clinton said he would quadruple to $4 billion the amount the Government spends on job training for welfare recipients and add $2 billion in tax credits for the working poor. Mr. Stephanopoulos said today that those targets might change because projections about increases in the deficit were higher than expected.
For the past year, Mr. Clinton has stressed mutual responsibility, arguing that the Government should do more to help the poor and the poor should do more to help themselves. He said today he would appoint a panel of representatives from Cabinet departments to consult with Congress and state officials. The panel, officials said, would be charged with devising a program that cracks down on parents who do not pay child support and limit welfare payments to two years.
After that, the recipient would have to take a job or perform community service to receive Government aid. One of four people on welfare stays on the welfare rolls eight years or longer, White House officials say.
"We ought to be able to lift people who work 40 hours a week with kids in their home out of poverty," Mr. Clinton said. "And we will remove the incentive for staying in poverty. It will be much less expensive than to have government direct supplements to pay people to remain idle. And it will reinforce the work ethic."
Mr. Clinton's plan garnered support in divergent circles today.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the chairman of the Finance Committee, said he was "hugely gratified" by Mr. Clinton's promise to change welfare. The Senator was a sponsor of the Family Support Act that passed in 1988 and espoused many of the same principles as Mr. Clinton's proposal.
And Robert Rector, an analyst on welfare and family issues at the conservative Heritage Foundation, a research organization in Washington said: "He really does have a really coherent package here. What I fear is, we will get free health-care coverage for the poor, for working families and others and forget this other part about making the welfare recipients work."
 
Wooing Senators on Deficit
 At the Capitol today, Mr. Clinton encouraged senators to make suggestions on the components of his deficit-spending program, which is expected to be divided equally between new spending and tax breaks for business. Lawmakers who attended the meetings said the discussion lacked specifics on costs.
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said that no final decisions had been made about the components of the stimulus package and that higher and lower price tagshad been discussed. But Mr. Stephanopoulos said the $31 billion figure was "in the ball park."
"There was a very broad consensus about dealing with reality and getting the deficit down in a real way," said Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois.
Mr. Simon said the President asked the senators "to weigh in in the next few days" on their views of what his economic package should include.
Senator Kerry said the President "said very clearly that he was going to make cuts" in programs to offset the new taxes that are likely to be part of an economic package.
But the White House has taken pains to concentrate on the good news of increased spending, and officials are less forthcoming about the down side of Mr. Clinton's formula, the tax increases and budget cuts that are just as likely to be part of Mr. Clinton's State of the Union Message.
"The President is not eager to move forward on any proposals that will have any kind of an undue impact on people," Mr. Stephanopoulos said. "There's no question about that. But he also has said in the end his package will be fair. And he remains committed to that."

HEADLINE: Economy Shows Expansion, But Jobs and Regions Falter

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Despite lingering joblessness and areas where the recession stubbornly hangs on, most economists say the United States economy is expanding solidly and seems poised to continue growing.
Layoffs by large companies like I.B.M. and Sears are grabbing headlines and indeed, joblessness is now higher even than when the recession began. In this recovery, growth has come primarily from improved production by workers already on the payroll, rather than new hiring. But this is contributing to hefty corporate profits, more investment by business and longer hours for those employed.
Furthermore, job creation by small companies is starting to offset the very visible job cutbacks at big-name enterprises. Borrowers have now repaid some of their debts, and consumer confidence has strongly rebounded.
 
Index Soars 1.9%
 Signs of the recovery taking hold showed up strongly in a variety of statistics released in recent days. The Government's main measure for predicting the economy, the index of leading economic indicators, soared 1.9 percent in December, its third straight advance and the brightest forecast for growth in nearly 10 years, the Commerce Department reported today. 
 At the same time, the department found that sales of new one-family homes climbed 6.3 percent for the month, a gain even bigger than it appeared because of a sharp upward revision for November home sales.
 Other signs of the strengthening economy in the last week included a bullish report about manufacturing activity from corporate purchasing managers and a big jump in December in new orders for long-lasting goods.
 Analysts said that these figures were further confirmation that the economy was solidly expanding, and that only strong job gains were lacking to put an end to doubt about robust 1993 growth.
"That the United States economy is beyond the recovery stage and in the nascent phase of an expansion seems clear," said John R. Williams, an economist for the Bankers Trust Company, in the bank's current market letter. "Practically every piece of data, with the exception of some labor market news, is increasingly upbeat."
Although the economy has picked up smartly in most areas, some have remained distressed. In contrast to the early 1980's, when the two coasts boomed for years before the middle of America made its comeback, California, New York and New England are still in trouble.
California's economy was late to enter the recession, and while other parts of the country started to bounce back, its real estate market continued to erode, it lost thousands of defense jobs and suffered such a severe budget crisis it was forced to pay its employees with I.O.U.'s.
Only now is the state's economy showing some signs that it has begun to stabilize; for example, its unemployment rate, which peaked above 10 percent in November, retreated to 9.7 percent in December.
The Northeast, one of the first areas to go into recession, has recovered substantially better, though unemployment rates in big states like New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts remain at 8 percent or more, above the 7.3 percent national average. But housing prices in the Northeast had the biggest advance of any region in 1992.
 
Growth Weaker Than Normal
 Although it has picked up, national economic growth in this recovery is still far weaker than normal. For example, last year's 2.1 percent growth was less than half what economists have come to expect after a recession. Even so, the expansion now under way would ordinarily leave little reason to embark on the kind of economic stimulus President Clinton is planning. But he is undoubtedly motivated by the discouraging reports on the jobs front.
On Friday, the Labor Department is expected to report expanding payrolls for January but at less than half the typical pace of job creation.
Political pressure to improve employment is particularly intense because of the high number of white-collar employees who have lost jobs and have little prospect of returning to work soon.
Today's bullish economic reports came as the Federal Reserve Board began a two-day meeting to set strategy for the year on interest rates and the money supply. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, last week told Congress that he was confident that recovery would continue, even though growth was still running into "strong headwinds." He also indicated a willingness to continue to accommodate growth as fast or slightly faster than seen so far.
The strong leading indicators for December announced today were not expected to cause significant change in either the Fed's stance or that of the Clinton Administration because they were largely expected.
 
Public Works Programs
 President Clinton is continuing to fashion a plan for short-term economic stimulus, which by latest accounts seems likely to total $31 billion in deficit spending, including outlays for roads and bridges and incentives for business to invest in new equipment.
Despite the succession of encouraging statistics on the economy, most analysts expect at least some slackening in late winter and spring.
This reflects both the lagging job growth and a likely pause in consumer spending. Americans will be receiving smaller tax refunds for 1992 as a result of the Bush Administration's election-year effort to spur activity by reducing the tax withheld from paychecks.
Moreover, the spur from rebuilding in Florida, Louisiana and Hawaii after hurricanes is now waning.
David Orr, chief economist for the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., said, "First-half gross national product growth will drop back into the 2 to 2.5 percent range, followed by a return to the 3 percent-plus range in late 1993" as the Clinton stimulus program takes effect.
But some economists are more optimistic. Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear Stearns, is forecasting 4 percent growth this year. He also expects unemployment to decline by a full percentage point.
"At the root of a free-market economy is the company," said Mr. Kudlow, who was chief economist for the Office of Management and Budget in the early Reagan years. "If business is making money, it will expand. All American business is emphasizing productivity, productivity. Once that has run its course, job creation will follow."
Housing has been one of the strongest areas of the economy since last year, reflecting the marked decline in mortgage rates and increasing consumer confidence. Today's figures showed new homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 656,000 in December, 6.3 percent ahead of the 617,000 pace the month before.
David Seiders, economist for the National Association of Home Builders, said he was pleased with the December results, declaring activity "on a firm footing.
For 1992 as a whole, sales rose to 608,000, or 19.4 percent above the 1991 level. The median price of new homes remained virtually unchanged at $120,100.
 
Big Regional Shifts
 This, however, masked significant regional shifts as the median price rose 8.4 percent in the Northeast, to $169,000; 4.9 percent in the South, to $104,900, and 4.5 percent in the Midwest, to $115,000. In the West, the median price dropped 8 percent, to $130,000.
The 1.9 percent jump in the leading indicators' index was the biggest since April 1983, when the economy was rebounding from the severe recession of 1981-82. In the first four months that year, the index posted increases averaging just over 2 percent.
Moreover, the December jump was broadly based, with 9 of the 11 components contributing to the gain and only two holding it back.
The biggest gain was a rebound in the University of Michigan's survey of consumer expectations, which rose sharply in November and December, though it has since leveled off.
Sizable gains also resulted from a smaller number of first-time claims for jobless benefits, higher orders by manufacturers for consumer goods and materials, a rise in contracts and orders for plants and equipment, a rise in unfilled orders for durable goods, higher levels of building permits and higher stock prices.
Small increases came from a longer-than-average workweek and from more companies' reporting slower deliveries from suppliers, suggesting backlogs.
The two negative components were a decline in the M-2 money supply and lower prices for materials particularly sensitive to the business cycle. The money supply now seems to be expanding, however, and prices of materials have been held down partly by the large-scale unloading on world markets of Russian minerals.
Another Commerce Departmentindex, of indicators that tend to move in line with the economy rather than ahead of it, rose six-tenths of 1 percent in December after no change in November, the report showed. The December rise in this coincident index matched that of October, the best performance since February 1990, showing that 1992 ended on a strong note.
The index of lagging indicators, meanwhile, eased one-tenth of 1 percent, a sign to economists that bottlenecks and other inflationary pressures were being eclipsed.

Success and Failure, All From the Same Source

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:
Promise and Power The Life and Times of Robert McNamara By Deborah Shapley Illustrated. 734 pages. Little, Brown. $29.95. 
Every biographer of a public figure faces a daunting challenge because image makers often erect an official fence around their liege. Nevertheless, after all the research in the library stacks, the personal interviews and the self-serving declarations by friends and foes, an author must stop, weigh everything and then try to discover the answer to a fundamental question: What makes this person tick?
 In "Promise and Power," her biography of Robert Strange McNamara, Debra Shapley gives it a good shot, but despite her voluminous notes, sources and bibliography, her subject remains an elusive personality. At excessive length, Ms. Shapley, a Washington journalist who specializes in military, arms-control and technology issues, conveys more about Mr. McNamara's familiar times than about the V-8 engine driving his enigmatic life.
 This may not be the author's fault. As portrayed by the Ms. Shapley, her subject -- former president of the Ford Motor Company, former Secretary of Defense under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, former president of the World Bank -- appears as a Janus-faced individual on almost every controversial issue.
 There is the Detroit whiz kid able to make tough business decisions, but doing so in an impersonal if not offensive way with his underlings. There's the charts-and-pointer civilian leader valiantly placing budgetary controls on the military establishment, yet thinking that Harvard Business School management methods can win a peasant war for a corrupt ally against a dedicated enemy. There's his sincere effort to improve the conditions of the poor in underdeveloped lands, but the reality that the programs he engineers frequently fall short of his claims.
 Secretary McNamara was considered intelligent but insensitive by his contemporaries in Washington. Yet he was sometimes openly emotional when toughness was considered the proper public face for the Kennedys and their spear carriers. He carried conflict like a concealed weapon in his briefcase, but why and to what end?
 Ms. Shapley writes: "It was his nature to be wedded to large organizations while mistrusting and fighting them. He made the same inner choice many times -- at Ford, over Vietnam and at the Bank -- always at the center and alone, with secret insights and plans, maneuvering the machinery he had built, playing against his corporate self. Yet to redirect a faltering organization, a leader needs the trust of subordinates. So his past manipulations kept coming back to haunt him."
 In her own area of expertise, the author praises Mr. McNamara for his intellectual leadership in nuclear strategy, arms control and third-world development. She believes he made a major contribution in the closed meetings that resolved the Cuban missile crisis. And she says he was also able to whip the World Bank into shape, even though his subordinates there often feared him.
 Any McNamara biography must be centered on his role in the Vietnam War. Ms. Shapley's main contribution is a series of interviews she conducted with him about his loyal wartime stance in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations and his reported doubts about the success of the war. The interviews indicate that like the fellow hawks whose advice widened the war -- Dean Rusk, McGeorge Bundy, William P. Bundy, Walt W. Rostow, Henry Kissinger, all of whom are covered in the book -- Mr. McNamara still doesn't seem to get it. In light of history and the debatable domino theory about the future of Southeast Asia, the question was not how to turn Vietnam into a winnable war but whether it was a justifiable war.
 In one of the interviews, Mr. McNamara says: "If I didn't believe we had a chance of progressing on the political track as a result of our military pressure . . . I should have strongly recommended withdrawing from Vietnam, and if the Government wouldn't do it, I should have resigned. There's no question about that in my mind." He continues, "So the fighting was not in vain, even though I was pessimistic about how well we were doing in the field."
 Ms. Shapley writes that Mr. McNamara "says here for the first time publicly that he and Kennedy planned to withdraw all U.S. advisers by the end of 1965, even if the South Vietnamese 'were going to be defeated.' "
 "I know for a fact that John Kennedy would have withdrawn from Vietnam," she quotes Mr. McNamara as saying.
 She continues: "Thus he adds his name to the list of former Kennedy advisers who have made this assertion, and like them, he has offered no proof. He has not said what evidence he has: On this most sensitive issue of all, his habit of glimpse and concealment goes on."
 "Promise and Power" is a diligent, often outspoken biography. Even though Ms. Shapely was granted interviews -- and, incidentally, allowed Mr. McNamara to review the quotes directly attributed to him -- she does not pull her punches. She observes that "the same qualities that made McNamara sincerely work to help society and brought success led to failure as well." And in a harsh judgment, she says that the paradox of his legacy is that he is "a pivotal figure in the weakening and decline of America, despite the many virtues of the American Century he embodies."
 The book does include material about Mr. McNamara's personal background, his children and late wife, and his companionable relationship with a married woman. But if there's a key that unlocks the mystery of this strange public personality, it would probably have to be found in the autobiography that Mr. McNamara promises never to write.

 Health-insurance coverage varies. Many policies cover a portion of the fee -- typically 50 to 80 percent -- and many impose an annual maximum on payments for mental-health care.
 Shown are the average costs of group therapy, individual psychotherapy, and family or couples therapy; average charge per psychotherapy session state by state; who's in therapy and who isn't; and figures on what Freud's fee would be if he were alive today.

HEADLINE: CLINTON REBUFFED ON PLAN TO REDUCE ELECTION SPENDING

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
President Clinton summoned Congressional Democrats to the White House today to seek help in keeping an election-year promise to act swiftly to change campaign finance laws. But he won no agreement on the basic elements of such a package, and there were signs that the White House was backing off its own plans in the face of Congressional resistance.
Leading Democrats emerged from the one-hour session declaring that for the first time in 12 years they were in accord with a President over the general notion that the amount of money needed to run for office should be reduced and that donations by political action committees should be limited further.
 
President Carter's Mistake
 But the participants said they did not discuss specifics, and there was no agreement on issues that were at the heart of promises made by Mr. Clinton during the campaign. One pledge was to limit political action committee contributions to $1,000, instead of the current $5,000 per candidate; another was to provide free or discounted television time for candidates who agree to limit their spending, and a third was to restrict "soft money" donations that are intended to skirt Federal spending limits. 
 Neither was there an agreement on a timetable for drafting the package. Supporters of a campaign finance overhaul contend that President Jimmy Carter's campaign finance proposal did not survive because he waited too long after taking office to push it through a reluctant Congress.
But participants in today's meeting said that regardless of what came out of the discussions any changes in campaign financing would not take effect until after the 1994 mid-term elections.
 
Divisions Become Apparent
 White House officials and Congressional leaders both said that the meeting was successful and that its purpose was not to begin drafting legislation but to begin organizing on the issue. It was clear afterward, however, that many divisions remained.
The uncertainty over campaign finance came during a relatively smooth week in which Mr. Clinton had largely succeeded in turning attention to the economic and social issues he wants to stress and away from his struggles of last week over homosexuals in the military.
The President's day began with a speech to about 200 employees of the Office of Management and Budget in which he returned to his campaign promise to make the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes.
"Before I ask working Americans to work harder and pay more," Mr. Clinton said, without divulging details, "I will ask the economic elite who made more money and paid less in taxes to pay their fair share."
Prodded by Ross Perot, who helped make campaign finance a top issue during last year's Presidential race, Mr. Clinton has considered overhauling campaign finance laws as important if he is to prove that he came to Washington as an outsider and will not settle for politics as usual. But campaign finance has never been popular among lawmakers, who are afraid that tampering with campaign finance rules would hurt their chances of being re-elected.
 
Using the 'Bully Pulpit'
 That is why Mr. Clinton "will have to pull out all the stops and use the bully pulpit with the American people on this," said Senator David L. Boren, an Oklahoma Democrat.
Recalling Mr. Perot's emphasis on the issue, Mr. Boren said: "My fellow members should certainly understand that if they want to vote against campaign finance reform they do so at their own peril, because of what Bill Clinton said about it and what Ross Perot said about it. As much as anything else, the reform agenda was what this election was all about."
As he prepared to meet with Congressional leaders, Mr. Clinton told reporters today that he was committed to the campaign finance package, saying, "I want to pass a bill this year, as early as we can" and "I hope we can get a good bill."
Howard Paster, Mr. Clinton's chief Congressional liaison, insisted that the President would not back off from a tough package. "The key here is that he's moving on it," Mr. Paster said. He said the meeting today had demonstrated that Mr. Clinton had made the issue a high priority. "The nature of commitment is well established," he said.
But some White House officials said that major elements of what Mr. Clinton had proposed during the campaign were back on the table, and George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, repeatedly declined opportunities during his daily briefing today to say that the proposal would include provisions that Mr. Clinton had pledged in the campaign.
 
Differences Played Down
 Emerging from the White House this evening, the Congressional leaders sought to gloss over differences on basic issues like partial subsidies for candidates to buy television time, calling them technical questions. "We did not write the bill today or begin the writing of it," said Thomas S. Foley, the House Speaker. "We did not go item by item down the list of technical questions involved in the bill, and decide how we will approach those."
Mr. Boren, for years a leading champion of campaign finance legislation, said before the session: "I hope afterwards we have a timetable and goals. We really need some deadlines imposed on us."
But afterward, Mr. Boren and other members said there was no timetable. Asked what he meant by "early action," Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, said, "It means early -- as fast as we can."
Two things that the participants did seem to agree on involved what the bill would not include: they said it would not call for full public subsidies for candidates who agreed to limit their spending, an idea that is unpopular with many incumbents as well as with Republicans, and that whatever bill was passed would not take effect until the 1996 election.
Fred Wertheimer, the president of Common Cause, a group that for years has lobbied for tougher campaign finance laws, said in an interview this week that the issue was so important in the 1992 campaign that any finance package should take effect by the mid-term elections of 1994.
"You've got some folks on the Hill who are looking for Clinton to take them off the hook on this," Mr. Wertheimer said. "The challenge here for President Clinton is to move forward with a strong proposal and a request for immediate action."
As evidence of Congressional cooperation with the White House, George J. Mitchell, the Senate Democratic leader, said after the meeting, "What's possible is what we passed last year -- we passed a good strong bill, and that's where we begin this year."
Although few Democrats doubt that some campaign package will emerge, the question is how strong it will be. David Wilhelm, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has said, for example, that eliminating soft money in campaigns could greatly damage Democratic candidates around the country.

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeking $14 Billion Cut By the Military

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Les Aspin has directed the Pentagon to produce a spending plan for the next fiscal year that is at least $14 billion less than the budget for the current year, according to internal Pentagon documents.
Before he left office, President Bush had already proposed spending $3 billion less on the military in the next fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1. But Mr. Aspin's directive would cut the spending by nearly four times as much and make the Clinton Administration's first step toward honoring a campaign pledge to reduce military spending more. 
 About $8.3 billion of what Mr. Aspin hopes to cut is to come from the operating budgets of the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marines. That is likely to mean faster cuts in troops, less training time and fewer ships than President Bush had envisioned in his final budget.
 
Reducing Troops in Europe
 The military budget for the current year is $283 billion, in 1994 dollars, adjusted for anticipated inflation of 3.7 percent. Before he left office, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had proposed a $280 billion spending plan for the next fiscal year.
In a departure from Mr. Cheney's plan, Mr. Aspin directed that money for the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, which operates the "Star Wars" anti-missile program, be kept at the current level of $3.8 billion. Mr. Cheney had requested $6.3 billion for it.
In general, Mr. Aspin is using the Cheney plan as a basis, while seeking deeper cuts. Mr. Aspin, for example, directed the Pentagon to comply with legislation that forces in Europe be reduced to 100,000 troops by 1996 from about 185,000 now. The Bush Administration had hoped to modify that timetable.
The savings from deeper cuts would be applied to reducing the Federal deficit and perhaps be used for programs to stimulate the economy, senior Defense Department officials said.
Mr. Aspin, in memorandums to the acting service secretaries sent late Tuesday, ordered the services to submit their reductions by next Monday. The Navy and Marine Corps were told to reduce their combined budget by $3 billion, the Air Force by $2.8 billion and the Army by $2.5 billion. Each reduction is about a 4 percent cut from levels outlined by the Bush Administration.
"You should avoid numerous, piecemeal adjustments," Mr. Aspin wrote. "In proposing your changes, do not lose sight of our first duty to maintain a sound, ready and effective force."
The reductions may be offset by $2 billion to $3 billion Mr. Aspin's wants to add for new programs, including ones to help American weapons factories convert to commercial products and the former Soviet republics dismantle their nuclear arsenals.
It is too early to say whether the Congressional armed services and appropriations committees, one of which was headed by Mr. Aspin until he became Defense Secretary, will demand even deeper cuts than he is proposing.
Once the services submit their revised budget projections, the Defense Department will forward its overall budget request to the White House Office of Management and Budget by Feb. 23, senior officials said. The Administration is to submit the final budget proposal to Congress by March 23.
Anxious to dispel the perception that the fight over homosexuals in the military has paralyzed Pentagon planning on other major issues, like the budget, Defense Department officials provided copies of Mr. Aspin's letter and an accompanying three-page document, "Policy and Programming Guidance for FY93/94 Budget Amendment" in response to questions from The New York Times.
Senior Pentagon officials said amending the budget proposal for the 1994 fiscal year marked the first step in fulfilling Mr. Clinton's campaign promise to cut $60 billion more than Mr. Bush had said he would from military spending between now and 1997.
"This amended budget puts us on a line to get to that $60 billion neighborhood," said one senior Defense Department official.
The policy guidance to the services addresses the size of the armed forces, combat readiness, the Star Wars program and weapons modernization. These are some of its salient goals:
*Shrinking the number of active-duty troops to 1.4 million in 1997 from 1.8 million now in a way that minimizes instances of uniformed soldiers or sailors' being forced out of the military.
*Maintaining a robust budget for new research programs to sustain the American military's technological superiority.
*Reducing reserve forces "at a rate that is realistic in light of previous rates enacted by Congress."
The guidance also recommends allotting the Star Wars program as much as it now receives. But the Clinton Administration would give priority first to advanced anti-missile rockets like the Patriot missile, then to a ground-based anti-missile defense that would protect the country against an accidental or limited nuclear attack. Finally it suggests giving just enough money to maintain a research program on a plan to build missile-killing rockets to orbit the Earth. These priorities are ranked in largely the opposite order from that in which the Bush Administration had placed them.
Top-ranking military planners said today that Mr. Aspin's cuts fall within the range of budget options they had been developing since last year when it became clear that even if Mr. Bush was re-elected military spending would decline.
Senior Defense Department officials said that their immediate focus since Election Day had been on amending the budget for the 1994 fiscal year and that the services would receive additional guidance on budgets from 1995 to 1999 after Pentagon planners completed a policy review in the coming weeks.
But there are still several questions, underlying the framework of the budget for the 1994 fiscal year. Mr. Aspin's aides are struggling to determine whether savings projected at $71 billion over five years incorporated into Mr. Bush's budget can be achieved on schedule. Philip A. Odeen, a former Pentagon and National Security Council official, will lead independent experts over the next four to six weeks in scrutinizing the final Bush Administration budget.

Aspin Gets a Deputy
 WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 (AP) -- President Clinton today nominated William J. Perry as chief deputy to Defense Secretary Aspin. Mr. Perry, 66, served in the Carter Administration as Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, responsible for military acquisitions. He is currently an engineering professor at Stanford University, co-director of the Stanford University Center for International Security and Arms Control, and chairman of Technology Strategies and Alliances, a management consulting concern.

HEADLINE: Monetary Fund Criticizes Russia on Inflation

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
In an unusually strong criticism, the International Monetary Fund's top official faulted Russia's Government today for letting inflation get out of control, saying the risk of hyperinflation threatened Russia's fledgling democracy.
The official, Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, said hyperinflation would hurt Russia's poor the most, would jeopardize other economic reforms, and was causing a severe flight of capital that would make economic recovery more difficult. 
 "Many democracies in the world have been killed by hyperinflation," Mr. Camdessus said in an interview with Izvestia, the Russian newspaper, released here today. "Hyperinflation must be stopped at all costs."
Prices in Russia are rising by about 50 percent a month -- a dangerously high level that economists have termed hyperinflation.
Mr. Camdessus attributed the high rate of inflation to the creation of billions of rubles in new money, especially in the form of credits to prop up foundering state enterprises.
The United States and other industrial nations are looking to the monetary fund, which has 175 member nations, to assess Russia's market-oriented reforms and coordinate aid to Moscow.
While Camdessus voiced optimism that Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin had vowed to reduce inflation, he also noted that Russia had violated the promise it made last year to cut inflation to about 5 percent a month.
One of his biggest worries is capital flight, in which Russians, frightened by the plunging value of the ruble, are transferring their savings to banks in Western Europe. The ruble's value has plummeted to a record low of 572 rubles to the dollar from 163 in August.
"When savings go out, or stay out instead of entering or going back to the country," Mr. Camdessus said, "investments go down, growth goes down, and foreign investors are discouraged from putting their money in Russia."
Dangling a carrot in front Russia, Mr. Camdessus said he believed that Western nations should finance benefits to the country's unemployed and a safety net for the elderly and the poor.
"I am certain that we can get higher contributions" from the wealthy industrial nations than the $24 billion in aid promised last year, he said, "if Moscow makes an ironclad commitment to get its economic house in order.
But in a warning, he also said many nations did not think it made sense to grant aid to Moscow if it did not do what was needed to reduce inflation "so that this money stays in Russia" instead of heading to "foreign bank accounts in Zurich, Paris or London."

HEADLINE: 3 Western Nations Demand Zaire Leader Yield Power

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, Feb. 3

 BODY:
As bloodshed intensified here, the United States, France and Belgium demanded today that President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire transfer power to the transitional government led by his rival, Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi.
A note was turned over to a Mobutu aide here, and was made public in Brussels. It essentially called on Mr. Mobutu to live up to an earlier accord to give the transitional government control of the economy and management of the government. Mr. Mobutu, who has ruled Zaire for 27 years, was reported to be at his palace in the northern part of the country. 
 The note said the current economic and social disorder results from Mr. Mobutu's failure to "transfer authority to the transitional government."
"These developments have brought Zaire to the brink of political and economic collapse, and are subjecting Zairians to unbearable hardships," the note added.
Rival army factions battled each other in Kinshasa today, leaving many dead and whole neighborhoods of Zaire's capital in ruins, witnesses said.
Fighting that erupted shortly after midnight is believed to have pitted President Mobutu's elite presidential guard against mutinous troops in Camp Kokolo, a military barracks near the city's center. It was the heaviest fighting since rioting that reportedly left several hundred people dead broke out last Thursday.
The fresh fighting between rival military forces, which lasted until dawn, spread to another military camp on the outskirts of the city. Witnesses also said soldiers attacked and pillaged what was left of Kinshasa's central market, killing several civilians.
 
Hundreds Reported Dead
 There were no firm estimates of the death toll in the fighting today. Mr. Tshisekedi, Zaire's Prime Minister and Mr. Mobutu's archrival, said that at least 1,000 people had been killed in Kinshasa on Tuesday, though the Belgian Foreign Minister, Willy Claes, said in Brussels that the true figure was closer to 300.
Sketchy reports of fighting in Kisangani, Lubumbashi and other Zairian cities also circulated here.
According to The Associated Press, Mr. Claes said in Brussels that Mr. Mobutu "has the blood of more than 300 people on his hands" from the rioting.
The latest demand of the three nations most closely aligned to Mr. Mobutu in the past was seen as a further blow against him. However, he has been able to hold onto power in recent years even though he long ago lost the support of the United States, Belgium and France. Under pressure, Mr. Mobutu agreed two years ago to have administrative power turned over to a transitional government, but he never lived up to his agreement.
Under the arrangements proposed in the note, he would be able to remain in charge of foreign policy and the army, but the running of the economy would to be entrusted to the transitional government headed by Mr. Tshisekedi. Zaire, with some of the world's largest deposits of diamonds, copper and other resources, is economically ruined. Mr. Mobutu has been widely accused of squandering the treasury.
It was not known what leverage the Western powers might wield over Mr. Mobutu. French and Belgian troops have been sent to Kinshasa to help in the evacuation of foreigners. Herman J. Cohen, the United States assistant Secretary of State for African affairs, flew to Brussels tonight, it was reported in Washington, for further urgent consultations with French and Belgian officials.
The note said that the only way to halt the violence was for Mr. Mobutu to transfer authority to the transitional government.
"The transitional government should have the means to maintain order in compliance with human rights and the capability to resume the democratic process and to restore economic stability without further obstruction by the President," the note said.
Belgium, the Central African country's ruler in colonial times, announced today that it would begin withdrawing 550 soldiers from Brazzaville, capital of the neighboring Congo, who had been sent to help with the evacuation of Belgian citizens and other foreigners from Zaire. Brazzaville is across the Congo River from Kinshasa.
The imminent departure of Belgian troops has stirred a wave of panic among many ordinary Zairians who fear that the armed forces, already increasingly beyond the Government's control, will completely disintegrate.
About 3,000 Belgians, the biggest European group in the sprawling country, lived in Zaire before the current crisis. So far, about 1,100 foreigners have fled, leaving embassies operating with skeleton staffs, businesses abandoned and Zaire's huge copper and cobalt mining operations stripped of foreign experts.
 
Mobutu Away From Capital
 President Mobutu so far has not reacted publicly to his country's latest crisis, except to blame his political opponents for trying to sabotage his Government. Significantly, the President has not visited Kinshasa since last October, and is said to have spent the last week or so in his palatial retreat in Badolite, a town about 700 miles northeast of here.
But Mr. Mobutu is not the only figure who appears to have sought to distance himself from the turmoil. Mr. Tshisekedi has been virtually invisible in recent days. Aides to Mr. Tshisekedi say he is carefully studying various options and is reluctant to make any public pronouncements lest he stir emotions in an already volatile situation.

HEADLINE: Japan Cuts Key Rate By 3/4 Point

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, Feb. 4

 BODY:
After more than a week of tense behind-the-scenes prodding, the Bank of Japan announced this morning that it had cut its official discount rate to 2.5 percent from 3.25 percent in an effort to revive a badly weakened economy.
Today's three-quarters of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate, which is what the central bank charges commercial banks for short-term loans, is effective immediately. It brings the rate down to match the low set during the economic boom of the late 1980's. The rate is also a benchmark that affects other rates banks charge for loans and offer on deposits. 
 Expectations of a rate cut had been discussed in leading newspapers here for more than a week. Some Government officials had apparently leaked the news in an effort to force the central bank's hand.
On Wednesday, several senior officials said the Bank of Japan would finally announce the reduction after an extraordinary meeting of its policy-making board. So there was no surprise in the decision.
 
Tokyo Market Little Moved
 And Tokyo stocks showed little reaction today. The Nikkei index of 225 issues ended the day down 31.4 points, or 0.18 percent, at 17,190.63. Tim Hayashida of Merrrill Lynch Japan, said, "The market is going to need signs of a more fundamental economic recovery before there's a real change in sentiment."
Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan's governor, has come under criticism for his apparent reluctance to reduce the discount rate. Some in the central bank reportedly feared that such a reduction might set off a surge in stock and real estate prices.
On Wednesday, Mr. Mieno again said that "the economy remains in a severe adjustment phase," the language he has used to acknowledge the degree of the slowdown. The economy is expected to grow by less than 1.5 percent this fiscal year.
This morning the central bank said, "The Japanese economy is still faced with stagnant final demand against the background of cautious investment and consumption behavior by corporations and households."
Pressure for the reduction in the key lending rate also came from the United States and other big trading partners.
[In Washington, there was quick favorable reaction. Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen issued a statement saying: "We welcome the reduction in Japanese interest rates in light of recent economic conditions. It should help to strengthen domestic demand and, in turn, help shrink Japan's very large external surplus. And it will assist in strengthening world economic growth."]
Japan's trade surplus has soared over the last two years, exceeding $100 billion in 1992. It is expected to rise further this year, in part because the weak Japanese economy has reduced the appetite for imports.
The United States has thus been among those prodding the Government to take more aggressive steps to stimulate the economy so that Japan will import more and export less.
Pressure on Japan to act has increased with the arrival of the Clinton Administration, which is viewed as tougher on trade issues than Bush officials were. In addition, Japan will play host in July to the next meeting of leaders of the world's seven top industrial nations. Political leaders insist that the Government take strong action to halt the rise of the trade surplus to avoid criticism then.
But some economists argue that the reduction might turn out to be destructive, causing the already huge trade surplus to grow. Yukio Noguchi, an economics professor at Hitotsubashi University here, said the interest cut would have little effect on growth because there is little demand for credit. In fact, he said, the reduction might hurt consumer spending by sharply cutting sharply income from bank deposits and other interest-bearing securities.
Banks and other financial institutions should benefit, however. The rate cut will ease pressure on the large number of companies that have become overburdened with debt.
Mr. Noguchi and some other economists also said that the rate reduction might widen Japan's surplus by weakening the value of the yen.
Evidence of the Japanese recession has been growing. Consumer spending has dried up, corporations have slashed their capital spending budgets, profits are down for the third year, and banks have slowed lending. There has been virtually no growth in the money supply since September.
In the meantime, inflation is running at less than 2.5 percent and unemployment has risen slightly, to 2.4 percent in December. While that sounds remarkably low by American standards, the Japanese are accustome to full employment.
Today's move was the sixth reduction in the discount rate since 1991, when the Bank of Japan reversed a tight money policy.
The recession is in large measure a product of the policies of the central bank. When the value of the yen nearly doubled in 1986, the Bank of Japan cut interest rates to all-time lows in an effort to assure that exporters would not be strangled.
With the discount rate then at 2.5 percent, banks began a lending spree that spurred a boom in corporate spending in new plants and upgraded technology. But the loose monetary policy set off a speculative boom that sent stock and real estate prices flying and encouraging reckless lending by some financial institutions.
In May 1989, the central bank sought to bring this price spiral under control, starting to raise rates.

Times Mirror Reports Quarter and '92 Loss

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 3

 BODY:
The Times Mirror Company, which publishes The Los Angeles Times, Newsday and other newspapers and magazines, today reported a fourth-quarter loss of $61.7 million, as a result of several charges to reduce staff, restructure operations and make accounting changes.
The charges, which totaled $268.8 million for 1992, gave the company a net loss of $66.6 million for the year. 
 Weak economic conditions in the Los Angeles and New York markets made 1992 a difficult year. Advertising revenue has fallen sharply, forcing the company to cut costs. Times Mirror officials said they do not foresee an upturn this year and continue to look for ways to cut expenses.
In the newspaper group for 1992, advertising revenue was down 3.1 percent, and ad linage down 3.6 percent. National advertising was hardest hit, off 7 percent for the year.
The $61.7 million loss for the fourth quarter compares with a loss of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 1991. Revenue totaled $1.01 billion, up from $974.7 million. For the year, Times Mirror's loss of $66.6 million compares with net income of $82 million, or 64 cents a share, in 1991.
The company took a one-time charge of $65.3 million, or 51 cents a share, in the fourth quarter to pay for employee-buyout programs at The Los Angeles Times and Newsday. Times Mirror also took a $58 million charge -- 45 cents a share -- in the quarter for restructuring Matthew Bender, its legal publisher, to reflect a decline in demand.
In addition, the company took an after-tax charge of $145.5 million, or $1.13 a share, to adopt new accounting rules related to retirement health care and life insurance benefits.
Despite the losses, Times Mirror stock gained $1.50 today, closing at $33.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Clinton to Take Show to Detroit

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Bill Clinton grew so fond of campaigning on live television over the last year that he will continue the practice as President next week in a one-hour question-and-answer session broadcast from Detroit with audiences in three other cities.
Administration officials announced today that the President would travel to Detroit on Feb. 10, for a program that would be simultaneously broadcast on ABC affiliates in Detroit, Seattle, Miami, Atlanta and nationally on the C-Span cable network. 
 The "town meeting" in Detroit, Mr. Clinton's first out-of-town appearance as President, will be one week before the President delivers a major speech on economic issues before a joint session of Congress.
Mr. Clinton appeared on the Detroit station, WXYZ, in a similar format in September. He began conducting the televised roundtable sessions in New Hampshire while trying to rise above a tide of negative news coverage.
The President's aides have advised him to take his message to the people by appearing on live broadcasts rather than in news conference settings. This dovetails with the aspirations of local news programs, which are happy to pay for the broadcasts, in exchange for the prestige of such an event.
"We've been maintaining constant contact with the Clinton people," said Tom Griesdorn, the general manager of WXYZ. "We told them that if they were interested, when the President took his show on the road we would certainly like to be at the top of the list."

HEADLINE: Norwest Acquiring Citibank-Arizona

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Norwest Corporation, a highly profitable Minneapolis banking company with an appetite for growth outside its home region, said yesterday that it had agreed to buy most of Citibank-Arizona.
Although the Arizona bank has not been a good investment for its New York parent company, Citicorp, Norwest expects to do better. The Arizona economy has begun to improve, and the terms of the deal call for Citicorp to keep all the bank's questionable loans, which caused a loss of $13.4 million in the first nine months of last year. Norwest will pay $58 million for the bank's $1.9 billion of deposits and take on about $1 billion of good loans. 
 Norwest concentrates on the consumer business and is one of the most geographically diverse big banking companies. Its Norwest Mortgage subsidiary operates in 49 states and was the third-most-active mortgage lender in the country last year, while Norwest Financial, a consumer lending company, operates more than 770 offices in 46 states.
 
Lost Earlier Bid
 The deal for Citibank-Arizona, with 59 branches, mostly in Phoenix and Tucson, is not Norwest's first foray into the state. After buying three small Arizona banks a few years ago, Norwest tried last year to buy Valley National, the state's largest bank. Norwest lost that bidding contest to the Banc One Corporation of Columbus, Ohio, and will now become the fourth-largest bank in the state, trailing the BankAmerica Corporation, Banc One, and First Interstate Bancorp.
This latest deal is consistent with Norwest's strategy of diversifying geographically while concentrating on the consumer business, where the profit from each customer is small but so is the risk of significant losses. By expanding outside the Middle West into the Southwest, Norwest's fate is less closely linked to the economy of a single region.
"The diversity of Norwest is one of its most attractive features," said John D. Leonard, a banking analyst at Salomon Brothers. He predicted that Norwest would seek other acquisitions, "but always at a price that is favorable to Norwest, and limited to areas that are part of or adjoining the markets where they are already present."
Norwest stock rose $1.125 after the deal was announced yesterday to close at $46.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. Citicorp, which acquired the unit in January 1988, said the transaction, expected to be completed in the second quarter, would have little impact on its profits. Its stock rose 12.5 cents to close at $26.
 
 
Reaching Retirees
 Richard M. Kovacevich, the chief executive of Norwest, said that the Arizona purchase would reduce profits per share slightly this year but would prove very profitable in subsequent years. "We have a chance for a real home run," he added, if Midwesterners who retire to Arizona turn to Norwest because it is a familiar name. He noted that 12 percent of the population of Phoenix and Tucson comes from states where Norwest has banks.
Norwest's diversification strategy has allowed it to sidestep many problems faced by other large banks, which suffered heavy losses from bad loans in recent years and are disgruntled with low profit margins in lending to large corporations.
Last year, only about 5 percent, or less than $30 million of Norwest's record $518.4 million profit, came from serving big businesses. Shunning large but low-profit loans was one key reform at the bank in the mid-1980's, and Mr. Kovacevich said he did not look for any rapid expansion in the corporate banking business.
 
Passing of the Mantle
 Buying the Arizona bank is Mr. Kovacevich's first major venture since he assumed the chief executive's job early this year. Lloyd P. Johnson, who is 62 years old and was the primary architect of the bank's revival in the last half of the 1980's, remains chairman.
Mr. Johnson, a banker who was hired from the Security Pacific Corporation in 1986 to turn around Norwest, which was foundering from bad loans and organizational problems, is more soft spoken than his successor and seems most at home plotting strategy in the board room.
Mr. Kovacevich, who is 49 and is credited with the rapid growth of Citibank's New York branch system in the 1970's, seems to crave contact with people and projects the image of someone comfortable running a chain of department stores or lending a hand at a bank branch. He waxes enthusiastic about banks' untapped potential as retail stores for financial services and goes so far as to compare Norwest's strategy to such successful retailers as Wal-Mart and Home Depot.
 
Retailing Bent
 "I don't consider myself to be a banker," Mr. Kovacevich said, adding that banking is just one of many product lines, and one that could be greatly improved at most banks.
"I never heard of a retailer who didn't want customers coming to the store," he said. "Yet you often hear bankers complain about people who waste their time, ask too many questions and get the carpet dirty."
Although smaller than several of its Arizona competitors, Norwest may be able to earn more than its size would suggest. Its Arizona bank branches are supplemented by 15 offices of Norwest Mortgage, and 12 offices of Norwest Financial, which often makes loans at high interest rates to customers who have been rejected by banks.
 
Fringe Benefits
 Mr. Kovacevich said that in Colorado, where Norwest acquired the $6 billion-asset United Banks in 1991, business has doubled at its mortgage company and sharply increased at its consumer finance company since the acquisition.
Although many banking companies own mortgage and consumer finance companies, few can match Norwest's success in those businesses.
Norwest sold most of its mortgage business to the General Motors Corporation in 1986 to raise cash, but kept a nucleus of 45 offices. The business grew rapidly after that, with Norwest Mortgage boasting 458 offices and profits of $53.4 million last year.
Norwest Financial sprang from the 1982 acquisition of Dial Finance, and the business's profits have risen for 18 consecutive years. It earned $159 million last year, through 770 branches in 46 states and an affiliate in Canada.
While the mortgage and consumer finance businesses have been good in recent years, Norwest is looking to other areas for growth in the future.
 
Eye on Insurance
 One prospect is the insurance business. Norwest developed a network of insurance agents before the insurance industry was largely closed to banking companies. With 94 offices, selling all kinds of insurance and a speciality in farm crop insurance, Norwest is the 14th-largest insurance agency company in the country. Because only about 9 percent of the bank's customers use its insurance affiliate, company officials expect rapid growth in insurance sales, a business considered very low risk.
With profits mounting from so many areas, Norwest has the luxury of making acquisitions and planning for its long-term health, even if that means immediate profits are less than they could be. Les Biller, executive vice president, noted that Norwest Mortgage could have increased profits by $100 million last year if it had chosen to sell the servicing rights on its mortgages instead of holding onto the rights and stretching out the profits over several years.

HEADLINE: Senior C.I.A. Analyst Admits Discord Over Russia

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Reflecting the complexity of Russia's problems, one of the Central Intelligence Agency's most senior analysts today laid out the divisions within the intelligence community and among independent Western and Russian experts on how best to reform Russia and promote its nascent democracy.
George Kolt, the National Intelligence Officer for Russia and Eurasia, told a Senate panel of three broad areas of disagreement over the degree and pace of reform. His testimony illustrates how difficult it will be for the Clinton Administration to reach a consensus on a strategy for Russia as it begins its formal policy review. 
 In the campaign, Mr. Clinton stated that "no national security issue is more urgent" than promoting reform in the former Soviet Union. But since the election, he has said nothing of substance on the subject. Administration officials acknowledge that budget contraints, Mr. Clinton's determination to focus on domestic problems and the enormity of the problem in Russia and the other republics will dramatically limit what the United States will do.
Asked at a hearing of the Senate Armed Service Committee by Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat and committee chairman, to describe the areas of greatest uncertainty and disagreement about the former Soviet Union inside the intelligence community, Mr. Kolt said the disagreements were widely shared both inside and outside government.
Politically, Mr. Kolt said, there was a debate over whether President Boris N. Yeltsin "should push for a breakthrough" by holding new elections and setting up a new constitutional system or or whether it is better to stick to a "policy of compromise," of slower, more even movement. Economically, he added, some analysts believe that "shock therapy is the only way to reform" the economy, while others hold to the view that radical change is 'too distruptive," and that there has to be gradual change controlled by the state.
A third issue of disagreement, he said, relates to what is "the greatest danger" in Russian today: inflation, which leads people to hold on to money less and less, a view he said he shared, or unemployment, the view that the ingrained system of barter keeps the economy going and that there should be a willingness to run an inflationary policy to curb unemployment.
Mr. Kolt's articulation of the debate is well known, but his willingness to admit that the C.I.A. and other Government intelligence agencies have not reached a consensus on how to tackle the problem is unusual.
Perhaps what was most interesting about Mr. Kolt's remarks was that he tended toward the optimistic end of the spectrum on the current reform movement. He rattled off a litany of positive developments, including the move toward privitization, the "lively media" and the increasing importance of the Constitutional Court.
"So much has been accomplished" in a peaceful way, he said, adding that Mr. Yeltsin's leadership has been "critical" in making political and economic tradeoffs and maintaining popular support. But when questioned by Senator Dirk Kempthorne, the Idaho Republican, about whether Mr. Yeltsin was "our best hope" for a pro-Western Russian leader, Mr. Kolt offered praise but not exclusive support, saying that there were other reformers and entrepreneurs who were important.
At one point Mr. Kolt seemed to be promoting more aid for Moscow, saying that the Russians were asking the United States for $26 million to continue a privatization effort, an amount that would make "a key difference."
But he also called the problem of Russia and the other republics the biggest American security concern for decades to come, and noted the downside: the widespread crime and corruption, the absence of a concept of private property, a disunified currency system, the political infighting and the danger of hyperinflation. He said he believed there was a "possibility and a danger," but not a probability, that Russia itself would break up. If that happened, he added, it would create problems with nuclear security, could spawn wars on Russian territory and destabilize the region. It could "make Bosnia pale in comparison," he said.

HEADLINE: Sales of U.S.-Built Vehicles Hit Highest Level in 2 Years

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built vehicles surged 24.6 percent in late January to their best level in two years, the nation's auto makers said today, confirming earlier indications of a recovering national economy.
Sales of domestically built cars from Jan. 21 through 31 rose 19.1 percent from the comparable period last year, to 215,493. Sales of domestically built light trucks, a category that includes mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickups, rose 34.1 percent from a year earlier, to 140,716. There were nine selling days in the current period, compared with 10 selling days in last year's period. 
 The seasonally adjusted annual rate of domestic car sales for the period was 7.6 million, up from 5.9 million in mid-January and 6.1 million a year earlier.
For the entire month, car sales rose 4.3 percent, and truck sales were up 22.5 percent from January 1992. The monthly results include the 9 major Japanese and 10 European auto makers that sell vehicles in the United States.
Theordor R. Cunningham, executive vice president for sales of the Chrysler Corporation, said the auto maker was pleased with consumer response to its new products. He noted that January marked the company's fifth consecutive monthly increase in car sales and 16th consecutive increase in light-truck sales.
Robert L. Rewey, vice president of sales operations for the Ford Motor Company, said Ford's factories will produce 20 percent more cars in the first quarter than in the comparable period last year. Other auto makers are also increasing production, insuring high employment rates and weekly income figures for auto workers and workers in supplier companies.
"Pent-up demand is a very real factor at this time," said Yale Gieszl, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Corporation's United States sales subsidiary. Sales of Toyota cars built domestically were up 2.8 percent in late January to 11,058. For the month, however, sales of Toyota cars dropped 3.2 percent, to 19,179.
Karen Radley, owner of Karen Radley Acura in Woodbridge, Va., said: "The last recession was the first time the Washington, D.C., area auto market suffered. But we're starting to see Democrats coming to town and buying new cars."
Hunter Perry, sales manager of the Mike Perry Motor Company in Nacogdoches, Tex., said, "A lot of people are financing who used to pay cash because the lending rates are so low." Mr. Perry said his biggest seller was the Chrysler mini-van.
 
Big 3 Stocks Are Up
 Ford sold a total of 103,889 cars and trucks in the late-January period, up 27.3 percent from a year earlier.
Ford's domestic car sales rose 26.7 percent to 58,487, while its light truck sales jumped 30.5 percent to 42,422. For the month, Ford's domestic car sales rose 18.5 percent to 127,742, and truck sales rose 15.8 percent to 95,013.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Ford shares closed up 62.5 cents yesterday, to $47.75.
General Motors sold 139,742 cars and trucks in the the period, up 13.4 percent. G.M.'s domestic car sales rose 10.1 percent to 89,735, while light-truck sales rose 27 percent, to 47,333.
The sales numbers helped lift G.M. shares yesterday to $1.75, to $39.125, despite the prospects that the company will report a record loss for 1992.
For the month, G.M.'s domestic car sales fell 0.9 percent to 181,623. Its truck sales rose 18.09 percent to 110,643.
 
Chrysler Sales Up 31.6%
 Chrysler's late January vehicle sales were estimated by Ward's Automotive Reports to be up 39.8 percent. The company does not report 10-day sales. Chrysler's actual monthly sales were up 31.6 percent.
Chrysler sold 55,041 domestic cars in January, an increase of 31.9 percent from a year earlier. Chrysler's domestic truck sales for the month also were up 31.9 percent to 82,551.
Chrysler shares rose 25 cents yesterday, to close at $39.
 
 
Japanese Brands
 Honda's car sales in late January were down 7.5 percent, to 18,586, compared with 22,315 a year earlier.
Isuzu truck sales rose to 3,178, up 86 percent from 1,898.
Mazda sold 3,525 cars, up 43.4 percent from 2.731, and 277 trucks, down 5.0 percent from 324.
Mitsubishi of America sold 2,278 cars, up 37.4 percent from 1,842.
Nissan sold 8,353 cars, more than double the 4,371 it sold a year earlier; truck sales were up 24.7 percent, to 4,184, compared with 3,728.
Subaru sold 1,571 cars, a 48.1 percent increase from 1,179.

HEADLINE: Most Big Concerns Post Gains in Quarter

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Fourth-quarter reports from nearly two-thirds of the nation's 500 largest companies show a strong rebound in profits, helping to support the stock market's brisk advance.
Based on announcements so far, Wall Street economists now expect the quarter's net earnings to nearly double the total from the last quarter of 1991. The 1991 net results, however, were severely depressed by one-time charges for layoffs and cutbacks, far greater than the write-offs taken in 1992. 
 Operating earnings, a more reliable guide to continuing performance, are up about 20 percent for the fourth quarter, economists say.
They expect profits to continue climbing through 1993, as companies that have already become more efficient benefit from a strengthening economy as well.
"You're getting the best part of the earnings cycle," said Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch. "Companies have been forced to cut their costs during the recession, and now they are on a productivity rampage."
 
At the Forefront
 Technology and banking companies have been among the strongest earners, a performance typical as a recovery gets going. These groups have also been at the forefront of the stock market's rise.
Among the leaders of these industries, Intel's quarterly income more than doubled in the fourth quarter of 1991. Citicorp went from a loss of 53 cents to a gain of 53 cents a share.
Improved earnings among cyclical and financial companies continued to flow yesterday, as 3M's earnings rose 12 percent and Allied-Signal's 20 percent. Salomon Inc. earned $1.10 a share after a loss of 41 cents.
Market strategists are divided, however, over how well stock prices incorporate the further improvements they expect. Many said that yesterday's rally, with the Dow gaining 45.12 points, or 1.4 percent, to 3,373.79, was fueled by upbeat earnings reports and signs of economic strength.
 
Anticipated Income Improvement
 Mr. Steinberg said that most investors already anticipated continued earnings improvements in the 20 percent range. "Luckily, it looks like that will be forthcoming," he said. "If there's any shortfall, it's going to be problematic."
Some others say this year's earnings can propel the market substantially higher. Abby Joseph Cohen, a market strategist at Goldman, Sachs, said that based on predicted earnings and the current level of interest rates, stocks are 15 to 20 percent undervalued. With interest rates likely to remain stable, she sees the Standard & Poor's 500 producing a total return, including dividends, of 13 to 15 percent through the rest of the year.
The companies most likely to be left out of the earnings parade are those that do a lot of business overseas, especially in products vulnerable to foreign recessions, she said.
Foreign reversals account for some of I.B.M.'s record losses, and are one reason that Wall Street's outlook for Ford and General Motors is not as bright as for Chrysler, which does most of its business at home.
Using the net earnings that 326 of the S.& P. 500 have already reported, and analysts' estimates for the rest, Bloomberg Financial Services calculates that total earnings for this index will be $5.09, compared with $2.55 last year. These and other earnings totals usually do not include accounting charges for retiree benefits.
The earnings announced so far are a few percent behind analysts' estimates, which in most quarters are too optimistic.
Net earnings for the first two quarters of this year were stronger than in the final quarter, but the fourth quarter had greater one-time costs for cutbacks.

HEADLINE: Will Marriott Ever Stand Divided?

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
The Marriott Corporation's proposal in October to split the company in two has not only put at risk the squeaky clean reputation forged by three generations of close-knit Marriott family management. It has also provoked a lawsuit by bondholders that some analysts say could unravel the restructuring plan and hobble the hotelier.
"If they don't come up with a compromise position that satisfies bondholders, they would have to continue operating as one company," said Arthur Adler, a hotel consultant at Coopers & Lybrand. "That could adversely affect their ability to fund a whole range of initiatives that will make them a more profitable company -- everything from expansion to developing new computer systems." 
 While Marriott has been in talks with bondholders in recent months to make the restructuring more palatable and keep the dispute out of court, those negotiations broke down this week. Though talks may well reopen, the risk of a court fight to keep the company whole and Marriott's conviction to split it up makes this proposal among the riskiest undertakings in the $9.1 billion Bethesda, Md., company's 66 years, since J. Willard Marriott started with a root beer stand in Washington.
The object of the bondholders' criticism is a restructuring plan that would load most of the corporation's $2.9 billion debt (about $1.9 billion in bonds) onto the Host Marriott Corporation, a new company that would inherit the parent's vast real estate holdings. That includes 141 hotels that Marriott has been unable to sell in the current depressed real estate market and that cost it heavily in interest expenses. The other company, Marriott International Inc., will retain existing management contracts with some 750 hotels and motels and with 3,000 corporate and institutional cafeterias.
Marriott's 20-year bonds tumbled 30 percent after the plan was announced. Moody's Investors Service Inc. promptly downgraded its ratings on Marriott bonds, while the Standard & Poor's Corporation placed Marriott's debt on creditwatch for a possible downgrading.
And institutional bondholders, led by PPM America Inc., sued the company and three top officers, accusing them of securities fraud for selling $400 million worth of bonds last April and May without informing investors of intentions to split up the company. A separate class-action suit was filed on behalf of all Marriott bondholders.
"Marriott should have disclosed at an earlier date the fact they were contemplating the restructuring that would have the catastrophic consequences that eventually developed," said Lawrence Kill, a partner at Anderson, Kill, Olick & Oshinsky, which represents PPM, whose clients hold more than $120 million in Marriott bonds.
A Marriott spokesman, Robert T. Souers, said the split was needed "to continue our strategy of being a management company as opposed to a real estate ownership company." Marriott realized, he added, that with all that real estate on its hands, the company was being penalized by interest costs and by analysts' asking when it was going to sell the property.
If the companies were separated last year, Marriott International would have had sales of $7.4 billion and operating cash flow of $500 million, while Host Marriott would have had sales of $1.7 billion, and operating cash flow of $350 million -- much of which would have been eaten up by annual interest payments of about $225 million.
Curiously, most other hotel concerns have separated these functions. At the time of Marriott's proposal, its stock shot up from $17.125, to $21.875. It closed at $24.25 yesterday, up 37.5 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.
Under the restructuring, shareholders would receive a special dividend of one new share of stock in Marriott International for each share they own in the Marriott Corporation, which will change its name to Host Marriott. The Marriott family owns 25.8 percent of the stock.
But bondholders say the restructuring makes them bear the burden of the company's mistakes.
 
A Building Boom
 Throughout most of the 1980's, Marriott built hotel after hotel, then sold or franchised them while retaining the management contracts, which have accounted for more than half of Marriott's revenues for the last decade.
"Hospitality companies thought they were being undervalued so the whole industry shifted from being owner operators to franchises or running management companies, which are cash flow businesses," said Steven A. Carvell, associate professor of finance at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration.
Marriott pioneered that shift and became its most skillful player, with a return on equity of more than 20 percent in the 80's. But the 1986 tax revision law eliminated most real estate tax shelters, and Marriott was uncommonly slow to respond, according to some. "They were saddled by commitments and debt," Professor Carvell said. "And when you're that big sometimes you're a lumbering giant."
While analysts generally accept the Marriott rationale for splitting the company, one analyst who refused to speak for attribution suggested a possible additional motive:
"Host Marriott may have medium-term problems working themselves out of debt," he said, "so Marriott executives can say we'll pop this company into a Chapter 11 without affecting the larger company."
 
A Strong Denial
 Steven Bollenbach, Marriott's chief financial officer and the prime architect of the plan, categorically denied any such intention. "The strategic reason for this special dividend," he said, "is to separate the heavy capital business from the service business."
To make both companies economically viable, he said, Host will refinance properties and sell real estate -- although he said it might be five years before the market for hotels improves. Meantime, Marriott International will provide Host Marriott with a $600 million back-up credit line through 1997, if needed.
Beyond that, Host Marriott will be "by far" the biggest customer of Marriott International, Mr. Bollenbach said, accounting for about 20 percent of its management contract business. "You don't set up a deal where your biggest and best customer is designed to have financial trouble," he said. Moreover, Mr. Bollenbach will be president and chief executive of Host Marriott.
In their recent meetings, the bondholders were pushing Marriott to sell so-called targeted stock in each of the new companies. That is, Marriott would remain a single company responsible for all its bonds and would issue two series of stocks, one tied to the earnings and assets of Marrott's real estate holdings and the other to the hotel and services businesses.
"That way there would be one legal entity so the bonds would be the obligation of the holding company," said Ed Whiting, a vice president at Whitman Heffernan Rhein & Company, financial adviser to the PPM Group. He added that when the company first rejected that proposal, some weeks ago, "We continued to come to Marriott with new ideas and variations on the theme," but Marriott rejected them also.
 
Refining the Plan
 Nick Hill, a Marriott spokesman, said yesterday the company continues to talk to bondholders and to look at "refinements" that might make its restructuring plan more attractive.
Meanwhile, a hearing is scheduled on next Thursday in Federal District Court in Baltimore, at which the court is to rule on the bondholders' requests for documents from Marriott. Since the company agreed not to contest the requests, John Stark, the general counsel at PPM America, said lawyers for PPM will begin taking depositions soon afterwards, and PPM's suit will be ready to go to trial in April.

HEADLINE: Medical Trends Shake Prospects Of Drug Makers

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
After more than a decade of sharply rising prices for prescription drugs -- and profits to match -- fundamental changes in medical spending are clouding the prospects of pharmaceutical companies, which have long ranked among the most profitable and technologically innovative of corporations.
The outlook is battering the companies' stocks, long a favorite of investors, and many reached lows in trading yesterday before bouncing back with the market as the Dow Jones industrial average surged 45.12 points in a burst of economic optimism. [Page D1.] 
 The growing pressure on pharmaceutical prices is coming from cost-conscious large private purchasers like health maintenance organizations and mail-order suppliers that demand deep discounts. It is also coming from Congress and the Clinton Administration as they press for the Government to cap price increases for drugs for the first time.
Industry executives argue that if price controls result, research to develop new life-saving drugs could suffer for lack of financing.
The latest criticism from Washington came yesterday in a report by the Senate Committee on the Aging. It said that despite the promises of many drug companies to keep their prices from rising faster than inflation, 19 of the 31 largest manufacturers had increased prices in 1992 by more than double that rate.
Seven large drug companies, including Merck and Pfizer, had pledged to hold down price increases to no more than the general inflation rate. Senator David Pryor, the Arkansas Democrat who heads the Committee on the Aging, and Senator William S. Cohen of Maine, the panel's ranking Republican, urged the Clinton Administration to include drug price restraints in its package of health-care legislation.
The changes in drug buying, which have been gathering momentum for more than a year, have soured the longstanding enthusiasm for the drug industry among Wall Street investors. Stock prices of seven of the 12 largest American drug companies fell to 13-month lows yesterday morning before rebounding later in the day in the strong market rally.
Securities analysts said the low share prices reflected investors' diminished expectations for continued robust growth in drug profits. The 12 companies, which include longtime favorites of investors like Merck & Company, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Johnson & Johnson, have lost $87.33 billion in combined stock market value in the 13 months between Jan. 1, 1992, and Tuesday.
About one-third of the combined loss, $29.69 billion, took place this year. "It is a continuation of the awful times of 1992," said Neil B. Sweig, a pharmaceutical analyst with Capital Institutional Services, a stock brokerage firm. "We're in a sour state of events."
In the last 13 months, Merck has lost $20.36 billion in stock value, Bristol-Myers Squibb lost $15.57 billion and Johnson & Johnson $9.16 billion, according to a compilation by Mr. Sweig.
Since the beginning of 1992, while stock prices were soaring, drug stocks declined by more than 27 percent. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks increased 6.1 percent, on average, in the 13 months.
Pharmaceutical executives have long argued that drug price rises are essential to finance the development of important new drugs, which the industry contends may each cost more than $200 million to bring to market. Innovative drugs for cardiovascular and digestive tract diseases, for example, have helped millions of Americans to avert expensive surgery and related hospital costs, they say.
The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, a Washington trade group, contended that Senator Pryor, in an attack on manufacturers' pledges to contain drug price increases, had "distorted or misused" drug price reports by ignoring the lower prices paid by large health insurance plans. Rather, the Senator concentrated solely on prices at drugstores, which he said supplied most of the elderly.
The industry association said it "acknowledges the need for health-care cost containment." It told the Clinton transition team in December that a drug benefit should be part of any federally required basic health-care coverage for people under 65. The association added that it would be willing to discuss extending drug coverage to elderly Medicare beneficiaries, who are the main customers for the companies' products.
But analysts noted that the industry dismayed even many of its friends this week by objecting to a proposal by Clinton Administration officials to have the Government distribute vaccines without charge to all children. The industry spokesman said a Government program would make vaccines unprofitable and force the companies to curtail research for new ones.
Most securities analysts and stock fund managers are gloomy about the industry's prospects, at least for the next year or so. "Everybody's panicking out," said Barbara Ryan, an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons. "The companies are on the chopping block in Washington. Everyone's fearful of what Washington will do."
Richard Vietor at Merrill Lynch Research said many drug companies were having difficulty adjusting to changes in buying practices. He noted that managed care organizations, which authorize health purchases of patients for large groups, had severely restricted the companies' ability to raise prices at will.
"The companies are like battleships that have entered stormy waters," he said. "They are finding it difficult to change course because the products they were depending on were conceived under rules of pricing flexibility that are no longer appropriate."

HEADLINE: Billing System For Hospitals Is Overturned

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
A ruling by a Federal judge in Manhattan yesterday threatens to destroy New York State's delicate system of subsidizing hospital care for some patients.
The judge said the state was violating Federal law by adding an extra charge to hospital bills paid by some insurers and health maintenance organizations. That arrangement has benefited hospitals and nonprofit insurers like the Blue Cross-Blue Shield plans. 
 Hospitals throughout the state have received $160 million a year as a result of the system. And the embattled Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield has benefited by paying hospital bills that are 24 percent lower than those paid by profit-making insurance companies.
Empire, whose financial woes have provoked an investigation by a United States Senate subcommittee, recently imposed rate increases of up to 20 percent on 1.4 million subscribers.
 
Threat to System
 Health-care experts say that yesterday's ruling could put New York on the same path as New Jersey, which lost a similar lawsuit last year and hastily had to patch together a new way of paying for indigent care and setting hospital rates. With New York's hospitals already pleading financial hardship, and some two million citizens with no health insurance, the result could be disastrous for New York as well, experts say.
"This is beginning to pull apart the foundation on which New York's hospital financing system is built," said Robert Jaffe, a lobbyist who represents New Yorkers for Accessible Health Care Coverage. "This is eventually going to unravel the system."
In his decision, which the state plans to appeal, Judge Louis J. Freeh of Federal District Court in Manhattan found that the hospitals' practice of tacking surcharges onto the hospital bills of commercial health insurers and health maintenance organizations violated the Federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known commonly as Erisa. Under the law, employee contributions to benefit funds can be used only for the "sole and exclusive benefit" of the workers and their families.
Judge Freeh found that the surcharges -- 24 percent for commercial insurance companies, and 9 percent for H.M.O.'s -- unfairly increased insurance costs for the benefit funds and used the employees' money for purposes that had never been intended. "In fact, it diverts a not-insignificant amount of these resources to a state-specified use which is unrelated to the health care of plan participants," Judge Freeh wrote.
The ruling does not in itself pull down the state's hospital financing system, but it begins to chip away at it. In a similar case pending in Federal Court in Brooklyn, a group of unions have challenged a different state surcharge using the same Erisa argument. In that case, the 5.5 percent is tacked on most hospital bills and raises $1.1 billion a year that is used to subsidize health care for people without insurance.
In the New Jersey case, the state's method of subsidizing indigent care through hospital surcharges was also declared illegal on the ground that it violated Erisa. As a result, New Jersey had to change drastically its hospital financing system by deregulating hospital rates, charging new health-care taxes, and raiding its own unemployment insurance fund to pay for indigent care.
In New York, the state is now trying to renegotiate the rates that hospitals can charge patients, and if it loses the Brooklyn case it may lose the ability to regulate hospital rates at all.
"It could very well mean reverting back to a system in which hospitals set their own prices," said Jeannie H. Cross, a spokeswoman for the Hospital Association of New York.
 
Law Faulted
 State officials responded to the ruling by criticizing the Erisa law.
"To the extent that Erisa limits the state's flexibility to devise ways to pay for care and subsidize the uninsured, it's a real problem for us," said Peter Slocum, a spokesman for the State Health Department. "This demonstrates the need for major reform at the national level."
Yesterday's ruling, if upheld, will have an immediate impact on the state's hospitals, which will lose the $160 million they take in every year on a 13 percent surcharge tacked on to the hospital bills paid by commercial insurance companies.
The state stands to lose, too, by missing out on expected revenues from two surcharges it imposed in order to close this year's budget gap. These are a 9 percent surcharge on H.M.O.'s, and an additional 11 percent surcharge on commercial insurers, bringing the total extra cost for commercial companies to 24 percent. All told, the state hoped to get $90 million from the surcharges.
The ruling also has immediate and potentially unfortunate implications for Empire Blue Cross and Shield, the state's largest insurer. Empire and the state's other Blue Cross plans do not pay the hospital-bill surcharges, and in fact are meant to benefit from them. If they are no longer able to pay charges that are 24 percent lower than those of the commercial insurers, the Blue Cross plans might well lose more customers to their competitors, officials said.
Commercial insurers praised the ruling yesterday. "Consumers for too long have had to subsidize Blue Cross," said Chris Petersen, senior counsel for the Health Insurance Association of America, one of the parties that sued the state. "No one business should be afforded a state-subsidized advantage over another business."
State officials said they worry about what would happen if New York loses the Brooklyn case as well.
"We have a very delicately balanced reimbursement system in this state," said Michael J. Dowling, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's director of health, education and human services. "We don't have an alternative other than what we're doing right now, which is appealing the case."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Broad Surge for the Dollar On Europe's Market Turmoil

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar surged ahead again yesterday, gaining against all major currencies but the Japanese yen amid continued turmoil in European markets.
Gold prices fell worldwide. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $329.30 an ounce, off $1.10 from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank said gold lost $1.05 an ounce, to a late bid price of $328.50. 
 Dealings were active in Europe, where the Danish krone fell to its lowest allowable level in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. That prompted intervention by several central banks, including Germany's Bundesbank, to prop up the sagging currency.
Pressure on the European currencies has intensified since the weekend devaluation of the Irish pound. The nervousness increased ahead of today's scheduled meeting of the Bundesbank's policy-making council. Despite heavy speculation that they would cut interest rates, the finance ministers are not expected to take any dramatic action.
"The possibility of a Bundesbank easing just intensified the pressure on the European currencies," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the advisory firm IDEA. High interest rates generally bolster a currency.
 
U.S. Data Help Dollar
 Aiding the dollar, more good news about the United States economy came from the nation's auto makers, which reported surprisingly strong sales for January.
One of the dollar's biggest gains came against the German mark when the dollar briefly surged past the 1.65-mark level, its highest exchange rate since last April. The dollar ended the day in New York at 1.6450 marks, up from 1.5405 marks on Tuesday.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.33 yen, down 0.65 yen from Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar fell to 124.30 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 124.38 yen, down from 124.69 yen on Tuesday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.4350, from $1.4465 late Tuesday. The pound also hit a historic low of 2.3610 against the German mark amid reports of possible cuts in British interest rates. In New York, it cost $1.4340 to buy one pound, less expensive than Tuesday's $1.4440.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.5255 Swiss francs, up from 1.5210; 5.5750 French francs, up from 5.5495; 1,537.50 Italian lire, up from 1,522.00, and 1.2667 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2645.

HEADLINE: L.I. Protests U.S. Data-Gathering Change

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Feb. 3

 BODY:
The Nassau and Suffolk County Executives and the president of Long Island's largest business and civic group today urged the Federal Government to rescind a decision that would eliminate the Island as a separate statistical area in gathering Federal data.
At a news conference this morning, officials said the change could cost Nassau County $17 million in Federal money and would have a similar impact on Suffolk County, where figures were not yet available. They also added that the change could deter the Island's efforts to attract private businesses. 
 The dispute is a result of a decision in December by the Federal Office of Management and Budget to put Long Island, northern New Jersey and one county in Pennsylvania with New York City in the same "primary metropolitan statistical area." Officials said the new district could affect Federal aid because it would alter statistics like the median income and labor costs used in allocating Federal funds.
The Nassau County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, said Nassau's largest potential loss would be $6 million in Community Development Block Grants. James L. LaRocca, president of the Long Island Association, the civic group that has spearheaded the campaign against the new district, said the issue is critical to the Island's economic growth.

Mobil Promotes One of 3 in Race for Chief

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
The Mobil Corporation said yesterday that it had named Lucio A. Noto president and chief operating officer. Analysts said the promotion was a signal that he was ahead in the race to succeed Allen E. Murray as chairman and chief executive next year, when Mr. Murray reaches the mandatory retirement age of 65.
Mr. Noto, 54, becomes the third New Yorker in a row to be president of the oil giant, which moved its headquarters from 42d Street in Manhattan to Fairfax, Va., three years ago. Mr. Murray, born in Queens, followed the Brooklyn-born William P. Tavoulareas in the job. 
 Mr. Noto, Mr. Murray and Mr. Tavoulareas, said Bernard J. Picchi, an oil analyst at Kidder, Peabody, "are gritty, hard-edged characters who didn't go to Oxford or Harvard; tough, street-smart kids with very independent personalities."
 
Two Others in Contention
 Also in the race to succeed Mr. Murray are Paul J. Hoenmans, 60, and Eugene A. Renna, 48. Mr. Hoenmans is executive vice president for exploration and production; Mr. Renna heads the refining and chemicals operations. They and Mr. Noto are directors and members of the board's executive committee.
Mr. Noto has been chief financial officer since 1989, but his 30-year career has covered many positions, with an emphasis on international experience, which has become increasingly important to global oil companies, especially Mobil.
Mr. Murray has been president and chief operating officer since succeeding Mr. Tavoulareas in 1984 and chairman and chief executive since 1986, when he replaced Rawleigh Warner Jr.
 
'In Much Better Shape'
 Mobil has reduced debt, slashed costs and expanded profitably in the Far East in the Murray era. "The company is in much better shape," said George F. Friesen, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Capital Group.
Mr. Noto headed Mobil's refining and petrochemical business in Saudi Arabia in the 1980's. In 1986 he became vice president for planning and economics at Mobil's former headquarters in New York.
Earlier in his career he was a marketing and planning executive in Italy and Japan. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Notre Dame in 1959, and from Cornell University with an M.B.A. degree in 1962. He attended Regis High School in Manhattan.
Mobil's shares gained 37.5 cents yesterday, closing at $64.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Lumber Rally Continues In Face of Tight Supplies

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A record-breaking rally in lumber continued yesterday as futures prices leaped the permitted daily limit for the eighth straight day on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Spruce 2-by-4's for March delivery rose $5, to $318.50 for 1,000 board feet. Lumber sold on the cash market for as much as $364 for 1,000 board feet as wholesalers continued to pay for tight supplies, said Curt Cunningham, president of Pacific Futures Trading Company in Seattle. He said that mills in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia were taking only enough orders each day to cover one day's production and that customers were waiting four weeks to have orders filled. 
 Lumber prices have climbed steadily since early November as signs of economic recovery have sent dealers scrambling for supplies reduced by logging bans in the Northwest.
Federal timber sales in the Northwest and California plunged 57 percent in the 1992 fiscal year, mainly as a result of a court-ordered halt to logging while timber interests and environmentalists fought over preserving ancient forests and the northern spotted owl. Those disputes are still unresolved.
 
State-Owned Timber Removed
 On Monday, the Washington State Board of Natural Resources announced it would remove 140 million board feet of state-owned timber from this year's sales list, further reducing the lumber supply.
"A major amount of timber has been removed from the public domain for cutting," said Ted Bloch, president of the Bloch Lumber Company, a Chicago wholesaler. "People have been talking about this now for four or five years and it was almost like the boy who cried wolf. But this year it's caught up and the wolf is in the sheep fold."
On other commodity markets, grains and soybeans were mostly higher, while livestock and meat futures were mixed. And oil prices finished little changed in quiet dealing on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Light sweet crude for March delivery fell 7 cents, to $19.93 a barrel; March heating oil rose 0.12 cent, to 55.98 cents a gallon; March unleaded gasoline fell 0.06 cent, to 55.85 cents a gallon, and March natural gas rose 1.4 cents, to $1.583 for 1,000 cubic feet.

MINNESOTA MINING & MANUFACTURING (N)

 BODY:
The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company said yesterday that its strong fourth quarter was led by American sales that were the best in four years. The St. Paul-based diversified manufacturer said earnings rose 11.5 percent in the period, while sales rose 4.7 percent. It said weakness in Japan and Europe offset the strong sales in the United States and Latin America.
"In view of the slow economy in the U.S. and internationally last year, the company has done a good job, particularly since a lot of their products are in cyclical businesses," said Frank Rolfes, an analyst at Dain Bosworth in Minneapolis. 
 The company's memory technology group, which makes video and computer tapes, posted the weakest results, Mr. Rolfes said, noting that the unit "is struggling with price competition" with the Japanese and other producers in the United States.
The company said its life sciences sector, which makes health and safety products ranging from bandages to traffic control devices, had continued to do well. The company would not break out results for its units.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Will Clinton halt or foster a drift toward trade protectionism?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
JUST where does Bill Clinton stand on free trade? If the President knows, he is not telling.
Mr. Clinton's refusal to be pinned down during the campaign was probably smart politics, allowing the self-styled New Democrat to hang onto union votes even as he was wooing Kmart shoppers who cared more about the price of blue jeans than their national origin. But smart campaigns do not necessarily make for smart government. 
 The interest coalition supporting open trade has never been overwhelmingly strong, and for a host of reasons the opposition is growing more formidable. Without a President deeply committed to liberal trade, there is scant hope of stopping the drift toward protectionism in everything from steel plate to memory chips to cellular phones.
The conventional wisdom is that enlightened governments in general -- and postwar Washington in particular -- have championed open trade because they understood it meant better, cheaper products for all. But Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology believes this standard story, in which the consumer is king, has got it all wrong.
In trade, he argues, governments represent parties with the most focused interests: domestic producers maximizing their markets. Trade has become freer because producers in each country get the point that they can export more only if they permit more imports -- and that the profits and jobs pie will be larger if they make concessions in order to gain concessions.
But increased trade inevitably creates losers as well as winners. And the political game of organizing exporters into an effective coalition requires motivation and skill.
This White House may prove to have the skill; while Mr. Clinton's foreign trade team is inexperienced, it does include some tough, determined negotiators. However the Administration's motivation to champion exporters at the expense of import-competing firms is in serious doubt.
For one thing, notes Robert Hormats of Goldman Sachs International, President Clinton will be asking businesses to pay more for health care, environmental cleanup and deficit reduction. In return, industry -- particularly older industries like autos and integrated steelmakers that are among the most vulnerable to both foreign competition and high-cost government mandates -- will undoubtedly demand protection on the trade front.
Mr. Hormats points out, moreover, that such special pleading will be particularly hard to resist because the big industrial economies are out of synch on economic growth. With America emerging from recession and both Europe and Japan heading in, America's trade deficit is almost certain to rise -- and with it, Congressional calls for protectionism. Consider, too, higher unemployment abroad, which will fuel protectionist sentiments, particularly in Europe.
Wait, it gets worse. Years of sluggish growth worldwide have left virtually every heavy industry with excess capacity. And James Bovard, the author of "The Fair Trade Fraud" (St. Martin's Press), notes that the way trade laws are written in both America and Europe makes it illegal for foreigners to sell goods at prices dictated by free market competition.
In cyclical industries with high overhead like steel or autos, it pays to keep pushing out the product as long as variable costs -- labor, raw materials -- are covered. The idea, or at least the hope, is to keep production moving, covering losses in hard times with fat margins at the boom end of the cycle.
But "anti-dumping" statutes require that prices charged by foreigners represent at least "fair value," defined as fully allocated costs plus a healthy profit. Thus price-cutting, which is both normal and, from economists' perspective, desirable for domestic producers, is against the law for foreign competitors. And in recent years, Mr. Bovard argues, Commerce Department bureaucrats have been enforcing the statute with a vengeance.
In the dumping decision announced last week, steel from 19 countries was judged to be selling at an average of 27 percent below cost. But look closely, Mr. Bovard says, and it is plain that the judgment was arbitrary: Where foreign producers could not or would not provide truckloads of cost data on demand, the Commerce Department typically took the domestic industry's own estimates as the "best information available." In the case of MEI, the hapless Romanian steel exporter, data that arrived by mail from Bucharest a week past deadline were ignored.
C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, likens trade liberalization to a bicycle that "will topple, absent continued forward motion." For Mr. Bergsten that means, at very least, a bold effort to generate a "mini-package" of reforms at the Uruguay Round trade talks before all momentum is lost in the spring. The toughest issues could be left for a "Clinton Round," with the explicit threat that America would pursue separate regional negotiations with Pacific Rim countries if Europe balked at speedy settlement.
All this assumes, of course, that Mr. Clinton cares enough about open trade to invest political capital in its pursuit. He may not have much time to make up his mind.

HEADLINE: Ballet Theater Reduces Work Time

 BODY:
The dancers and management of American Ballet Theater reached an agreement yesterday to reduce the performers' guaranteed work weeks from 36 to 26 this year. The dancers have also agreed to extend their current contract, which runs through Oct. 31, for another year without wage increases.
The unusual agreement, part of a larger stabilization plan, is expected to save Ballet Theater $2 million in the next two years. Management and the dancers have also agreed to negotiate the number of guaranteed work weeks if similar reductions appear necessary for the 1994 season. 
 The dancers will continue to receive supplemental unemployment benefits provided by the company, under the terms of their contract, during the weeks they are not working. In a statement yesterday afternoon, the negotiating committee representing the company's 70 dancers said: "The dancers of American Ballet Theater are committed to working with the new directors of the company, and by maintaining an ongoing dialogue with them, will work together to preserve one of America's national treasures."
Gary Dunning, executive director of Ballet Theater, said: "This agreement is indicative of a tremendous spirit of cooperation, innovation and sacrifice that has pervaded the company over the past several months. I am deeply grateful to the dancers, their negotiating committee and A.G.M.A. for recognizing the needs of the company and assuming crucial leadership positions." A.G.M.A. is the American Guild of Musical Artists, the dancers' union.

SHAWMUT LIKELY TO RESTORE DIVIDEND IN 1993

BYLINE: Reuters

 BODY:
The Shawmut National Corporation said yesterday that it would probably restore its common dividend in the middle of this year. The Boston-based bank holding company omitted its quarterly dividend of 25 cents a share in October 1990 and 1991 when its results were hurt by the New England recession and souring real estate loans. It has 311 branches in New England states. A Shawmut spokesman said the bank agreed with analysts' 1993 earnings estimates of between $1.40 and $1.55 a share, compared with 81 cents a share in 1992. Shawmut shares were up 50 cents, to $20.875, on the New York Stock Exchange, after hitting a new 52-week high of $21.25.

HEADLINE: Head Off A Trade War

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk; Leonard Silk is a former economics columnist of The New York Times.

 BODY:
Fears are spreading that the Clinton Administration is moving toward a trade policy so aggressive as to unleash protectionism and a trade war among the major industrial countries. During the campaign, Mr. Clinton was ambiguous about what trade policy he would pursue. On one side, he proclaimed support for an open world economy based on free-trade principles; on the other, he courted business and labor by promising a highly aggressive campaign against foreign countries and companies accused of wiping out American jobs.
Mr. Clinton and his aides now seem to have come down on the aggressive side. The Administration has threatened to block sales to the Government of European telecommunications and power-generation equipment and a wide array of services, charging that the European Community has run a buy-Europe policy against American products. His Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, declared that the U.S. might withdraw from the government-procurement code of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
 Has Mr. Clinton crossed the Rubicon -- or is this just a get-tough threat to get the Europeans and Japanese back to serious bargaining on measures to open markets? Some economists who advised him during the campaign say they are not sure if he is bluffing. But Mr. Clinton's advisers, including those in the Administration, are split into two camps: one urging essentially free trade, the other managed trade, aimed at opening markets abroad with threats of retaliation if foreign governments will not yield. The core of managed trade would be commitments by nations to accept certain proportions of imports in their domestic markets.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, new chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, contends that managed trade, not free trade, is the only viable alternative in the real world to protectionism.
But while Mr. Clinton stays remarkably silent on the trade issue, many American industries are seizing what they see as an opportunity to push on an open door for Federal protection or trade relief. Pressures are rising from producers of steel, autos, oil, semiconductors, weapons, movies, textiles and apparel.
Mr. Clinton is running out of time to make up his mind. Producers' demands will drive him to protectionism, which will spread as foreign countries retaliate, as they have already started to do. If he intends to hold to his general endorsement of an open world trade policy, he must act now to block protectionist demands.
How can he do so? By declaring that he will press to bring the Uruguay Round talks of GATT to a successful end, and then moving to strengthen GATT as an instrument for freer trade and investment for all nations.
Protectionism feeds on world recession, sluggish growth and unemployment. Mr. Clinton must go for growth, abroad as well as at home. This means acting immediately to gain the cooperation, not the hostility that will stem from a beggar-my-neighbor trade policy, of U.S. trading partners, including Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada and Mexico.
Expansion by the industrial countries is crucial to nourish growth in the rest of the world -- and provide markets and resources to prevent the economic and political disasters threatening the third world and ex-Soviet empire. Flirting with protectionism is flirting with a world catastrophe.
The U.S. should take the lead in building a more open global economic system. The next and more difficult stage will require that other nations address the internal regulations, monopolistic practices and structural differences that are now the principal impediments to the expansion of trade and investment.
But if others, Japan and Germany most of all, do not lend greater support to a U.S. effort to strengthen the world trading system, protectionist pressures will intensify and the only alternative may be a highly inefficient form of managed trade, in which national power rather than economic choice will determine, and distort, trade -- to the harm of consumers and producers everywhere.

HEADLINE: Amtrak Gains Accord for Wide Use of Fast Trains

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Clearing an important obstacle to the development of high-speed rail travel outside the Northeast, the nation's freight railroads agreed today to let Amtrak use fast European trains on their tracks.
Under the agreement, Amtrak plans to guarantee that the freight lines will be indemnified against liability for accidents involving its trains, said W. Graham Claytor Jr., president of Amtrak, the national passenger railroad corporation. 
 The freight lines had cited safety concerns and legal liability in their refusal to allow high-speed trains on their tracks. The freight carriers own almost all of the track outside the Boston-Washington corridor.
Amtrak is now testing a Swedish-built train, the X-2000, with a top speed of 155 miles an hour, between New York and Washington. It plans to begin regular high-speed train service on its own tracks between Washington and Boston in 1997.
With today's agreement, Amtrak said it would now consider high-speed service between New York and Buffalo; Miami, Orlando and Tampa, Fla.; Washington, Richmond and Charlotte, N.C.; ; Chicago and Detroit; Milwaukee and St. Louis; San Diego, San Francisco and Sacramento, Calif., and Eugene, Ore., Seattle and Vancouver.
"We're talking about corridors, mostly under 300 miles," Mr. Claytor said. "Eventually the corridors can be joined."
Amtrak would ask Congress and state transportation officials to provide money for improving signal systems and tracks and the elimination of grade crossings, he said.
Mr. Claytor said that the mechanism for indemnification of the freight carriers against damages was unsettled and that such a move could require Congressional action.
Edwin L. Harper, president of the Association of American Railroads, whose members haul more than 90 percent of the nation's freight, made it clear that indemnification was the price of the agreement.
"We believe that if privately owned rail freight rights-of-way are to be used by new passenger operations, then the private owners should be indemnified and insured against any and all financial liability arising from accidents affecting passenger services," Mr. Harper said at a joint news conference with Mr. Claytor.
While the indemnification agreement eliminates an important practical obstacle, it is still not clear whether there would be enough passenger demand for high-speed train service to make it economically feasible.
Amtrak breaks even on the Washington-New York route, where it serves more than 40 percent of those traveling between the two cities. The benefits are considered social rather than economic: relieving traffic congestion, highway accidents and air pollution.
Mr. Harper noted that European countries subsidize their passenger rail services and added, "In fact, there are no profitable rail passenger systems in the world."
As part of its plans for the New York-Boston run, Amtrak plans to electrify the rail line between New Haven and Boston. It expects to reduce traveling time on the 231-mile Washington-New York trip to a little over two hours from just under three hours, and the New York-to-Boston time to under three hours from the current four hours.
In addition to the X-2000, Mr. Claytor said Amtrak this summer planned to test the German Inter City Express, with a top speed of 185 miles an hour, on its Northeastern tracks. One or both trains will be selected for the Northeast corridor, Mr. Claytor said, and can now be considered for other routes, too.
The trains will be built in the United States, he said. ABB, the Swedish conglomerate that manufactures the X-2000, has a train operation in Elmira, N.Y., and Siemens, which makes the German train, has many factories in the United States but none that make trains.

HEADLINE: CONGRESS PASSES MEASURE PROVIDING EMERGENCY LEAVES

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Congress gave President Clinton his first legislative victory tonight, passing the family-leave bill to guarantee workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for medical emergencies.
The Senate passed the bill 71 to 27, and the House followed on a 247 to 152 vote, just minutes before midnight. 
 Mr. Clinton plans to sign the bill on Friday morning to make the political point that domestic legislation, stalemated during the Bush Administration, would now pour forth because Democrats control both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
The House, which passed a similar bill late Wednesday night, had to take a second vote because the Senate version included a statement about homosexuals in the military.
 
Parts of Compromise
 That statement is a bland declaration backing two elements of the compromise between Mr. Clinton and Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee, on the President's proposal to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military.
It endorses Mr. Clinton's order to the Defense Department last week to study the issue and its implications, and it directs the Senate panel to hold hearings on the issue, which Senator Nunn had already announced he would do. But it lets stand the President's decision to stop asking prospective recruits whether they are homosexuals.
 
Vetoed Twice by Bush
 The family-leave bill was vetoed twice by President George Bush, who said it would impose unnecessary costs on businesses. It would require employers to give workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to deal with birth, adoption or a serious illness affecting themselves or members of their immediate families. Employers would have to maintain health insurance coverage.
In Dade County, Fla., the first municipality in the country to pass a measure that most closely resembles the Federal bill, many of the 2,500 businesses covered by the law say it is less expensive than anticipated and actually increases worker satisfaction and productivity. [Page A14.]
The Federal bill, which would cover employees of companies with 50 or more workers as well as Federal, state and local government employees, embraces about half of the nation's work force. It would take effect six months after it is signed by the President.
Vice President Gore, who presided over the Senate as the bill was passed, said of the vote, "The Congress has shown courage and foresight," adding: "We are seeing in just two weeks what a difference Bill Clinton makes. American families will no longer have to choose between their families and their jobs."
In another Democratic effort to show the party could enact bills Mr. Bush had thwarted, the House passed a measure directing the states to make it easier to register to vote by offering registration in many public buildings, including motor vehicle and welfare offices. .
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Democrat from Connecticut who has been the chief sponsor of the family-leave bill since 1985, said: "This has been a long time coming. I'm very gratified we have a President who will sign it. Hopefully, we'll now move on to more issues involving people: jobs, the economy, health care and families."
Some critics of the family-leave bill have insisted it would hurt small business. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said: "We have no idea how much it will cost business. We are talking about tens of thousands of jobs being lost or not created because of this bill."
On a local level, he said, 71 companies in Kansas have exactly 50 employees. He predicted that many would dismiss a single employee to avoid the requirement.
 
Subject of Debate
 But little of today's debate actually concerned the leave bill. Because it was the first legislative business of the year in the Senate, a bill the Administration badly wanted, and was the first to come up after last week's disputes about homosexuals in the armed forces, Republicans made it a target for their unhappiness with Mr. Clinton's intention to end the ban.
The statement on homosexuals in the military was adopted as a substitute for a Republican proposal to prohibit any changes in the military's ban. The proposed Republican amendment, killed on a 62-to-37 vote, to the family-leave bill would have required the military to continue questioning recruits on sexual orientation.
"It is clear that President Clinton has already made up his mind," Mr. Dole said. "And he has already acted without Congressional approval. I am convinced that he will continue down this road, regardless of the evidence, regardless of outcome of hearings, and against the advice of our military leaders."
And he insisted that any vote against his amendment "is a vote to put homosexuals in our military."
Senator Dan Coats of Indiana, who led the Republican attack, contended that admitting homosexuals would severely damage the morale of the armed forces. He said sex was a "tension-creating, conflict-creating element that destroys morale." The problem could be overcome, he said, by separating men and women in the services. But no such separation was possible between heterosexual and and homosexual soldiers, he said.
 
Effect on Morale
 Senator Bob Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, said Mr. Clinton had chosen a "course which jeopardizes the readiness and morale of the Armed Forces."
The argument that defeated the Dole proposal was pushed by Senators Nunn and George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader. They contended that Mr. Clinton's agreement to defer most changes in policy until July would give the Senate and the armed forces the time to study the issue carefully.
But just as the Senate heard from outright opponents of admitting homosexuals, it heard from advocates.
Two Marine veterans, Senators John Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, and Charles S. Robb, Democrat of Virginia, argued for including homosexuals. Senator Chafee said it was absurd to think that homosexuals would flood into the armed services, but he added that the military should adapt "or get out."
 
Question of Civil Rights
 Senator Carol Moseley Braun, an Illinois Democrat, said: "The simple truth is this debate is not about military capability at all. It is about irrational fears and prejudices. It is about civil rights and leadership in a Democratic society."
Saying the issue was similar to the exclusion of blacks from the Navy in World War II, she quoted a 1942 Navy memorandum that said: "Men on board ship live in particularly close association. In their messes one man sits beside another; their hammocks or bunks are close together.
"How many white men would choose, of their own accord, that their close associates in sleeping quarters, at mess and in a gun's crew should be of another race?"

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeking Negotiated Path To Bosnia Pact

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has set aside for now the use of military force to resolve the Balkan crisis and is preparing instead a diplomatic effort to modify the peace plan for Bosnia to make it acceptable to the Muslims, Administration officials said today.
The officials declined to specify what changes they would seek in the partition of Bosnian territory envisioned by the current plan, fashioned in recent months by former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen, a former British Foreign Secretary, under the authority of the United Nations and the European Community. Washington has refused to endorse the plan because it sees it as unfair to the Bosnian Muslims. 
 Mr. Clinton spoke during the recent presidential campaign about possibly using military force, including bombing Serbian targets if necessary, to relieve Bosnia, suggesting that President Bush had been timid in his approach on the Balkan war.
But for now his Administration appears to have rejected such options as it has confronted the complexities of the Bosnian situation and the actual prospect of ordering military intervention, and as the parties themselves have stepped up discussions of a peaceful settlement in recent weeks.
The officials said that the Clinton Administration does not have a map of its own that it would like to see put into effect in Bosnia, but will support any outcome that all the parties can live with. That, however, effectively dictates an American diplomatic initiative that pressures the Serbs to give more territory to the Muslims than now provided in the plan, while making sure that the appetite of the Muslims does not grow out of proportion, the officials indicated.
This diplomatic initiative by the Administration will likely be combined with a stepped-up humanitarian relief program for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the officials said. But the President's advisers still have not decided how big the increase in aid would be, or how they would get it into Sarajevo and other besieged towns.
While the Administration officials insist they are not ruling out the use of force, they acknowledge that for various domestic and international reasons it is not really an option at this time.
 
Meeting at White House
 The President's top national security advisers crystallized the plan at a three-and-a-half hour session in the White House on Wednesday and presented what they called their combined humanitarian-diplomatic initiative to Mr. Clinton. The President has yet to give his formal approval to the effort, although it seemed likely that he would do so, the officials said.
The meeting of Mr. Clinton's advisers was called as pressure mounted on the Administration to produce its own policy on the Bosnian crisis.
Administration officials acknowledged that they hade no "silver bullet," as one official put it, to resolve the Bosnian crisis. The emerging Clinton approach, which is expected to be made final and announced shortly, is viewed by officials as the best they can come up with given the fact that Russia is unwilling to tolerate any military moves against Serbia, that the European allies have lined up behind the peace plan designed by Lord Owen and Mr. Vance, and that the Pentagon is reluctant to get involved militarily.
Lord Owen has accused the Administration of rejecting the settlement without having an alternative, saying that the plan is "the best settlement you can get."
The peace plan would create 10 autonomous provinces in Bosnia and Herzegovina and establish guarantees for the protection of minority groups within each. Proponents argue that, far from rewarding the Serbs, it would require Serbian forces to withdraw from substantial areas.
The plan has won the full endorsement only of the Croatian side in the war. The Serbian side has accepted the concept of dividing Bosnia and Herzegovina into autonomous regions but wants the map redrawn more to its liking. The Muslims object to the plan altogether, saying it would dismember the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina and reward the Serbs for their "ethnic cleansing" campaign, under which thousands of Muslims have been killed and many others expelled.
The Clinton Administration has been on the defensive all week for the way in which it has distanced itself from the Vance-Owen initiative, without having an alternative ready. Administration officials are now trying to signal that they do have an alternative in the making, while appealing for time to complete it properly.
"In Bosnia, we've inherited one of the most difficult foreign policy problems that can be imagined, I think one of the most difficult that I've ever known," Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher told reporters today.
 
'The Hard Questions'
 "I make no apologies for the fact that we're taking time to ask the hard questions, sometimes unpleasant questions, in order to determine the fairness and feasibility of the plan put forward by Mr. Vance and Lord Owen," he added. "I think the American people want us to ask those tough and searching questions."
That was not the theme that Mr. Clinton articulated during the campaign, when he lambasted Mr. Bush for not being more aggressive in coming to the aide of the Bosnians, by military means if necessary. But, as in many other areas, the Administration is now discovering the difference between campaigning and governing.
The Administration officials said that Mr. Clinton has no intention of trying to impose an American-modified version of the Vance-Owen plan on the warring factions. It will instead try to use a combination of economic and diplomatic carrots and sticks to try to encourage the parties themselves to agree to an arrangement that will be satisfactory to all.
"We don't modify it," said one policy maker. "The parties modify it, and we use our diplomacy to support that process."
The Clinton Administration has taken the view that Vance-Owen initiative is impractical, unenforceable and rewards ethnic cleansing. Mr. Clinton believes, aides said, that the United Nations should not impose a diplomatic settlement on the victim, just because the aggressor has agreed to it.
Secretary Christopher has been in touch with all the parties and the United Nations in an effort to determine how the United States can use its influence to modify the Vance-Owen plan. Administration officials feel that they have some leverage to exercise on the Serbs and others by threatening to withhold American diplomatic recognition or foreign aid, or threatening war crimes tribunals, among other things.

HEADLINE: Clinton Chooses New York Judge For Justice Post

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
President Clinton has settled on Kimba M. Wood, a Federal District judge in New York, as his nominee for Attorney General but will not announce her selection until background checks are completed, Administration officials said today.
With the White House still stung by Mr. Clinton's embarrassing withdrawal of his first nominee for the job, Zoe Baird, after she admitted hiring illegal immigrants for household work, officials said the selection process was moving with extreme caution. 
 In contrast to the Baird nomination, which was hastily made and known only to a small circle of advisers until two days before it was announced, the White House seemed to be putting out Judge Wood's name to test public reaction and insure that no damaging disclosures surfaced before officially nominating her.
 
Backup Candidates
 The officials left open the possibility that if the background inquiries led to questions about Judge Wood's qualifications or political viability as a nominee, the President was ready to shift to another candidate. These officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the backup choices are Charles F. C. Ruff, a Washington lawyer who is a former senior Justice Department official and is also a leading contender for deputy Attorney General under Judge Wood, and former Gov. Gerald L. Baliles of Virginia, who has known Mr. Clinton from their days on the Democratic Leadership Council.
Judge Wood, 49, was appointed to the court by President Ronald Reagan in 1988 at the request of Senator Alfonse D'Amato, the New York Republican, although she described herself at the time as a moderate Democrat. Her most noted decision was the 10-year prison sentence she imposed on Michael R. Milken, the financier at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. who had pleaded guilty to securities fraud. She later reduced the sentence, which gave her a reputation for toughness, to 2 years after prosecutors said he had cooperated with the Government.
While Judge Wood has not produced any opinions considered to be landmarks, she has written some creative and unusual decisions, legal experts say. She ruled last year that an advertising agency for the Wilkinson Sword Inc. was jointly liable with the company when it falsely claimed that its Ultra Glide razor was better than Gillette's Atra Plus Blades.
White House officials said Judge Wood impressed Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in separate interviews last week and that Mrs. Clinton has insisted that a woman be selected for the job.
 
No Date for Announcement
 If Judge Wood is ruled out after the background check, the officials said, Mr. Clinton will turn to a man of high stature in legal or political circles. Both Mr. Ruff and Mr. Baliles are said to meet that requirement.
Judge Wood, who was raised in a military family, earned her law degree at Harvard University. She is married to Michael Kramer, a political columnist for Time magazine, and they have a 6-year-old son, Ben.
White House officials said aides today began reviewing Judge Wood's opinions and personal history and that an announcement could come any day, depending on when the background checks are completed.
George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, said there was not a definite day set for the announcement, and he denied that Mr. Clinton was being driven by pressure to select a woman.
"The President is going to make an announcement soon, I hope," Mr. Stephanopoulos said. "I don't know the exact timing. I expect it will be within several days, but he will pick the best person in his judgment for the job."
 
Support in New York Supporters
 Judge Wood's backers in the White House are notably different from those of Ms. Baird, a corporate lawyer who was backed by a circle of Washington insiders and Secretary of State Warren Christopher. The person Mr. Clinton initially had in mind for the job also had strong Washington connections: Judge Patricia M. Wald of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Judge Wood is said to be well regarded by White House advisers from New York: Bernard W. Nussbaum, the chief counsel; Robert E. Rubin, head of the National Economic Council, and Susan Thomases, a New York lawyer who is close to the Clintons.
Ms. Thomases said in a telephone interview today that she had enormous respect for Judge Wood. "She is one of the most disciplined, most thoughtful people I've known since college," Ms. Thomases said, "but she is not a personal friend." She said she had not brought her to the Clintons' attention but had told them that if Judge Wood becomes the nominee "I will do everything I can to help her" get through the nomination process.
At first blush, Judge Wood, whose benefactor was Senator D'Amato, would not be a likely choice for Attorney General in a Democratic Administration. Before her appointment to the bench, Judge Wood had no experience with criminal cases and had never conducted a trial before a jury. Her specialty was antitrust law, which she practiced at the New York firm of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby & MacRae for 17 years. And she has virtually no administrative experience.
But Judge Wood is well regarded by colleagues on the court, and other female judges and lawyers often seek her guidance.
Among Judge Wood's opinions are some that legal experts consider creative and unusual. In a case involving charges of embezzlement, Judge Wood froze the assets of the defendant and then released enough money for him to appeal her order after recognizing she might have been in error. The order was ultimately upheld.
As a lawyer, one of her biggest cases involved defending underwriters and brokers of Lloyd's of London in an investigation by five state Attorneys General who were examining whether the insurers had colluded to raise premiums and make some policies unavailable.
Judge Wood's initial 10-year sentence of Mr. Milken was the most severe imposed in any of the Wall Street corruption cases that came to light with the confessions of Ivan F. Boesky.
Laurence H. Tribe, a law professor at Harvard University who was a legal consultant to Mr. Milken, said Judge Wood's performance in that case demonstrated her capacity for management. "She was highly innovative and imaginative," he said, "and she was creative in boiling down a very chaotic situation."

HEADLINE: G.M. IS HELD LIABLE OVER FUEL TANKS IN PICKUP TRUCKS

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Feb. 4

 BODY:
A state court jury today held the General Motors Corporation responsible for the death of a Georgia teen-ager in the fiery crash of one of its pickups, finding that the company had known that the trucks had a defective fuel-tank design but that it had failed to correct the problem. The case has been closely watched by the car industry and safety experts.
Already reeling from more than $10 billion in losses in the last seven quarters and the resignation last year of its chairman, Robert C. Stempel, G.M. now faces negative publicity and possible economic fallout from the Georgia case. A former G.M. safety expert testified at the trial that the company had intentionally misled the public about a dangerous safety problem.
 
Besieged by Problems
 G.M.'s stock closed today at $37.75, down $1.375, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained almost 43 points. The news of the jury's award came a day after the auto maker announced disappointing January car sales and saw its credit rating lowered because of huge pension obligations. 
 The jury awarded $105.2 million to Thomas and Elaine Moseley of suburban Atlanta, whose 17-year-old son Shannon burned to death in a 1989 accident in which his 1985 GMC Sierra pickup burst into flames when it was struck from the side. Jurors awarded $4.2 million in actual damages and $101 million in punitive damages.
 
Federal Decision Pending
 Large jury awards are often reduced on appeal, and under Georgia law, trial judges have the authority to reduce or raise jury awards. If upheld, it would be the largest judgment in the history of the auto industry. Judge A. L. Thompson, who presided over the trial, did not say whether he would adjust the award.
The verdict, involving a gas-tank design that has already generated more than 130 other lawsuits, comes as the Federal Government is considering ordering the recall of 4.7 million pickups produced by General Motors between 1973 and 1987.
 
G.M. Denies Defect
 The company said in a statement today that the jury had been swayed by the emotionally charged nature of a case in which a family suffered "a terrible and tragic loss." But the company said it stood behind the safety of the trucks.
"Despite this decision, General Motors remains confident that a full examination by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the technical issues in this matter will bear out our contention that the 1973-1987 full-size pickup trucks do not have a safety-related defect," the company said in its statement. General Motors said late today that it would appeal the verdict.
Fighting back tears after the jury's verdict was announced, Mr. Moseley said of the verdict: "It's achieved our purpose. We've given a statement to G.M. and the Government. It's for everybody out there -- people I don't know, the son I did know."
Critics say more than 200 people have died in full-sized Chevrolet and GMC pickups made between 1973 and 1987 because the trucks had side-mounted fuel tanks outside the truck frame, allowing them to rupture when the vehicles were struck on the side.
Six previous lawsuits involving the G.M. pickups have gone to trial, said Ed Lechtzin, a company spokesman. G.M. has won three, and plaintiffs have won three, he said, adding that some other cases had been settled out of court.
This case drew extraordinary attention for these three reasons:
*It produced by far the most internal documents from G.M.
*A former G.M. safety engineer, Ronald E. Elwell, provided damaging testimony when he told the jury that the company had intentionally hidden its knowledge of a dangerous safety defect.
*It was the first case to come to trial since the beginning of the Federal inquiry that could lead to the recall.
 
'They Must Recall Them'
 "I think the jury today sent a clear message to General Motors that the cover-up on these defective pickups is over and that they must recall them," said Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, an advocacy group in Washington that called last year for the recall of the trucks. "It's inevitable that these trucks will be recalled."
Tim Hurd, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said the verdict will not have a bearing on the investigation it began Dec. 8 into the gas-tank design.
But critics of the company said the trial had produced crucial evidence that the trucks are unsafe, and jurors agreed.
"I hope they'll read this verdict and make it right," John Dale, a juror, said of the Federal investigators. "They need to recall the trucks."
G.M. has said a recall would cost more than $1 billion. Mr. Ditlow said that the company was using an inflated figure as an argument against a recall, and that the real cost would be more like $300 million. Even so, he said, the costs of a possible recall and pending lawsuits would make the design the most costly defect in the history of the auto industry.
 
'More Will Burn'
 The ruling against the company capped an embarrassing and damaging case for G.M. The company changed lawyers shortly before the case went to trial; it had to contend with damaging testimony from Mr. Elwell, whom the company had used as its own expert in the past; and, in a vain attempt to salvage the case, it brought out as a witness Mr. Stempel, who recently resigned in the wake of the company's devastating losses.
The Moseleys' lawyers, James Butler Jr. and Robert Cheeley, argued that Shannon Moseley had burned to death because of a faulty fuel-tank design and that jurors should punish the company so severely that Federal regulators would feel compelled to order a recall that would prevent any more accidents.
"More will burn," Mr. Butler told jurors in his closing argument on Monday. "More will die unless something is done about this."
Fred Bartlit, a lawyer for G.M., tried to prove in a largely technical defense that Shannon Moseley had died instantly in the collision, which he said occurred at such a high speed that the teen-ager's death could not be attributed to the truck's design.
The company changed the design in 1988, moving the tank inside the frame, but has said it did so for design, rather than safety reasons. Critics say the change it made was not adequate to protect against fires.
"We all feel desperately sorry for the Moseleys," Mr. Bartlit said in his final argument. "We all want to help. But testimony that is inconsistent with the laws of nature cannot help."
As the case unfolded, the Moseleys refused G.M.'s offers to settle, insisting that it go to trial. Much of the most compelling testimony came from Mr. Elwell, who had testified in more than 15 previous cases that the pickups were safe. Switching sides in this case, he testified that G.M. had known for years that the "sidesaddle" design was defective but had refused to fix it for fear of alerting the public.
He said the company withheld crash-test data from him until 1983, but also said that out of fear of losing his job, he had continued to defend the company until 1989.
Defense lawyers first tried to block his testimony, and, to question his credibility, used his admission that he had testified on behalf of a design he believed was unsafe. Company officials sought to paint Mr. Elwell as a disgruntled employee who had sued the company last year in an employment dispute and was now seeking revenge.
The jury also heard the testimony of Mr. Stempel, who resigned last year as G.M.'s chairman. He said he believed the pickups were safe, but he acknowledged that the trucks' rate of fire deaths in side collisions was higher than the rates for competitors' vehicles.
The jury also viewed videotapes of General Motors' own crash tests between 1981 and 1983. In the tests, a pickup was struck in the side by another vehicle moving at 50 miles per hour. In virtually every case, the pickup's fuel tank broke open.
The company said the tests had been run as a part of an overall effort to improve the fuel safety of its vehicles. But Mr. Elwell insisted that company officials, concerned about growing pickup litigation, had begun a rush program because they had known the pickups were "no longer defensible."
 
Negative Publicity Feared
 Industry analysts said the negative publicity from the case could be as damaging as the actual costs at a time when G.M. was trying to recover from last year's losses and management problems.
"The important question in the long run is the issue of public relations, because G.M. is in the process of rebuilding its image after many years of being in an unfavorable light," said Maryann Keller, an auto industry analyst with the firm of Furman Selz.
David Ruprecht, the drunken driver and co-defendant who served 28 months in prison for vehicular homicide after running a red light and plowing into Mr. Moseley's truck, told jurors: "I hope each of you give justice to Mr. and Mrs. Moseley. I wish Shannon had been driving a Ford truck."

HEADLINE: A Clinton Aide's Farewell To Clients: Keep in Touch

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Robert E. Rubin, a former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company who is President Clinton's top economics adviser, sent a letter in December to many of his clients urging them to continue doing business with the investment banking firm and to stay in touch with him at the White House.
A copy of one of the letters, on Goldman, Sachs stationery and signed by Mr. Rubin, assures a Japanese client that Goldman, Sachs can continue to work closely with the client despite Mr. Rubin's departure. "I am confident that Goldman, Sachs will continue to work as well or even better with" the company, Mr. Rubin wrote, "given the strength of trust and the bond of mutual respect between our organizations." 
 The three-paragraph letter concludes, "I also look forward to continuing to work with you in my new capacity."
 
'Many' Such Letters
 Mr. Rubin said in an interview on Wednesday that he had sent "many" such letters, but he refused to provide a number. He said the statements were social phrases intended to encourage cooperation between private industry and Government and not intended to encourage any improper contacts or special pleading.
"What it meant was, it's in the interest of the U.S. Government to work constructively with everybody," Mr. Rubin said.
Dee Dee Myers, a White House spokeswoman, said the letter does not violate Federal ethics laws or regulations.
But the letter highlights the looseness of Government regulations on contacts between Administration officials and their former clients, said Charles R. E. Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit research organization here. He said it had created at least the appearance of a conflict of interest.
Mr. Rubin's correspondence also sheds some light on his extensive dealings in international business and finance. Mr. Rubin, the head of Mr. Clinton's new National Economic Council, is not subject to Senate confirmation. He has not yet filed his financial disclosure forms with the Federal Government but is required to do so by Feb. 19.
An adviser to a Japanese executive who received the letter provided a copy of it on the condition that neither the executive nor his company be identified. The adviser said that as many as 1,000 Goldman, Sachs clients in the United States, Japan, Europe and elsewhere received similar letters.
Mr. Rubin also said in the letter, "I hope I can continue to rely on your interest and support as I move from Broad Street in New York to Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., and would be grateful for whatever suggestions you would offer."
A Federal lawyer who had read the letter and who spoke on the condition of anonymity said, "It doesn't strike me that there's anything there that would raise any kind of specter of a violation of law or regulation."
Federal ethics regulations are mainly aimed at limiting contacts by former Administration officials with the agencies they have left. The rules require that officials not participate in decisions in which they have a financial interest and that they not accept compensation from companies and firms. But the rules do not prohibit officials from maintaining contacts with their former clients.
The letter was dated Dec. 18, 1992. Mr. Rubin joined the Administration in late January.
 
'A Fascinating Letter'
 Mr. Lewis of the Center for Public Integrity, who made his comments after a reporter read him the letter, said: "This is really a fascinating letter, because it's really an open door to contacts by his former clients. Lots of times in positions like this, people send letters saying, 'Don't contact me.' "
Mr. Rubin said he had severed his financial links to Goldman, Sachs and that he was putting his investments in a blind trust fund over which he would have no control. He reportedly earned $15 million in 1991 and has a net worth estimated at more than $50 million.
Mr. Rubin said in the interview that he would not participate in decisions that might involve Goldman, Sachs directly, but he did not rule out participating in decisions that might affect the investment bank's clients.
"Goldman, Sachs, of course, dealt with everybody," he said, adding that it would be difficult to remove himself from all issues that might affect a Goldman, Sachs client.
Ms. Myers said that White House lawyers would review Mr. Rubin's past financial work to develop a list of issues in which he would not be allowed to participate. She said the final list would exclude him for one year from decisions that would directly affect some of the clients with whom he dealt personally.
While the list is being drafted, she said, Mr. Rubin "is dealing very, very cautiously with his former clients."
She added, "As the head of the National Economic Council, it is Mr. Rubin's responsibility to the President to work with business leaders around the world to present the President with the best advice available."
Mr. Rubin said that because his position does not require Senate confirmation, he had not prepared a formal policy statement on when to remove himself from decisions in which he might face conflicts of interest.
A former ethics official in the Bush Administration, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that "assuming severance of all financial ties, there is no legal prohibition to dealing with former clients and employers, but we always tried to negotiate a grace period of a year or so," when such dealings were prohibited.
Mr. Rubin said his remark in the letter about continuing to work with a client was not meant in any way to urge the client to continue doing business with his former employer. "It was just sort of a social phrase, it had nothing to do with Goldman, Sachs," he said in the interview.

HEADLINE: Democrats Stung by Weicker Rebuke On Passing Bill to Cut Income Taxes

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s impromptu imitation of Dolly Parton, singing "Here You Come Again," may go down as one of the more lasting images of his budget address on Wednesday, not for the quality of the singing, but for the stinging 10-minute rebuke of the Democratic Party that followed when the laughter died.
Less than 90 minutes before the speech, the Democrats, who control the General Assembly, had passed a bill to cut income taxes for the middle class. The vote fulfilled a central campaign promise for many lawmakers, and addressed, they said, the elements of unfairness in the law. 
 Mr. Weicker mocked and belittled their aims, and his tone of high-handed dismissal will carry a price, lawmakers said today, especially if he decides to seek a second term next year, as he has lately indicated he might. Some of the central budget ideas in the speech were also pronounced dead by legislative leaders. Mr. Weicker, meanwhile, announced that he would veto the income-tax bill as soon as it reaches his desk.
"I understand we've been busy," Mr. Weicker told the combined House and Senate. "Within a year and a half of putting it in there," he added, referring to the income-tax law, "here we go again."
 
Faulting Tone of Words
 In conversations around the Capitol today, voices were filled with a startling bitterness about Mr. Weicker's words, and what many felt was his patronizing tone. Some were angry that Mr. Weicker had squelched the tax bill so publicly, others dismayed that he had so openly embraced the aims and oratory of the Republicans, who had opposed the plan as unfair to the upper income classes.
"The tone was the error," said Senator Kevin B. Sullivan, a Democrat from West Hartford and a deputy majority leader in the Senate. "If the shoe were on the other foot, and legislators were to glare down at him and sardonically chastise him, he would be offended, too."
Mr. Weicker, an independent third-party Governor and former Republican, has never been loved in the legislature, but he had been considered by many Democrats as a sort of kindred spirit: a liberal on most issues, whatever his party label.
The Democrats formed the core of the bipartisan coalition that Mr. Weicker assembled in 1991 to pass the income tax, and Mr. Weicker helped many of them win re-election in November by putting them on the ticket of his third party, called A Connecticut Party, which controls the top ballot line on all elections.
Legislative leaders also met with Mr. Weicker last week and told reporters afterward that they believed he would not stand in the way of the tax-revision plan.
"A number of people kept faith with the Governor -- the Governor has betrayed them," said Senator John B. Larson, the President pro-tem of the Senate and a likely candidate for Governor next year. "The Governor came off as a patronizing elitist, where he's right and everyone else has a right to be wrong."
 
Weicker Calls Cuts Minimal
 The Democrats' tax plan would have granted $156 million in new tax exemptions and deductions, with the greatest benefits going to families making $50,000 to $100,000. The costs of that cut would have been born by families earning more than $145,000, who would have seen their top marginal tax rate rise to 6.25 percent, from 4.5 percent.
Mr. Weicker said in attacking the proposal that the cuts, spread over such a large class of taxpayers, would be minimal compared with the big increases that would be faced by upper-income earners -- the very decision makers and business leaders who Mr. Weicker said he was trying to attract to Connecticut to help rebuild the economy.
In his speech, Mr. Weicker proposed about $170 million in new taxes, including a plan to replace the 5-cent bottle-deposit law with a 5-cent-a-bottle tax that would support environmental programs. He also asked the legislature to cut off about 22,000 residents from general assistance welfare relief on July 1 if they are deemed employable.
Both those notions were considered to be sinking fast today.
 
Override of Veto Is Unlikely
 "If a veto is done, Democrats will cut Governor Weicker much less slack on the initiatives he's seeking," said Representative Miles S. Rapoport, who has been one of the Governor's most dependable supporters. And overriding a veto is unlikely. The tax proposal passed 84 to 66 in the House, 17 votes short of the 101 needed for an override. It passed 21 to 14 in the Senate, where 24 votes would be needed to override.
Underlying even some of the most caustic comments about Mr. Weicker today was respect for his often canny manipulation of a legislature where he lacks even a single member of his tiny political party. The state Democratic chairman, Edward L. Marcus, said he believed Mr. Weicker, perhaps for strategic reasons, had chosen to hitch his star to the fortunes of the Republicans in siding with them on the tax fight.
The Republican chairman, Richard Foley Jr., said he expected no such alliance with the Governor, and would not particularly welcome it.
"I would characterize the Governor's discovery of Republican ideals like this," Mr. Foley said. "Even a blind squirrel finds some nuts."

HEADLINE: Japan's Growing Trade Surplus Is a Minus in U.S. Equation

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Feb. 5

 BODY:
After years of negotiations to reduce Japan's huge trade imbalances with the United States, Japanese exports are once again rising dramatically and Japanese corporations appear to be backsliding on their commitments to purchase more goods overseas.
As a result, Japanese leaders fear that their first efforts to build a relationship with the new Clinton Administration will be undercut even before they begin. In recent weeks, the United States Ambassador, Michael H. Armacost, is said to have warned Japan that it should come up with concrete proposals to improve the trade picture before meeting President Clinton or other officials. 
 This week, in a sign of Japan's eagerness to revive its economy, the Bank of Japan cut the discount rate, the interest it charges on money borrowed by commercial banks, to 2.5 percent from 3.25 percent. Government officials fervently hope the step will spur imports and impress Japan's trading partners that it takes the trade imbalance seriously.
The Japanese economic downturn, one of the biggest in recent history, has worsened the trade situation as companies seek to stimulate earnings by stepping up their exports.
 
No Climate for Change
 Government officials also say privately that in a climate of corporate cutbacks and even some of the country's first layoffs in a generation, Japanese firms cannot be persuaded to buy more foreign parts and components at the expense of their long-term relationships with their traditional suppliers.
The depth of the problem became evident today, when Japan released its trade totals for 1992. Japan's surplus with the world was $132.63 billion, a record, and more than twice the figure in 1990.
While figures for the United States were not immediately available, it will probably account for a third of the surplus, running a trade deficit with Japan of $45 billion to $47 billion. The new level will approach the record of $52 billion six years ago, when the trade figures created a crisis in relations and sharp new pressures on trade.
The changing trade situation comes at what Japanese officials describe as the worst possible time, fueling Japan's image as an economic aggressor just as the Clinton Administration is facing its first demands from several industries to provide protection from Japanese imports.
In telling the Japanese to come up with some concrete proposals, Mr. Armacost has carefully steered clear of saying what kind of new initiatives to offer or that they should be a condition of a first meeting, American officials here said. But he is said to have made it clear by implication that a major plan to spur Japanese Government and private spending, and thus improve imports, would be the best way to avoid souring the first encounters with Mr. Clinton's economic team.
But so far, the Japanese Government, enmeshed in complicated arguments over its budget for next year, has shown few signs of heeding the advice beyond the Bank of Japan's move to cut the discount rate.
 
Business Blames Government
 Business executives are increasingly blaming the Government of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa for reacting far too slowly and sticking by a spending program that it devised months ago and that, as a stimulus, now appears completely inadequate.
Last week Mr. Miyazawa conceded in Parliament that the Government had badly misjudged the depth and severity of Japan's downturn. But the Prime Minister, his approval ratings in the polls already at near-record lows, declined to commit himself to greater spending.
"There is a feeling that it is not nearly enough," Yotaro Kobayashi, the chairman of the Fuji-Xerox Company and a spokesman for the Keidanren, Japan's most powerful business organization, said of the Government's stimulus program in an interview. But Mr. Kobayashi also said that Japanese business was partly to blame for the resurgence of the trade surplus.
After contending for several years that the Japanese economy was rapidly shifting away from overdependence on exports and that trade surpluses were in steady decline, Mr. Kobayashi and other business executives now concede that many of Japan's biggest firms are trying to export their way out of Japan's economic troubles.
 
Change Was illusory
 A few, when speaking on the condition that their names not be used, say that the "fundamental reforms" that the Government said industry was undergoing through the late 1980's were actually illusory, and that the progress American firms made to become supplier to Japanese industry has been halted, and in some cases eroded.
At the same time, Japanese officials have clearly grown more edgy about the new Administration.
In the two weeks since the inauguration, disputes with Japan have arisen over steel, autos and commercial airline routes, and a bill was introduced in Congress to renew a law the Japanese detest: the so-called "Super 301," which allows the United States to retaliate unilaterally against countries that Washington judges are discriminating against American goods.
Almost immediately after the "Super 301" bill was introduced, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry leaked information that it was drawing up legislation for Japan to respond with import restrictions of its own.
But there is growing recognition in Japan that the trade surplus numbers alone will encourage the Clinton Administration to adopt a much harsher tone on trade.
"It would be hard to imagine a worse situation in which to build a relationship with the Clinton people," a senior Japanese official who has long struggled with trade questions said recently.
 
A General Plan
 Next week, Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe will travel to Washington for Japan's first close encounter with the new Administration. But Japanese officials are already trying to dampen any expectations that he will follow Mr. Armacost's advice and bring anything more concrete than a general plan for a new organization that would talk about reconciling fundamental differences about the way business is done in the world's two largest economies.
The Foreign Ministry's chief spokesman, Masamichi Hanabusa, said this week that Mr. Watanabe would ask for more time to see the effects "of our big stimulative measures."
"I don't think that is empty-handed," he said. "But I don't say it is full-handed."
Few Japanese officials are eager to acknowledge a less obvious reality of the trade surplus with the United States: the figures would be dramatically worse if Japan had not spent much of the past decade building factories all over Southeast Asia, from air conditioning plants in Thailand to electronics factories in Indonesia and Malaysia.
The result is that many of the products Japan once exported from here are now assembled, with Japanese components, in other nations. Thus, the final products do not go on Japan's trade ledgers, even though much of the content is of Japanese origin.
The surplus with the rest of Asia has quadrupled in only six years, and this year Japan's surplus with Southeast Asia will be roughly the size of the surplus with the United States. Politically, however, it is less of a problem for Japan: Heavily dependent on Japanese foreign aid and technology, and often eager for investment of any kind, many of those countries are unwilling to complain too loudly.

HEADLINE: House Passes Voter Bill Over G.O.P. Opposition

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
House Democrats stood almost as one today and passed legislation fiercely denounced by Republicans that would make it easier to register new voters and harder to purge them from precinct rolls.
The legislation, the daylong debate over it and the party-line vote of 259 to 160 echoed an election-year battlewaged in Congress last spring and summer over voter registration. The Senate, which now gets the bill, is expected to pass it and send it to the White House, just as it did last year. 
 While George Bush vetoed the bill last year, President Clinton, is certain to sign it, perhaps as soon as March.
The voter bill, like family-leave legislation, is one of several Democratic initiatives vetoed by Mr. Bush that Democrats want to enact early this year to show their political muscle.
 
Bitter Pill for G.O.P.
 Passage of the voter bill would be a bitter pill for Republicans, who argued last year and again today that it is a plot to expand the ranks of Democrats. But Democrats and many civic groups insist it is intended to encourage voting, although they also acknowledge that it would largely benefit poor and relatively powerless Americans who historically lean toward Democrats.
More than 122 million Americans are registered to vote, but 57 million others of voting age are not.
"I think that enfranchising poor people -- and that's what we're talking about here, people who can't afford cars, people who can't afford nice houses -- is a noble thing," Representative Andrew Jacobs Jr., an Indiana Democrat, said in today's debate.
The legislation, nicknamed the "motor-voter bill" because of its tie to driver's licenses, includes a sweeping clause that would effectively register as a voter anyone over the age of 18 who applies for or renews a license. That would include nearly 9 in 10 adults, and registration would be virtually automatic unless an applicant deliberately waived the process.
 
Registration by Mail
 But the measure also takes steps to enroll the remaining 10 percent of adults by ordering all states to permit registration by mail and to designate popular government offices as voter-registration agencies. Among agencies that would register voters are those dealing with welfare, unemployment and services for people with disabilities. States could add branches at marriage-license desks and even private offices.
Republicans assailed the measure on three fronts: that it is too costly, that it is intended to give Democrats an electoral edge and that it is an invitation to rig elections.
Some were especially incensed by what they saw as special efforts to enroll core Democratic constituencies in welfare and jobless-benefits offices. Several Republicans complained that the bureaucratic burdens of complying with the bill would cost the states scores of millions of dollars.
Democrats say the bill would cost $25 million over five years.
 
Voter Fraud Feared
 Republicans warned that quick and easy registration would encourage corrupt political machines to steal elections. Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House minority whip, predicted a wave of fraudulent voting by illegal immigrants, noting that the Department of Agriculture estimates 300,000 illegal aliens already get food stamps at welfare offices, and thousands more have driver's licenses.
Democrats responded that the Republicans' real fear was that new voters would oppose their policies.
"The fraud issue being raised here today," said Representative Al Swift, a Washington Democrat, "is the biggest fraud in this debate."

HEADLINE: In Florida, Family Bill Wins Converts

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Feb. 4

 BODY:
When the Dade County Commission was considering a family-leave ordinance in 1991, Malone & Hyde Food Distributors was among the many companies that testified against the idea, arguing that the legislation would impose an unnecessary and disruptive burden on them.
But nearly a year after the law took effect in Florida's most populous county, the company has a new attitude. "We had reservations about being told what we could and couldn't do, but it hasn't really had any affect on us," said Janet Blair, the personnel director. None of the 600 employees have yet asked for a family leave "even though they are aware of it," she added. 
 Nationwide, 25 states and the District of Columbia have some type of family-leave legislation. But Dade County was the first county in the country to pass such a measure, and its ordinance most closely resembles the Federal bill, according to the Families and Work Institute, a organization in New York City that studies the issue.
In Dade County, many of the 2,500 companies covered by the law have reached conclusions similar to that of Malone & Hyde Food. Some, like Ms. Blair, say it is because few employees are taking the leaves. Others say it is proving less expensive than expected and actually increases worker satisfaction and output.
 
Big Gain in Loyalty
 "Not only do you get a tremendous amount of loyalty, since they know they can come back to their job, but from the productivity perspective you get more done because they come back refreshed," said Stephen Cerrone, director of human resources at Burger King, which has its corporate headquarters here. "This has been nothing but positive for us."
The legislation's backers say they have been pleased with the results. Commissioner Larry Hawkins, who sponsored the ordinance, and other county officials have said that the policy is working as expected and that there have been few complaints.
Like the bill passed by Congress last night, which provides for 12 weeks of leave, the legislation here, which took effect in March, lets workers take six days more, up to 90 days, of unpaid leave for the birth of a child or the illness of an immediate relative, with a guarantee they will have a job when they return. Because of the similarities, workers and corporate managers here say that once a Federal bill became law, the misgivings around the country would probably ease.
Edward Garcia, a service representative for Southern Bell who was able to take six months off to care for a sick child, said he was pleased. "I was allowed to return to the same title, the same office, the same supervisor and the same money," he said. "How could I not be grateful to a company that granted me this, that helped my son incredibly?"
Fears that large numbers of employees here would immediately try to take advantage of the program have proven to be unfounded.
"There has been very little abuse compared to the size of our work force," said Henry C. Fraind, director of management and operations for the Dade County school system, which employs 38,000. "You can't earn money when you're out, sitting at home."
Many critics of family leave argue that obligatory policies will add to the cost of doing business, thereby leading to higher unemployment. Senator Connie Mack, a Florida Republican who opposes the Federal bill, said in a statement this week that "it is ridiculous for the Government to pile regulation after regulation on employers and not expect job losses to follow."
But companies here that offer family leave say their experience has been otherwise. The costs have not been "oppressive," said Terry Johnson, a spokesman for Southern Bell, which has about 5,500 employees here and was one of several larger corporations that already offered family leaves.
That is not to say, though, that companies have not had to make adjustments.
 
New Strategies
 "The challenge to our managers and bank team is the staffing issue," said Elizabeth Ferrer, vice president for human resources at Barnett Bank of South Florida, who has taken two maternity leaves herself. "One thing we have done is to have a larger support team throughout Dade County, so that when family leave occurs we have somebody who can step right into that place."
But Mr. Cerrone of Burger King said that by shuffling workers around, his company has actually "gotten some yardage out of exposing people to different areas of the business."
Executives of smaller companies, however, argue that it has been harder for them to comply with the county ordinance because they do not have as much flexibility. Lombardo Perez, president of Metro Ford, an automobile dealership here that has 92 employees, said that only one of his workers, a mechanic, had asked for the family illness leave.
"My one reservation about this is that in some very specialized jobs, like an air conditioning mechanic, it can be difficult to get a temporary replacement," Mr. Perez said.
Mr. Perez also said he was happy to hold a job for productive workers. But "if they're not good employees, I'm not going to want to do the same," he added.

"How could I not be grateful to a company that granted me this, that helped my son incredibly?" (Phillippe Diederich for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: New Jersey Retaliates for New York Taxi Fee

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON

 BODY:
In the latest skirmish in the trans-Hudson wars, officials in New Jersey said yesterday that they would begin charging New York City limousines and taxis $200 a year per vehicle for the right to bring passengers from New Jersey to New York.
Members of the Bergen County legislature, which enacted the law Wednesday evening, described it as a tit-for-tat action intended to encourage New York's Taxi and Limousine Commission to rescind regulations for out-of-town hired cars that went into effect last week. 
 "We don't want to do this," said Richard A. Mola, vice chairman of the county's Board of Freeholders, its governing body. "All we want to do is to get New York to take back their law, which is plain wrong."
Accusing New York authorities of trying to gouge New Jerseyans, Mr. Mola said that he thought New Jersey's limousine companies had suffered enough in the recession and that the new expenses were ill timed.
Just as, over the years, New Yorkers and New Jerseyans have bickered over taxes, the birthplace of baseball and the Statue of Liberty, limousine owners and drivers in the two states spoke derisively of one another yesterday.
"Manhattan is just another town," said Tim Rose, vice president of Garden State Limousine of North Arlington, N.J., describing his objection to the New York regulations. "They want to charge us for going from town to town."
Deleroy Mayles, a New York driver, countered: "I only go to New Jersey when I absolutely have to. There's nothing of interest there." The new regulations principally affect limousine companies with corporate clients.
If the Taxi and Limousine Commission does not alter New York's regulations in 30 days, Mr. Mola of Bergen County warned, the police will begin enforcing the law in New Jersey. Any New York limousine found picking up a passenger in New Jersey would be given a $500 ticket for the first and second offense, and could be confiscated after a third offense. Those penalties are similar to New York's strictest penalties for operating a vehicle without a proper license.
Yet the Taxi and Limousine Commission seems unlikely to budge. Mr. Del Valle noted that the regulations were written into state law, which was passed last November and that took effect last week, and would not easily be changed. He defended the regulations as sensible.
' "We regulate the industry for a reason," Mr. Del Valle said. "When you get into a car, you want to know that it's not Jack the Ripper behind the wheel." He estimated the trans-Hudson limousine and taxi traffic at fewer than 2,000 cars
The new laws in both states require a $200 licensing fee for each limousine and a $500 fee for the limousine company, both annual fees. Mr. Del Valle said that New Jersey limousines would be exempt from New York motor vehicles tax, which costs local taxis $1,000 and limousines $400.

HEADLINE: Clinton's National Service Program Will Have Modest Start

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
The White House said today that the ambitious national service program Bill Clinton proposed in the Presidential campaign would begin as a more modest and economical effort to encourage volunteerism.
George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, said President Clinton "intends to fulfill his commitment to build a national service plan" but acknowledged that it would be costly to do immediately. 
 In the campaign, Mr. Clinton said his Administration would replace the existing student loan program with one that would give students tuition aid in exchange for donating time to community service after graduation.
Today Mr. Clinton said that he always intended to enact the national service program in stages and that it would take six years for the full slate of options to be offered.
 
Avoiding a Mess
 "Unless the mechanics are such that we can't implement the service program, which I don't believe is the case, I would expect us to get, you know, to be well beyond what you would call a pilot program as soon as we implement it," Mr. Clinton said.
Eli J. Segal, the director of the Office of National Service, said there would not be enough volunteer service slots to accommodate every student who received Government assistance. He said the President was considering a plan that would also allow students to repay Government loans in amounts related to post-graduate income.
"I think we're in the process stage of figuring out one of the best ways of achieving the objectives," Mr. Segal said. "I think if we had all the money in the world, President Clinton would probably not want to throw it all at this right away. We don't want to create a program that would create a mess in the process."
Neither Mr. Segal nor Mr. Stephanopoulos would characterize the amount of money Mr. Clinton will set aside for the national service program in the budget he gives to Congress on March 23. But both indicated that the President had been forced to change some of his goals as economic circumstances changed.
 
Lowering Their Sights
 "It's true that the economic circumstances have changed since his election," Mr. Stephanopoulos said. "The deficit is bigger. We are going to have to make tough choices. Some of those choices might entail scaling back some of the investments that he dearly wants to move forward on."
Mr. Segal said limited resources had forced him to focus more on coordinating volunteer programs than on putting a college aid program in place. But he insisted that the service program would eventually emerge intact and should not be classified as another campaign promise that might soon be broken.
"This is at the soul of Bill Clinton," he said. "This is not peripheral. This is not like middle-class tax cuts. He'll walk away from a lot of things before he walks away from national service."
Mr. Segal has been meeting with leaders of volunteer groups and has begun to identify volunteer offices in several Federal departments.
Until coordination is established on that level, he said, the full program will not be ready to begin.

HEADLINE: STRONG ECONOMIC SIGNALS LIFT DOW TO A RECORD;
Productivity Increases 4% In a Surge Without Hiring

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The productivity of American workers shot up 4 percent in the fourth quarter, the Labor Department reported yesterday -- fresh evidence that corporate America is helping to generate a new surge in the American economy without hiring many new workers.
The productivity numbers issued by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics were startling. The 4 percent rise in last year's fourth quarter was the highest increase for a single quarter since the early 1970's. And the 2.6 percent rise in productivity for all of 1992 was the best improvement since 1972. 
 The latest data were announced along with eye-popping gains in retail sales in January. [Page D2.] The Government also announced that factory orders jumped 5.3 percent in December and that new claims for unemployment benefits fell in the latest week for the first time in three weeks. These reports, along with the enthusiasm shown by investors in the stock market, suggest that a full-fledged recovery might at last be under way.
 
A Question Still Unanswered
 But a huge question remains unanswered: Can the surge continue while companies are getting all the production they need from their existing workers? So far, the stronger productivity -- that is, the greater efficiency in what workers produce in a given period -- has worked against new hiring. And at this point after previous recessions, new hiring was already well under way.
The adverse effect of a productivity increase on job creation "can be bad in the short term because of what it does to consumer spending and to consumer confidence," said Nancy Lazar, a senior economist at the ISI Group, a consulting service. "But long term, it is positive because as profits rise, so do stock prices, and that should encourage hiring. Maybe that is already beginning."
Yesterday's report covered the seventh quarter since the recession ended in March 1991. Although the latest improvement was unusually strong -- with the service sector and the manufacturing sector both turning in strong gains -- the average quarterly rise in productivity over those seven quarters was roughly the same as the average for the first seven quarters of recovery that followed each of the seven major previous recessions since World War II.
What is different this time is this: While the output of goods and services rose each quarter by more than 11 percent on average after previous recessions, the average quarterly growth in output since March 1991 has been only 4 percent. Total output of goods and services differs from productivity, which is the amount workers produce per unit of time.
 
 
Room for a Rise
 The strong growth in output after the earlier recessions left room for employment to rise without dampening productivity. In fact, total hours worked throughout the economy except in farming and government employment rose 5.9 percent on average in the previous recoveries, while in this recovery hours worked actually fell six-tenths of a percent.
"This tells you, to be very literal about it, that the number of hours worked in the nonfarm sector was less in December than it was at the lowest point in the recession," said Edwin R. Dean, associate commissioner for productivity at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. He attributed the drop mostly to layoffs and attrition, rather than to fewer hours worked by the same number of people.
"What has happened is that the recovery in output of goods and services has been so weak that it has been possible to produce that output by simply using the services of skilled workers somewhat more intensively," Mr. Dean said.
More important, unit labor costs -- the cost in wages to produce a car, for example, or a sled or a machine -- have risen far less in this recovery than in the previous seven, going up only 2.3 percent on average for the seven quarters, compared with 5.3 percent for the same period in the previous recoveries.
The productivity gains, in effect, have not yet been passed on in higher wages, Mr. Dean said. That has helped to make companies more profitable and also given them leeway to lower prices, thus making the companies more competitive on world markets -- but at a cost of frozen wages in America, discouraging the demand among consumers that in the past has sustained recoveries.
 
'Double-Edged Sword'
 Such findings sharpen a debate over whether rising productivity can itself sustain a surge in economic activity -- despite the job problem -- to convert the surge into a lasting healthy recovery. "It is a double-edged sword," said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "It is good for the improved efficiency of our companies and thus for competitiveness. But it is tough on workers, who are victims of the downsizing that has been required to boost productivity."
Clearly, the productivity has some advantages. Ms. Lazar, Mr. Roach and many other economists argue that the higher profits that have resulted in recent months from improved productivity are already encouraging some companies to invest more in new machinery. The production of machinery, in turn, helps to create jobs.
Despite much-publicized layoffs at giant companies, the number of jobs has been rising slowly in recent months, mostly at small companies employing 20 workers or fewer, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. But the job growth has not been sufficient to absorb all the Americans who want to work, and the unemployment rate has remained above 7 percent.
Productivity improvement also helps to hold down inflation, because rising demand can be met without running short of workers to produce the needed goods and services. Lower inflation -- it was only 2.9 percent last year -- allows interest rates to fall, encouraging the borrowing by consumers and businesses that stimulate spending and recovery.
 
On the Dark Side
 The dark side of strong productivity is inadequate job growth and income, weakening demand and also the recovery. The surge in consumer buying in recent months, in fact, is often attributed to a rise in consumer debt, a trend that cannot continue. Productivity is particularly an obstacle to growth, many economists say, if it results not from more skillful work habits but from shrinking a company's work force because there is not enough production to keep all of the staff busy.
"It is hard to quantify how much to attribute to the slash-and-burn approach and how much to other, more positive factors," Mr. Roach said.

HEADLINE: STRONG ECONOMIC SIGNALS LIFT DOW TO A RECORD;
Index Jumps 2.6% in 2 Days; Other Averages at Highs

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
The stock market surged again yesterday, as a headstrong rally in the bond market and exuberant corporate earnings propelled the Dow Jones industrial average to a record closing. The index has risen 2.6 percent in the last two days.
Most other market averages reached new highs as well, on emphatic Big Board volume of 351.14 million shares, the seventh highest in history. But until yesterday, the Dow was the only major market indicator not to set a record this year. 
 Yesterday's 42.95-point gain in the Dow, to 3,416.74, came as the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 7.18 percent, the lowest since August 1986. Traders say further gains may depend on today's employment report. [Page D12.]
 The advance among stocks and bonds followed interest rate cuts by the German and Japanese central banks, moves that are expected to help the languishing global economy. Encouraging economic reports on productivity, retail sales and factory orders also fueled the stock market's advance.
 
'Best of All Worlds'
 The Dow's new high capped an 8.9 percent rise since Oct. 9, built on the economy's recovery and a surge of investing through mutual funds.
 "We've got the best of all worlds here," said Robert H. Stovall, president of the Stovall/Twenty-First Advisors money-management firm. "Interest rates down, business cycles recovering, inflation not a problem."
Higher stock prices and lower interest rates have great benefits for the economy, allowing companies to raise money and expand at less expense. Any stimulus provided by the financial markets ultimately lessens the need for the Government to keep the economy moving through increased spending.
Some strategists caution that with stocks at these levels, the release today of an even slightly disappointing employment report would cause share prices to tumble. "That report has to be great for the market to do better," at least in the short term, said Laszlo Birinyi, president of a financial consulting firm that bears his name. "People are going to be looking for an excuse to sell."
Economists anticipate word of continued improvement in payrolls, with the consensus for a gain of 125,000 jobs in January.
But some bond traders fear that a strong report on employment could end the credit market's rally, pushing yields back up. Rising bond yields, in turn, would draw money out of the stock market.
The Dow, weighed down by humbled industrial giants like General Motors and I.B.M., has recently lagged behind other averages. With a gain of 88.07 points in the last two days, however, it has rushed to the market's forefront, past the high of 3,413.21 set on June 1.
The Standard & Poor's 500, a broader index, had a more modest rise of 2.36 to 449.56, still continuing a streak of records.
Although General Motors moved lower and I.B.M. gained a modest 7/8 point, to 51 3/8, most industrial heavyweights stepped lively. Among the Dow stocks, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing rose 3 1/2 points to 104 1/4, Allied Signal was up 3 1/2 to 65 3/8, International Paper rose 3 points to 68 3/8 and Goodyear gained 2 1/2 points to 73 1/2.
Mr. Birinyi and many other strategists say the improving economy and stable or lower interest rates could, over coming months, send stocks still higher. Earnings reports for the latest quarter have shown significant improvement.
Some analysts are less confident about the Nasdaq stocks that have led the market higher since fall. The Nasdaq composite index set a record yesterday, but rose only 0.18 points to 708.85.
 
 
Computer Issues Lose Ground
 Small stocks edged ahead, but the Nasdaq 100 index of this market's largest stocks was stranded with a loss of 4.58 points, to 748.49. Some popular computer technology issues lost a point or more, with Microsoft down 3 3/8 to 85, accounting for about two-thirds of this average's decline.
Hank Striefler, co-manager of the Lehman Brothers Nasdaq trading desk, said the Dow industrials were due to make up lost ground. "We've been acting so great that we have to give them a chance to catch up with us," he said.
A minority, however, sees a more ominous pattern. David G. Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, said the market's highs in recent days had been based largely on anticipation that long-term interest rates would hit seven-year lows. He noted the strong gains among utility stocks, banks, Dow industrials and other issues that profit the most from declining rates. Some Nasdaq stocks, which he says are less dependent on lower rates, have cooled.
In his view, a reversal in interest rates, even if it results from an upbeat jobs report, could puncture the stock market's progress. "The whole world will be watching the unemployment numbers," he said. "All you need is a couple little things to upset the apple cart."
 Since fall, the market has seldom flown in formation, with one sector, then another, soaring ahead. The Nasdaq index, dominated by smaller stocks, has gained 24 percent since Oct. 9, more than twice as much as the Dow.
Investors chose Nasdaq stocks because they seemed most likely to benefit from President Clinton's plans to encourage small, young businesses. The Nasdaq issues are also usually favored by individuals, who have poured record amounts into stock mutual funds.
Some market watchers say the Dow has suddenly emerged this week because investors are sated with their Nasdaq profits, and the Dow stocks now look like a cheap way of betting on an accelerating recovery.

HEADLINE: Zaire Opposition Seeks Foreign Troops to Restore Order; Capital Is Calm but Nervous

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Adding a potentially explosive element to Zaire's political crisis, Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi called today for foreign military intervention to help restore order after a week of civil disorders.
"What we need is foreign pressure, whatever it is, be it moral or physical," Mr. Tshisekedi said at a news conference, his first public appearance since marauding soldiers went on a rampage a week ago. 
He said he had made the appeal because the Zairian Army "does not respect the rule of law."
Mr. Tshisekedi's remarks came as diplomats from France, Belgium and the United States, Zaire's main creditors, held talks in Brussels to discuss ways of forcing President Mobutu Sese Seko to yield virtually all control over the Government to the Prime Minister.
 
President Is Intransigent
 But President Mobutu reacted angrily to the three nations' appeal Wednesday that he step aside, telling a French news agency that Zaire's political imbroglio was mostly a result of bungling by Mr. Tshisekedi and other opposition leaders. His creditors, the President said, were trying to punish the "fire brigade" while allowing "arsonists to go free."
African and Western diplomats say the friction between Mr. Mobutu and Mr. Tshisekedi has reached a stalemate. "Neither side has shown any willingness to compromise," said one African diplomat. "They would rather see this country go up in flames than appear to be the first ones to blink."
In a statement today, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, Zaire's biggest and most influential opposition group, said Mr. Mobutu should be impeached for "high treason." The group, which is led by Mr. Tshisekedi, said the President had committed "barbaric acts" in order to "cling to power by force."
 
Inertia and Impotence
 Left unsaid was the fact that Mr. Mobutu has shown absolutely no inclination to yield, and Mr. Tshisekedi has no power to make him do so. Also unmentioned is that the President is in tight control of the armed forces and has no qualms about using them.
Moreover, African and Western diplomats said, although Zaire's creditors seem eager to get rid of Mr. Mobutu, no one appears ready to do so by force. Rather, the Western nations are believed to be more likely to use sanctions and other economic tools.
Until now, the creditors had urged Mr. Mobutu and the opposition to accommodate each other in a power-sharing arrangement; Mr. Tshisekedi's selection was supposed to be part of that process.
 
Funny Money, Soldiers Say
 The current crisis, the most serious threat to President Mobutu in decades, began last Thursday when soldiers rioted after being paid in new high-denomination bank notes that were issued by the President but outlawed by Mr. Tshisekedi and rejected by traders. They closed Kinshasa's airport and the river port on the Congo, and looted stores and private houses. As the pillaging and unrest spread, France and Belgium flew in hundreds of troops to evacuate their citizens from Zaire, which was once the Belgian Congo.
Today the streets were calm, but vast segments of the economy have shut down. Not a single gas station, for instance, was operating in central Kinshasa. Nor, it seems, were any pharmacies open. Banks have been closed for months.
In the few stalls open in the central market, the price of a sack of manioc, Zaire's staple food, has doubled in less than a week. At hospitals, supplies are depleted and doctors admitting only emergency cases.
Mr. Tshisekedi said President Mobutu was behaving as if Zaire's provisional Parliament did not exist.
"He is resisting what the people want and the pro-democracy conference decided, which is change for the country," the Prime Minister said.
"I'm not prepared to take orders from somebody whose political record for the last 28 years is a clear disaster. President Mobutu did not appoint me and he cannot get rid of me."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Evaluating Mobutu
 BRUSSELS, Feb. 4 (Special to The New York Times) -- Diplomats from the United States, France and Belgium today discussed their options if President Mobutu does not cede power.
The diplomats refused to comment on their five-and-a-half-hour meeting, but participants said options included seizing Mr. Mobutu's assets, expelling his diplomats and limiting the travel of Zairian officials.
All three countries, and the European Community's development fund, have suspended aid to Zaire because of Mr. Mobutu's actions.
Belgium held firm today to its decision to impound 14.5 metric tons of freshly printed five-million-zaire banknotes that Mr. Mobutu's forces had sought to fly by chartered airplane from a provincial field at Ostend to his embattled capital.
The bills, which feature Mr. Mobutu's picture and are supposedly worth $2 each, were printed by Harrison & Son of Britain. President Mobutu's previous printers, Gieseck & Devrient of Germany, canceled his account on the ground that he was not creditworthy, apparently fearing they would be paid with the same bills they were printing.
There were also continued demonstrations today outside the Zaire Embassy here. Some demonstrators laid flowers on the pavement to commemorate the victims of the violence in Zaire, while others threw eggs against the facade.

HEADLINE: National Study Finds Insurance Industry Bias

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
A nonprofit community development group says that it has found evidence in a national study that homeowners in inner-city neighborhoods are severely underinsured and that it is harder for poor members of minorities to buy insurance than it is for poor whites.
The study of 13 cities was conducted by Acorn, an activist group that has prodded the banking industry on lending practices in poor areas. It described its research as the first national study in a decade of whether insurance companies practice redlining. 
 The report comes at a time when regulators around the country are expressing increasing concern about the availability and cost of insurance for the inner-city poor, particularly in California, New York and Texas.
"Discrimination clearly perpetuates itself throughout the financial marketplace," said Maude Hurd, the president of the organization, which is active in 24 states. "It may well be time for the Federal Government to take an active role in protecting the interests of low-income and minority families."
The Acorn study found that insurance agents are five times more likely to refuse homeowners in inner cities a chance to buy insurance than they are residents of high-income areas.
The survey of insurance-company data in five Midwestern cities also found that people living in poor minority neighborhoods were far more likely to be without insurance than residents of poor white neighborhoods. In Milwaukee, for example, homes in poor minority areas were more than four times as likely than white-owned homes to be without insurance.
A spokesman for Acorn, Deepak Bhargava, said his organization had studied the filings of insurance companies and analyzed that data by ZIP code for Chicago; Kansas City, Mo.; Milwaukee; Minneapolis-St. Paul, and St. Louis. In addition, the organization surveyed agents in 624 phone calls in 13 cities across the country.
 
 
Findings Disputed
 Spokesmen for insurance companies bitterly dispute that they are guilty of discrimination by race or geography. Higher risks in poor areas make insurance more expensive, they say, and often difficult for poor people to afford.
"It is clearly more difficult and more expensive to get insurance in urban areas, but it is often more difficult and more expensive to get groceries" and other products, said Lynn Schubert, an assistant general counsel with the American Insurance Association, a trade group representing more than 200 property and casualty companies. "We are absolutely opposed to any kind of racial discrimination."
Sean Mooney, a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, another insurance trade group, cautioned that a large number of uninsured residents in an area might reflect the fact that poor consumers might decide not to buy. He said he had not had time to study the Acorn data.
"I don't see anything here that goes to the question of whether anybody just can't get insurance," Mr. Mooney said. "People who are poor sometimes decide not to."
Whether insurance is available and affordable is a crucial issue in economic development for inner-city areas, economists say. Without insurance, property owners are unable to get mortgages and business are unable to get credit. And inner-city residents pay auto insurance premiums that are many times higher than suburbanites.
After the riots of 1968, a Federal study found a widespread lack of insurance in inner-city areas, and Congress established state-run plans known as Fair Access to Insurance Requirements, or FAIR. The plans were intended to make insurance available to residents of high-risk areas, but since 1979 there has been no multistate review of how many people are underinsured and how hard it is to buy insurance in urban areas.
Among Acorn's findings were that low-income neighborhoods were underinsured in comparison with wealthier areas. In Chicago, for example, only 51 percent of the occupied single-family units in low-income neighborhoods were insured, compared with 90 percent in high-income areas. In Milwaukee, 51 percent of single-family units in poor areas were insured, compared with 84 percent in affluent areas.
People who said they lived in low-income ZIP codes, the organization said, faced numerous obstacles to buying from agents, compared with those saying they lived in affluent areas.
People from high-income areas were refused a policy 6 to 8 percent of the time, compared with 38 percent of the callers from low-income neighborhoods, the organization said. In New York City, for lower-income areas, agents refused to give a price for a policy 26 percent of the time. The surveyors experienced no refusals for people calling from high-income areas.

HEADLINE: Strong January Sales Signal Good Quarter for Retailers

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Retail sales roared ahead at a surprising pace in January, with almost every major store chain posting eye-popping gains.
What's more, because most merchants managed their inventory so carefully during the holiday season, they were not just getting rid of clearance merchandise last month, a trend that bodes well for their first-quarter profitability. 
 "In contrast to the doom-sayers who say there's nothing to support a recovery, consumer spending is leading us out of this weak economy," said Jeffrey M. Feiner, a retail analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.
The Salomon Brothers Same-Store Growth Index, which includes the sales of 22 different retail companies, rose 5.8 percent in January. Mr. Feiner had been expecting a 4 percent increase in the index.
 
Wal-Mart Sales Up 26%
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retail company, sold more than $4 billion worth of goods in January, a 26 percent increase over all and a 10 percent jump in sales of stores that have been open at least a year. The company hit a sales record of $55.5 billion in the year that ended last month.
Sears, Roebuck & Company's retail business had a 8.3 percent increase in comparable store sales, and Limited Inc. said its same-store sales climbed 6 percent in the four weeks that ended Jan. 30.
Analysts consider sales in stores open at least a year a better indicator of a retailer's performance because new stores distort total sales figures.
Analysts said that while the pace of spending was not sustainable, sales would nonetheless continue to show healthy increases as the year continued and consumer confidence grew. "Sales are being driven by improving hope for the future, thanks to one man -- namely, Mr. Clinton," said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report, a retail consulting firm.
 
Kmart Growth is Weak
 The rising sales tide failed, however, to buoy all retailers. Comparable store sales at the Kmart Corporation, which had meager sales gains in December, crept up just three-tenths of 1 percent. The Woolworth Corporation also eked out a fractional increase of two-tenths of 1 percent.
Some store companies reported sales for five weeks that ended Jan. 30 while others reported their sales for the four weeks that ended the last Saturday of last month, making comparisons between retailers somewhat difficult. J. C. Penney, for example, posted a 1 percent decline in same-store sales during the four weeks that ended Jan. 30 because a major furniture promotion shifted from the last week of the month to the first week of February. But had Penney counted sales during the four weeks that ended Jan. 23, the company would have posted a 6.2 percent comparable store sales increase.
Some analysts had worried that consumers would shut off the flow of dollars in January once they got bills reflecting their markedly increased use of credit cards during the holiday season. But Mastercard International reported yesterday that its card holders in the United States charged almost $7.2 billion worth of goods and services during the month, a 21.1 percent increase.
 
Apparel a Pacesetter
 Clothing, a category of merchandise that did not sell well during the recession, is now blowing out of stores, retailers said. For example, Clothestime Inc., a specialty store chain that sells trendy fashion merchandise, posted a 12 percent gain in same-store sales.
Same-store sales at Gap Inc. increased 7 percent, and the Ann Taylor Corporation reported an 11 percent increase in sales in its stores open at least one year. Both chains warned, however, that their sales came at the expense of profits as they marked down prices to move merchandise out of their stores.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bond Yield Falls Again

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 7.18 percent yesterday, its lowest level since August 1986, and traders began to focus on today's January unemployment report for clues to the rally's fate.
The price of the 30-year bond finished up 10/32 , pushing the yield down from 7.21 percent on Wednesday and 1 basis point below the 7.19 percent reached last Friday. 
 All the gains were made in the morning, after the Japanese and then the Germans cut their short-term interest rates. Some traders said the cuts brought some foreign buyers into the Treasury market.
"Unemployment Friday" is always an uneasy day in the bond market. Bond traders have to guess what the closely watched nonfarm payroll number will be, and, even if they get that right, they must gauge how investors and traders will react to it.
Today's report may be even trickier to assess than usual because it comes at a time when the 30-year bond has rallied to its lowest yield in six and a half years.
With a weak employment report, the price of the long bond could rally the full point needed to push the yield down to a level not seen since the 1970's.
But an unexpectedly strong jump in nonfarm payroll jobs could dash hopes for an immediate further rally.
Such a report could make investors and traders pay more attention to other recent economic data, including the 9.1 percent surge in orders for durable goods in December and the 24.6 percent increase in sales of domestically manufactured vehicles in late January. Those reports show that the economy is growing at a healthy pace and probably a little faster than many had counted on.
Barbara L. Kenworthy, the portfolio manager of taxable fixed-income funds at the Dreyfus Corporation, summed up the uncertainty this way: "I think the market is probably a little overdone, but I think it is going further. Yet I recognize that I am skating on thin ice."
The problem in figuring what might happen is that even if one could know what the data will show, it is impossible to say how the market will react.
For example, if nonfarm payrolls jumped by 180,000 jobs in January, which is a high forecast, then the normal reaction would be for the market to sell off because the faster pace of growth signaled by the report would make investors and traders worry about inflation.
"I am hearing that the market will behave in the conventional way; that the higher the number, the less the market will like it," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities.
"But given the way the market has behaved recently, I am not so sure of that," he added hastily.
What he meant was that traders, investors and speculators have ignored the recent string of data showing the economy picking up some speed. One explanation has been that a stronger pace might lead to the Clinton Administration's reducing the size of its economic stimulus package. A little more growth is preferable to a stimulus plan that could get out of control.
But instead of indicating that, Administration officials said this week that the package would be even larger than some had anticipated, probably totaling $31 billion. But there has been little reaction to this.
When the market is in such a state of denial, when it dismisses data that contradict the direction of prices and yields, it can move to its own beat for some time.
This has been the case recently because of two strong factors supporting higher prices. One is that inflation remains around 3 percent and appears likely to remain low for the near future. Another reason has been the speculation about a cut in the size of the 30-year bond auction, which could help prices by reducing supply while demand remains steady. On Wednesday, the Treasury not only announced a $1 billion cut in the size of the 30-year bond auction next week but also a $500 million reduction in the size of the 10-year auction.
But if this focus is broken, the direction of the market could change quickly.
On the other hand, if the jobs number is weak -- there are forecasts as low as 50,000 to 80,000 new nonfarm jobs -- then the market should rally. The report would say that the economy is not moving fast enough to reverse the growing positive expectations about inflation.
But that is also in doubt, according to Ms. Kenworthy. "If the number is mildly weak, people will say that is O.K.," she said. "But if it is veryweak, the market could give back some ground. People will say, 'Whoops, Clinton is going to increase the size of the stimulus package.' "
 
Treasury Market
 The 10-year note and the 30-year bond received support from the cut in the auction size announced by the Treasury on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Politicians Ride the Rails In Annual Campaign Rite

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Cary Edwards was only up to the fourth car of the 18-car train when he ran into a woman wearing a lapel sticker that said, "Hire Me -- I'm Legal."
Mr. Edwards, who is nothing if not quick on his feet, said, "Make sure you have a green card; I'm checking." 
 With that, Mr. Edwards, who is running for the Republican nomination for Governor and who is having trouble because he employed an undocumented Portuguese woman as a housekeeper, sailed on down the rocking train aisle to shake yet another hand and buss yet another cheek. He had 14 cars to go.
His Republican rival for the nomination, Christine Todd Whitman, who was going the other way on the train, and who has had illegal immigrant problems of her own, stopped for an interview with a television reporter.
 
'A Good Place to Mix'
 "The major issue is the economy," she said, "and this train trip, with all the economic leaders of the state on board, is a good place to mix and mingle and do some serious business as well."
So it would seem. At least 1,400 people, lawyers and lobbyists, the press and publicists, office holders and hopefuls, almost all of them movers and shakers, paid $325 for the crowded, jostling four-hour train ride today from Trenton to Washington for the 55-year-old political ritual called, simply, "The Chamber Trip."
"This," observed a woman making her way, rush-hour subway style, through several of the highly active club cars on the train, "gives new meaning to the phrase 'press the flesh.' "
This year was particularly popular, what with all 120 members of the New Jersey Legislature, not to mention the Governor, up for election, with the new man in the White House expected at the dinner that was the ostensible goal of the two-day excursion, and with all three candidates for Governor on board.
 
Peculiar to New Jersey
 Gov. Jim Florio, along with both Republican leaders of the Legislature, Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco and Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, held court along with New Jersey Chamber of Commerce brass in a V.I.P. coach near the end of the train.
Everybody else tramped the cars end to end, endlessly, shaking hands, mending fences, winning friends and influencing people in a ceaseless march that some have dubbed the March to Washington.
The trip is a political rite peculiar to New Jersey, and once, when campaigns were shorter, the traditional opening of the political season.
"It's toned down a lot since the days when it was basically an all-male smoker," said Alan Karcher, a legislator who has made the trip -- invoking Sinclair Lewis, he once nicknamed it the Babbitt Special -- since the late 60's. (Women were first allowed in 1968.) "Guys used to bring flasks and stumble off the train."
 
Edwards Sponsors 2 Cars
 It's staider now but still important. "I've got 50 staff people on this train," said Mr. Edwards, who sponsored two cars himself. 'You can't travel around the state for a year and see this many people that are important politically."
Governor Florio, who had originally plan to skip the trip this year, changed his mind a week or so ago, but said the change of heart had nothing to do with a recent break in his bleak poll ratings, and the concurrent troubles both his rivals have encountered over the illegal hiring issue. "I have gone on this trip for 26 years," the Governor said. "It's obviously a major social event."
 
'Your House Is in Order'RXx
 In a 10-minute speech before the dinner crowd at the Sheraton Washington, President Clinton spoke of tough decisions that he, the Congress and the nation face on the economy and other matters. He ended with a series of political plugs for Mr. Florio.
"Not so long ago you elected a Governor who had to make some of those decisions," Mr. Clinton said to sparse applause. "For all the pain suffered by Governor Florio and the Legislature, the truth is: your house is in order now. I hope you are proud of him, because I am."
The Chamber of Commerce inaugurated the train ride to Washington and Congressional Dinner in 1937 as a way for lobbyists and business people to meet the Congressional delegation, and each other. It has evolved into a political event, although the meeting, greeting and influencing has not been cast aside.
Slow economic times have curbed participations a bit in recent years, but William F. Faherty Jr., president of the state Chamber, said this year was a sellout. "I could have sold a thousand more tickets if we could have gotten the cars," he said. 'Everybody wanted to come."

HEADLINE: High-Tech Policy Major, With a Minor in Trade

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 4

 BODY:
When President Clinton announced the appointment of a supercomputer industry veteran, John A. Rollwagen, as Deputy Secretary of Commerce last Friday, the move alarmed at least one group: the Japanese. The news media in Japan immediately seized on the appointment as fresh evidence of the new Administration's hard-line stance on trade issues.
As chief executive of Cray Research Inc., the dominant producer of supercomputers, Mr. Rollwagen has spent several years jousting with the Japanese Government and with computer executives and the news media in Japan, as he has put pressure on that country to open its federal markets to his company's machines. 
 Now, after 19 years at Cray Research, the last three as chairman, Mr. Rollwagen is shifting from selling supercomputers to becoming a Government policy maker on technology and trade issues. His new role is emblematic of the desire of the new Administration to sharpen its focus on the relationship among the United States' trade policy, advanced technology development and economic competitiveness -- a stance also evident in the President's appointment of Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a high-tech policy expert, to lead the Council of Economic Advisers.
 
Girding for the Battle
 Perhaps the clearest sign of Mr. Rollwagen's intentions in his new job came in a letter to employees announcing his resignation from Cray Research. "Whether we like it or not," he said, "our country is in an economic war."
The appointment has been greeted particularly warmly in Silicon Valley, where there has long been concern that the Government has been ineffective at supporting embattled high-technology companies facing foreign competitors.
"I couldn't have been more pleased that the Administration has reached out and selected a high-technology C.E.O.," said John Sculley, chairman of Apple Computer Inc., where Mr. Rollwagen has been a member of the board. "The Clinton Administration is going to take a different tack on global trade than we've seen in previous administrations," Mr. Sculley said, "and John Rollwagen has the practical experience required."
International trade may turn out to be the most manageable of Mr. Rollwagen's challenges in his new role as the high-tech visionary at the Commerce Department. Transforming the agency into the "technology powerhouse" that the Clinton campaign envisioned in order to build a national system of high-speed computer networks and nurturing commercial technology development will require deft leadership from Mr. Rollwagen, a business outsider who must overcome long-entrenched and powerful Washington interests.
The problems plaguing the Commerce Department today, Clinton officials say, are not only ossified management and a bureaucratic culture, but also the scattered mission of the agency, which does everything from taking the census to predicting the weather.
Although the department's diverse missions will remain, technology is almost certain to acquire greater importance. Mr. Clinton and Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown have both said that they intend to direct the Administration's technology policy from the Commerce Department, and that in the future the agency will become more of a player in setting the Government's agenda.
 
Toes May Be Stepped On
 The Clinton Administration is still sorting conflicting advice on what to do with the department, which until now has been viewed as a bureaucratic backwater. Some of Mr. Clinton's backers argue that the Commerce Department is the ideal place to forge a new industrial policy by creating a superagency that would include the department's National Institute of Standards and Technology, or N.I.S.T., and might absorb the Defense Advanced Projects Agency, some of the Energy Department's national laboratories and even the Patent and Trademark Office.
But such a transformation would require stepping on powerful toes and the consensus is that Mr. Rollwagen will initially have to work with a much more modest set of resources.
High-tech executives have been discussing a variety of possible near-term projects that they think could pay dividends for the economy and that the industry would support. These are among them:
*Pushing through administrative proposals to free new portions of the radio spectrum for innovative applications that might create new industries.
*Expanding the existing programs of the N.I.S.T., like the industrial extension services that have been set up to help small businesses, and the advanced technology development grant program.
*Moving the department's National Telecommunications and Information Agency directly under the office of the Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology as a way of to solidify the Administration's push to create a national high-technology information system. In the past, this agency has seldom had a measurable impact on policy, usually taking a back seat to the independent Federal Communications Commission.
Conventional wisdom is that there will be a natural working relationship between Mr. Rollwagen and his new boss, in which Mr. Rollwagen will act as the planner and technology visionary and Mr. Brown will be the implementor. This would be a break with the past, since the deputy position has traditionally been filled by someone with administrative and political experience in the Government.
Mr. Brown, however, is viewed as the consummate Washington insider, while Mr. Rollwagen is more policy-oriented -- a cerebral man must now buy several suits simply to have an adequate wardrobe for his new job. Whether a role reversal occurs, and creates friction between Mr. Brown and Mr. Rollwagen, remains to be seen.
 
Private Industry's Role
 A more substantive challenge for both men will be finessing the ideological debate in Washington over what role the Government should play in assisting industry. Mr. Rollwagen is clearly an activist on this matter, but industrial policy is likely to be a contentious issue under the Clinton Administration.
Moreover, government spending to subsidize technology development is likely to have little effect without significant internal changes at the nation's technology companies, academic researchers say.
"One of the overwhelming messages is that private business strategy has to be the basis for technology development," said Joe Morone, a professor of management at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and author of a recently published study, "Competing in High-Tech Markets."
"We can complain all we want about closed Japanese markets," he said, "but if they open their markets and we have products that are inferior, it's not going to us much good."
Cray Research is currently challenging the Japanese Government over its award of a supercomputer contract to the NEC Corporation of Japan. Cray maintains that its machine is better and is demanding that it be able to test the Japanese computer to see if it lives up to NEC's performance claims. The Japanese are expected to rule on Cray's demand by the middle of next month.
 
A Charge of Favoritism
 Back home, meanwhile, most high- technology leaders are enthusiastic about Mr. Rollwagen's new role at the Commerce Department. But some are not.
In the turbulent supercomputer industry, for example, such competitors as the Thinking Machines Corporation and the Intel Corporation believe that Cray Research has been singled out for special treatment by the Government. They say that while Cray has lagged behind them in developing the new massively parallel supercomputer technology that represents the industry's state of the art, the company has been coddled.
The Bush Administration had pressed the Japanese to open their market to Cray supercomputers, and the Energy Department financed a project late last year involving Cray and several of the national laboratories to develop massively parallel computer software.
"This nation has to decide whether it wants to support a national supercomputer company," complained a top executive at one of Cray Research's competitors.
Those protests notwithstanding, Mr. Rollwagen's appointment has done a great deal to set the tone for a strong relationship between business and the new Democratic Administration.

HEADLINE: Hospitals and Bills

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 4

 BODY:
When New York State began regulating hospital rates in 1983, a mainstay of the system was the hospitals' ability to charge more for some patients to help keep down costs for others.
The extra charges were meant to advance the state's goal of helping nonprofit insurers like the Blue Cross plans, which did not have to pay the surcharges, compete more evenly with profit-making insurance companies, which were required to pay them. They were also used as a way to channel more money into the state's ailing hospitals, already staggering under the weight of increased health costs. 
 But on Wednesday, Judge Louis J. Freeh of Federal District Court in Manhattan struck down a large part of New York's payment system, saying the hospitals could no longer impose the extra charges. The ruling, which the state plans to appeal, deprives the hospitals of $160 million a year, makes the position of the ailing Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield even more precarious, and, most significant, threatens to dismantle New York's complicated and fragile hospital financing system.
 
'An Imperfect System'
 "It's been an imperfect system that's been patched together with Band-Aids and other temporary solutions," said David P. Rosen, president of Jamaica Hospital, which would lose $1 million a year if the ruling is upheld. "This literally takes the entire reimbursement system and trashes it."
The case was brought by a coalition of commercial insurance companies, which argued that the extra charges -- 24 percent for commercial insurers and 9 percent for health maintenance organizations -- unfairly penalized their customers.
New York State countered that the hospitals should be allowed to continue charging commercial insurers more than they charge nonprofit insurers like Empire Blue Cross or the state through its Medicaid program. Because of the nonprofit insurers' special mission to accept any applicant who applies and to set rates without regard to age or risk of illness, the state argued, they are entitled to pay less.
But Judge Freeh agreed with the commercial companies, holding that the extra charges violated the Federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known commonly as Erisa, because they were using employees' money for purposes that had never been intended -- in this case, to keep costs down for others. Under the law, employee contributions to benefit funds can be used only for the "sole and exclusive" benefit of workers and their families.
 
Another Blow to Empire
 The decision is another blow to Empire, New York's largest insurer, which has depended on the state's system. Without the handicap of paying higher hospital bills, officials say, commercial insurance companies may be able to lower their insurance rates and woo customers away from Empire.
It also hurts the state's hospitals, which lost $397.4 million in 1991 and would lose $496 million more if Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning April 1 were to take effect. "What this does is attack the fundamental social philosophy underlying the hospital reimbursement system, where you give Blue Cross and Medicaid a break and cap the amount the commercial insurers would pay," said Jeannie H. Cross, a spokeswoman for the Hospital Association of New York.
Last year, New Jersey's system of paying for indigent health care through extra charges on other patients' hospital bills was declared illegal on similar grounds, and the state had to scramble for alternatives. It ended up completely reorganizing its entire system within a few months by deregulating hospital rates, charging new health-care taxes and raiding its own unemployment insurance fund to pay for indigent care.
The two cases have sent a shudder through hospitals and state health agencies in New York State, which are anxiously awaiting the results of another case pending in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. In that case, a group of trade unions has challenged yet another hospital bill surcharge, a 5.6 percent extra payment tacked on to all hospital bills that is used to collect $1.1 billion a year for indigent care.
 
Other Possibilities
 Should that system be struck down as well, state officials say, they do not know what alternative they have. Most possibilities -- deregulating hospital fees, charging new broad-based taxes or denying health care to some 2 million people who are too poor to pay for health insurance but not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid -- are decidedly unattractive.
"Right now the plan is to appeal and win," said Paula Wilson, executive deputy commissioner of the State Health Department. "There's no plan beyond that to discuss at this point."
In the absence of other viable plans, state officials are praying that either they will be able to wrest a waiver from the Federal Government of the Erisa requirements, or that the Erisa law will be revised, or that the Clinton Administration will enact some sort of universal health-care proposal.
"The Federal law which pre-empts state level actions is hampering the ability of states to achieve health care reform," said Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly Committee on Health, speaking of Erisa. "It is important that Congress quickly re-examine the Federal pre-emption of state law under Erisa."

HEADLINE: For Neediest Cases Fund, Late Is Better Than Never

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
The end of the 81st annual appeal of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund is fast approaching, prompting a flurry of last-minute check writing by contributors who sheepishly admitted that they had procrastinated their way through the last few months.
In a letter with her $25 donation, Dorothy Sluter of Hillsdale, N.J., referred to an unofficial motto of the fund. " 'To delay may mean to forget,' and that is exactly what happened in my case," she wrote. "I have belatedly found the enclosed check, which I meant to send before New Year's. Still, better late than never!" 
 Stuart and Penny Lachs of Brewster, N.Y., expressed similar sentiments. "As you note every day, 'To delay may mean to forget,' " they wrote in a letter with their $125 contribution. "This year we resolved not to forget."
Raymond and Betty Kaplar mailed their $50 check and a note apologizing for their tardiness all the way from Jerusalem. And Adam L. Berger, who gave $36, said he was so immersed in his studies that he did not have time to send his donation.
"If you want to know why I'm so late with my check this year, you have Harvard College's outdated exam policy to blame," he wrote, noting that Harvard holds finals after Christmas. "I'm happy to report that I finished my last exam this morning, putting four straight weeks of work behind me."
Mary M. Jones of Manhattan donated $100 and quickly scribbled her letter to the fund. "I apologize for the informality of my note paper and envelope," she wrote. "But I kept putting off sending my contribution until I got organized -- which may be never."
 
Fund Is Down
 This year's Neediest Cases campaign, which ends on Feb. 28, is down about $700,000 when compared with this time last year. The drop comes at a time when the seven charities supported by the fund are struggling to help thousands of people who have lost their jobs because of the recession. All contributions go directly to the charities because The Times pays the fund's expenses.
C. W. Reiquam of Lakewood, Colo., sent $100 and said he had "planned to contribute before, but somehow it slipped by." Kathleen L. Jerome, who gave $100, wrote that she was "running a bit late this year -- but better late than never."
And Myrna V. Lewis of Rockland County, N.Y., gave $50.
"I almost didn't do it this year," she wrote. "There have been so many other needs. But I couldn't miss even once."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed After Japan And Germany Lower Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed against other major currencies yesterday, posting moderate gains against the German mark after the Bundesbank moved to cut key interest rates.
The dollar gained marginally on the yen after the Bank of Japan cut its discount rate. But the move "had been so widely anticipated that it had little effect on currency markets," said Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at the Bank Leumi Trust Company. In New York, the dollar settled at 124.65 yen, up from 124.375 yen on Wednesday. 
 Gold prices declined worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $329.00 a troy ounce, off 30 cents from Wednesday. The Republic National Bank said gold lost 15 cents to a late bid price of $328.35.
European markets saw high-volume trading after the Bundesbank, the German central bank, announced it would cut the discount and Lombard rates. The dollar advanced strongly on the move, which came unexpectedly and was aimed at stabilizing European currencies.
Hectic activity brought major corporate players into the market, analysts said, but trading cooled and the dollar pulled off against the mark with heavy profit taking when trading shifted to domestic markets.
"The German easing was not as pronounced as one might have expected," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis.
Traders said the dollar had been driven higher in recent weeks on anticipation of a German rate cut, and that after the Bundesbank announcement, attention quickly turned to the United States economy, including today's unemployment figures, the prospects for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve and the disclosure of President Clinton's economic policy package scheduled for later this month.
"The market has to deal with the fact that one of the things that had been keeping it going has happened," Mr. Waxman said. "We will need a very strong sign on employment to keep the rally going."
In London, the British pound rose to $1.4445, from $1.4350 late Wednesday. In New York, it cost $1.4405 to buy one pound, compared with Wednesday's $1.4340.
Other late dollar rates in New York included: 1.6565 German marks, up from 1.6450; 1.5325 Swiss francs, up from 1.5255; 5.600 French francs, up from 5.5750; 1,536.00 Italian lire, down from 1,537.50, and 1.26295 Canadian dollars, down from 1.26655.

Identity Crisis in Chicago
CHICAGO, Feb. 2 -- This is a particularly fecund moment for the nexus between America's first and second theater cities. "The Goodbye Girl," Neil Simon's Broadway-bound musical, closed up shop last weekend after six weeks at the Shubert Theater here -- the city's first pre-Broadway tryout in three decades. And "The Song of Jacob Zulu," the Steppenwolf Theater Company's play about apartheid, featuring the music of Ladysmith Black Mambazo, is also on its way to New York. On Saturday, it opened a two-week reprise engagement of a production that had its world premiere last year. 
 In addition, "Wings," the musical adaptation of Arthur Kopit's play about a recovering stroke patient, which was a recent hit at the Goodman Theater here, opens at the Joseph Papp Public Theater on March 9.
"Wings" was the first show directed by Michael Maggio since a double lung transplant in 1991 released him from a lifelong enslavement to cystic fibrosis and an imminent death. Mr. Maggio, who is 41 and is to direct the show in New York, purposely chose this project for his return. "Not to get too Shirley MacLaine about it, but what I've gone through has certainly heightened my sense of the spirit," he said. "And transcendence is very much at work in this musical."
The Remains Theater, which is a likely Chicago stop for David Mamet's "Oleanna" and Larry Kramer's "Destiny of Me," is now presenting "Snakebit," a new play by David Marshall Grant, which was being scouted last weekend by Nicholas Martin, associate artistic director of Playwrights Horizons. The play, about a gay man whose last female lover was his best friend's wife, was directed by Campbell Scott, who recently appeared in "On the Bum" at Playwrights, as did one of the actors, John Benjamin Hickey.
A leader in the regional theater boom, Chicago has a substantial history of launching productions toward New York, of course, and its theater professionals have long relished its place outside the media glare that attends Broadway, an atmosphere that has nurtured ensemble groups and placed an emphasis on theater art rather than theater economics.
"Chicago actors get in a room and don't worry about money, about agents, about how this role will affect their next gig," said Larry Sloan, the artistic director of Remains, who was once an associate at Lincoln Center Theater. "In New York, there's always pressure to make each role part of a career. I once worked with an actor in New York who wouldn't wear a fat suit. That would never happen in Chicago."
Still, after a decade in which the native playwright David Mamet and several members of the once-renegade Steppenwolf company "allowed us," in the words of Mr. Maggio, "to step up into the national theater," Chicago finds itself in a bit of an identity crisis.
"I'm a big Chicago booster," said Roche Schulfer, the Goodman's producing director, "but there's a little bit of second-city syndrome. You've got to make it in New York to prove your chops."
There are generational growing pains. Companies like Steppenwolf, now in its 17th season, and Remains, in its 14th, have moved into newer, roomier quarters and consequently up to bigger budgets and bigger fund-raising headaches.
"We moved into this place for a song," said Mr. Sloan of Remains's three-year-old home on the second floor of a weird, sparsely patronized, vaguely new-age mall. "But that song has become a whole CD of expenses."
As attendance has increased and subscription lists have grown, these groups have faced the responsibility of pleasing their patrons. At the same time, in the Chicago tradition, smaller companies have arisen to take their place as the new kids on the artistic fringe. ("Like everybody who graduates from college in Chicago, they formed a theater company," Mr. Maggio said of the four-year-old Looking Glass Theater.)
"We've had to evolve," said Randall Arney, a founding member of Steppenwolf and now its artistic director. He added that he was in touch monthly with the other 22 members of the acting troupe, which includes John Malkovich, Gary Sinise and Laurie Metcalf. Steppenwolf's $8.28 million theater is two years old, and fund raising for it goes on.
"We still work hard to maintain a mom-and-pop organization," Mr. Arney said. "But during the 80's, we were able to build a superstructure to protect this artistic bubble." The company's next production, Arthur Kopit's "Road to Nirvana" -- a flop at the Circle Repertory in New York two years ago, which Steppenwolf is reviving, Mr. Arney said, simply because the company likes it -- is a vicious, profane Hollywood sendup. Indeed, it is something of a risk for a group whose subscription list has grown to 18,000 from 13,000 in three years.
"There'll be a lot of our original subscribers who'll love it," Mr. Arney said. "They'll say, 'Thank God,' you know?"
Overall, the Chicago theater teeters between the provincial and the national. This is clear from a scan of current productions. On the one hand, there is an evident commitment to plays about blacks and contemporary black issues that New York, at the moment, cannot match. Two plays are now up: August Wilson's "Two Trains Running," which closed on Broadway in August, at the Goodman, and "The Song of Jacob Zulu," which was written by a white man, Tug Yourgrau, but is given authenticity by Mambazo and a fierce performance by the South African actor Zakes Mokae. And previews begin on Friday of Cheryl West's "Pudd'n and Pete," a contemporary love story about the struggling new marriage of two middle-aged black people, a janitor and a secretary.
On the other hand, with "The Destiny of Me" and Paul Rudnick's "Jeffrey" -- plays that plumb the problems of living with AIDS and not just confronting it -- running in New York, the two new AIDS plays here seem a tad behind the curve. Both "Snakebit" and Steven Dietz's "Lonely Planet," at the Northlight Theater in Evanston, are grounded in lamentation that the plague is evil and unfair -- a verity to be sure, but by this point a worn dramatic artifice. And they share an almost identical climactic scene in which a character calls to find out test results, an unfortunate coincidence and, one would think, an avoidable one if the theater community here is as tightly knit as everyone says.
 
'Goodbye Girl' in Progress
 "The Goodbye Girl" closed here on Saturday night with an acknowledgement from both performers and critics that the six-week tryout was a success. That is, the show that left is much better than the one that arrived. Two nights earlier, the show introduced a new opening number, its fourth, a duet between Paula, the title character, played by Bernadette Peters, and her 10-year-old daughter, Lucy (Tammy Minoff). An exuberant song about their hoped-for move to California from New York City, it's meant to help Paula lighten up; in the first act, she has been perceived as a drip. In addition, the expository book sections at the beginning have been nearly eliminated, so the show now opens like a musical: with music.
"As a result, the rest of the act played better," the director, Michael Kidd, said before rehearsal the next morning. "The audience is happier. You could tell that right away."
Mr. Kidd is, of course, the replacement for Gene Saks, who was dismissed amid much hoopla in early January. Mr. Kidd would not comment on what he'd changed, but the producer, Emanuel Azenberg, said that Mr. Kidd's strength was in staging musical numbers and that the show is about 25 percent changed since Mr. Kidd's arrival.
Several cast members, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Saks's dismissal was necessary, although none really blamed him.
"We'd reached a plateau, and it was clear we weren't rising any higher," one person said, echoing a consensus, although one dissenter said Mr. Saks "was just a scapegoat."
(Actually, given the economics of a big musical, it was a success that the show opened here at all. An unusual labor agreement with the local stagehands' union pared the number of members the union generally requires on a show's payroll. That, and concessions from performers -- Ms. Peters and her co-star, Martin Short, worked for $1,000 a week, a fraction of what they'll receive in New York -- saved $1.5 million, Mr. Azenberg said.)
The show, scheduled to open at the Marquis Theater in New York on March 4, is now back in rehearsals, still with "a lot of work to do," in the words of Neil Simon. In any case, to judge from a morning photo session last Friday, little tension remains from the earlier brouhaha. As the cast posed for the camera, there was much horseplay, led mostly by Mr. Short, who at one point, with his arm around Ms. Peters, tweaked a potentially rumor-mongering observer by calling out, "You know we're having an affair, don't you?"


GRAPHIC: The monologuist David Cale is to perform his latest show, "Deep in a Dream of You," at the Joseph Papp Public Theater throughout April. The show, which was commissioned by the Goodman Theater in Chicago and performed there last year, is to be presented at the Public in repertory with "Memory Tricks," a one-character play written and performed by Marga Gomez.

Behind the Scenes With Bush and Gorbachev

At the Highest Levels
The Inside Story of the End of the Cold War
By Michael R. Beschloss and Strobe Talbott
498 pages. Little, Brown & Company. $24.95
During the years 1989 through 1991, history leaped into fast forward as events overtook expectations and the cold war came sliding to a dramatic end. In these three short years, there came in mind-boggling succession the liberation of Eastern Europe, the reunification of Germany, the disbanding of the Warsaw Pact, the Persian Gulf war, the collapse of a hard-line Soviet coup and the formal dissolution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 
 These events, of course, are familiar to anyone who reads the papers or follows the news on television. Now, however, the historian Michael R. Beschloss and Strobe Talbott, the Clinton Administration's new ambassador at large in charge of dealing with the former Soviet Union, have filled in the details of this historical outline, providing the reader with an intimate and utterly absorbing behind-the-scenes account of the negotiations between George Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev that helped shape these momentous events.
The authors say that early in their research they "quietly asked a large number of American and Soviet officials if they would speak with us on a regular basis about what was happening within and between their two Governments," and that they obtained the cooperation of these officials "on the condition that we not identify them as sources." Although this approach leaves the reader wondering exactly how the blow-by-blow accounts of secret meetings and conversations were reconstructed and verified, it also makes for a highly fluent narrative with the heft and density of history and the emotional resonance of fiction. Former Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the former Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, one suspects, are two frequent unidentified sources.
Clearly the background of the two authors makes them particularly well-suited to the job they've undertaken in this volume: Mr. Beschloss is the author of a critically acclaimed study of the tension-filled relationship that developed between President John F. Kennedy and Nikita S. Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, during the early 1960's ("The Crisis Years: Kennedy and Khrushchev, 1960-1963"); and Mr. Talbott, in addition to writing several volumes on arms control, wrote a book with Michael Mandelbaum about Mr. Gorbachev and President Ronald Reagan ("Reagan and Gorbachev").
As in these earlier books, Mr. Beschloss and Mr. Talbott look at the events leading to the end of the cold war through the prism of personality, turning what might have been a dry, chronological account into an almost novelistic story of two leaders and the political chess games they played with each other and with their own advisers and adversaries at home.
The result is a remarkably readable book that gives the general reader an appreciation of the role personal leadership (or the lack of it) can play in the making of history, as well as a good basic lesson in complicated processes of diplomacy: how domestic agendas and difficulties can shape and inhibit foreign policy, how foreign policy decisions can impinge upon domestic concerns; how public declarations can belie understandings reached in private.
Mr. Talbott and Mr. Beschloss reveal that in December 1987, Vice President Bush told Mr. Gorbachev that President Reagan was surrounded by "marginal intellectual thugs," who would jump on any evidence that he, the Vice President, was a closet liberal. Therefore, he would have to do and say certain things to get elected during the 1988 campaign, things Mr. Gorbachev should ignore.
It was a remark that Mr. Gorbachev would have to take comfort from during the long "pause" in Soviet-American relations that Mr. Bush took during the opening months of his Administration despite the urgings of Margaret Thatcher and others to capitalize on the opportunities made possible by the new Soviet openness.
By the end of 1989, Mr. Beschloss and Mr. Talbott report, all this had begun to change. The revolution in Eastern Europe, along with a friendly summit in Malta and pressure from the American public and Western allies for serious engagement with the Soviet Union, had combined to plant the seeds for an intensely personal partnership between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev, a development that at once reflected the American President's penchant for personal diplomacy and suited the Soviet leader's taste for high-risk showmanship.
Although Mr. Bush had been warned from the start that it was dangerous to support Gorbachev the man, rather than the new Soviet policy of openness, the authors of "At the Highest Levels" report that the White House consistently ignored advice from the C.I.A. to diversify support for democratic reformers in the Soviet Union. In 1989, Mr. Talbott and Mr. Beschloss say, the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, fell asleep during a meeting with Boris N. Yeltsin, the Russian President, who had been hustled into the White House through a side door. As late as April 1991, they add, Mr. Bush was still reluctant to issue a formal invitation to Mr. Yeltsin, worried that such a move might alienate his old friend Mr. Gorbachev.
As depicted in this book, the Bush Administration's decision to put all its eggs in Mr. Gorbachev's basket had an assortment of serious consequences. It contributed to Mr. Bush's longstanding reticence on the subject of Baltic independence. It contributed to the White House's willingness to discount repeated warnings (from the C.I.A. and former President Richard M. Nixon, among others) about a possible Soviet coup. And according to Mr. Beschloss and Mr. Talbott, it contributed to the eventual downfall of Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Bush themselves.
"Gorbachev came to believe," they write, "that it was more important for him to cultivate his relationship with Bush and his fellow Western leaders than to reach an accommodation with Boris Yeltsin and other champions of democratization, decentralization and free market economics.
"Bush was so intent on shoring up Gorbachev that he was slow to perceive that by the summer of 1991, the Soviet leader was largely a spent force. Bush created the impression that he cared more about his friend in the Kremlin than about the principles of freedom and independence. His ties to Gorbachev -- and his reluctance to support Yeltsin -- ultimately became a liability in Bush's campaign for re-election."
Such assessments are rare in "At the Highest Levels," which for the most part eschews interpretation for straightforward reporting. Although the portraits of Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Bush that emerge from this volume are hardly new, they have been judiciously and powerfully amplified. President Bush comes across as a prudent, cautious man, fearful of making "the wrong mistakes," a man whose main contribution to ending the cold war was coaxing the Soviet Union toward surrender by, in the authors' words, "exercising restraint and refraining from pushing" too hard.
Mr. Gorbachev, in the end, emerges as a far more tragic figure, a forceful and charismatic man who spent his first four years in power unleashing a revolution that would change the world and who ended up "being a baffled witness of its consequences."

HEADLINE: Press Harder on Deficit Reduction

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is headed in the right direction with two of its major plans for reducing the Federal budget deficit -- a sharp cut in defense spending and a reduction in the cost of Social Security. But the Administration can't afford to flinch as it confronts two of the nation's most powerful interest groups, the military and the elderly.
Secretary of Defense Les Aspin's proposals to cut the military budget are fine as far as they go, but they don't go far enough. As Senator Everett Dirksen once observed in another context, a billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking about real money. Mr. Clinton needs to add some more real money to Mr. Aspin's unnecessarily modest proposals. 
 The Administration is also on the right track in debating ways to control the costs of Social Security. No deficit-reduction package will sell politically unless it distributes the pain widely and fairly, and the elderly must be part of that calculus. The only real choice is how to do it -- between a proposal that would hurt the poor and a far better strategy that would ask the wealthy to bear the burden.
Secretary Aspin has asked the Pentagon to cut the 1994 defense budget to $269 billion, $11 billion lower than the Bush Administration was proposing. He and Congress can surely find an additional $6 billion or so in unneeded spending on items like those below. That may not seem like much, at least by Pentagon standards, but it could add up to many billions more in later years.
What counts is not just the amount to be cut, but the way he cuts it. Reducing training and exercises provides only a one-year savings. Reducing current forces yields little immediate saving but saves billions over time. Cutbacks in new weapons yield both current savings and future dividends -- eliminating the costs of manufacture and of manning and maintenance for years to come.
There are plenty of candidates for trimming. The Navy does not need the new carrier it is building. Halting construction now would save nearly $3.8 billion in 1995, and billions more in future years. The Navy can also reduce procurement of guided missile destroyers from three per year to two. And the armed services want many more new tactical aircraft than they need or can afford.
Since the nuclear threat has disappeared, a number of strategic arms can be retired immediately, like Minuteman III missiles, half the B-52's and 8 of the 18 nuclear-armed subs. Nuclear warhead production can also be cut back.
In reducing personnel, Mr. Aspin has directed that cuts come from active duty forces. That's not enough. He also needs to cut the reserves, even if members of Congress object to losing local pork.
There are limits to what cuts in personnel can be realized in the coming year without unduly damaging morale. But the Administration must plan now for much deeper cuts in coming years to give the armed services time to adjust and allow those who have served their country honorably time to prepare for civilian jobs.
President Clinton will probably have to squeeze Social Security as part of a deficit-reduction package that spreads the pain across America. But he doesn't have to clobber the elderly poor by temporarily suspending cost-of-living increases in benefits, known as COLA's. A fairer way is to raise taxes on benefits to wealthier retirees.
Politically, it might seem foolish to threaten any of the nation's 30 million elderly recipients. The fact that Mr. Clinton might try testifies to the depth of his budget problem.
After paying for new programs he promised voters, the President must reach, by 1997, about $150 billion a year in spending cuts and tax increases to meet his pledge to slice the deficit nearly in half. Social Security -- 25 percent of Federal outlays -- looms as a likely target.
Eliminating COLA's for a year would produce huge savings by lowering the base on which future increases are calculated: about $38 billion over five years. But the consequences will be severe. The elderly rely on COLA's to keep their benefits even with inflation. A one-year suspension would push a half-million elderly into poverty.
There's another, so far overlooked, reason to keep Social Security COLA's intact. The Clinton deficit-reduction plan could include higher excise taxes on cigarettes and alcohol and higher energy taxes. With COLA's in place, the elderly poor will be immunized from price hikes. But without COLA's, the poor would face smaller monthly checks and higher heating and transportation bills. That would be an unconscionable double whammy.
That's why taxing benefits would make better policy. Social Security benefits would be taxed more like private pensions. The percentage of benefits subject to income tax would be raised from 50 percent, under current law, to 85 percent. To protect the poor, the tax hike would not apply to couples with annual incomes under $32,000 a year, or individuals with incomes under $25,000.
Raising taxes on benefits would save Washington less, about $30 billion over five years. But the tax hike would be fairer. Current retirees get back from Social Security much more than they paid -- including interest on those contributions. There is no justification for exempting well-to-do families from paying taxes on the difference.
If Mr. Clinton stands up and takes on the nation's retirees, one of Washington's most ferocious lobbies, he will deliver a resounding message that he's serious about the deficit. If he shrinks back, he will signal another year of budget games. Taking a fourth of the Federal budget off the budget-cutting table would force Congress to take impossibly large swipes at everything that remains.

HEADLINE: JUDGE WITHDRAWS FROM CLINTON LIST FOR JUSTICE POST

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Judge Kimba M. Wood withdrew today from consideration for Attorney General after the White House learned she had employed an illegal immigrant as a baby sitter before it became illegal to do so.
That stunning setback left President Clinton scrambling for the third time to fill the post. 
 There was no evidence that Judge Wood, who sits on the Federal District Court in New York, did anything illegal, but White House officials said they told her to withdraw because they feared the kind of public outcry that struck down the Administration's first choice for Attorney General, Zoe Baird, who had employed two illegal aliens for household work.
 
A Blank List
 White House officials said they were angry at Judge Wood because she had not told Mr. Clinton and other officials about her baby sitter, even when she had been directly asked. In her statement, however, Judge Wood said she had not misled the White House.
After the hasty search for a first nominee, then the rush to replace Ms. Baird, the Clinton Administration was forced by Judge Wood's withdrawal to start virtually from the beginning in looking for the nation's top law-enforcement official.
"They have nobody on their list now, period," said a Democratic Senator who is close to the White House. "They've got to start from scratch."
As late as Thursday evening, White House officials confidently said Mr. Clinton planned to announce Judge Wood's selection as soon as background checks were completed. But what the officials viewed as a done deal disintegrated later that night as officials questioned Judge Wood and studied documents she had submitted.
 
Trained to Be Playboy Bunny
 The sudden turnabout on Judge Wood is a blow to Mr. Clinton, who two weeks ago withdrew Ms. Baird's name after she admitted she had hired the illegal immigrants and had knowingly neglected to pay the required taxes for household employees.
Tonight the White House issued a statement on behalf of Mr. Clinton. "I understand and respect Judge Wood's decision not to proceed further with the possibility of being nominated as Attorney General," it said. "I was greatly impressed with her as a lawyer, a judge and a person. I respect her legal talents, judicial record and integrity. I wish her well."
The White House officials said they had also recently discovered that Judge Wood had briefly trained as a Playboy bunny years ago when she was a student in London and that they feared that that might become the source of jokes.
In the statement issued by her lawyer's office in New York, Judge Wood did not cite her stint as a Playboy trainee but said the issue was her hiring of an illegal immigrant from Trinidad, who worked for her for seven years. Judge Wood said she did not act illegally because her baby sitter was hired in March 1986, several months before the enactment of a Federal law making hiring of illegal aliens unlawful. The baby sitter obtained legal residency in December 1987, she said.
"On Jan. 29, I met with the President at the White House to discuss the possibility of my appointment," she wrote. "In the course of a wide-ranging discussion of policy issues, I was asked if I had a 'Zoe Baird' problem. I said I did not. And I do not."
Judge Wood went on to say: "I have fulfilled every legal requirement with respect to the employment of our babysitter. Nevertheless, and after further consultations, I have concluded that in the current political environment, proceeding further with the possibility of my nomination would be inappropriate."
 
Problems With Backups
 Complicating the matter is that the President is not ready to name a substitute candidate. Officials had initially said that if Judge Wood did not pass the background checks they would probably turn to Charles F. C. Ruff, a Washington lawyer and former senior Justice Department official, or former Gov. Gerald L. Baliles of Virginia. But today, they said that questions had been raised about whether Mr. Ruff had employed an illegal alien and that the President was not ready to pick Mr. Baliles.
George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, sought in an interview tonight to play down any implication that the Administration was at fault. He said Judge Wood was asked about the issue of illegal aliens once by the President and twice by Bernard W. Nussbaum, the White House chief counsel.
"The White House search process discovered the problem," Mr. Stephanopoulos said. "Judge Wood was asked about this matter twice before she interviewed with the President and once in her interview with the President. As the process moved forward, the White House did discover it because she delivered financial records that she had hired a baby sitter who was in the country illegally. After this information was discovered, and after consultation with the White House, Judge Wood decided to withdraw."
Asked about the disclosure that she had trained to be a Playboy bunny, Mr. Stephanopoulos said, "I just don't know anything about it."
Officials close to the White House said the trouble developed in part because President Clinton, pressed by his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, insisted on finding a woman for Attorney General, which limited the field of Democratic contenders with a law-enforcement background. The problem with Judge Wood, they said, was that although she is a respected jurist, she lacked the law-enforcement and managerial credentials for the post. So when the disclosures arose, there was no great desire by Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat who is chairman of the Judiciary Commitee, or other influential players to press her case.
 
A Lark in London
 Judge Wood is 49 years old and was appointed to the court by President Ronald Reagan in 1988. She had no experience with criminal cases before her appointment and had never conducted a trial before a jury. But she has earned the respect of other judges and lawyers who have come before her, and the President and Mrs. Clinton are said to have been favorably impressed when each interviewed her last week.
People close to the situation said Mr. Nussbaum contacted Judge Wood on Thursday to tell her that he had heard a rumor that she had put herself through the London School of Economics as a Playboy bunny.
According to people familiar with the conversation, Judge Wood told Mr. Nussbaum that in 1966 she was a student in London and that on a lark she had signed up for the bunny trainee program for the Playboy Club there. She told him she quit after five days, before actually being employed by the club or drawing a paycheck.
Mr. Nussbaum is said to have told Judge Wood that the episode would not disqualify her.
Even after the disclosures were made, officials said, Judge Wood wanted the White House to press ahead, as did some Administration officials. But the White House backed down, they said, after learning that Mr. Biden and others had serious reservations about the nomination.
As early as Thursday night, the White House struggled to contain the political fallout. Hours after some Administration officials told reporters an announcement on Judge Wood would be forthcoming as long as background checks did not turn up anything serious, officials called reporters at home after midnight to urge them to back off the story. At the time, they did not say there were developments that had diminished Judge Wood's prospects.
 
'They Want Squeaky Clean'
 By this morning, White House officials said Judge Wood's selection was in grave doubt, and as the day wore on and rumors flew through the capital it looked increasingly likely that her candidacy might not last the day.
Administration officials said Judge Wood and her husband, Michael Kramer, a political columnist for Time magazine, spent much of the day closeted with Administration officials in the hope of salvaging the nomination.
Officials involved in the background checks said the White House was being far more cautious than in the checks of Ms. Baird. They said officials were not only concerned about finding instances of illegality but anything that could raise any appearance of impropriety. "They want squeaky clean," said one official involved in the process. "They're worried about how all this will play in Peoria."
Another official who was deeply involved in examining Judge Wood's background expressed sympathy for the judge and said: "Under any other circumstances, this would have been totally ignored. But we can't afford the battle right now. It's a perception problem."
Fellow judges who serve with Judge Wood in the Federal Courthouse in lower Manhattan also expressed sympathy for her.
"I'm very, deeply disappointed for her sake," said Judge Thomas P. Griesa. "I think she would have made an outstanding Attorney General. "I'm really disappointed."

HEADLINE: JOBLESS RATE HITS A 25-YEAR RECORD IN NEW YORK CITY

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
The unemployment rate for New York City soared to 13.4 percent in January from 11 percent in December, hitting the highest level in the 25 years that the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics has tracked the city labor market, the bureau reported yesterday.
There were 447,000 people out of work in January, excluding those who had dropped out of the city labor market and were not actively seeking jobs. The number of jobless, which was up from 369,000 in December, was also the highest on record.
 
Seasonal Effect at Work
 The data were not seasonally adjusted, meaning that they were not statistically smoothed out to account for seasonal variations like the hiring of temporary workers by retailers during the December holiday season who are then laid off in January. Because of such practices, the unadjusted rate typically jumps in January, but even so this increase was unusually high. It surpassed the previous unadjusted peak of 12.1 percent reached in July. 
 Nationally, the unemployment rate eased two-tenths of a point in January, to 7.1 percent, and businesses expanded payrolls by 106,000, the Labor Department reported. But the national rate, which was adjusted for seasonal changes, dropped only because the total number of people in the labor force fell, and job growth has yet to rise at anything near the pace of overall economic activity. [Page 47.]
A seasonally adjusted rate for New York City was not available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but economists in the City Comptroller's office calculated one. Even by this measure, the city's unemployment rate was quite high: 12.8 percent, the highest since the office began to calculate it in January 1985.
 
A 'Stalled' Recovery
 "What was an anemic job recovery in New York City has now stalled," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the bureau's regional commissioner.
Noting that rebounds in employment often lag behind recoveries in the output of goods and services, economists pointed out yesterday that they had been predicting the city would lose another 50,000 jobs this year. Still, they said other indicators suggested that the city's economy was in fact expanding, albeit at an anemic pace.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for New York State in January was 8.5 percent, the same as in December. New Jersey's rate fell to 7.4 percent from 8.3 percent, but the bureau said that was mainly because fewer people sought jobs.
January data for Connecticut have yet to be released. But some big Connecticut employers like the Pratt & Whitney jet-engine division of the United Technologies Corporation have announced plans for large layoffs, suggesting that the state's unemployment rate will not decline significantly anytime soon. The rate rose in December to 7.4 percent from 7.3 percent in November.
"As a job machine, the tristate regional economy has yet to come to life," Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
Several economists emphasized that the figures did not necessarily mean that New York City's economy was again contracting. Indeed, they said other indicators -- including wages, initial claims for unemployment insurance, business failures, business requests for telephone connections and stock market activity -- showed that it was still expanding and they expected it to grow by a sluggish 1 or 2 percent this year.
"There are too many positive things going on nationally and locally for the city to sink back into a deep recession," said John Tepper Marlin, the chief economist for the City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman.
The Center for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University's business school said the city economy had been growing since June. "It's not entirely a surprise that unemployment went up in January," said Anirvan Banerji, an economist at the center.
According to the latest figures from the New York State Department of Labor, the city has lost about 370,000 jobs since April 1989, including 114,000 last year. The consensus among economists is that employment in the city in 1993 will remain unchanged, at best.
Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicated that employment among New York City residents fell by 98,000 in January. Typical seasonal factors, for example, layoffs by retailers and by companies with outdoor work like construction or recreation, do not appear to account for all of the job losses, Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
While not all economists agreed with him, he also cited a continuing "restructuring and downsizing" in sectors like manufacturing, banking, advertising and accounting. He said that while retailers in New York and New Jersey had a good holiday season, they appeared to hire fewer temporary workers than usual, and he said Wall Street firms continued to handle their strong level of business without increasing employment.
"For New York State as a whole, 1993 starts out better than 1992," Mr. Ehrenhalt said, "but a job recovery is hardly yet a safe bet, particularly given what is happening in New York City."
The seasonally adjusted number of unemployed residents of New York State was 731,000 in January, up slightly from 726,000 in December. The number of employed rose a scant 19,000, to 7,877,000.
In New Jersey, the number of unemployed dropped to 290,000 in January from 332,000 in December. But the number of employed fell by 36,000, to 3,640,000. In other words, the drop in the unemployment rate reflected the fact that fewer people were looking for work.

HEADLINE: Balkan Mediators Ask U.S. Assent For NATO Planes to Keep Peace

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The international mediators trying to solve the Balkan crisis want the United States to support the use of NATO war planes to enforce provisions of their peace plan for ending the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, arguing that this would reassure Muslims and deter Serbs from further aggression.
The co-chairmen of the United Nations and European Community effort to bring peace to Bosnia, Cyrus R. Vance, a former American Secretary of State, and Lord Owen, a former British Foreign Secretary, also want the United States to provide modern satellite communications for the expanded 25,000-member peacekeeping force that the United Nations will be asked to send to Bosnia if all three factions agree to their proposals, officials close to the negotiations here say. 
 In addition, the two mediators are pressing the United States to take the lead in setting up a new international court to try those accused of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia as well as a special commission to monitor human rights issues.
The mediators hope that provision for enforcement of their peace proposal through air power, coupled with some alterations in their suggested division of territory that would be more favorable to Muslims, would together encourage the Clinton Administration to throw its full weight behind a modified version of their plan.
 
Interest in Washington
 Officials here said Lord Owen has received information from Washington that suggests the policy debate inside the new Administration is moving in his favor, with President Clinton now leaning toward supporting such a modified version of the Vance-Owen plan.
Such a step would mean that the United States would have to tell Bosnia's beleaguered Muslim forces they would not get any outside military help and that they should settle for a negotiated end to the conflict along the lines of the Vance-Owen plan.
So long as the United States is undecided about their proposal, however, the Serbs and the Muslims have little incentive to accept it.
Under the plan, which divides Bosnia and Herzegovina into 10 highly autonomous provinces, the armed ethnic factions are required to disengage and withdraw their artillery and other heavy weapons out of range of their opponents. The weapons would be stored with the United Nations peacekeeping force in areas where they could be monitored.
Mr. Vance and Lord Owen are now suggesting that the United States might strengthen that aspect of their plan by using NATO war planes to enforce the ban on military flights over Bosnia and Herzegovina and, if necessary, to bomb any army that fires its heavy weapons or fails to place them under United Nations monitoring.
Officials said such steps would help to reassure the Muslim side, which has fewer artillery and big mortar pieces than the Serbs. The enforcement operation would be organized by NATO's existing air command but would be under the control of the commander of the United Nations peacekeeping force.
Mr. Vance and Lord Owen, the officials said, also hope to negotiate changes in their plan for dividing the country into ethnically mixed provinces that would take more territory from the Serbs and give it to Muslims and Croats, thus helping making it more acceptable to the new American Administration, which has claimed it rewarded "ethnic cleansing."
Only when the United States is fully committed to their approach is there any chance that the Serbs and Muslims can be persuaded to accept it. This is because to secure Serbian support the Security Council must be ready to threaten President Slobodan Milosevic's Government in Belgrade with even tougher economic sanctions unless he uses his influence with the Bosnian Serbs to make them sign.
Similarly, the Muslims are holding out because they still hope that the United States will reject the Vance-Owen plan and either lift the arms embargo against the former Yugoslav republic so they can rearm or send a military force to rescue them. Bosnia's Croats are the only faction that has fully accepted the plan so far.

HEADLINE: Judge's Hiring of Illegal Alien in 80's Did Not Violate Immigration Law

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Judge Kimba M. Wood was right when she said tonight that she violated no law in hiring an illegal immigrant to work as her baby sitter in March 1986.
Congress outlawed the practice eight months later. On Nov. 6, 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which prohibits the hiring of illegal aliens. 
 Under the immigration law as it existed before that date, it was against the law for illegal aliens to be in the United States, but it was not illegal for Americans to employ them.
The prohibition on hiring illegal aliens took effect immediately when the bill was signed by President Reagan on Nov. 6, 1986. It applied only to hiring that occurred after that date, and the penalties of the 1986 law did not apply to the continuing employment of illegal aliens who had been hired before it went into effect.
The 1986 law was passed after a bipartisan majority in Congress concluded that it was inconsistent, perhaps even hypocritical, to treat employer and employee so differently. The main purpose of the law was to curb the influx of illegal aliens. Recent studies by the Census Bureau show the law has not achieved that goal.
 
Judge Defends Acts
 Judge Wood, who sits on the bench in Federal District Court in Manhattan, withdrew her name tonight from consideration for Attorney General, declaring, "All of my acts were lawful." But she acknowledged that her baby sitter was in the United States unlawfully from 1980 to December 1987, when she gained legal status under the amnesty provisions of the 1986 law.
Even under the old immigration law, it was forbidden to bring an illegal alien into the United States or to conceal or harbor an illegal alien. For such offense, the law authorized a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $2,000 fine.
But a famous provision of the old law, known informally as the Texas proviso, stipulated that the employment of illegal aliens "shall not be deemed to constitute harboring."
This section was called the Texas proviso because many Texans took advantage of it by hiring illegal aliens from Mexico and other countries south of the border.
Judge Wood said her baby sitter's visa had expired when she was hired in March 1986. Most aliens with expired visas entered the United States legally, but fell into illegal status when they stayed here longer than allowed by the Federal Government.
 
Concern About Practice
 Although Judge Wood's action in hiring an illegal alien was not prohibited in early 1986, there was a growing consensus in the mid-1980's, expressed by members of Congress, that the employment of illegal aliens was an undesirable part of the underground economy. Jobs were seen as a magnet that drew illegal aliens to the United States.
Given this consensus as well as the strong public reaction to the case of Zoe Baird, President Clinton's first nominee for Attorney General, who withdrew after the firestorm over her employing two illegal aliens, it would have been politically awkward for Judge Wood to defend her hiring of an illegal alien at a confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The 1986 law was known by the names of its sponsors, Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, and Representative Romano L. Mazzoli, Democrat of Kentucky.
Charles Gordon, who was general counsel of the Immigration and Naturalization Service from 1966 to 1974, said that before passage of that law, "there was no prohibition at all on employment of illegal aliens as household workers."
Commenting on Judge Wood's fate, Mr. Gordon said in an interview: "This is an outrage. It was never contemplated that the law would be used to penalize career people who needed assistance to help them in the care of children."
In a letter to the editor of The New York Times last month, Mr. Gordon said the 1986 law and its "employer sanctions" should be reconsidered because they were ineffective.
David Carliner, an immigration lawyer who has written a book on the rights of aliens, also said that Judge Wood had done nothing illegal.
"It was made quite clear by the Justice Department that employers hiring undocumented workers before that date were not in violation of the statute, which was a criminal statute," Mr. Carliner said in an interview. "The department made clear that employers would be able to continue employment of people in illegal status who were hired before Nov. 6."
Mr. Carliner said Judge Wood was being treated too harshly. "She is being penalized for an action that was not illegal or improper at the time she employed the baby sitter," he said. "She didn't violate the law. I don't understand why she should have any adverse judgment relating to her because of this situation. It was done by many employers, and none of them were prosecuted or penalized."

HEADLINE: Text of Statements by Clinton and Wood

BYLINE: Reuters

 BODY:
Following are statements by Judge Kimba M. Wood of Federal District Court in New York, who withdrew her name yesterday from consideration for the post of United States Attorney General, and by President Clinton:
 
 
 
Wood's Statement
 After consultation with the White House, I have decided to withdraw my name from consideration by the President for nomination to the post of Attorney General. The reasons for this decision are as follows: 
 On January 29, I met with the President at the White House to discuss the possibility of my appointment. In the course of a wide-ranging discussion of policy issues, I was asked if I had a "Zoe Baird" problem. I said I did not, and I do not.
First, since I hired my babysitter in March 1986, I have submitted all required forms and paid all required taxes on her behalf. Second, I complied fully with all immigration laws and made all filings and disclosures that should be made in compliance with the immigration laws. My hiring of my babysitter was legal in March 1986 (prior to the Fall 1986 enactment of the Immigration Reform and Control ("IRCA") which rendered hiring illegal aliens unlawful if they were hired after IRCA's passage), and my employment of her continued to be legal after the passage of IRCA, because IRCA explicitly excluded from its provisions employers whose employees were hired prior to its passage.
In March 1986, it was lawful to openly employ aliens who were in the country, like my babysitter, on an expired visa, as long as the required taxes and forms were filed. However, although all of these acts were lawful, my babysitter, like anyone pursing legalization, was not legally in this country from 1980 until she obtained legal residency in December 1987 through the IRCA amnesty program.
I maintained and provided seven years of records with respect to my babysitter and other household help. These records included my federal social security, FUTA and W-2 filings and payments, and my State unemployment compensation, disability insurance and workers' compensation filings and payments, as well as the files I kept relating to my babysitter's immigration status, including my Application for Labor Certification and her application for federal amnesty pursuant to IRCA.
In sum, I maintained appropriate records and made all required filings and payments for the seven years that my babysitter has been in my employ.
Thus, I have fulfilled every legal requirement with respect to the employment of our babysitter. Nevertheless, and after further consultations, I have concluded that in the current political environment, proceeding further with the possibility of my nomination would be inappropriate.
 
 
 
Clinton's Statement
 I understand and respect Judge Wood's decision not to proceed further with the possibility of being nominated as Attorney General.
I was greatly impressed with her as a lawyer, a judge and a person. I respect her legal talents, judicial record and integrity. I wish her well.

HEADLINE: Germans' Apprentice System Supports Economic Vitality

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERLIN, Feb. 5

 BODY:
When Michel Sorgatz finished school last year, he did not have to read classified ads to find a job in his chosen field. Instead he entered an apprentice program at one of Germany's largest companies that will teach him a profession and virtually guarantee him a job.
On his way to a high-tech career working with metals, Mr. Sorgatz, 19, spent three weeks learning on the job at Siemens and two more weeks at a specialized school. At the end of his three-year apprenticeship he will take an examination, and if he does well, he will probably be offered a job at Siemens, an electronics and computer products manufacturer. 
 The German apprentice system has been in effect for decades, and is an outgrowth of the guild system that began in Central Europe centuries ago. But only in the postwar era, when Germans established a range of heavily subsidized social programs, have the government, labor and industry instituted such a wide-reaching and highly regulated and subsidized career training and placement system.
The system is considered a major reason for Germany's long economic boom. With the Clinton Administration searching for ways to make the American labor force more competitive, various public agencies in the United States are studying Germany's approach.
"You can't be too sure about the future given the overall economic situation, but in general I think the German system is positive," Mr. Sorgatz, who earns a gross salary of $600 a month, said one recent morning. "The best aspect of it is that you get theoretical training and practical experience at the same time."
When finished training, Mr. Sorgatz would earn three to five times his apprentice salary, as do trained employees working in his department.
Dietrich Volker, who directs training programs for Dresdner Bank, said, "It's a very expensive system, but if you ask anyone who's ever studied it whether it works, you will get a resounding yes."
The German system requires a greater level of regulation than may be acceptable in the United States. Germany officially recognizes nearly 400 professions, and to practice any of them fully, a citizen must hold a diploma from a specialized school.
Although the German system has succeeded in producing several generations of highly productive workers, it is not without critics. Some say that by regulating employment so tightly, the system rewards formal training over talent.
A hairdresser who has great natural ability or has been tutored privately, for instance, may work in Germany but may not open a salon. Salons may be run only by certified hairdressers who have completed a formal three-year training program and passed an examination.
Other critics say that while the German system works well in finding jobs for craft workers and business administrators, it is less effective at placing university-trained professionals. In addition, although job training and placement has long been considered a western German success story, the system has not yet managed to stabilize the labor market in newly absorbed eastern states. Many people in the east have lost jobs in antiquated industries and have no modern skills.
 
Most Are Pleased
 But most Germans are evidently pleased with their country's career training system. A recent survey of 10,000 apprentices by a group called Young German Business showed that 19 of every 20 were learning careers they find interesting, and that only 3 percent were pessimistic about job prospects.
Because the German career-training system is administered by various federal and state agencies, its full cost is difficult to compute. Budget figures, however, show that state and local governments spend a total of about $5.5 billion for vocational education every year, with the federal Government adding about $4.5 billion.
The system is costly not only for taxpayers, but also for industry, which at any given moment is supporting nearly 1.5 million apprentices. These apprentices perform work, but not enough to earn back their training costs and salaries. One research agency has estimated that business invests about $8,400 a year in each apprentice.
Businesses also assign many of their experienced workers to part-time teaching posts at vocational schools, picking up most of the costs themselves.
Despite these heavy costs, however, most business leaders are pleased by the results.
"Our German economy lives from the high quality of its workers," said Bernhard Jenschke, an administrator of vocational programs in Berlin. "Business recognizes this, and pays a great deal of money to guarantee a steady flow of highly trained workers. It's an investment in human quality."
Mr. Jenschke has received several delegations of American educators and labor planners recently. He told them that Germany's career-training programs have social as well as economic benefits.
"We help young people bridge the gap from school to career at an important time in their personal development," he said. "When German kids are between 16 and 20, most of them are in a combination of school and career training. They know that if they do well, they will have good futures. They're motivated. They get a sense of orientation and meaning to their lives. They don't feel hopeless or drop out of society."
Principal responsibility for overseeing the German system lies with the Federal Labor Agency, a sprawling nonprofit corporation run by representatives of business, labor and government. The agency employs 96,000 people at its headquarters in Nuremberg and at 184 branch offices and 646 counseling centers.
 
Employing Many Psychologists
 The labor agency has a legal monopoly on career counseling in Germany, but it does much more than channel people into vocations. It is the largest employer of psychologists in Germany, and offers a range of testing services devised to bring each citizen into the career where he or she will be happiest and most productive.
In addition, the agency supports a research institute at which 120 specialists analyze long-term trends affecting the German economy. They predict which industries are likely to grow, which new ones are likely to emerge, and what sorts of skills future German workers will need.
"We have a system that has provided us with great prosperity and stability," said Joachim Drechsler, a Siemens executive. "The American hire-and-fire system would definitely not be accepted here."
Like most German companies, Siemens replenishes its work force by hiring and training apprentices. Its 20,000 employees in the Berlin area are responsible, in addition to their other tasks, for guiding about 1,100 young apprentices who are learning 20 trades and professions. The apprentices earn between $575 and $675 a month.
"It is a very complex system, and it could be adopted in a country like the United States only in steps," Mr. Drechsler said. "First you'd have to decide that you want to pay the price. After that, you'd try to figure out where to begin -- maybe by building a network of modern vocational schools."
Germans usually have their first contact with the labor agency at the age of 14 or 15. Counselors visit every ninth-grade class to explain the agency's work and encourage students to use its Career Information Centers. At the centers, all visitors are entitled to individual counseling.
The Career Information Centers are heavily used. On most days they are full of young people taking computerized tests, watching films that describe the rudiments of various careers, and reading files that explain salary ranges and working conditions.
About two-thirds of German students choose a career path -- not necessarily one they stick to -- when they are in the 10th grade. They then apply for an apprentice position at a company and, after acceptance, enter the dual system of work and study that is the core of career training in Germany.
Most German concerns prefer to hire new employees only at the entry level, and to fill other openings by promoting from within. The way to rise through nearly any company, therefore, is to begin in its apprentice program.
Apprentices work not only in large companies like Siemens, but also in countless small and mid-sized factories and offices.
Ayfer Ataf, 20, thinks she wants to be a dental assistant. After finishing the 10th grade, she signed up for a three-year training course, of which she has completed about half. The Berlin dentist, Peter Schmidt, for whom she works makes a special effort to hire children of Turkish or other immigrants as his apprentices, or to hire applicants from eastern Germany. By doing so, he believes, he is helping to integrate German society.
Miss Ataf spends two days a week at a school in Berlin where all the students are dental assistants. They learn about dental technology and office administration, but also pursue academic subjects like literature and social studies.
On the other three days, Ms. Ataf wears a white jacket and works as an assistant to Dr. Schmidt, earning about $500 a month. He is pleased with her work and says he will be happy to hire her at the end of her training, but she is not sure she will accept.
"I look at this as a three-year experience, not a lifetime commitment," Ms. Ataf said. "If I decide it isn't for me, I'll take an apprenticeship in some other field, maybe as a hospital technician. There are plenty of possibilities."
Students who do not enter the "dual system" after the 10th grade usually remain in school for three more years. Then they begin a process similar to what the 10th graders went through, except that the number of occupations open to them is greater.
 
Some Jobs Unregulated
 A few professions in which creative ability and other intangible skills are thought to be required, including journalism, are left unregulated. Employers in these professions are free to hire people regardless of their training or lack of it. Standards for hiring university professors and other highly specialized professionals are also left largely to employers' discretion.
Nearly everyone entering the German work force, however, has either completed an apprenticeship or used some of the resources offered by the labor agency.
A growing number of apprentices are well into their 20's or older, including women entering the work market after raising children and people who want to change careers in mid-life. The labor agency is trying to insure that these applicants are given the same opportunities as new graduates, but some companies still prefer young people as apprentices.
The newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau recently published a long study analyzing problems in the "dual system." But it acknowledged in an editorial that most Germans consider the system so successful that it should not be altered.
"Do we really need apprentices in every bakery, art studio, hotel, travel agency and gas station?" the editorial asked. "The usual answer is, 'Of course we do, because otherwise what would happen to our businesses and industries? How would we keep training the typical German high-tech workers who are the envy of the world from Japan to Detroit? What would become of our social and economic stability?' "

As World Crowds In, an Island Shields Its Culture

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HANGA ROA, Easter Island

 BODY:
The topography is like the political climate in this speck of land with its Polynesian people isolated in the South Pacific.
At first, Easter Island appears to be a pleasant and even breathtaking place, with undulating pastures carpeted in pale green that spike up to rounded peaks and then plummet into blue Pacific. But just under the surface are sharp volcanic rocks that make walking painful. 
 Born of fire three million years ago, the island has been a territory of Chile for 104 years. Now its people are beginning to vent pent-up anger and fight the growing dominance of Chilean and Western culture.
In November, a militant group that had been formed to protect the Polynesian culture staged demonstrations to stop the Chilean Navy from building a lighthouse on a sacred ceremonial site. Navy officials say the lighthouse was intended to help island fishermen.
 
Statues and Sacred Rocks
 The same group had interfered earlier in plans to use what its members considered sacred rocks to repair the airport runway and had stopped the Chilean Government from sending one of the island's giant stone statues, or moai, to an exhibition in Hawaii.
Many islanders are openly challenging the Government in Santiago, demanding control over their land; the use of their native language, Rapa Nui, as the main language in schools; a school curriculum better oriented to their Polynesian culture; local management of archeological sites, and the appointment of islanders to all local government posts.
"We have lived 104 years as Chileans, but more than 1,000 as Easter Islanders," Alberto Hotus Chavez, Mayor of Hanga Roa, said.
For scientists here, Easter Island is an example of exotic, unique and weakened cultures struggling to survive amid a shrinking, modernizing world.
"This is an extraordinary culture," said Gonzalo Figueroa, the foremost Chilean archeologist on the island, which is 2,300 miles off the Chilean coast. "But islanders are finding their children are going off to school in Santiago, learning different ways, not speaking their native language. They are very worried about that."
For the Chilean Government, the stirrings seem almost like ingratitude. Government officials say the islanders receive large subsidies from Santiago and are not required to pay taxes.
"What is being discussed is not change, but the velocity of change," said Angel Cabeza, director of Cultural Affairs at the National Forest Service in Santiago. "As far as we are concerned, the Rapa Nui have economic and political power in their hands." The people and culture, as well as the language, are called Rapa Nui.
But Mr. Cabeza conceded that the central issue, control of the land, will not be resolved quickly.
Currently, 40 percent of the island is administered as national parkland, another 40 percent is Government land on which an agricultural testing station is operated. The islanders own only the remaining 20 percent.
Government officials fear giving up control over some of the most exotic archeological sites in the world, and they worry that it might lead to a movement for independence.
On the island it is hard to find many who say they favor independence, mainly because they realize that their deep economic dependence on the mainland.
 
Cultures Clash
 Though they are outwardly friendly, the Rapa Nui and Chileans acknowledge a complex clash of two very different civilizations.
Chileans, known for their industriousness, say they cannot understand the ethos of the Polynesians, many of whom say they pride themselves on leaving time to enjoy the sun that sparkles off the water.
And islanders say they are offended by what they describe as a persistent racism and treatment as second-class citizens by Chileans.
"When I was going to college in Santiago, they nicknamed me the cannibal," said Virginia Haoa, the secretary of the Corporation for Cultural Protection, the group that blocked the lighthouse. "I realized then how different we were and that we had to fight for our culture."
During the 16th and 17th centuries cannibalism was widely practiced here, as a result of deforestation and hunger, archeologists say. The practice gradually came to an end.
 
New Source of Worry
 Islanders are worrying now about another new exposure to Western culture, the first filming of a major motion picture on Easter Island that is being co-produced by Kevin Costner.
Island officials say they are worried that some of the hundreds of film-industry members who will come for the filming will bring drugs and AIDS.
"A lot of us are getting tested voluntarily," Zane Weiner, production manager for the film, said. "As far as drugs, if we find someone taking drugs, we'll send them home."
Perhaps the most radical manifestation of the low-level cultural warfare is the emergence of the Corporation for Cultural Protection.
"We are different from Chileans in language, culture and way of thinking," Rodrigo Paoa, the group's founder, said. "As a Rapa Nui, if I want to sleep, I sleep. If I want to eat, I eat. I can spend a week without spending any money. If we are not careful, people will turn this island into another Hawaii or Tahiti, where the only important thing is money."

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Rises At Fastest Pace in 3 Years

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
American consumers borrowed heavily to buy cars in December, driving up their debt at the fastest rate in nearly three years, the Government said today.
Consumer installment credit rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.1 percent in December, to $725.9 billion, the fourth consecutive monthly increase, the Federal Reserve said. 
 It was the biggest increase since borrowing rose at a 6.4 percent rate in February 1990.
Credit outstanding rose at annual rates of 1.8 percent in November and four-tenths of 1 percent in October. Before the most recent gains, credit outstanding had shrunk for seven consecutive months.
For the year, consumer credit was down three-tenths of 1 percent. That followed a 1 percent drop in 1991 -- the first since 1958 -- and a 2.6 percent gain in 1990.
The cutback in borrowing during the recession and subsequent economic doldrums was a reaction to the huge debt levels that many consumers built up during the 1980's.
Borrowing finally began increasing after many Americans reduced their monthly payments by refinancing their mortgages and other loans at lower interest rates.
But economists said consumers were unlikely to completely revert to the free-spending ways of the previous decade until the economy begins providing more jobs.
"A number of families have reduced their debt loads, but they're more cautious," said Norman Robertson, a private economist in Pittsburgh. "I would not look for a sudden surge of borrowing and spending."
In December, automobile loans advanced at a 7.3 percent annual rate to $259.3 billion, following a 4.2 percent increase in November.
Revolving loans outstanding, which include credit card balances, increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.7 percent, to $251 billion, the fifth consecutive increase.
Other consumer loans rose at a 3.1 percent annual rate to $215.6 billion. This category includes loans for mobile homes, education, boats, trailers and vacations.

HEADLINE: Japan's Surplus Increases 61%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Japan's current account surplus jumped 61 percent to a record $117.62 billion in 1992, the Government said today.
The Ministry of Finance said the surplus in the current account -- the broadest measure of trade in goods and services -- rose from $72.9 billion in 1991. The previous record, $87 billion, was set in 1987. 
 The trade component of the nation's balance of payments rose to a record $132.6 billion surplus in 1992 from the previous high of $103 billion a year earlier, the ministry said.
Japan was already under increasing pressure from the United States and the European Community to trim its surpluses. But a sluggish economy is dampening imports while a strong yen exaggerates the size of Japan's exports.
Figures for the American portion of the imbalance were not immediately available.
Japanese exports rose to $330.8 billion in 1992 from $306.56 billion. Imports slipped to $198.2 billion from $203.57 billion.

HEADLINE: Florio Receives More Cheery Budget News

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio, who this week returned from Washington with $412 million in back Medicaid payments to bolster his soon-to-be-released state budget, has gained some more bright budget news from the Federal Government and a state judge.
Treasury officials said today that the Department of Labor has postponed a $96 million debt repayment that dates to Gov. Thomas H. Kean's administration. And a Superior Court judge threw out a lawsuit by state employee unions challenging last year's revamping of the state pension system. 
 The pension change provided more than $1 billion for the current state budget and is expected to add more than $500 million to the budget that Mr. Florio will release on Monday, said Richard McGrath, a state Treasury Department spokesman.
Mr. McGrath said Federal officials told the state that it can wait until 1994 to repay $96 million to the state Unemployment Trust Fund, freeing those revenues for this year's state budget.

HEADLINE: Expert Links Mandatory Desegregation to 'White Flight'

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST HARTFORD, Conn., Feb. 5

 BODY:
Large numbers of whites have removed their children from public schools wherever mandatory integration plans have been imposed, an expert testified today in the state's defense against a suit challenging the racial and economic segregation in Hartford's schools.
In the Hartford area, said the expert, Prof. Christine Rossell of Boston University, a survey done for the state found that 51 percent of the whites questioned said they would move or resort to private schools if a desegregation plan assigned their children to a city school. 
 Flight occurs even when a plan covers an entire metropolitan area, as the plaintiffs are seeking for Hartford, as long as parents are not allowed to choose whether to take part, she said.
 
Seeking Desegregation
 "Every single mandatory reassignment plan that we can find in a metropolitan area suffers significant white flight," Professor Rossell said. "I can't find any that have not."
Professor Rossell attacked several important contentions of the plaintiffs in this suit, Sheff v. O'Neill, in which civil-rights lawyers say the segregation in Hartford's schools have denied the city's children an equal educational opportunity.
The suit contends that the state has not acted to eliminate the segregation. Despite more than 25 years of studies identifying segregation as a serious problem, 90 percent of the city's students are black or Hispanic, and two-thirds are poor.
It is also seeking a desegregation order covering Hartford and 21 surrounding towns, on the theory that including an entire metropolitan area eliminates a major incentive for white flight, the ability to avoid integrated schools by moving a short distance.
Professor Rossell, however, not only testified against both points, but offered herself as the ultimate evidence that people deeply involved in desegregation can change their opinions on the value of mandatory integration.
As late as the mid-1980's, Professor Rossell was a frequent expert for plaintiffs in desegregation cases, testifying on the extent of white flight that courts would have to expect, and helping to design plans to minimize white flight.
But as her research progressed, she said today, it began to show that voluntary integration plans, in which parents could choose to send children to new schools, or keep them in their neighborhood schools, were achieving greater mixing of whites and minority students than mandatory plans.
A chief reason, she said, was that so many whites left the public schools under mandatory plans that not enough remained to provide meaningful integration.
"The goal of a desegregation plan," she said, "should be to integrate minority and white students, and to have enough whites in that plan so that the schools look integrated."
 
'A Leader in the Nation'
 As a result of these findings, she said, "plaintiffs stopped calling me." Now she is a leading expert for school boards and other government agencies defending themselves against desegregation suits.
Professor Rossell began her testimony today by calling Connecticut "a leader in the nation" in financially supporting urban schools and in promoting efforts to integrate city and suburban students.
"This is a state that is committed to integration," she said. "It's not committed because of a court order, but because its elected representatives think that's what its people want."
As she compared white flight under mandatory plans and voluntary ones, Professor Rossell drew frequent objections from Ron Ellis, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, over her definition of "mandatory."
The plaintiffs are seeking a court order setting specific goals and deadlines for integrating schools in the Hartford area, but they would like the actual plan to include voluntary components, like magnet schools.
But Professor Rossell does not consider a plan "voluntary" just because it includes magnet schools. Unless parents can choose to keep their children in their current school, she said, a plan is mandatory, and magnet schools are then simply one way to take part.
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has emphasized the potential of voluntary measures to achieve the goals he has offered in legislation calling for towns and cities to achieve greater racial balance.
Professor Rossell also testified that large-scale metropolitan plans do not minimize white flight because they add to one major concern of parents, the distance children have to travel, while not addressing a second concern, the quality of the school at the end of the bus ride.
Much of that testimony was also contested by Mr. Ellis because it focused on Los Angeles, where a busing plan ordered by state courts in the 1970's drove most whites out of what had been considered one of the country's best urban school districts.
While Professor Rossell contended that the Los Angeles plan was metropolitan because it covered a vast area, Mr. Ellis argued that it was not, because Los Angeles is a single school district, unlike Hartford and its suburbs.
Professor Rossell was an expert for the plaintiffs in the Los Angeles case. One of the chief witnesses for the defense was David Armor, a professor who will be the state's final witness here.

HEADLINE: U.S. Jobless Rate Falls As Labor Force Shrinks

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The labor market showed further spotty improvement in January as the nation's unemployment rate eased two-tenths of a point, to 7.1 percent, and businesses expanded payrolls by 106,000, the Labor Department said today.
But the latest survey, representing the first broad view of the economy's performance last month, showed that the unemployment rate dropped only because the number of people in the labor force fell. And job growth has yet to rise at anything near the pace of overall economic activity. 
 Though its findings were expected, the survey had been eagerly awaited because it is considered a reliable overall indicator of business activity as well as a gauge of social distress.
 
 
'Still Too High'
 Many economists as well as Democratic politicians said the figures underscored the need for a dose of Government spending to stimulate the economy. President Clinton called the 7.1 percent jobless rate, the same as in January 1992, "better, but still too high."
The survey was also the final major report to be published before President Clinton must decide on the contents of his spending initiative. Those plans, which are likely to add about $31 billion to the budget deficit, are to be announced on Feb. 17.
"He still believes that it's necessary to try to kick-start the economy, particularly in the area of job growth," said Dee Dee Myers, the White House press spokeswoman.
The basics of today's report had been fairly accurately predicted and thus did not surprise the stock or bond markets. Bond prices dropped slightly after the Labor Department's announcement, but then rose the rest of the day.
Still, deciphering the unemployment rate was more difficult than usual because of large seasonal swings, measurement difficulties, crosscurrents in various industry sectors and, in the case of January's rate, a figure that was far less encouraging than it first appeared.
The jobless rate fell to the lowest level in a year only because the work force dropped by 508,000, to its October level, after rising substantially in November and December.
Department officials said they could not account for this other than to note that January is typically a month of huge seasonal swings, including the discharge of workers hired for the holiday shopping season.
 Had the labor force remained unchanged, the rate would have risen about five-tenths of a point instead of declining two-tenths of a point, they said. The number of people with jobs, according to the department's survey of households, fell 240,000.
The household survey, conducted in 58,000 households through personal interviews and by telephone, asks people whether they are employed. The employer survey, based on records of more than 350,000 establishments, is considered a better gauge of the economy; it also reflects people who hold more than one job.
Typically, the labor force expands when the economy is on the rebound because people who have given up looking up jobs -- and are thus not counted as unemployed -- become encouraged enough to start searching again. There has been no clear trend in the size of the work force since mid-1992, following a hefty rise.
At the same time, there were some undisputed positives in today's report, most of them showing up in the survey of employers' payrolls.
The length of the workweek in American factories jumped another 12 minutes, to 41.4 hours, its highest level since 1966. Factory overtime edged up 6 minutes, to 4 hours, with employers determined to get maximum production from workers already on the payroll before hiring new ones.
 
 
'Stretched to the Limit'
 But employers will probably be unable to do this much longer.
"That is stretched to the limit," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist for the Chemical Banking Corporation in New York.
In fact, factory jobs rose a moderate 34,000 in January, the second gain in three months following large losses from August through October. These gains were widespread, though an official expressed reservations about the accuracy of a big jump in the automobile industry because of shifts in that industry's seasonal patterns.
Another bright spot was that 57.4 percent of all industries added workers last month, up from 52.8 percent in December and the highest proportion since April 1992. Manufacturing industries posted similar gains.
"You could describe it as a pattern of moderate but pretty entrenched growth," Walter M. Cadette, an economist for the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, said of the report.
 Employment in retail trade climbed 69,000, entirely in bars and restaurants, automotive dealers and food stores. Department stores and other businesses selling general merchandise shed 5,000 jobs.
Construction employment fell another 37,000, partly reflecting harsh weather. Employment in the services industry edged down as small gains in business and health services failed to offset losses elsewhere.
The household survey showed that the improvement in the jobless rate was largely confined to adult men, whose rate fell four-tenths of a point, to 6.4 percent. That matched the rate for women, which was unchanged for the month. Unemployment among teen-agers was 19.7 percent, pushing the overall jobless rate up.
The number of unemployed who had involuntarily left their last jobs fell by 290,000, with 60 percent of the decline among those who were on layoff and were expecting to be recalled, the report also showed. The ranks of those out of work at least 15 weeks fell by 288,000, but there was a 230,000 increase in the number of newly unemployed.
Among the 11 biggest states, the only sizable changes in the jobless rate were nine-tenths of a point declines for New Jersey, to 7.4 percent, and for Michigan, to 7.1 percent. But because of relatively small state samples, these were considered to be of little statistical significance.
The unemployment rate for New York State was put at 8.5 percent, unchanged from December.
Regionally, the Northeast and West both posted declines of two-tenths of a point, to 7.9 percent and 8.3 percent, respectively, while the jobless rate remained at 6.8 percent in the South and 6.2 percent in the Midwest.
"All in all, it was a pretty good report," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist for CRT Government Securities in New York. "But it's not the type of employment growth that's going to satisfy the Clinton Administration and Congress."

HEADLINE: U.S. Officially Pleased at Foreign Rate Cuts

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
American officials welcomed this week's interest rate cuts by Germany's and Japan's central banks, but they were reluctant to say in public what many express privately -- that the two nations should do more to stimulate their languishing economies.
Not only do Mr. Clinton's economic aides fear starting off wrong in relations with the world's two other industrial superpowers, but Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen has said he prefers private persuasion to public badgering when Washington wants to put pressure on its partners. 
 "We welcome the reduction in German interest rates," said Mr. Bentsen, who has called for greater cooperation among the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, as well as an increased commitment to growth.
American officials have talked with the Germans and Japanese in the last week. They declined to discuss the conversations.
But officials and economists said Germany and Japan cut their rates principally because of domestic economic slumps, not because of importuning from abroad.
Bush Administration aides vigorously and repeatedly pressed Bonn and Tokyo to cut interest rates and make other moves to keep their economies out of recession, but that pressure had mixed results, at best.
"There's no question the U.S. would like more stimulus in Japan and Germany," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, who served as an economic official in several previous Administrations. "But there's a realization that this will occur when those countries regard it as appropriate for domestic reasons, rather than in response to outside pressures."
 
Optimism in Washington
 Administration officials said they expected the rate cuts in Germany and Japan to spur growth there, adding that this should lead these countries to import more American goods. "Low interest rates around the world and in the United States help promote further growth and create jobs," said George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, at a news briefing on Thursday.
American officials seemed especially pleased by the German rate cuts because they believe they will help buoy growth throughout Europe and calm fragile currency markets.
Indeed, two Government officials, speaking privately, said they hoped that the Bundesbank, which had resisted lowering rates for fear of inflation, would soon follow its cuts Thursday with other such moves. That would reduce tension in Europe's monetary system, in which several countries have had to raise interest rates to keep their currencies from plunging against the German mark.
But officials are less eager for the Bank of Japan to cut its rates further because that could weaken the yen against the dollar and increase Japan's $47 billion annual merchandise-trade surplus with the United States. A weak yen as a rule means cheaper prices for Japanese products abroad, and many economists say that the yen is already undervalued in relation to the dollar.
Several officials said that as a next step, they want the Japanese Government to approve a big new economic stimulus program, with tax cuts and deficit spending on public works projects. Such a stimulus would in theory increase Japan's growth and imports without pushing the yen down against the dollar.

FEARS OVER FREE-MARKET POLLUTION
Under the Clean Air Act of 1990, if a company could clean up its emissions more than required, it could sell the right to pollute to another company. But an announcement this week that the Long Island Lighting Company was selling some of its pollution rights to another company has raised fears in New York's environmental community. Because the law does not regulate the sales or require companies to provide any public information about them, at least until 1995, pollution could be quietly shifted from one region to another, critics say.

 JANUARY JOBLESS RATE HIGHEST ON RECORD
The unemployment rate for New York City soared to 13.4 percent in January from 11 percent in December, hitting the highest level on record in the 25 years that the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics has tracked the city labor market. There were 447,000 people out of work in January, excluding those who have dropped out of the labor market and are not actively seeking jobs. That number, up from 369,000 in December, was also the highest on record. Page 1.
 
 AMTRAK ORDERED TO ALLOW BILLBOARD
A Federal judge ruled that Amtrak must permit an artist to display a montage criticizing the owners of the Coors Brewing Company on a giant billboard in Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Higher Against Mark But Mixed in Other Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished stronger against the German mark, but mixed against other major currencies yesterday after an employment report showed improvement in the United States economy.
Gold prices were mostly lower worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $328.70 a troy ounce, off 30 cents from Thursday. The Republic National Bank said gold fell 55 cents to a late bid price of $327.80. 
 The Labor Department reported that the nation's nonfarm payrolls rose by 106,000, slightly higher than expected. The unemployment rate fell two-tenths of a percentage point, to 7.1 percent.
The data, which provided signs of an improving economy, made the dollar and dollar-denominated securities more attractive than their European or Japanese counterparts.
"Worldwide it looks as though, temporarily at least, the rosiest picture is in the U.S.," one foreign-exchange trader said.
 
Impact on Interest Rates
 Traders said the numbers also persuaded the financial markets that the Federal Reserve would not lower interest rates soon. That is a positive for the dollar, since higher interest rates in the United States make it more attractive.
"It also means that a lot of people, if they want to get a nice return on dollar investments, would be getting into the bond market and stock market and would need to buy dollars to do that," the trader said.
In New York, the dollar settled at 124.45 yen, down from 124.65 yen on Thursday. The British pound cost $1.4460 in New York, vs. Thursday's $1.4405.
Other late dollar rates in New York included: 1.6580 German marks, up from 1.6565; 1.5325 Swiss francs, even with Thursday; 5.6075 French francs, up from 5.6000; 1532 Italian lire, down from 1536 and 1.26155 Canadian dollars, down from 1.26295.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Thursday, included: 1.6554 German marks, up from 1.6540; 1.5279 Swiss francs, down from 1.5290; 5.5940 French francs, up from 5.5915; 1.8524 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8619; 1,527.00 Italian lire, down from 1,533.25, and 1.2615 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2630.

HEADLINE: Fed Adopted Neutral Stance At December Policy Meeting

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve said in a report today that its chief policy-making committee abandoned its slight tilt toward lower interest rates in December and adopted a neutral policy, a move that will probably disappoint politicians who want further rate cuts.
Such a neutral policy generally indicates that the Fed remains as worried about slow growth as about a possible increase in inflationary pressures. And the report, describing the Dec. 22 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, said the central bankers had not totally ruled out changing interest rates. 
 According to the report, the committee unanimously abandoned its bias toward lower rates in a reaction to the pickup in economic growth. The bias toward easing did not mean the committee planned to cut rates, just that it was predisposed to do so, especially if the economy deteriorated.
The Fed committee met again on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, but its decisions at that meeting will not be announced until late next month. Many economists suggested that the panel held to its December decision favoring neither lower nor higher rates.
In a move today that some said demonstrated the central bank's intentions not to cut rates soon, the Federal Reserve in New York removed some reserves from the banking system. It acted after the Federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans -- had fallen to 2.78 percent, well below the Federal Reserve's target of 3 percent. Draining reserves from the system subtly tightens the supply of credit, helping push the Federal funds rate back up.
Still, the summary of the December meeting said members "observed that the next policy move might be in either direction."
"The need for some easing could not be ruled out, should the expansion again appear to be faltering," the report said.
But it also raised the possibility of increasing interest rates. "A stronger economic performance," the report said, "might raise questions as to the need for a tightening move at some point during the year ahead as a means of maintaining progress toward price stability while continuing to encourage maximum sustainable economic expansion."
The report added that if tightening was needed, it would be desirable to raise rates "before inflation pressures showed through in the actual price statistics in order to avoid sharp and potentially disruptive tightening actions later."
When Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, testified before Congress last week, several lawmakers criticized Fed officials for even talking about inflationary pressures and increasing interest rates when inflation is 2.9 percent and the jobless rate is above 7 percent.
The report said committee members in their December meeting anticipated that inflation would continue to fall, although "some now expected somewhat less improvement than they had earlier." The report said recent data on consumer prices and wages "had a somewhat less favorable tenor."
But the report saw several factors helping to hold down inflation, including unused industrial capacity. It noted that large-scale layoffs were tending to hold down wage demands and that productivity gains and import competition would also help hold down inflation.
The committee adopted its policy favoring lower interest rates in July when the economy was sluggish. It decided to continue that policy in its August and October meetings, although in October it adopted a stronger "marked" bias toward easing. The Fed last cut rates on Sept. 4, when it reduced the Federal funds rate to 3 percent from 3.25 percent.
The Federal Open Market Committee consists of the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board and the presidents of the Fed's 12 regional banks.

Kinds of Coins
Q What is the difference between bullion and numismatic coins?
 
 JEANNIE AARON, MANHATTAN
A "A bullion coin is a coin that has either silver or gold content and is usually 90 percent pure," said Harvey Stack, a partner of Stack's Coin Company. "The value of the coin is determined by its weight in relation to the current bullion prices on the commodity exchanges." Examples are dimes, quarters and half dollars dated 1964 or earlier. 
 In contrast, a numismatic coin can be made of any metal, including precious bullion metals, but is a rarity because of limited supply and great demand for the item. "Examples of American coins with such a scarcity are the 1877 1-cent piece and the 1885 5-cent piece," Mr. Stack said. Unusual foreign pieces like ancient Greek silver coins and medieval European gold coins are also in this category.
 
Municipal Bonds
Q What are pre-refunded municipal bonds?
 
 FRANK GALLO, BALDWIN, L.I.
A According to James F. Lynch, president of Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory, pre-refunded municipals are tax-free bonds backed by Treasury securities, AAA-rated and generally maturing between 1994 and 2003. Originally issued when interest rates were higher than they are today, these bonds have been pre-refunded -- or called before their maturity -- by the issuance of other municipals at lower interest rates.
"When the issuer sells a new issue at today's lower rates, it takes the proceeds and buys U.S. Government bonds whose income and principal is used to pay off the old bonds," Mr. Lynch said.
He also noted that because of their high quality and liquidity, pre-refunded bonds were appropriate investments for people seeking maximum safety. Even though they are are always sold for more than their face value, their yield is typically higher than a comparable-quality bond selling at par.
 
Self-Directed Keogh
Q I have a self-directed Keogh account. Can I deduct the interest on money borrowed to make this year's contribution to the account?
 
 DITTE JENSEN, VENTURA, CALIF.
A Interest on any money borrowed for personal purposes, even to fund a Keogh contribution, is deemed to be nondeductible personal interest.
The broader question here, however, is really whether interest on this loan can be considered investment interest, which in some situations is tax deductible.
Morris Lipton of Lane & Lipton, a certified public accounting firm in Valley Stream, L.I., said that investment interest generally must produce what is known as portfolio income to obtain the tax benefit.
"Portfolio income is income from interest, dividends, annuities or royalties that are not derived in the ordinary course of trade or business," he said.
Mr. Lipton concluded that because the proceeds of the loan were going directly into a tax-deferred Keogh account that would not produce taxable portfolio income, the Tax Code would not recognize the interest you would be paying as deductible investment interest.

HEADLINE: Not Enough for Domestic Partners

 BODY:
In moving to grant them some of the benefits enjoyed by married couples, Mayor David Dinkins makes a welcome gesture of recognition and respect to the non-marital relationships that constitute "family" for millions of New Yorkers. Yet he continues to dodge the most urgent issue facing non-traditional families -- health care benefits.
The Mayor will create a city registry in which residents or nonresident city workers can file as "domestic partners." Homosexuals or unmarried heterosexual registrants will have the same standing as married couples in qualifying for city apartments, the same visiting rights at city jails and hospitals. Those who work for the city may also take unpaid leave to care for newborn children. 
 Those are worthwhile measures, but they fall short of Mr. Dinkins's 1989 mayoral campaign pledge to offer health coverage to the live-in partners of city employees. The Mayor now says he lacks the legal authority to issue an executive order. Yet that's not so clear.
Mayor Dinkins cites a letter from the State Superintendent of Insurance opining that state law bars insurance companies from offering group health plans that include domestic partners. But the judge in a pending lawsuit filed by three homosexual teachers has rejected that statutory interpretation, and a unanimous appellate panel has denied a move by the city to dismiss the case.
Instead of clinging to the city's legal brief, Mr. Dinkins might have exerted himself earlier in his term to try to persuade Gov. Mario Cuomo to change the state policy. If the Mayor's real concern is costs, he should say so openly and commission a realistic economic analysis. In localities that now offer health benefits to domestic partners, the costs have proved surprisingly modest.
While unwilling to test his own executive authority on the issue of health coverage for domestic partners of city workers, Mr. Dinkins has endorsed legislation in the City Council that would achieve the same thing. But Council Speaker Peter Vallone takes an obstructionist position, refusing even to allow hearings that might help educate the public and develop added safeguards against fraudulent use of such new coverage.
He says that state insurance and domestic relations law pre-empts any Council action. That conveniently constricting view of the Council's jurisdiction hardly masks Mr. Vallone's hostility to the civil rights of homosexuals.
The courts may eventually decide that existing laws against discrimination on the basis of marital status and sexual orientation require the city to grant the health benefits. In the meantime, more candor from top city officials would be refreshing.

Laundry And Debt

BYLINE: BY RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
I am trying to worry about the deficit but make no headway. Driving shirts to the laundry, I am worrying about the American laundry situation when a radio yakmeister insinuates himself into my ear.
He is worrying about the deficit. He asks people to phone him. I think he is in Seattle, but may be wrong because the laundry problem has my mind by the throat. 
 The radio is bleating idly away, soaking into the car upholstery. I usually leave it that way on the chance that sooner or later Daniel Schorr will come on and say something interesting.
Mostly what it picks up is America yakking. If my car seats could talk they would probably telephone Rush Limbaugh and denounce Congress for raising its pay.
So this day, Thursday, I am debating whether to give the laundryman a piece of my mind or treat him to some cutting sarcasm. Three weeks running my white shirts have come back tinted a faint but unmistakable blue.
The laundryman is a simple, hard-working man. The best way to get results, doubtless, is to speak forthrightly: "If these shirts come out blue this time, fella, my business goes elsewhere."
Yet I am not good speaking forthrightly. Simple, hard-working men on whom I have tried it sense that I lack the killer instinct to back up threats. On the other hand, a sneer would be lost on the laundryman, so there is no point in saying, "After washing these shirts, do you think you could bear to hold the dye?"
From this thought I segue instantly into a favorite worry: America can't cut the mustard anymore. How can we hope to sell Japan cars with steering wheels on the wrong side when we can't even get our white shirts back from the laundry white?
Somewhere around here I am aware of a radio talk show in progress. In a faraway place, possibly Seattle, a man is urging people to phone him and tell all America what they are willing to sacrifice to cut the Federal deficit.
The question shames me briefly. My answer, if hauled before this nationwide audience, would be a despicable, "Nothing." That's because I've always thought deficits highly overrated.
I recall Republicans railing for 30 years that deficits would kill us all, which they didn't. I recall the Republicans then running up a deficit that made the Democrats look like bush-league deficiteers. And now suddenly everybody agrees with the old-time Republicans that the deficit will kill us all.
My life in Deficit Land leaves me suspicious that politicians, not to mention economists, don't understand deficits any better than my laundryman, not to mention me, understands quantum electrodynamics.
Nevertheless, here is one of these inescapable call-in radio shows assuming that the kind of people who call in are so desperate about the deficit that they will go on the air and pledge sacrifices to end it.
Instantly my mind, accustomed to taking big philosophical leaps, propounds a proposition: If the American masses were to master the details of their daily toil -- the laundryman keeping the blue out of the white shirts, the oil-changer remembering to put fresh oil in the car after draining the crankcase, and so on -- then the habit of efficiency would become so ingrained in the national spirit that no deficit whatever could possibly occur.
In short, as long as the laundryman persisted in turning the white shirts blue, sacrifices would be powerless to cut the deficit.
Listening to America phoning in, I am heartened to see that it agreed with me. One caller, not a Congressman, said he would happily sacrifice Congress's pay raise. A Brooklyn woman who struggled, she said, to supplement her poor mother's paltry Social Security check offered to accept a substantial income-tax increase on my salary.
At the laundry I am too depressed to mention the blue in the shirts. Back home I walk past the TV set. Maury Povich is talking to a young woman. The caption on the screen identifies her as "Recovering Sex Addict." Another woman speaks. "Engaged to Recovering Sex Addict," says the caption. The audience is enthralled.
Was it for this and failed laundry that we won the Battle of Midway?

HEADLINE: Real Help for the Everglades

BYLINE: By Robert W. Hahn; Robert W. Hahn is an economist at the American Enterprise Institute and research fellow at Harvard. He consults for the U.S. Sugar Corporation.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In her hearings for confirmation as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Carol Browner spoke of the need for a "new era of communication" between environmentalists and business. As one of her first moves, she has a rare opportunity to work to the benefit of the environment and the economy, resolving a dispute with which she is keenly familiar.
As head of the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation, she led the state into an agreement with the U.S. Justice Department aimed at preserving the Everglades, one of the world's great wetlands. The pact between Florida and the Federal Government called for protecting the area by reducing phosphorus runoff from farmland. The phosphorus, thought to harm native plant species, comes from soil, fertilizer, sugar mills, rain and irrigation water. 
 Despite a pro-business reputation, the Bush Administration, through the Justice Department, imposed a cleanup on Florida, requiring farmers to insure that their runoff water is cleaner than rain. The $400 million plan envisages building 35,000 acres of experimental filtering marshes which even some government environmental consultants doubt would work as advertised, and handing the bill to farmers. Sugar and vegetable farmers said that the costs would drive out most of the region's agriculture and, by some estimates, put 20,000 people out of work.
Because of the huge costs associated with the plan, the Everglades issue is far from settled: the so-called solution makes no attempt to balance the economy and environment.
Here's a way to break the logjam: adopt a system that allows pollution credits to be traded, an arrangement that was successfully built into the 1990 Clean Air Act to curb acid rain. The idea is to have government set targets for phosphorus reduction but give farmers maximum flexibility in achieving them.
The Justice Department plan made no attempt at a fair distribution of public and private responsibilities for cleaning up the Everglades. Initially, farmers were to pay for everything, no matter how much of the phosphorus problem they actually caused. Then there was talk of an arbitrary deal, dividing costs between agriculture and government.
While any division of environmental responsibility is arbitrary, people should be asked to pay to clean up only the part of the problem they cause. In the Everglades, farmers should be responsible for making sure that the level of phosphorus in water leaving their land is no greater than the rain and irrigation water that comes on in the first place. If government thinks the water should be cleaner than that, then it has an obligation to pay for the cleanup.
The key is to allow farmers to decide how best to reduce the phosphorus. Each farm would receive one credit for each pound of phosphorus it may put into public canals. Farmers whose water is easily cleaned up can sell their credits to others. That way, farmers will have a powerful market incentive to invest in new cleanup technology -- a Clinton Administration goal -- and costs will come down for everyone.
This market is intended to make pollution prevention pay. Farmers may well discover they can remove more phosphorus than they now believe is possible, thereby lowering public cleanup costs too. As the history of technological progress has always shown, where there is an incentive, someone finds a way.
Government may end up building filter marshes to meet some of its own cleanup responsibilities. Then the question will be which level of government should pay. As E.P.A. Administrator, Ms. Browner can help see to it that the Federal Government faces up to its share of blame for the problems in the Everglades.
Washington has poured money into a vast canal system near the Everglades that supplies water and controls floods, but it has hurt the environment by rerouting natural waterways and disrupting native life.
The Everglades, a national treasure, has received short shrift for too long. Ms. Browner can achieve an early victory if she can gain the support of environmentalists and farmers for a pioneer plan that could be the model for environmental policy for decades to come.

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL MUSIC;
Who Pulled the Big Five's Plug?

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
"You don't care 'bout the water till the well runs dry," goes an old blues refrain. Classical-music fans who may have missed this bit of folk wisdom are discovering it for themselves, now that one of the luxuries of the radio landscape -- weekly national concert broadcasts of the best American orchestras -- is fast disappearing. In the last five years, corporations pinched by the recession have been withdrawing sponsorship for these series, which cost up to $1 million a year to produce. And many classical-radio programmers have come to see the concerts as a nuisance rather than a boon.
These broadcasts are important for many reasons. They offer newcomers to classical music large samplings of repertory in unvarnished performances and a concert context. They allow more devoted listeners to track the progress and programming of orchestras around the country, and with concert tickets selling for as much as $55, they give radio eavesdroppers something for nothing. They introduce new conductors and soloists. And they include new works, giving listeners quick access to pieces likely to cause a stir and granting a moment in the sun to scores that may never be commercially recorded. 
 For orchestras, the broadcasts establish a national profile that can translate into sales of recordings and concert tickets, and an image that helps attract donors. And they serve a crucial archival purpose that is vividly illustrated in the current exhibition of New York Philharmonic broadcasts at the Museum of Television and Radio in New York. They have even, in a way, helped orchestras perpetuate themselves.
"We decided at one point to personalize the orchestra by having the players speak in the intermission features," said Roy Hemming, the producer of the New York Philharmonic's broadcasts during the 1980's. "Week after week the musicians would bring up how important the broadcasts had been for them when they were growing up in different regions of the country. The Philharmonic's broadcasts convinced them that there was more to music than the school orchestra, and helped them set their professional sights."
Right now, the national radio roster is topsy-turvy. There are syndicated broadcasts by the Florida Philharmonic and the Detroit, Baltimore, San Francisco and Pittsburgh Symphonies. All are solid, polished ensembles but not brand names on the level of the so-called Big Five -- the New York Philharmonic, the Cleveland and Philadelphia Orchestras and the Chicago and Boston Symphonies. Yet since 1988, three of the five -- New York, Philadelphia and Boston -- have been off the air.
A fourth, the Cleveland Orchestra, is living on borrowed time. Since December, when the oil company BP stopped underwriting the broadcasts, the orchestra has been using concert recordings from its archive. It must find a new sponsor by the end of the season, and the search is not going well.
"We visited one Fortune 500 company," said Robert Conrad, the president of WCLV, the Cleveland station that produces and syndicates the broadcasts. "On our way to the meeting, we walked past empty office after empty office. We knew then that the company's financial situation precluded their helping us."
Only the Chicago Symphony's broadcasts are going strong. And recently its longtime sponsor, Amoco, asked the orchestra to find other sponsors to share the costs.
The reasons for this decline are many and tangled. Players in the big orchestras receive higher broadcast fees than their less famous counterparts, and most management efforts to save the broadcasts by seeking concessions in pay have been fruitless. By contrast, in Boston, where the symphony musicians regard local broadcasts as community service and demand no fees, concerts are carried live by two stations.
Orchestra broadcasts have a time-honored place on American radio. The New York Philharmonic was the first to take to the airwaves, in 1922, and the first to be carried coast-to-coast, by CBS in 1930. In 1937, NBC created the NBC Symphony for Arturo Toscanini. Concert shows were remarkably popular, and they kept famous conductors and renowned orchestras in the news. When the young Leonard Bernstein replaced an ailing Bruno Walter for the Philharmonic broadcast of Nov. 14, 1943, his debut became a national sensation.
By the mid-1950's, other orchestras were broadcasting, too. Only in the 1960's, when generalized radio formats splintered into special-interest stations, were orchestra broadcasts shunted into a smaller spotlight. Even so, as classical-music stations flourished, so did concert broadcasting. More of the smaller orchestras found sponsorship and broadcast outlets, and through the early 1980's, concert broadcasts were the centerpieces of classical stations' programming.
But as the costs of these shows have been spiraling upward, corporations that long saw them as classy advertising vehicles have been reconsidering, particularly since their own profits are down. Many continue to sponsor the orchestras' concert series and other endeavors. Thus, when Thomas W. Morris, the executive director of the Cleveland Orchestra, laments BP's decision not to renew its $900,000 annual radio sponsorship, he hastens to add, "Even without the radio, BP remains our biggest corporate donor."
Smaller orchestras have been luckier. Their production budgets are lower, and they have been able to tap into the civic pride of locally based companies whose national ambitions match their own. The Florida Philharmonic, formed only seven years ago, has been on the radio for three years in a 13-week, hourlong series syndicated by the Concert Music Network. Its sponsor, Alamo Rent A Car, pays $250,000 a year for the series, which is heard in 43 cities across the United States, and considers it a bargain.
"We do them because we think it's good business," said Mark Cannon, the director of marketing at the Fort Lauderdale company. "The Concert Music Network reaches about 12 million listeners a week. Even if the show is heard in a market where we don't have a rental car location, these are people who travel all over America, and who are likely to visit someplace where we are."
But the high-ticket orchestras that have been searching for corporate sugar daddies these last few years consistently report experiences like Mr. Conrad's in Cleveland.
"I think the days of broadcast seasons supported by huge funders are over," said Ruth Dreier, who produces several concert programs (including those of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam) and has been a consultant to American Public Radio. "Orchestras are going to have to recognize that this kind of funding will never happen again, and that it's folly to keep looking in that direction. What we're going to have to do is build a consortium of sponsors that a lot of orchestras can draw from."
Until recently, sponsors have not wanted to share the spotlight or the on-air gratitude. Amoco's dealings with the Chicago Symphony suggest that things may be changing.
But matters have been further complicated for the large orchestras by mounting deficits, occasioned by a lethal combination of rising costs, dwindling government and corporate subsidies, the same maladies from which the entire American arts world has been suffering in recent years. "The larger orchestras have a broad range of activities that they are raising money for now," said Deborah Borda, the managing director of the New York Philharmonic, "so that while broadcasts are important to us, they are only one of many things that are."
In fact, orchestra managers offer divergent opinions about the importance of broadcasts in the grander scheme. "Outside Cleveland," Mr. Morris said, "the orchestra has three ways of being heard. There are the broadcasts, recordings and tours. Now one of those avenues may be closed to us."
Mr. Morris's colleague at the Chicago Symphony, Henry Fogel, who once ran a classical-radio station in Syracuse, said that determining the place of radio in the list of financial concerns is tricky: "When you are trying to find regular annual contributions, and corporate underwriters for major proj ects like tours, there's no question that you have to make priorities. If you say that radio's a priority, and you get a corporation to underwrite your broadcasts, chances are that you can cross that corporation off your list of companies that will also give you a quarter or half a million dollars for a tour.
"I don't know what's more important to an orchestra," he added, "touring or being on the radio once a week. Most orchestras would say touring. And in terms of the orchestra's image in the community, when we come back from Europe with great reviews, our contributors see it as a sign that this is truly a great orchestra. But I'm not so sure that the people of Chicago think about the fact that the orchestra is heard on some 500 radio stations in the United States."
All this is occurring as classical-radio programmers around the country are asserting that the traditional fly-on-the-wall concert format -- the full concert, with intermission interviews and program notes read by an announcer -- is too dull for listeners today. But the facts sometimes suggest the opposite. A spokesman for WNCN in New York noted recently that the Chicago Symphony's two-hour broadcasts often received the highest ratings of any of the station's programs. This contradicts WNCN's much-emulated programming philosophy, which prizes bright, brisk, unchallenging music and holds that informed comment on the music should be left to textbooks. So the station regards Chicago's success as an anomaly.
"Because Chicago is the only orchestra broadcast we carry," explained Mario G. Mazza, WNCN's director of programming and operations, "it's like a jewel on black velvet. It's perceived as a high-quality product, and it has done well for us in the 25- to 54-year-old demographic. That's why I keep it.
"But I would not want to do a lot of this," he added. "Radio programmers like to maintain control of the sound of the station. And since a lot of orchestras are taking a strong stand on behalf of modern music, a lot of that can show up on the air."
Mr. Mazza is not alone in wanting to control his airwaves. His direct competitor in New York, Warren Bodow of WQXR, has said, "The radio should not necessarily be regarded as a pipeline from the concert hall to the living room." Several years ago Mr. Bodow and other station directors argued that orchestras should allow stations to delete contemporary works. When this was proposed to the New York Philharmonic, in the late 1980's, the orchestra responded that the broadcasts had to run intact or not at all. The stations relented.
The control issue is sometimes negotiable. To the stations, concert broadcasts mean easy profits. The stations incur no production costs. And in important markets the sponsors not only provide the programs free but also buy the air time.
"In television, commercial companies buy the air time, and the stations use the revenue to pay for the programs," said Joseph H. Kluger, the president of the Philadelphia Orchestra, which has been off the air since 1990. "Here, the sponsor is paying for the programming and for the air time. Our sponsor, Cigna, underwrote our programs to promote the image of the company. After five or six years, they concluded that they had accomplished what they set out to do, and their advertising people told them that the arrangement was no longer efficient.
"The problem is," he added, "the stations take the view that they aren't going to be paying for programming in any case. If they don't carry the broadcasts, they can just as easily go into their libraries, put on a couple of compact disks and call it 'The Philadelphia Orchestra Hour.' "
But Ms. Dreier, in an audience study carried out for American Public Radio in 1991 and 1992, found that a majority of listeners preferred concert broadcasts over disk jockeys spinning CD's. In four cities, study groups were drawn from listeners in a demographic group regarded as typical of the public-radio audience nationwide: highly educated, affluent 25- to 45-year-olds, including some who were passionate about classical music and some, mostly at the younger end of the scale, who viewed classics as one interest among many.
"What we found was encouraging," Ms. Dreier said. "Both the audience we have, and the target audience, perceived value in the concert broadcasts. But they have to be produced in a way that is attractive to listeners. Orchestras have to realize that a straight transmission of the concert, with an announcer calling the moves in a not very interesting way, has to change."
Orchestra managers have reached a similar conclusion. Most are considering one-hour shows that include recent performances, interviews and perhaps archival recordings. Still, many believe that even if the major orchestras can recapture their place on the air through such measures, something vital will have been lost.
"In Cleveland," said Mr. Conrad of WCLV, "we want to produce concerts that convey what the audience hears in Severance Hall. These programs are put together carefully by the music director. And his purpose would be defeated if we mixed and matched. We have to do a careful balancing act. While we're a profit-oriented station, we're not in it entirely for the profit. It was our choice to broadcast classical music. If we just wanted to be entrepreneurs, we'd be rocking and rolling."
 
 
 
THE BIG FIVE, DROPPING FROM THE AIR WAVES
 For many years until 1988, all of the Big Five orchestras had national radio outlets for concert broadcasts. One by one, these programs have been disappearing. Here is a status report.

Chicago Symphony Orchestra
On the air, but . . . .
 
 Status: Amoco, the orchestra's longtime radio patron, has asked the symphony managers to find other sponsors to share both costs and credit.
Prospects: "I think we will remain on the air," said Henry Fogel, the orchestra's executive director. "It is conceivable that it will be with a reduced schedule."
 
Cleveland Orchestra
On the air, barely.
Status: When BP, an oil company, withdrew its sponsorship in December, the orchestra began distributing a 13-week series of Mozart concerts from its archive, hoping a new sponsor could be found by May.
Prospects: "We have been looking," said Thomas W. Morris, the orchestra's executive director, "and we are examining alternatives that involve more than one sponsor."
 
Boston Symphony Orchestra
On the air locally, off nationally.
Status: The orchestra never had a national radio sponsor; stations paid for use of its programs until last year. Its concerts are still carried live by both WGBH and WCRB in Boston.
Prospects: "We have a committee that has approached potential sponsors and is working aggressively," said Kenneth Haas, the orchestra's managing director, "but no luck yet."
 
Philadelphia Orchestra
Off the air.
Status: Cigna, an insurance company, withdrew its radio sponsorship in 1990.
Prospects: "We have sent proposals to every conceivable potential sponsor, unsuccessfully," said Joseph H. Kluger, the orchestra's president. "But I'm an eternal optimist."
 
New York Philharmonic
Off the air.
Status: The first orchestra in the country to broadcast its concerts (in 1922), the Philharmonic lost its Exxon sponsorship in 1988.
Prospects: "I know the Philharmonic will be back on the air," said Deborah Borda, the orchestra's managing director. "The question is when, and what the format will be."

HEADLINE: A DIRECTORY CRUISES WORLDWIDE;
Record Bookings in a Buoyant Year

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL; EDWIN McDOWELL reports on travel and tourism for The Times.

 BODY:
THE first two weeks of the year are always the cruise industry's busiest, but reservations during that period this year broke all records. Carnival and Royal Caribbean together booked more than 125,000 passengers in the first week, 8,000 more than last year's record, and other cruise lines also reported big increases. The main reasons for the booking surge, according to industry executives, were pent-up demand and an improving economy.
Reservations have since returned to normal, but if the economy continues to improve and potential world trouble spots stay quiet, the industry expects almost five million passengers this year, 10 percent higher than 1992. At least five new ships are scheduled for delivery this year, at least six others are planned by 1996 -- which, despite the increased bookings, may be too much of a good thing from the industry point of view. 
 While spring and summer itineraries feature few new destinations, some of the more exotic ports of call include Ho Chi Minh City, Warnemunde in the former East Germany, and two of the Baltic states: Riga, Latvia, and Tallinn, Estonia. And Premier will be the first cruise line with regular stopovers at Port Lucaya on Grand Bahama Island.
Many destinations will experience a marked increase in cruise ship visits, including Waterford, Ireland, where Royal Viking will be joined by six other lines, and Dominica, in the Windward Islands, where several ships will be calling at Cabrits, its new port. American Hawaii recently resumed cruises to Kauai, which was closed to cruise ships after Hurricane Iniki tore through last year.
One of the biggest traffic increases will occur in the Panama Canal; 15 ships will cross it this year. Carnival's Tropical will make a series of transcanal sailings from San Juan, marking Carnival's first departure from the Caribbean and Mexico. Sun Line has scheduled three 12-day canal cruises in March, originating in Galveston, Tex. Royal Caribbean, which crossed the canal 10 times last month, will offer two 11-night passages in April.
In the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war, some cruise line officials began referring to the Mediterranean as the Dead Sea. But it is on the itineraries of 17 lines this year, including spring or summer cruises by Windstar, Crown Odyssey and Seven Seas (which will enter European waters for the first time after three seasons in Alaska).
The Mediterranean is often at the mercy of world events, but that area is not alone. Bowing to customer complaints, Seawind Cruise dropped its scheduled port call in Caracas, after two attempted coups rocked the Venezuelan capital last year -- one of them involving shooting in the streets.
Moreover, only a handful of ships will call at sub-Saharan Africa. Part of the reason is lack of the necessary infrastructure to handle large numbers of tourists, but cruise line officials also say many of their passengers generally, if unfairly, equate Africa with famine and civil unrest.
However, Princess Cruises will visit Africa this year for the first time. In November it will offer a 16-day trip between Mombasa, Kenya, and Singapore, with stops at Zanzibar and the Seychelles, as well as a 14-day trip from Athens to Mombasa. Next year its 19-day cruise will stop at Dakar, Senegal, in west Africa.
A record 24 ships will call at Alaska between May and September, at fares for the 7- to 15-day cruises ranging from about $1,000 per person to $4,000. While many ships promote their casinos, fitness centers, sports bars and similar amenities, World Explorer, entering its 16th year in Alaskan waters, says its accent is on learning -- it bills the 12,000-volume library aboard its Universe as the largest afloat.
Regency Cruises also sails to Alaska, as well as South America and the Caribbean. On June 7 it will launch the first of 30 seven-day cruises this year between New York and Montreal -- the most of any line, and double the number it ran previously.
Although still small in numbers of visitors, Asia is the fastest growing cruise destination. The number of ships calling at Singapore more than doubled last year over 1990, and later this year Windstar will be the first cruise line to establish year-round operations there.
At least six cruise lines will call this year at China, the most since the Beijing Government killed and imprisoned protestors in Tiananmen Square in 1989. SeaQuest Cruises alone offers three different itineraries to China this spring, from 11 to 15 days. Ocean Grace, a luxury Japanese cruise ship, will put in at four mainland Chinese cities during an eight-night tour in May. And Pearl Cruises, which claims to have pioneered cruising to China in 1982, will be back again this year and will also visit Vietnam on five different sailings.
Several lines, including Seabourn, will enter Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia for the first time. Others, including Cunard, Sagafjord, Seven Seas, Orient and Pearl, will expand itineraries in the region.
"Unlike some other parts of the world, Asia is stable," said Herb Goodfellow, president of The Travel Company of Atherton, Calif., one of the oldest and largest all-cruise agencies. But future growth will be hampered by inadequate port facilities in the region and high air fares.
While American travelers are not yet flocking to Ukraine, Odessa America Cruise Company ("The Cruise Line of the Czars") offers a seven-day cruise each Saturday from St. Petersburg, Fla., to Honduras, Belize and Cancun.
Those cruises -- aboard the 400-passenger Gruziya ("Georgia"), which is registered in Odessa, Ukraine, and has a Ukrainian and Russian crew -- sail only through May, at which time the ship is repositioned to Montreal for five months.
While exotic destinations usually require two or more weeks, the two- to five-day cruise market continues to be the fastest growing. This summer, for example, for the first time, Regency will offer five "cruises to nowhere" from New York, each of them last two to three days at sea. Majesty is offering four-night cruises from Miami that stop at Playa del Carmen and Cozumel, Mexico.
Prices are about the same as last year, especially to such competitive destinations as the Caribbean, which accounts for more than 60 percent of all cruises, and from West Coast ports to Mexico. Moreover, at least six new ships are scheduled to join the fleet this year, including Carnival's Sensation (2,600 passengers), the CostaRomantica (1,350), Norwegian's Windward (1,246), the Crown Dynasty (820), and two from Holland America -- the Statendam (1,266) and its sister ship, the Maasdam (1,266). The 7,869 new berths will bring the industry total to well above 100,000 for the first time, but they will also add to what critics complain is the overcapacity that has driven fares on many East Coast cruises to the Caribbean and West Coast cruises to Mexico to levels below $100 a night per person, includng air fare.
And there appears to be little let-up. Carnival and Holland America (a subsidiary of Carnival) each has a new ship scheduled for delivery next year, while Carnival has yet another one scheduled for 1995, by which time industry officials had hoped the shipbuilding binge would pause to let demand (and higher prices) catch up with supply. Last month Carnival announced plans for a 2,600-passenger ship, for delivery in 1996, while Princess said it would build a 1,950-passenger ship to enter service in the fall of 1995.
A new Miami-based line, American Family Cruises, recently announced that in December it would begin seven-day Caribbean cruises for families with children, adding Alaska in the summer of 1994. While its two ships are refurbished rather than new, its 2,800 berths will add to the competition. And while not a direct competitor, the Delta Queen Steamboat Company, the New Orleans-based line that plys America's inland rivers, also expects to take delivery of a new paddlewheel late next year, its third boat.
The care and feeding of children is on the minds of many in the industry, not just the marketing officials at American Family Cruises. While cruises often include movies and menus for the younger set, Celebrity's 1993 cruises to Bermuda have expanded the offerings to face painting, scavenger hunts, dance lessons, video tournaments and photo contests. Dolphin's cruises feature Fred Flintstone and Yogi-bear characters. Holland America will provide youth counselors aboard its cruises during spring break, and will offer activities for teenagers and preteens.
SUCH new approaches are important in the current highly competitive market. "Overcapacity is making it hard for the cruise industry," said Mr. Goodfellow. He characterized last year's discounted fares to Mexico and the Caribbean as "a bloodbath," and said he expected a repetition in 1993.
To avoid such a fate, many cruise lines now give their biggest discounts to passengers who book earliest, then reduce the discount as departure dates near. Royal Caribbean pioneered the concept last year, and at least a half-dozen other lines have adopted similar programs. This year, as part of a $40 million advertising campaign, Royal Caribbean has a toll-free number for potential customers to request brochures and videos.
Holland America is offering early booking discounts of up to 10 percent for its cruises to Europe, starting from New York in May, and savings of up to $400 per couple on its cruises to Alaska. Seabourn passengers booking two successive cruises totaling 21 days or more can save up to 50 percent for one of the two cruises. Celebrity is offering 50 percent off for the second person on selected 10- and 11-night cruises to the Caribbean. And Radisson is offering 50 percent off the published tariff rates on its Caribbean trips in March.
But travel agents say many passengers are still likely to wait for, and get, last-minute deals on the most competive cruises.
And discounting remains so rampant that several lines are considering omitting the rate sheet from future brochures.

HEADLINE: Apartment Rentals Tightening

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
FUELED by a growing demand and a slowly shrinking supply, rents for New York City's unregulated apartments, which had declined significantly since the stock market crash in 1987, are starting to show signs of bottoming out.
To be sure, few brokers foresee a quick return to the days of the mid-80's when finding a decent rental -- at least by New York standards -- required a bribe called "key" money or a perusal of funeral notices for soon-to-be vacated apartments. 
 Indeed, the market continues to be very soft, and rents last year dropped in many parts of the city, particularly in areas where gentrification never fully took hold and for such apartments as studios, small one-bedrooms, fourth-floor walk-ups and units in buildings without doormen.
But the rent declines were not, for the most part, as steep as they were in previous years. Overall, rents in New York have dropped about 15 percent since the real estate recession began in 1988, about half as much as the sale prices of co-ops and condominiums.
Moreover, at the luxury end of the market and in a few select neighborhoods, rents appear to have stabilized. And in some places, such as parts of Brooklyn, Queens, Westchester County and midtown Manhattan, some rents have even started to rise.
"What we are seeing now is a tightening of the market," said Alan Rogers, managing partner for Douglas Elliman, which, along with Feathered Nest and J.I. Sopher and Company, is one of the three largest rental brokers in the city.
"You have much less product around and you are obviously going to get an increase in prices, and that is actually happening," Mr. Rogers said. "I see rents going up 10 percent this year."
Some tenants have already felt the change in the market. In 1990, for example, Barbara Schassar easily found a large one-bedroom duplex in the West Village of Manhattan for $1,875 a month -- not cheap but probably less than a comparable apartment in the same neighborhood would have commanded a few years earlier.
"There were good deals out there, and rents had declined," said Ms. Schassar, a lawyer who paid $2,800 in 1988 to live in a two-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side. She lived in London and Tokyo in 1989.
LAST year, though, Ms. Schassar sought a new apartment in the West Village. She wanted the same amount of space, but, to accommodate her two dogs, she wanted a two-bedroom unit. She eventually found such a unit. The rent was $2,295 a month.
"The tenant wasn't even out of the apartment yet and the landlord said, 'If you don't take it, someone else will,' " said Ms. Schassar, who rented the unit. "I think the rents may have come full circle in the course of five years."
The ups and downs in rents in recent years have had little effect on those who live in an estimated 1.3 million rent-stabilized or -controlled units, about 70 percent of the city's 1.9 million apartments. The rest are market-rate apartments that either fall outside the rent-regulation system or have had a high turnover, and thus have more frequent rent increases. Unregulated apartments include those in buildings with fewer than six living units or those built without tax incentives since 1973.
Many tenants in unregulated apartments, however, are not experiencing rising rents -- at least not yet. If renewing a lease, they are often still able to negotiate one with no increase in rent. And if searching for a new apartment, they are often able to negotiate a lease for a new apartment for hundreds of dollars less than the landlord is seeking. In some cases, they may even pay less rent than would be required for a comparable rent-stabilized apartment.
Further, an increase in rents isn't discernible in two reports released last month by the National Cooperative Bank in Washington and Feathered Nest.
The National Cooperative Bank report, which surveyed 109 units, showed that, overall, rents declined by 6 percent in 1992, about the same amount as they did in 1991. In three areas, though, rents increased. They are midtown Manhattan, by 9 percent; Brooklyn and Queens by 7.5 percent and Westchester County by 5.9 percent.
Rents, according to the National Cooperative Bank, showed the greatest decrease -- 14.8 percent -- in Lower Manhattan. On the Upper West Side the drop was 4.2 percent and on the Upper East Side, 2.7 percent.
"My feeling is that you are going to see a stabilization this year," said Grace A. Huebscher, a corporate vice president with the bank. "I don't think you will see another decline."
FEATHERED NEST'S report, which surveyed almost 10,000 apartments, showed that rents in 1992 declined or stayed the same for virtually all sizes and types of apartments in most parts of the city. Even so, Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, said that conditions in the rental market were changing, more rapidly than renters might realize.
"Prices are no longer very negotiable and owners are no longer are paying commissions," she said. "And because of the 20 percent drop in the supply of available apartments, prices should begin to rise this year."
Ms. Packes said that her survey covered 60 to 80 percent of the unregulated rental market in Manhattan and that the existing rental stock was gradually being absorbed because there was no new construction coming onto the market.
She noted that despite the large number of individual co-op and condominium owners who could not sell their units and had rented them out, there were fewer rentals available last year in her listings (9,881) than in 1991 (11,655) and 1990 (13,902). The number of listings last year, though, was still far more than the 2,684 recorded by Feathered Nest in 1987, when the rental market was at its tightest.
"The rental market is shrinking," she said.
Added Mr. Rogers of Douglas Elliman: "The product is not there anymore. There is definitely a shortage of specialty apartments. All you have is turnover of the existing product, and even a lot of that is now being sold. People are getting the prices they wanted two years ago when there was a stalemate."
HE noted that many new large apartment buildings, such as the six-year-old Windsor Court, a 31-floor, 709-unit building on Lexington Avenue and 31st Street, had had high vacancy rates for several years but had filled during the last two years. "We have started a waiting list for the next three months," he said.
He also said the rents at Windsor Court had returned to their original levels; a one-bedroom apartment in the luxury complex now rents for about $1,600 a month, he said, up from the $1,400 charged in 1990.
Furthermore, Mr. Rogers said, renewal rates are increasing and, unlike what was happening in the last few years, renters are requesting long-term leases, usually for two years, which were common before the recession.
"People were reluctant to make long-term commitments," he said. "I think we're going to see two-year leases again."
Individual landlords are also having little difficulty finding tenants. Ms. Packes of Feathered Nest estimated that about 60 to 70 percent of the rentals currently seeking tenants are owned by individuals rather than large corporations, such as Glenwood Property Management, which owns dozens of high-rise apartment buildings in the city.
One such individual landlord, Ed Baum, who owns a 1,200-square-foot, two-bedroom floor-through co-op in a brownstone in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn, recently rented it with the help of a broker. "It has gone very smooth so far," he said. "It's a new experience for me, being a landlord -- I never drew up a lease before. A key concern for me was to find a tenant that would enjoy living in a space that we tried to make our home for seven years. And I think we did that."
Ms. Packes noticed another trend indicating that rents might be rising: Building owners are no longer paying brokers a fee for finding tenants.
Indeed, when Ms. Schassar rented her new apartment in the West Village, she was originally told that the owner of the building would pay the broker's fee. Just before signing a lease, however, she was told that the policy had changed, that the owner would pay only half the fee.
"It's starting to move back to the tenants paying the standard 15 percent of the annual rent," Ms. Packes said.
The dominant dynamic involved in the rental market these days is the decreasing supply. Ms. Packes, added, though, that there also appeared to be many people who, in the past, would have bought apartments but were now renting, increasing the demand.
She said that even though they were able to afford buying an apartment and could get financing, they were also frightened by the outlook for the economy, particularly their own jobs.
Some are also worried about the low rate of appreciation and the lack of liquidity associated with any real estate investment in recent years. Others do not expect to stay in the city for the five to seven years that many brokers believe is now necessary to make buying a home in New York a profitable proposition.
Then there are also co-op and condominium owners, such as James A. Goldsmith, who can't sell their units, rent them out and then become renters themselves. "I don't have a lot of confidence in the market, and I'm not sure co-ops are necessarily a great form of ownership," Mr. Goldsmith said.
LIKE many apartment owners in Manhattan, Mr. Goldsmith never expected to become a landlord, much less a tenant. He bought his two-bedroom apartment on East 97th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues in 1987 at the insider price of $141,000. With the birth of his second child in 1990 he needed a larger apartment and put his unit on the market for $250,000. There were no bidders.
So Mr. Goldsmith, who is 36 years old and a real estate broker, rented his apartment. He charged $1,800 a month, but had what he described as a problem tenant who often paid his rent late.
A year later, he put his apartment on the market again, this time for $175,000. Once again, there were no bidders. "We had some people who looked and said they liked it, but nothing ever materialized," he said.
In 1991, Mr. Goldsmith again rented out his apartment. This time, however, it fetched only $1,500 a month, far from the amount necessary to cover the monthly mortgage and $1,100 maintenance payments. On top of the negative cash flow, he is also paying rent on his six-room apartment on East 81 Street between Third and Lexington Avenues.
"We'll probably try to sell again in the summer," he said. "It depends on the market, how people feel about the economy and what other apartments in the building have been sold for."

Builder's Motto: 'Move On, Clean House'

BYLINE: By MAUREEN MILFORD

DATELINE: GREENVILLE, DEL.

 BODY:
Packing is a pleasure for Vernon and Beverly Toulson, or so they say. It is certainly a familiar experience. They have moved 21 times in the last 23 years.
The most recent move was from Vero Beach, Fla., to Delaware, where they lived temporarily in Mr. Toulson's parents' house before moving six months later into a new house in this high-end residential suburb half a dozen miles northwest of Wilmington. They sold the house in Vero Beach after having lived in it a year and now their 6,400-square-foot French-country-style house here is on the market for $950,000. 
 Through his company, Toulson Builders, the 48-year-old Mr. Toulson has built 15 of the houses they have lived in over the 23 years, including the current one.
He said that he fell into the pattern in the early years as a way of saving money and limiting his risk. Also, he said, he found it easier to get construction financing when the lender knew that he was going to live in the house as a primary residence.
"Obviously there are some savings." he said. "I'm not paying interest on two mortgages and two electric bills and all those things. But when we sell, we have to pay capital gains and moving costs and points on a new mortgage, so in the end it's probably a wash."
He likened himself to a new-car dealer who enjoys riding around in a new car, showing off his product and selling it to get the money for a newer model. Sometimes the sale takes only two months; one took two years.
When the current house is sold, he said, he probably will buy another for $300,000 to $350,000, live in it, improve it and then -- as always -- sell it.
The interior of the manor house here reflects the unusual Toulson life style. The large rooms lack the familiar clutter of ordinary family living. This is not just an illusion created by the 10- to 22-foot ceilings and the absence of curtains and draperies on the large windows. The usual odds and ends of note paper near the kitchen telephone are missing; the paneled library is strikingly spare -- no books, family photos or other memorabilia. Even the walk-in closets -- the size of most bedrooms -- are pristine in their neatness.
Perhaps the most personal room belongs to the couple's daughter Kelley, 19. Another daughter, Kim, 25, moved back to Dover, Del., from Florida about eight years ago to live with her grandmother and finish high school with her childhood friends. Today both daughters say they will never move.
The homes have ranged from modest 2,400-square-foot houses built in the early 70's in Seaford, Del., to the 6,400-square-foot house the family now has in the exclusive Versailles area of Greenville. The most expensive home the family lived in was one on the waterfront on John's Island, Fla., that they built in 1989 and sold for $1.4 million.
In each home, including those in some glitzy areas of Florida, the Toulsons recycled the same Queen Anne dining room suite and Chippendale living room furniture they started with. But Mrs. Toulson, the daughter of a Delaware builder who built custom homes for employees of Delaware's major chemical companies in the 60's, has learned to pare down. Her rule of thumb is if it hasn't been used in six months, out it goes.
"My mother will tell me I need such and such appliance and I always say, 'No, I'll just have to move it,' " she said.
Mrs. Toulson, who recently opened her own decorating business, also learnedhow to adapt her life style to the need to sell. She's not a collector, nor does she believe in making a personal statement with her decorating. That does not sell homes.
"We do most everything with somebody else in mind -- with the idea of resale," she said. "We would never do anything just related to our family."
The Versailles home now on the market is the first house in Delaware the Toulsons have built since moving back to the state after building in exclusive communities in Florida through the 80's.
After some market research, Mr. Toulson decided to build a grand speculative house on nearly three acres of what was once the park on the estate of Victor duPont. The idea is to show Wilmington's wealthier potential purchasers a sample of his work. The site was bought from a developer who had put in roads and utilities.
Last year the Toulsons won the Regal award from the Home Builders Association of Delaware for the best house with more than 2,500 square feet. But it has been for sale since July and remains unsold, as do dozens of others of extravagant homes, both old and new, that dot what is know locally as "Chateau Country."
Once almost exclusively the domain of the heirs to the E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company chemical fortune, much of the rolling countryside has gone under the bulldozer in recent years. Several large parcels, formerly held by the du Ponts or senior managers of the company, have been sold as subdivisions, albeit with homes priced from $800,000 to more than $1 million.
Developers, some of whose immigrant grandfathers did construction work for du Ponts,moved into the old du Pont mansions with the lovely French names while they put up $850,000 homes often called "McMansions." Mr. Toulson himself and his father before him worked at "the Company."
After nearly 75 years of Old World, almost royal living, the children of some of the industrialists who built fortunes from the two World Wars and the subsequent rebuilding, are being forced to sell property to pay millions in taxes on illiquid land assets.
"The real developer is Death," said William Sellers, director of environmental management for the Brandywine Conservancy in Chadds Ford, Pa. "Estate taxes on land can be disastrous for families who didn't do a lot of planning -- people can really be left with zero."
Those landowners who managed to sell in the 80's can now count themselves lucky.Credit for developers has become almost nonexistent in Delaware. Furthermore, in this tiny state it is well known by bankers and buyers alike that huge houses, whether old or new, are just not moving for a variety of social and economic reasons.
"I'm not sure how much of a market segment there is for the big home," said Mrs. Toulson. "Of course, we only have the one. For those people sitting with five or six spec houses it could be a little bit scary."
Mathematically, a buyer would have to make well into six figures to be able to comfortably maintain and support a million-dollar house, even if very little was financed.
A corporate executive with a major Delaware company recently bought an $825,000 home in Chateau Country -- actually New Castle County. He financed $650,000 at 9 percent, bringing his monthly payments to slightly more than $5,300. His annual income, therefore, had to run about $250,000 to meet lending requirements.
But according to information supplied by the Delaware State Data Center, only 1 percent of households in Delaware, or 3,487 families, make $150,000 and up. Real estate agents say the only segment feeling sanguine about trading up are physicians and others with health-care businesses. Christopher S. Patterson of Patterson-Schwartz & Associates, a Wilmington real estate agency that has traditionally gotten most of the upper-income listings, says physicians are almost the only buyers looking in the million-dollar price range.
Some real estate agents say, however, that even physicians are seized by uncertainty as the nation struggles to deal with the health-care crisis and the talk of reducing the mortgage interest deduction. Libby Zurkow, an agent with Patterson-Schwartz, said several of her physician clients had opted to buy lower-priced houses.
Mrs. Toulson says when she and her husband do sell their million-dollar property they will move to an upper-middle-class subdivision where homes in the $350,000 price range are similar to the kind that were built by her father. But they won't stay.
"We'll fix it up and move," she said. "I don't think we'll ever stay in one house. I simply can't imagine living in any house for more than, say, two years."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Deals With Foreigners;
A Wrong Number, or Color, Can Terminate Talks

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
SINCE nearly a third of the 350 or so corporate tenants in the World Trade Center's four buildings are Asian, you'd think there would be a smattering of them in Building No. 4. There's nary a one.
Why? 
 Because the number 4 is to many Asians what the number 13 is to many Americans.
"One Thai tenant even refused to rent Suite 28-14 in Tower No. 2 because there was a four in the address," said George Rossi, the complex's assistant director.
People can talk about global economies and homogenized business practices all they want. The fact is, renting space to a foreign company is still a -- well, foreign experience.
Landlords tell of Japanese tenants who expect leases to be just five pages long, since so much rental business is done on a handshake in Japan. They tell of Eastern European tenants who, despite perestroika, do not understand the concept of landlords' profit. They tell of Chinese tenants who balk at green doors because green signifies bad luck.
Indeed, talks with brokers, landlords and architects turn up a host of war stories about accommodating to a foreign client's needs. There are locational and layout requirements that, to Americans, seem to make no sense. There are conflicts between wanting to blend in with their neighbors while retaining their cultural identity.
And perhaps most of all, there are negotiations that seem to last forever.
Mara R. Spiegel, a vice president who handles investment sales for Helmsley-Spear, routinely has to renegotiate building prices with Italian buyers after they had gone to contract, when American companies would think the price was chiseled in stone.
"There is a barter mentality in the Mediterranean countries, and bargaining lasts to the last moment," she said. "The problem is, we expect them to operate our way and they expect us to operate their way."
Japanese companies often refuse to sign a lease until even low-level employees agree that the space is right.
"When a deal falls through, the Japanese see it as a learning experience, not a setback," said Jeffrey Lichtenberg, a partner in Peter R. Friedman Ltd., a Manhattan brokerage that often represents the Sumitomo Corporation, both as landlord and tenant.
Actually, the time problems with foreign companies can be procedural as well as cultural. They often must get approval from the home office before agreeing to lease or design terms that change dozens of times during typical negotiations.
Moreover, landlords often hold out for huge security deposits or letters of credit to make sure that if the tenant defaults, they can still get their rent.
"You don't want to chase someone to Europe to sue," said Edward A. Friedman, president of Newmark Retail Services.
The time lag can be particularly large when it comes to high-image retailers. Richard Evans, vice president of New Spectrum Realty Services, helped Gianfranco Ferre, the big Italian designer, find its new store on Madison and 70th. It took more than a year to consummate the deal, Mr. Evans reported -- not because of sticky negotiations, but because the company's architects had to sign off on every aspect of the design.
"For European designers, their New York stores aren't just profit centers, they are showcases to the world," Mr. Evans said.
As frustrating as the time lags, brokers say, are clients who refuse to be steered around pitfalls.
G. Tyson Maroon, a senior director of Cushman & Wakefield, tells of one Japanese company that wanted to expand a distribution center to include a customer service area. Since a lot of high-priced space was at stake, Mr. Maroon offered to try for a long-term lease at a lower rental than they were paying. His client, afraid to alienate the landlord, insisted on negotiating alone.
The upshot: What should have been a five-month negotiation stretched to two years -- and the client didn't get a long lease or the best price.
"Their nature is to not confront, to wear the opposition down, and it just doesn't work in real estate," Mr. Maroon said.
NEWMARK'S Mr. Friedman recalls trying to persuade the Sock Shop, a British hosiery chain, that if it opened stores too close to each other in Manhattan it would be cannibalizing its own markets.
"In London such clusters had helped them keep competition at bay, and they figured it would work here," Mr. Friedman said.
The too-close locations, combined with bad merchandising decisions, killed the Sock Shop's chances in New York.
Other brokers report missed opportunities on the part of overly conservative foreign clients. Mr. Maroon was surprised when an Indian company passed up a chance to rent the space under its store, even though access to the basement would have made the space far easier to sublet.
"An American or Korean firm would have intuitively taken the space," Mr. Maroon said. "The Indian companies pay more attention to numbers than to gut instinct."
By contrast, he says, German clients readily take risks. A few months ago, Lufthansa "pounced on the idea" of using a barter firm to trade some high-rent space it wasn't using for air and print advertising time.
"Getting Americans comfortable with barter takes a lot longer," Mr. Maroon said.
But not as long as getting South Americans comfortable with inflation, American style. Steven P. Pressler, managing director of Promenade Real Estate, which manages many Brazilian-owned buildings in New York, says that South Americans who own buildings here often insist on escalation clauses tied to consumer price index increases, even if they might do better with, say, a porter's wage escalation.
"They're used to rampant inflation, and they sleep better knowing they're protected against its effects," Mr. Pressler said.
Cultural differences are not confined to the negotiating table. Architects chase different parameters for foreign clients, too.
"COMPANIES with ancient ethnic traditions want their space to reflect their roots," said Matthew Cusumano, a partner at Manhattan-based SCR Design Organization who put a Buddha in the Bank of Thailand's reception room at 40 East 52d Street and set up a tent at the entrance to Saudi Petroleum's offices at 527 Madison Avenue, near 52d Street.
Actually, it's more than their roots; often it's their current traditions. Mr. Cusumano included an eastern-facing conference room in Royal Air Moroc's offices at 55 East 59th Street so employees who wished to pray toward Mecca could do so. Others report that, because German custom dictates that all employees must sit within 20 feet of a window, German companies are rarely attracted to the huge loftlike spaces that Japanese companies, with their penchant for open office layouts, covet.
Japanese companies also require one or two rooms with armchairs, sofas and coffee tables, more similar to living rooms than conference rooms.
Why? Japanese tradition dictates that only after exchanging pleasantries in an informal setting do you move to meeting rooms for actual negotiations.
The paternal relationship that many Japanese companies have with their employees also has an impact on where they set up shop.
The Hitachi Corporation recently moved from one Westchester building to another across the street, with no appreciable improvement in space or rent terms, solely because the second had a cafeteria. Marubeni America Corporation recently leased 85,000 square feet at 450 Lexington Avenue, near 45th Street; the company passed up a chance to lease similar space, at much less money, at Americas Towers, because it was four long blocks farther from Grand Central Station and most of its employees lived in Westchester and Connecticut.
"The Japanese tend to work late and their main concern is the safety of their staff," said Jeffrey A. Landers of Landers Commercial Real Estate, which handled both deals.
Mr. Rossi recently came up against tradition of another sort. He wanted to get a Chinese restaurant into prime space in the World Trade Center. He couldn't even get prospects to return his calls. The reason, he found out: The site faced a cemetery, and to the Chinese, that was bad luck.
"I should have guessed," Mr. Rossi said.

HEADLINE: Focus: Greenville, Del.;
Builder's Motto: 'Move On, Clean House'

BYLINE: By MAUREEN MILFORD

DATELINE: GREENVILLE, DEL.

 BODY:
PACKING is a pleasure for Vernon and Beverly Toulson, or so they say. It is certainly a familiar experience. They have moved 21 times in the last 23 years.
The most recent move was from Vero Beach, Fla., to Delaware, where they lived temporarily in Mr. Toulson's parents' house before moving six months later into a new house in this high-end residential suburb half a dozen miles northwest of Wilmington. They sold the house in Vero Beach after having lived in it a year and now their 6,400-square-foot French-country-style house here is on the market for $950,000. 
 Through his company, Toulson Builders, the 48-year-old Mr. Toulson has built 15 of the houses they have lived in over the 23 years, including the current one. He said that he fell into the pattern in the early years as a way of saving money and limiting his risk and that he found it easier to get construction financing when the lender knew he was going to live in the house as a primary residence.
"Obviously there are some savings." he said. "I'm not paying interest on two mortgages and two electric bills and all those things. But when we sell, we have to pay capital gains and moving costs and points on a new mortgage, so in the end it's probably a wash."
He likened himself to a new-car dealer who enjoys riding around in a new car, showing off his product and selling it to get the money for a newer model. Sometimes the sale takes only two months; one took two years.
When the current house is sold, he said, he probably will buy another for $300,000 to $350,000, live in it, improve it and then -- as always -- sell it.
The interior of the manor house here reflects the unusual Toulson life style. The large rooms lack the familiar clutter of ordinary family living. This is not just an illusion created by the 10-to 22-foot ceilings and the absence of curtains and draperies on the large windows. The usual odds and ends of note paper near the kitchen telephone are missing; the paneled library is strikingly spare -- no books, family photos or other memorabilia. Even the walk-in closets -- the size of most bedrooms -- are pristine in their neatness.
Perhaps the most personal room belongs to the couple's daughter Kelley, 19. Another daughter, Kim, 25, moved back to Dover, Del., from Florida about eight years ago to live with her grandmother and finish high school with her childhood friends. Today both daughters say they will never move.
The homes have ranged from modest 2,400-square-foot houses built in the early 70's in Seaford, Del., to the 6,400-square-foot house the family now has in the exclusive Versailles area of Greenville. The most expensive home the family lived in was one on the waterfront on John's Island, Fla., that they built in 1989 and sold for $1.4 million.
In each home, including those in some glitzy areas of Florida, the Toulsons recycled the same Queen Anne dining room suite and Chippendale living room furniture they started with when they got married. But Mrs. Toulson, the daughter of a Delaware builder who built custom homes for employees of Delaware's major chemical companies in the 60's, has learned to pare down. Her rule of thumb is if it hasn't been used in six months, out it goes.
"My mother will tell me I need such and such appliance and I always say, 'No, I'll just have to move it,' " she said.
Mrs. Toulson, who recently opened her own decorating business, also learned how to adapt her life style to the need to sell. She's not a collector, nor does she believe in making a personal statement with her decorating. That does not sell homes.
"We do most everything with somebody else in mind -- with the idea of resale," she said. "We would never do anything just related to our family."
The Versailles home now on the market is the first house in Delaware the Toulsons have built since moving back to the state after building in exclusive communities in Florida through the 80's.
After some market research, Mr. Toulson decided to build a grand speculative house on nearly three acres of what was once the park on the estate of Victor duPont. The idea is to show Wilmington's wealthier potential purchasers a sample of his work. The site was bought from a developer who had put in roads and utilities.
LAST year the Toulsons won the Regal award from the Home Builders Association of Delaware for the best house with more than 2,500 square feet. But it has been for sale since July and remains unsold, as do dozens of others of extravagant homes, both old and new, that dot what is know locally as "Chateau Country."
Once almost exclusively the domain of the heirs to the E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company chemical fortune, much of the rolling countryside has gone under the bulldozer in recent years. Several large parcels, formerly held by the du Ponts or senior managers of the company, have been sold as subdivisions, albeit with homes priced from $800,000 to more than $1 million.

After nearly 75 years of Old World, almost royal living, the children of some of the industrialists who built fortunes from the two World Wars and the subsequent rebuilding, are being forced to sell property to pay millions in taxes on illiquid land assets.
"The real developer is Death," said William Sellers, director of environmental management for the Brandywine Conservancy in Chadds Ford, Pa. "Estate taxes on land can be disastrous for families who didn't do a lot of planning -- people can really be left with zero."
Those landowners who managed to sell in the 80's can now count themselves lucky. Credit for developers has become almost nonexistent in Delaware. Furthermore, in this tiny state it is well known by bankers and buyers alike that huge houses, whether old or new, are just not moving for a variety of social and economic reasons.

Mathematically, a buyer would have to make well into six figures to be able to comfortably maintain and support a million-dollar house, even if very little was financed.
A corporate executive with a major Delaware company recently bought an $825,000 home in Chateau Country -- actually New Castle County. He financed $650,000 at 9 percent, bringing his monthly payments to slightly more than $5,300. His annual income, therefore, had to run about $250,000 to meet lending requirements.
BUT according to information supplied by the Delaware State Data Center, only 1 percent of households in Delaware, or 3,487 families, make $150,000 and up. Real estate agents say the only segment feeling sanguine about trading up are physicians and others with health-care businesses. Christopher S.

HEADLINE: The Man Who Would Be Governor Again

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
AT 8:30 on a brisk Wednesday morning, 150 members of Italian-American organizations around the state trouped to Drumthwacket, the Governor's mansion in Princeton, to join Jim Florio and his wife, Lucinda, for breakfast.
As the guests milled about the first floor, engaging in ritual small talk and nibbling on Italian pastries, their hosts were pursuing a ritual of their own in the upstairs apartment -- a breakfast of cereal, bananas and coffee. 
 "No matter how many breakfasts we have to go to, we always have our Cheerios together in the morning," Governor Florio said later during a day that seemed largely devoted to his all-but-announced candidacy for re-election. His prospects have brightened considerably since the time when his public approval ratings were less than 30 percent; in fact, polls now show him on a par with both candidates running for the Republican nomination.
During this 11-hour day, the Governor traveled hundreds of miles by car, train and helicopter; gave four speeches; met with Republican legislative leaders and generally set forth the political themes that are likely to be repeated in the months to come.
9 A.M.: The Florios walk hand in hand down the stairs. Mrs. Florio is immediately surrounded by a circle of guests while her husband works the room, exchanging handshakes and smiles with the predominantly male crowd.
Thirty minutes later, he stands with his wife on a flight of steps and delivers a casual 10-minute speech. He says he will soon introduce the third state budget in a row that calls for no new taxes while providing more funds for education. The brash political gamble he took in his first year in office, when he pushed through the largest tax increase in the state's history, is now paying off, he says.
President Clinton's victory, Mr. Florio suggests, is a vindication of sorts for his own style of government: "I think the American people voted for active leadership. You look at the problems, you analyze them, you put together a plan and then you move forward. That's obviously what we've been trying to do in New Jersey."
9:48 A.M.: The Governor, outfitted in a dark gray single-breasted suit and paisley tie, slides into the back seat of a black 1992 Fleetwood, which immediately moves out onto Route 206. A state trooper is at the wheel; another state trooper drives the car that follows close behind. Over the next hours, Mr. Florio will be accompanied by as many as four troopers and will exchange not a word with any of them.
As the Fleetwood heads south toward Trenton, Mr. Florio holds up scraps of paper on which his breakfast guests have jotted down their names and telephone numbers. "I've got notes in every pocket," he says. The paper ends up in a leather portfolio he will carry with him all day.
In part, the Governor says, his heavy schedule of public appearances reflects the lack of attention New York television and radio stations pay to New Jersey events. "The problem in our state is the inability to communicate," he comments. "If you want to try to punch through with a message, you've literally got to go out and do it yourself."
Mr. Florio does not easily engage in small talk. "I'm comfortable with silence," he says. "I'm not bothered by lulls in the conversation." In private encounters he is intense, formal and in control. His friends attribute that to his politeness; his critics say he is aloof and even arrogant.
He seems most comfortable when the topic is substantive, like health care or the environment. Even when confronted with a direct question about his personal life, he often finds ways to turn the conversation in another direction. Asked about his grandchildren, he replies that Matthew is 4 and Chelsea is 3 -- and then abruptly begins a detailed explanation of how his administration is improving the state's economy.
As Trenton comes in view, the Governor considers another question: growing up in Brooklyn, did he ever consider a career other than politics? "I always wanted to be a New York City cop," he replies. "My ethic was that you had made it if you got a city job. A city job was forever."
10:11 A.M.: When the limousine pulls up to the side entrance to the State House, Mr. Florio is quickly out the door and on his way. He is an athlete, a former amateur boxer, a jogger, and he strides rapidly through a winding series of hallways to his office.
The Governor's office is surprisingly small -- 10 feet by 15 feet. He works there in shirtsleeves, sipping coffee brought by his administrative assistant, Tina Lado. On the wall is a photograph of Woodrow Wilson when he was Governor of New Jersey and used the same leather-covered desk where Mr. Florio is seated.
"Here, look at this," Mr. Florio says, passing along a letter from Kiwi International Airlines. "They're thanking us for what our guaranteed loan programs have done to help them expand their business. That's what economic development is all about."
10:33 A.M.: The Governor sets out double time on the one-block walk to Thomas A. Edison State College, where he is to speak before a special meeting of the State League of Municipalities. Somehow, the state troopers manage to keep up.
The speech echoes the theme of his earlier talk (the 1990 tax increase is paying off) but is tailored slightly for his audience of 100 municipal officials with references to his programs to help the cities.
"You're not just talking to the people who are there," Mr. Florio says later. "You're talking to people who are going to be talking to other people."
On his way out, the Governor is set upon by a group of reporters and photographers and asked for his reaction to the news that both Republican candidates for Governor had once hired illegal aliens. He declines to comment -- except to say that neither he nor any of his Cabinet members has ever hired illegal aliens.
11:15 A.M.: Back in his office, Mr. Florio convenes the daily meeting of what he calls his "core group," which includes Joseph C. Salema, the chief of staff; Brenda Bacon, the chief of management and planning; M. Robert DeCotis, the chief counsel, and Jon Shure, the director of communications.
The sessions are held in the office next to his -- a huge paneled room that was once used as the Governor's office. Visitors are not welcome.
Mr. Florio's aides say he is a reasonable, polite boss, though he has a short fuse in one regard. "If there's one thing that makes this man go off in a second," Ms. Lado says, "it's not returning a phone call or a letter."
11:55 A.M.: A Sikorsky S-76B helicopter, piloted by two state troopers, rises from the heliport a few hundred yards from the State House. The Governor is on his way to Parsippany to deliver the keynote address to the annual luncheon meeting of the Morris County Chamber of Commerce.
Wearing silver-framed bifocals and moving his lips slightly, Mr. Florio spends the 20-minute ride editing his speech, which is printed in extra- large type on 50 pages. A car driven by a state trooper awaits him at the Morristown Airport, and when he arrives at the Parsippany Hilton, he is immediately ushered to the dais.
The Governor does not like to eat in front of a crowd, he says, and does not touch the food in front of him. On most days, he grabs a bite at a local diner or in the car; on this day, he has no lunch at all.
During his speech, he hardly looks at the manuscript over which he has labored so hard. He knows the speech by heart: New Jersey's move toward economic recovery is largely the result of tough decisions made early in his administration.
Later he comments: "We've been saying the same thing for the past three years. We were out there talking with nobody listening. But people are listening now."
1:45 P.M.: Newark is the next stop, and on the way, word comes over the car phone that Christine Todd Whitman has just officially announced her candidacy for governor and pledged to roll back all the tax increases Mr. Florio has imposed.
"That's great," Mr. Florio says, deadpan. He would like to know, he adds, what programs Ms. Whitman plans to cut.
"The $1.5 billion in added school assistance came out of what we've done," Mr. Florio says. "If you want to be out there saying you're going to de-fund the school financing system, that's fine. Go do it."
2:06 P.M.: The Governor arrives at N.J. Transit's Broad Street Station, 21 minutes behind the written schedule for the day. He is a stickler for staying on schedule, his aides say.
At the Newark station, Mr. Florio boards a special train that will take him and about 100 officials and reporters to a site deep in the Kearny Meadowlands. The occasion: groundbreaking ceremonies for the long-awaited "Kearny Connection," a $60 million link that will enable residents of North Jersey to commute directly into New York's Penn Station.
Reporters and television crews follow the Governor into a special car stocked with coffee, cake and cookies.
"There are a few things I am an expert on," he says. "Cheesecake, ice cream, pizza and chocolate chip cookies. Now you know why I jog."
For this speech, Mr. Florio blends transit facts, figures and anecdotes with the theme of his earlier talks. A crowd shivers in the cold as Mr. Florio; Thomas M. Downs, the Transportation Commissioner, and Shirley A. DeLibero, N.J. Transit's executive director, wield ceremonial gold-painted shovels.
Later, back in the car and headed for the Newark Fire Dock heliport, Mr. Florio talks about his uneasy relationship with news photographers, who often, he says, end up catching him in unflattering poses.
He offers an incident with a photographer on the Kearny Connection train as an example.
"I knew what he was waiting for," Mr. Florio says. "He was waiting for me to eat the chocolate chip cookie. We were waiting each other out. Finally I decided, 'The hell with it, I'm eating the chocolate chip cookie.' So he got his picture."
3:10 P.M.: From a State Police helicopter, Mr. Florio looks out over the city of Newark.
"See that open land there," he says, pointing to blocks of empty lots in the center of the state's biggest city. "All that land could be developed if we create an economic environment that is attractive to developers."
4 P.M.: Normally, by this time of the day, Mr. Florio has returned to Princeton for his three-mile jog. "My staff always knows when I just come back from running," he says. "I pick up the phone and call them with all these great ideas. They say, 'Oh-oh, you've been running again.' "
But on this day, the Governor is scheduled for a different exercise, a meeting with the Republican legislative leadership.
Members of Mr. Florio's core group have assembled in the large office next to the Governor's and are waiting for the arrival of the Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, Republican of Scotch Plains, and the Assembly Speaker, Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, Republican of Independence.
The Governor works in his own office and joins the group a minute or two before the legislators arrive from their offices down the hall.
Visitors are not welcome at the meeting, but later Mr. Florio says the session was called to "determine areas of agreement and narrow down areas of disagreement" between the administration and the Republican-dominated Legislature over the state budget.
By all accounts, the Governor has little taste for the politicking side of politics, the give and take of elective office or electioneering. "The thing he loves is government," Ms. Lado, his assistant, says. "Politics and elections are just something he has to go through."
5:35 P.M.: Back in the limousine, Mr. Florio is on the last lap of his official day, headed home to Princeton for a live broadcast of his monthly call-in radio show.
He talks about the perception among some reporters that "the real Jim Florio" is lurking somewhere inside Jim Florio the Governor.
"Maybe they're looking too hard," he says. "Maybe what they're looking for has been there in front of them all along."
When he is asked if he really cares that much about whether people like him, he answers quickly and decisively: "No. It's not something I worry about."
What plans does Mr. Florio have for his life after he leaves the Governor's mansion? "I'd think I'd like to teach at a college," he says, adding that he might also like to work for a law firm that specializes in environmental legislation.
He has no interest, he says, in returning to Washington as a Congressman: "I turn on C-Span and see all these folks down there in Congress flailing around and not getting a whole lot done."
How has his life been changed by his 1988 marriage to the former Lucinda Coleman? For the first time this day, his face softens and relaxes as he says, softly: "A great deal," and then, in almost a whisper, "A great deal."
6 P.M.: After arriving at Drumthwacket, the Governor changes into a sweater and jeans in preparation for his radio show. When a photographer asks permission to take pictures during the broadcast, Mrs. Florio is hesitant because the second-floor study where it takes place is in the family's private quarters and off limits to the press. But she finally agrees to the request.
After the broadcast is over and the photographer has left, Mrs. Florio says, "I just wanted to have one place in the whole world that was private."
Mr. Florio: "And now I've gone and broken the rules."
Mrs. Florio: "As a matter of fact, I was thinking of setting up the radio station downstairs next month, if that's O.K. with you."
Mr. Florio, with a laugh: "We'll talk about it."
Then the Governor and his wife walk up the stairs and into that one place in their world that is private.

HEADLINE: Rent Control: A 'Misnomer'

 BODY:
This is in response to a recentarticle, "Battle Lines Drawn for Major Struggle Over Rent Control."
First of all, rent control is a misnomer since it implies that rents are fixed. They are not -- they go up every year, usually on a par with inflation, and often beyond it. In Cliffside Park they go up beyond what banks pay, so that landlords are making a profit over ordinary interest. 
 In addition, landlords can get hardship increases in this town merely by proving they need one, but since that involves opening their books, no landlord applies for it. If you ask landlords, as I have, what they consider a fair profit, their answer is, "What the market will bear." Translate that to "Whatever I can get," and you have the basis for their complaints. Rent leveling forces them to charge a semi-reasonable amount.
I say semi-reasonable because you have to look at the tenants' side of things. To use the analogy in the article, when a supermarket raises its prices beyond what a shopper can pay, that shopper can always go to another store. But where can a tenant go? There are no affordable new housing units being built for someone making $15,000 to $20,000 a year, and even $30,000 is a tight squeeze.
The result is that tenants with apartments that they can afford stay where they are and hope their rent will not go up past what they can manage. In a climate of declining interest rates and high unemployment, that extra $20 or $30 or $40 a month for their annual increase becomes harder to manage every year. New subsidies for older citizens are as nonexistent as new affordable units.
As for vacancy decontrol, what happens is a revolving apartment door. A tenant moves in, finds the rent too high and (1) either sneaks out in the middle of the night, leaving the landlord with a vacant unit and lost rent till he finds a new tenant, or (2) takes in a roommate (or two or three transients), thus violating whatever occupancy laws may exist. The result in either case is a destabilization of the neighborhood and a lack of community feeling that is sensed by everyone, including homeowners.
As for repairs, why make them when tenants can be forced to make their own or go without? One tenant spent three years trying to get a flaking ceiling repaired under a legal system that is almost totally unresponsive to tenant needs. The problem was not the cost involved, which was minimal, but simply the landlord's unwillingness to make any repairs at all.
Now we come to homeowners. Homeowners benefit from a stable population, something they don't get if rents go sky-high. Tax shifts onto homeowners do not happen as a result of rent leveling, certainly not in this town, where tax increases can be passed on to tenants in the form of surcharges and hardship increases (which, as explained, are not even requested). Often, homeowners are landlords too, owning two-family houses with one unit rented, and they can simply raise the rent to cover their tax increases.
One last point: After World War II, the Government lost no time in providing housing for two million returning servicemen and their families. Today, we have over two million families living in the street. Could the difference be that the first two million were battle-trained, combat-hardened veterans, many with arms, while today's homeless are often women and children, the elderly, the disabled and the disadvantaged?

How John Bull at Home Becomes John Bear Abroad

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
WITH the British Government pushing down interest rates to end the country's stubborn recession, stock prices have begun to soar. Or have they?
It all depends on how you measure them. In pounds, the bull market is certainly on. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index ended this week 24 percent higher than at the end of last August, shortly before the Government's economic policy changed. Last week, the Footsie, as it is affectionately called, rose 2 percent. 
 Unfortunately for foreign holders of British stocks, those gains never happened, for the British pound has ticked down with every increase in the stock market, reflecting overseas reaction to those same lower interest rates. The pound has fallen to $1.45 from its peak of $2 in early September.
As a result, an American who bought the Footsie stocks last August now shows a 10 percent loss in dollars, including a small decline last week. From this side of the Atlantic, it looks like a bear market.

Gently Presiding Over The GATT's Final Round

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH

DATELINE: MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay

 BODY:
IN 1986, at this country's posh beach resort, Punta del Este, the world's trading partners began discussions on how to liberalize international trade and fight protectionism. Under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, it became known as the Uruguay Round.
Now after seven arduous years, the talks, known by the acronym GATT, appear close to an end, and it is perhaps fitting that Uruguay's Foreign Minister, Sergio Abreu Bonilla, has been chosen as president of the round to bring the negotiations to a close. 
 But Mr. Abreu will not enjoy a few months of genteel discussions and celebration. With France and the United States at bitter odds over agricultural issues, he has the formidable task of trying to nudge both sides into an agreement.
And since Uruguay, a tiny country of three million, is not a heavyweight in world trade, it will be difficult to make his voice heard amid the rows of the giants of the industrialized world.
But ever the diplomat, polished from having represented his country in numerous Latin American trade talks and with two master's degrees from the University of Southern California, Mr. Abreu has a clear message of gentle persuasion.
"What we are trying to do is close the round in the fastest timetable possible, with the most minimum number of changes in the final act," Mr. Abreu said. "We don't want to reopen all the negotiations and have countries rethink their positions. Our worry is how to create the conditions in which the Uruguay round can be closed."
Later this month, Mr. Abreu starts a kind of diplomatic quest, first traveling to Europe for talks with GATT's director, Arthur Dunkel, then on to Washington for talks with Mickey Kantor, the new United States trade representative named by President Clinton.
Mr. Abreu acknowledges that he cannot push anyone. Rather, he says, he is there "to assist in any way, to help out."
What concerns him most is the possibility that the Clinton Adminstration will want to review the agreement and will miss an opportunity to get quick approval in Congress.
Under what is called the fast-track legislation, if the agreement is presented to Congress before March 2, it cannot make modifications. It must either pass it or reject it, with the latter being highly unlikely.
But after that date, things get much more difficult.
In late January, Mr. Dunkel said he saw no way of completing the talks by that deadline, but Mr. Abreu held out hope.
"The conditions are there for the close of the Uruguay round," he said, adding that failure could "lead to greater protectionism by the various economic blocs."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
A G.M. Loss Could Spur Health Reform

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
GENERAL MOTORS will report the largest annual loss in the history of corporate America this week -- about $23 billion, or around $3,000 for each car and truck G.M. sold last year.
When G.M. signaled that loss last week, it drew a big yawn on Wall Street. That is because most of the loss -- $22.2 billion -- comes from a new accounting rule, the kind of thing that causes eyes to glaze over. Much more attention was paid to the fall in interest rates around the world, a fact that caused stock indexes to spurt to records. 
 But the sheer magnitude of that figure should cause a lot of people to sit back in amazement. It is based on estimates of what G.M. will have to pay in the future for health care costs for retired workers. Like most companies, G.M. has accounted for such payments only when it spent the cash, about $1 billion last year. But it never bothered to estimate the total liability until the accounting regulators ruled that such costs must be deducted from income while the workers were still performing services, not after they retired.
Estimating such figures is a work of art, with assumptions piled on assumptions. The key question is how rapidly health care costs will rise. Compared with other companies, G.M. is guessing health costs will rise a bit more slowly. Had it been less optimistic, the bill could easily be a few billion higher.
Even so, G.M. is assuming that by the turn of the century health care will be consuming 18 percent of the national income, up from about 14 percent now.
Such huge numbers provide further evidence that something must be done about the cost of health care, which is why the economy's long-term vitality may depend more on Hillary Rodham Clinton's work than on the success of the rest of the Clinton Administration.
In the meantime, companies are trying to cut benefits. Last fall, G.M. began requiring retired managers to pay part of their health expenses, but the company cannot force retired union workers to do the same.
There is a silver lining for the stock market in all this, contrary to much of what has been written. We now know that for many companies, especially ones with aging work forces, real profits have been much lower than reported ones for many years. Now that the Financial Accounting Standards Board has forced more reality into the statements, investors can have greater faith in the numbers that are reported in the future, and companies will have a better understanding of their costs. That should justify higher price-earnings multiples in the stock market, even as it results in lower reported earnings. G.M. estimates that for the next several years, its annual earnings will be cut $1.4 billion as a result of the new accounting rule.
And perhaps it is not too Pollyannish to hope that disclosures such as G.M.'s will spark national action to hold down health costs. That, in turn, would be wonderful news for American competitiveness and for corporate profits.

In Mexico, It's All a Matter of Trade

BYLINE: By Tim Golden

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
FOR Mexico's stock exchange to suffer, it has begun to seem, investors merely need feel uneasy about the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement. They need not have anything especially substantive to make them feel that way.
After climbing 43 percent over the previous four months, values on the Bolsa de Valores, as the exchange is known, began falling again on Tuesday, Jan. 26. By last Wednesday, the market index had dropped more than 11 percent, and analysts were putting a good part of the blame on doubts about the future of the agreement. 
 At no point during the seven days of trading did anything happen clearly to change the prospects for Congressional passage of the trade pact. The agreement -- which is almost certain to be ratified by Canada and Mexico -- was not even a particular subject of debate on Capitol Hill.
And when the market rallied strongly on Thursday, its index jumping 3.2 percent on the last day of trading before a long holiday weekend, there was no sign that the trade accord had anything to do with the bounce. Mostly, investors were grabbing at short-term bargains, analysts said.
A handful of other forces were clearly at work in the market's sharp correction: rising interest rates that siphoned money from equity investments and deepened concerns about overall economic performance; a surfeit of Mexican equities on international markets, and worries about the profitability of big Mexican companies as they prepared to issue quarterly earnings reports.
But the episode underscored how even after President Clinton embraced the trade agreement, its tortuous legislative course in Washington continues to shape day-to-day perceptions of Mexican economic well-being.
"One of the underlying elements of the Mexico story is Nafta," Timothy Heyman, the director of Baring Securities' Mexico City office, said. "And if doubts are cast on its passage, you have problems."
He added: "The doubts don't necessarily have to be well-founded."
When the Mexican exchange plunged from its 1992 high of 1,907.36 points on June 1, investors' fears were centered on the independent candidacy of H. Ross Perot, who had criticized the agreement. Later, as the Bolsa index continued to slide to a low for the year of 1,252.10 on Sept. 25, blame was directed at Mr. Clinton for his then-tepid support of the accord.
Mr. Clinton's endorsement of the trade pact on Oct. 4 is credited by many analysts with having helped turn the market's fortunes around. Within barely two months, the index rose from 1,389.72 to 1,742.55.
The latest unease, analysts said, seemed to stem almost as much from the Clinton Administration's fumbling in trying to secure a nominee for the post of Attorney General or a place for gays in the military as from its Jan. 27 announcement of punitive tariffs on steel imports from Mexico and 18 other countries.
Other developments contributed to the concern, analysts said. Senator Max Baucus of Montana, a Democrat prominent on trade issues, called on Jan. 29 for a cross-border tax on trade between Mexico and the United States. On Feb. 2, the United States imposed further duties on Mexican steel wire rope.
Still, Senator Baucus had issued the same call before. The trade agreement was never expected to do away with disputes over unfair trade. Nor did Clinton Administration officials indicate that their support for the agreement had seriously weakened.
Yet in several ways, market analysts noted, the vagaries of the trade agreement do cut to more fundamental economic concerns.
Without the new capital flows that Mexican officials expect from the accord, the widening current-account deficit -- it is projected for about $20 billion for 1992 -- would look even worse. With real interest rates close to 10 percent and rising again, many investors see the trade agreement as essential to quickening the economy's sluggish growth.
"The agreement will draw direct and portfolio investment into Mexico by companies that consider it too risky without Nafta," said Mickey M. Schleien, a research analyst specializing in Latin America at Morgan Stanley & Company in New York. "But because the prices already reflect the assumption that the agreement will be passed, any questions about a significant delay or a cancellation will cause prices to trend back down toward the levels they would be at if Nafta had never been considered."
Although the market's latest troubles did not coincide with pressure on the peso, some economists still contend that the rising interest rates and widening trade deficit will eventually force a devaluation. Some analysts say the Government's determination to force inflation down to single digits has also left the markets feeling a lack of liquidity.
There was also reason to wonder about the appetite for Mexican stocks. Grupo Carso, the conglomerate that controls the national telephone company, Telefonos de Mexico, managed to place $369 million of new equity in late January at only a slight discount. But the issue, which came only days after the sale of more than $300 million in the phone company's stock by an American mutual-fund manager, was only the first significant placement since a glut of new stocks helped provoke the market's fall last year.
Along with recent issues of Government and private debt, said Roberto R. Barrera, the director of analysis at the Mexico City brokerage InverMexico, "It's enough to give anyone indigestion."

HEADLINE: Some Dos and Don'ts for a Clinton Public-Works Policy

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
TWO years ago, the Harvard professor who is President Clinton's top economic adviser, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, was calling for a Marshall Plan's worth of government investment in worker training and infrastructure -- $2 trillion in the 1990's to fire up the nation's productivity growth and get the economy moving again.
During the campaign, Mr. Clinton promised to funnel $20 billion a year into the nation's infrastructure, everything from roads and bridges to water treatment plants, recycling plants, high-speed trains and an electronic "superhighway" to convey huge amounts of data. 
 Since the election, fiscal reality and a perkier economy have scaled back the Clinton public works plan. The talk from the White House these days is that the Administration may devote a third of its economic stimulus plan to infrastructure -- perhaps $5 billion in 1993. With 435 congressional districts, that's like divvying up a sixpack among a college full of fraternities.
Expect much gnashing and moaning at construction firms, mayor's mansions and Wall Street bond houses. But in many quarters you're more likely to hear sighs of relief that Washington won't after all be throwing a lot of money at public works projects.
Mr. Reich and other Democratic proponents of big increases in such spending argue that the economic payback to public investment on, say, better transportation and communications systems far outstrips the returns to business investment. They say infrastructure spending would pay for itself in a matter of months. They also argue that the nation's infrastructure was woefully neglected during the Reagan-Bush years.
"Public investment is the best way to do fiscal stimulus and it's important to do for its own sake," said Robert Kuttner, a widely published columnist who has long advocated a bigger Government role in the economy as a way of reviving the Democratic Party. "It bridges over the failure of the private sector to invest adequately. It doesn't leak out to imports. It's a way of subsidizing high tech. And it makes up for the shortfall in public investment."
But many infrastructure experts in government, the Federal Reserve and academia disagree. Claims of a huge shortfall in infrastructure spending are wildly exaggerated, they say, and infrastructure projects aren't a painless productivity palliative anyway.
"I can't imagine them putting in $20 billion," said Rudolph Penner, director of economic studies at KPMG Peat Marwick in Washington and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. He said that if the Clinton team consulted government experts on the subject, "they'll quickly see that would really be a waste of money."
What America urgently needs, these experts say, is to better manage an existing infrastructure valued by the Commerce Department at roughly $2.3 trillion. "We've got to make more efficient use of what we have," said Clifford Winston, a transportation specialist at the Brookings Institution, "and be very wary of putting money into anything new."
Ed Hudgins, an economist at the Joint Economic Committee, , agrees. "We've had little vision," he said. "That's why we've spent an inordinate amount on public infrastructure and why our cities are still crowded and we feel that we haven't gotten our money's worth."
Bottom line: Even though Washington won't be spending the bucks some were hoping for, the Clinton Administration still needs a better infrastructure policy than past administrations have been able to come up with. What follows is a list of dos and don'ts from experts skeptical of plans for large new Federal programs advanced by Mr. Reich and some other Clinton advisers.
 
Don't Raise Spending a Lot
 There is little evidence that a big rise in public infrastructure spending would produce bigger economic and social benefits than other public or private investments, such as vaccination programs or business spending on research and development.
The economist whose studies are most often cited by advocates of a lot more spending is David Alan Aschauer, at Bates College in Maine, who concluded that infrastructure spending packs three to five times the productivity punch of private business investment. Few economists find his claim credible. States with more infrastructure haven't grown faster than states with less, and Hong Kong, which is known for its growth, stinted on public works while Singapore, whose productivity has stagnated for two decades, was lavish.
"That doesn't mean building the Erie Canal or O'Hare airport or the Federal highway system wasn't a good idea," said Robert Schwab at the University of Maryland. "But with a huge stock of infrastructure, the payoff from expanding it isn't huge."
Spending on infrastructure, more than two-thirds of it paid for by state and local taxpayers, is already at a record level. The United States has been spending close to $150 billion a year on construction and maintenance -- twice as much, after adjusting for inflation, as the nation spent in the 1960's. Spending amounts to 2.6 percent of G.D.P., compared with the all-time high of 3.2 percent around 1960.
While Federal spending was flat during most of the 1980's, spending at the state and local level has risen by more than a third in the past decade. "There's been a substantial turnaround since the early 1980's," said George Peterson, a specialist on state and local finance at the Urban Institute.
Since 1990, Federal spending has risen 14 percent. And now the highway bill passed last year is funneling an extra $30 billion a year over the next five years to spruce up roads and bridges. "Spending is probably adequate to maintain the system at current quality," said Mr. Winston of Brookings.
Mr. Clinton's supporters cite the drop in infrastructure financing as a share of G.D.P. since the 1960's and the fact that Japan and Germany spend a larger percentage. But the drop in the United States reflects the completion of 40,000 miles of interstate highways and thousands of schools for the baby boomers.
"Take out highways and schools and there's no slowdown," said Jack Tatom, an economist at the St. Louis Federal Reserve. The amount of infrastructure per capita, he points out, is higher than it was in the 1960's.
Anyway, international comparisons aren't necessarily a good guide to how much Washington should be shelling out. In infrastructure per capita, the United States is way ahead of Japan, where sewers and seats on commuter trains are in short supply. And a lot of what counts as public works in Germany would in the United States go under the heading of business investment, by A.T.& T. and Con Edison.
 
Don't Give the Money To Everyone
 Infrastructure needs vary from place to place. On average, the West is wonderfully endowed, while the older cities of the Midwest and Northeast are coping with 60-year-old bridges and century-old water mains.
"There may be a case for spending more money in New York City, but Syracuse doesn't need more infrastructure," said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist at Syracuse University. "Many people associate New York City with the typical city in the Northeast and that's misled us into thinking that there's a general infrastructure crisis."
The trouble is that Washington tends to view public works projects in terms of political payola rather than public payoff. Example: the highway bill passed last year includes 500 "demonstration projects" -- one in almost every congressional district -- that will cost taxpayers $6.5 billion. "Our system has a political imperative to spread the money around to almost every congressional district," Mr. Penner said. "There's no way in our political system to say 'Let's do the best 310 projects'."
 
Don't Rely on Public Works As a Jobs Program
 The United States Conference of Mayors says it has $27 billion worth of projects approved and needing only financing. The implication is that such programs will create lots of jobs right away. But if the Carter economic stimulus package -- $15 billion a year in 1977 and 1978 -- is any guide, infrastructure dollars don't pour into the economy. According to the C.B.O., 2 percent to 20 percent of money authorized for infrastructure is spent in the first year, and spending is usually stretched over four or more years.
"Never, ever think of infrastructure programs as a short-run stimulus program," Mr. Penner said. "It simply takes so long to get the money out. That was always true, but it's especially true now that we have all sorts of things encumbering projects -- environmental impact statements, minority set-asides and other things that we didn't have before."
 
Don't Go for the Glitz
 The projects that make infrastructure seem sexy are large, like high-speed trains and a national "superhighway" for data, especially in the midst of a military slowdown that is throwing thousands of engineers out of work. "We should go for things like information highways and high-speed rail that have the potential of a commercial payoff and technological spinoff," Mr. Kuttner said.
But projects like bullet trains are precisely the ones about which many people have the most doubts. Recent history, here and abroad, is full of costly bloopers, from the Concorde to the Miami subway system. Enormously expensive projects like the data superhighway could be carried out by private enterprise, and more efficiently at that. And some, like bullet trains, probably should remain on the drawing board.
"Do we really need high-speed trains?" said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence. "There are several hundred jets collecting dust in the Mojave Desert because airlines don't have enough business to use them right now. Besides, if fiber-optic networks are successful, we won't need them to get to there from here. Instead of commuting by high-speed trains, we'll telecommute."
 
Do Focus on Maintenance
 There's solid evidence of a high payback for filling potholes and other mundane repairs -- in short, keeping the existing system running smoothly, therefore reducing wear and tear on vehicles and disruption to users. A C.B.O. study concluded that spending on such mundane work would produce by far the highest return to society of any kind of infrastructure spending; for each dollar invested, the annual payback would be 40 cents for some years.
 
Do Remove Impediments To Privatization
 Private involvement in the nation's infrastructure is no panacea, the experts say, but it could help by allowing private investment to help pay for construction and maintenance, and it could improve operating efficiency.
One priority, Mr. Hudgins said, is Federal guidelines that would allow for leasing or even selling airports. Some financially strapped cities -- Baltimore and Indianapolis -- are already looking into that possibility.
 
Do Charge Users the Full Cost of Infrastructure
 The problem that drives most Americans crazy is traffic snarls. Think of roads as a resource like oil or water. If they're free or heavily subsidized, people use more than they're willing to pay for, which is often the same thing as too much. That in turn exaggerates the need for yet more construction.
Right now, gasoline taxes discourage driving, but not in relation to the amount of congestion and wear and tear the driver causes. Mr. Winston and other transportation experts say one of the best ways to reduce automobile congestion is to charge a toll on the busiest roads that's highest in peak periods; the best way to address wear and tear is to charge heavier trucks more for use of a road. What makes this conceivable is that there's new technology -- involving sensors on the backs of license plates -- that eliminated the need for toll booths. Low-income drivers could get rebates just as has been suggested for the equally regressive gasoline tax.
Congestion pricing would be easiest to introduce at airports: make landing fees the highest at peak hours. Right now the most common method of assessing landing fees is by aircraft weight.
The net benefit of charging cars and planes for causing congestion is $15 billion, Mr. Winston said. And it doesn't involve any increase in capital spending.
 
Do Rely on State and Local Governments
 The lion's share of public infrastructure spending is done by state and local governments -- and most economists say that's the way it should be. Taxpayers get more for their money because they choose projects of greatest value to them.
The worst examples of excesses with Federal money involve urban mass transit. Cost-benefit studies, and experience, show that in all but the most densely populated cities, like New York, bus fleets are vastly cheaper and more efficient than rail systems. Yet Washington paid up to three quarters of the construction costs of rail systems in a dozen cities -- Miami and Buffalo among them -- that now operate at only a small fraction of their capacity.
What's more, any digging done on Federal projects is apt to be twice as expensive as it needs to be, said Stephen Moore at the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. The 1933 Davis Bacon Act, for example, requires that workers on Federal construction projects be paid prevailing union wages. The law keeps contractors from competing on cost and inflates costs by a quarter, Mr. Moore said. If this and a slew of other regulations were scrapped, he claims, taxpayers could get twice as much construction for every tax dollar as now. Indeed, President Bush signed a waiver of Davis Bacon in the last days of his administration. Mr. Reich has announced that President Clinton has reversed the waiver.
 
Do Upgrade Existing Roads and Airports
 Taxpayers would get off more lightly if the Government insisted on stiffer standards in road construction, said Mr. Winston of Brookings, who calls current standards penny-wise and pound-foolish. Specifically, paving roads thicker would make them more durable, less easily damaged by truck traffic -- a principal source of wear and tear -- and cheaper to maintain. "That means that spending on roads should be reduced in the long run, not increased," said Henry Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution.
The C.B.O. also found high returns from adding runways to congested airports. Mr. Winston said that if roads were paved thicker and more runways were built at existing airports -- at a cost to the Government of an extra $2 billion a year -- the total benefit to the nation would be $25 billion a year.

THE ECONOMY
 
Data, Data Everywhere -- but Not Many Jobs in Sight 

The latest employment numbers merely restated the theme that has run through all the economic chatter lately: As all the business cycles and indicators and sales data strut around the stage, job growth sits obstinately in the wings. In this very odd recovery, an awful lot of people will simply not get paychecks. Unemployment was indeed down in January, to 7.1 percent from 7.3 percent, but only because the number of people in the labor force fell. "Better, but still too high" was President Clinton's assessment of the rate, giving a strong sign that he will push ahead with his plan to spend some money to create jobs -- a plan he will announce on Feb. 17.
 
While the national job numbers were at least mixed, in the New York area they were unambiguously bad. New York City's rate, unadjusted for seasonal variations, was a dismal 13.4 percent, the highest in at least 25 years. In New York State, the rate stayed at a high 8.5 percent.

A Recovery That Will Stay Put
 
Yes, in the past year or so the economic rebounds seemed to flit away as soon as they were spotted. But this time -- jobs emphatically aside -- most signs point to a true recovery. All the data on recent performance smell like spring -- solid numbers on manufacturing, durable goods, home sales. And, most to the point, the Government's computer-powered crystal ball tells of truly bright days ahead: the index of leading indicators soared 1.9 percent in December, its third straight rise and the rosiest forecast in nearly 10 years. The economy "is beyond the recovery stage," said John R. Williams, a Bankers Trust economist.
 
The Other Side of the Sword
 
Another number came in surprisingly strong last week, but it harbored bad news, too. The 4 percent quarterly productivity rise was the highest since the early 70's, suggesting a mighty recovery. But look closely: High productivity means companies turn out goods with fewer workers; and those standing outside the gates can't buy a sandwich with statistics. And people with jobs aren't reaping the benefits, either; productivity gains haven't been passed on in higher wages. It is a double-edged sword. If the gains persist, though, jobs could follow.
 
Investors Hear the Music
 
Wall Street saw no shades of gray. "The best of all worlds," one money manager called it. "Interest rates down, business cycles recovering, inflation not a problem." Investors saw that same happy mix, sending stock prices roaring to record levels on Thursday and again on Friday. Everything seemed to fall in place: the reports on retail sales, factory orders, the rate cuts in Germany and Japan. The market's reasoning: with rates low, companies can more easily raise money to expand. Other stock indexes had already hit records. Last week, the Dow industrials, having been weighed down by the likes of G.M. and I.B.M., finally made their move, ending fully 4 percent higher for the week, at 3,442.14.
 
Now What, Mr. Clinton?
 
So with this embarrassment of rich numbers, where does a new President steer the ship? Still, still, toward job growth. A lot of numbers have been tossed around -- all the way from $15 billion to $60 billion -- as the exact amount needed. Alan Greenspan had given his much-needed blessing to $20 billion, but as more specifics fell into place, the figure crept up. Last week, President Clinton lobbed another number into the ring, telling governors and Congress he wants $31 billion, divided between tax breaks and spending to create jobs.
 
Jobs and the Trade Pact
 
One front of the job battle came into better focus. Unions and members of Congress predicted huge job losses from the North American Free Trade Agreement, while the Bush Administration cited the economic gains. But no Federal agency had done a full study of the economic impact until last week, when an International Trade Commission report contended that the pact would help overall American economic output and employment slightly. Some have argued for extensive renegotiation of the pact, but this independent evaluation gives them little ammunition.
 
The Family, Stupid
 
The battle lines on the family-leave bill have long been clear: George Bush said businesses would be hurt, while Democrats gave more weight to a worker's right to 12 weeks' unpaid leave to care for an infant or ill relative. Mr. Bush vetoed the bill twice. But the Democrats moved quickly to put their stamp on such matters, as Congress passed the bill easily and President Clinton signed it. The Republicans grumbled, though; Senator Bob Dole talked of "tens of thousands" of job losses.

 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Japan Finally Cuts Rates . . .
 
Perhaps he couldn't quite say the words "weak economy." Instead, "a severe adjustment phase" is what Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan's governor, called it. So severe, in fact, that last week the central bank finally yielded to world pressure and lowered its discount rate, to 2.5 percent from 3.25 percent, to try to give things a shove. The last time the rate was that low was in the late 80's, when Japan's economy was the wonder of the world. Pressure for a rate cut has risen with the arrival of the Clinton team, which is viewed as being tough on trade, and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen welcomed the move.
 
 . . . And Germany Budges, Too
 
In Germany, the interest-rate pressures have a special cast, because of problems created by German unity and the strains as Europe tries for monetary union (page 13). The Bundesbank has kept rates high, fearing inflation, but last week the central bank lowered its Lombard rate by half a point, to 9 percent, in a surprise attempt to help the economy and silence critics. The action is also seen as a signal to trade unions to limit demands for pay raises.
 
Russia Battles Its Inflation
 
Inflation of 2 percent isn't bad -- unless, as in Russia, it's 2 percent a day. Boris Yeltsin knows things are bad, and in a speech on his 62d birthday on Monday -- in which he likened the nation's troubles to the bleakest days of the fight against the Nazis -- Russia's President called for national resolve. More specifically, Russia sharply raised prices for natural gas and phone calls but also nearly doubled minimum pensions. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund faulted Russia for letting inflation get out of control, saying it threatened the nation's fledgling democracy.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
At Chrysler, Contagious Success
 
How the fallen have become mighty again. A year ago, Chrysler was deep in Detroit's dumps, its shares selling for a feeble $12.50. But it's been an uphill ride ever since, as successful new models and strong profits have helped triple the stock's price. So Chrysler saw a chance to tuck away some cash, and ended with even more than it had hoped for. In the second-largest stock sale ever (second only to G.M., of course), it took in over $2 billion last week. The selling price, $38.75, was $2.50 above the target. The stock ended the week at $40.75. Half the proceeds will go straight to its underfunded pension fund. Standard & Poor's, liking what it saw, quickly raised Chrysler's debt rating.
 
G.M. Takes Some Big Lumps
 
But as Chrysler cruises, General Motors keeps hitting potholes. First it swallowed, in one accounting gulp, future retiree health costs. The charge against earnings was a whopper: $20.8 billion. G.M.'s expected '92 deficit of more than $23 billion wipes away a record set by I.B.M. just the week before. To top it off, S.&P. cut G.M.'s debt rating.
 
Even as the dismal numbers mounted, the auto maker's good name got a beating when a Georgia court held it responsible for a teen-ager's death in a G.M. pickup, saying the company had knowingly failed to fix a defective fuel-tank design. The huge award, over $100 million, may well be lowered, but the problem could haunt G.M.: many lawsuits are pending, and the Government may order a recall of 4.7 million pickups.
 
Good News for All: Sales Surge
 
So some in Detroit are up, and some are down, but a rising tide could lift them all. Last week auto makers reported a surge in sales to the best level in two years.
 
Leslie Fay's Loose-Fitting Data
 
"Something doesn't add up here," one Leslie Fay executive said. No, indeed. For reasons unknown, the people adding up numbers for the big apparel maker did some creative accounting, apparently inflating the value of inventories while lowering reported costs. The controller, Donald F. Kenia, came forward when the false data no longer fit under the rug, and was suspended. That left the directors' audit committee to untangle the mess, and new data could wipe out last year's profits. The stock lost more than a third of its value, and investors, having no intention of just licking their wounds, filed lawsuits.
 
Post's Savior May Not Add Up
 
It seemed at first that The New York Post had a solid savior and would survive intact, but the plot thickened as the week wore on. Doubts were raised about the net worth of the buyer, Steven Hoffenberg, because of what were called dubious accounting methods. Then word of other buyers arose, some perhaps in partnership with Mr. Hoffenberg. In the meantime, The Post's lifeblood started to drip away, as top editors and writers were lured to The Daily News.
 
American Express Tries Again
 
At American Express, chairmanship has its privileges, but they don't necessarily include keeping the job. Even after James D. Robinson 3d persuaded the board to keep him on, investors rebelled -- and were heard. So again the company stood behind a chairman for its new era; this time it was Richard M. Furlaud, a director who had backed Mr. Robinson. With Harvey Golub installed as chief executive, Mr. Furlaud presumably joins the ranks of chairmen who kibitz from the sidelines.

The Family Leave Bargain

SERIES: Second of three articles on recent research in work-family issues.

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble

 BODY:
HERE are two facts of life: Babies are here to stay and so are women in the work force. Women now make up 46 percent of the American labor force. For the rest of the 1990's, some studies project, two out of three new workers will be female. By 2000, half the work force will be women, mostly of childbearing age. And four out of five women in the work force will probably have children during their working lives.
So managers may want to pull up their socks and read a second chapter in "Parental Leave and Productivity," a study released recently by the Families and Work Institute in New York. Like the institute's research on supervisors' attitudes toward leave reported on here last week, "The True Cost of Parental Leave" may offer some surprises to anyone who thinks family leaves are terminally disruptive and expensive. The message is particularly apt now that President Clinton has signed the family leave law. 
 The authors, Rebecca Marra and Judith Lindner, make their point pithily: Leaves don't cost as much as you think. They argue that managers who think leaves are too costly haven't considered the expense of the alternatives.
Using data gathered from supervisors at a high-tech company with generous leave policies, Ms. Marra and Ms. Lindner developed a "cost model" to help compare strategies for coping with a leave. Replacing a worker permanently, the most common managerial reaction to an employee's extended absence, is not necessarily the most effective. "Companies mostly don't think about how expensive it is to lose a person and to have all the additional costs of hiring and training," Ms. Lindner said. She and Ms. Marra found that providing liberal leave policies and covering the absence internally was statistically, at least, more cost-effective.
The result comes with several caveats and potential emendations. The model tries to account for many variables, among them type and length of leave; amount of planning time; the employee's job, age and performance; the size of the immediate work group and the supervisor's attitudes toward leave.
Variables, by definition, mean that conclusions can't be true for all places and all times. But the authors found that the cost of a leave "supported," as the authors say, by rerouting or reassigning work or simply letting it go, was on average 32 percent of a worker's annual salary -- 39 percent for management, 28 percent for nonmanagement. Replacing workers, according to data collected for an earlier study at the same company, was 150 percent of a manager's salary and 75 percent of a nonmanager's.
The researchers segmented the data to find out where most of the costs were -- or were not -- falling. The total cost of managing 70 percent of the leaves was 30 percent or less of the employee's annual salary. In 9 of 10 leaves, the total cost was less than 70 percent of a worker's annual salary, which, in the words of the report, means that "in almost all of the parental leaves studied, the total cost was lower than the average cost of replacing a nonmanagement employee."
As other researchers have found, planning is the key to making a leave go smoothly. The institute has said that employers, on average, have about five months' notice of a maternity leave. Ms. Marra and Ms. Lindner found little evidence to support the popular notion that free-ranging pregnancy hormones lower productivity and raise absentee rates. Often, au contraire.
This is not to say that leaves cause no blips. Managerial employees clearly cost more than nonmanagers. Small units are inconvenienced more than large. Pregnancies with complications can be costly. When women unexpectedly fail to return to work or leave shortly after returning, the company pays for the leave and the cost of the replacement.
AND the availability of leaves depends to some extent on the health of the company and of the economy. In the strip-mined employment environment of the 90's, companies may have less flexibility. "If a company has no fat whatsoever, if it's really trimmed down," Ms. Marra said, it can't just slide someone over from another assignment. "Maybe not everything gets done, but most things get done."
Small companies, recession or not, may never have as many options as large corporations. "But there may be some options they haven't thought of," Ms. Marra said.
Ms. Lindner said former employees or retirees might agree to work temporarily. "It's not good news, but a recession means that you may have a pool of people you may be able to hire back temporarily," she said.
Although it is probably fair to say that the two authors are philosophically committed to encouraging family-friendly corporate policies, their research is not meant to whitewash the difficulties. Their model, properly modified to the circumstances of a particular company, offers the possibility of a realistic prediction of leave costs. If it debunks a myth or two in the process, so much the better.

She Puts Up the Money for the Software Dreams

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
ANN WINBLAD, daughter of a high school football coach in rural Minnesota, recalls that her first toy was a stopwatch. It apparently set her up for a career marked by rapid achievement and precise timing. She became a computer programmer. In 1976, she started a software company, Open Systems, then sold it several years later "for a pile of money." She moved to California; worked as a consultant for Microsoft, Apple and I.B.M.; wrote a book on object-oriented programming, and co-founded Hummer Winblad Venture Partners in Emeryville, Calif.
With her partner, John Hummer, a former professional basketball player ("which makes our average height six feet," the diminutive Ms. Winblad notes), she is one of the leading venture capitalists in the computer software industry. 
 Question: What do you look for in a potential investment?
Answer: Just a few things. Who's running the company? Can they attract excellence? If you look at a company like Microsoft, one of the reasons they've been successful is they've been rigorous in their recruiting. They're very selective.
Second, we have to find market space where there's room, where there aren't significant competitors. Timing is everything, not just in life but in the software businesses as well. For example, Powersoft, one of our investments, has grown from zero to just over $20 million in just a year. Timing played a big part in their entry in the client-server environment.
Q: And strategy.
A: Building a software company is very much like playing the game of Risk. Your goal is to capture continents. You have to choose which one of your opponents you're going to use as a strategic partner, at least for a while.
Q: Alliances do seem to shift, don't they?
A: Right. You need to place your army, you need to claim your market space right away. You have to have a strategy and you have to keep an eye on not only your own strategy but also your partner's or your competitors' strategies.
We have to look for people who think like that. We're going to enter in the game of Risk with them, and they're actually going to be playing it. We're going to hand them the money to buy the board, and maybe finance their armies, but we're going to have to let them alone to play. Hopefully they won't get stuck in Australia and New Zealand, and they'll capture Asia.
I just learned how to play the game a few years ago and I often use it as a discussion point in asking people how they think. It takes more than cleverness to be a C.E.O. You have to be tough, you have to be smart, you have to think strategically, and you really have to understand the product space you're trying to claim. Positioning is key.

HEADLINE: STAMPS;
Common-Sense Advice For Novice Collectors

BYLINE: By Barth Healey

 BODY:
THE aggressive marketing by the United States Postal Service is evidently luring new collectors, but letters from readers indicate that many do not have a clue about how to develop their new hobby beyond buying stamps as they are issued.
A good way to start the transformation from accumulator to collector is with a new paperbound book from Dell, "Stamp Collecting: The Complete, Easy Guide to the World's Most Popular Hobby." (The immodesty of the title belies the stereotype of the deferential collector who studies philatelic minutiae in isolation.) 
 The author is Charles F. Adams, who answers the question, What is a stamp collection? most sensibly: "It's whatever you want it to be." The book is full of other common-sense advice, including a section on stamp albums that rightly warns of the frustrations that printed albums often cause because they seem to demand that a new collector acquire certain stamps to fill certain blank spaces.
Both new and experienced collectors can also use the APS Stamp Identifier, a slim booklet published by the American Philatelic Society with 45 pages of key words that appear on stamps. A new collector will recognize "Italia" as Italy but might stumble over "Pacchi Postali (with star and crescent)" as a key to a stamp from the former Italian colony of Somaliland. Also helpful are transliterations of Arabic, Chinese, Greek, Hebrew and Cyrillic alphabets.
Both books are available from the American Philatelic Society, P.O. Box 8000-N, State College, Pa. 16803. Mr. Adams's guide is $3.75; the identifier is $2.50, both postpaid.
 
From the United Nations

Continuing its emphasis on social issues, the United Nations put out a set of six stamps on Friday on the theme "Aging: Dignity and Participation." Last year was the 10th anniversary of the adoption of a United Nations convention on aging that calls for economic security and a chance for the elderly to participate fully in society.
Two stamps (valued at 29 cents and 52 cents) were issued in New York, two (50 centimes and 1.6 francs) in Geneva and two (5.5 schillings and 7 schillings) in Vienna.
Covers canceled on the first day of issue are available from the World Federation of United Nations Associations. The covers have a cachet showing the center panel of a quilt designed by Dink Siegel and sewn by Doreen Beck. The quilt, titled "Fantasy," is one of many original designs they have collaborated on.
The federation is also offering an 8 1/2-inch-by-11-inch print of the panel, in an edition of 500 signed copies. This print, like the dozens prepared by the federation over the years, raises money to promote United Nations activities. Each print is $70, postpaid, from the World Federation of United Nations Associations, Room DC1-1177, United Nations, N.Y. 10017.
The United Nations Postal Administration has also reorganized its marketing, focusing on a new publication, a 24-page booklet that describes new stamps and older ones that can still be bought by mail at face value. The booklet, to be published every two months, is available free from the U.N.P.A., Box 5900, Grand Central Station, New York 10163-9992.

HEADLINE: Don't Chip at Deficit With Social Security

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan is right to oppose the proposal for eliminating this year's Social Security cost of living adjustment as a component of the deficit-reducing package (front page, Jan. 31). 
 The proposal implies a regressive inflation tax on the elderly. Indeed, eliminating inflation adjustments in general is capricious, inequitable and affords a further dangerous invitation to use inflation to reduce the real value of Government debt. If Social Security recipients are to be singled out for sacrifice, this is the least equitable way. If it has to be done, far better to include more Social Security benefits of the well-to-do elderly in the income tax base.
Social Security should be seen as a contributory national insurance system and as such should be separated from the general budget. From time to time, adjustments must be made (as was the case in the 1980's) to keep the system self-sustaining, actuarially sound without burden on the general budget and to maintain equity between generations.
But to chip away at the system for the sake of budget deficit reduction will ultimately destroy confidence in and weaken the system. Its integrity should not be threatened by making it a vehicle for deficit reduction.
It is quite amazing how the Income tax is rarely mentioned as the best and most ready means of implementing President Clinton's aim of "shared sacrifice." Like no other tax, it spreads the burden of revenue increase in an equitable manner, whether by income class, region of the country or age group.
What should be the politically most acceptable tax has become the politically least acceptable because of an ideological distaste for even moderate progressivity over the upper income range.

HEADLINE: Car Import Duty Can Only Hurt U.S. Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Before President Clinton backs the punitive duties on imported cars that American car manufacturers propose (front page, Jan. 26), he will presumably evaluate their impact on the American cost of living, job creation and the interest rate the Government has to pay to sell bonds -- the last an important part of the Federal budget. On all three counts, the news will be bad. 
 Americans still have the world's highest per capita income, adjusted for cost of living, well ahead of the Japanese and other, less open economies. But that relatively low cost of living depends on our open economy. Import duties raise the cost of living by raising the price of both imported and competing domestic goods.
If American car manufacturers have import duties, they can maximize profits by selling fewer and more expensive cars. American consumers are already paying $1 billion a year because of "voluntary" auto import restraints. The new duties would drive these costs up severalfold, to several hundred dollars a car or more for all cars.
Nor will the duties save jobs, unless only jobs at American car manufacturing plants are counted. Elsewhere, jobs will be lost. They will be lost in all the industries that depend on car sales, because the volume of cars sold will be lower. They will also be lost because American capital will be channeled into the less efficient American automobile industry, instead of more efficent, more rapidly growing industries, such as the high-tech industries where United States performance recently has been superior to that of other countries.
Last, the slowing of imports will raise the cost of financing the national debt, as well as all debts. All the dollars that foreign exporters make here and that are not spent on American goods and services -- in other words, the trade deficit dollars -- must find their way into the American capital market.
Thus the trade deficit has had the impact of channeling money into United States real estate, bonds and other assets. With less foreign money in the American market, demand for United States bonds will slacken. The price of bonds will go down, which is tantamount to the interest rate's going up. Just the opposite is needed to help balance the budget.
The auto industry proposals will not serve the American public, neither consumers, nor workers (except in the industry's own plants), nor taxpayers.

HEADLINE: A TOUGH SELL;
Better Days Muffle Clinton's Call for Sacrifice

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
To economists, it makes no sense whatsoever. But in a perverse way, the rather good economic news these days may make it harder politically for President Clinton to ask Americans to tighten their belts for the sake of future prosperity.
Before the election, when the economy seemed dead in the water, when the unemployment rate was peaking, when Ross Perot was barking about how the economy was perched on the edge of a cliff, Mr. Clinton had no trouble campaigning for a fundamental change in direction. 
 But now, with the recession clearly over despite lingering joblessness, with businesses expanding and consumers' confidence jumping, with the outlook rosier than anyone could have foreseen a few months ago, the sense of urgency about changing course may be dissipating.
Mr. Clinton appears to be determined to get a handle on the budget deficit whatever the political cost, and his advisers have suggested how painful his long-term program might be: an energy tax that would strike at the pocketbooks of all Americans, especially the middle class, and new limits on retirement payments under Social Security.
Economists have no doubt that medicine this strong is needed to get control of the deficit. But it seems incomprehensible to some politicians that Mr. Clinton would entertain higher taxes on the middle class or go after the benefits of the elderly after he specifically promised in his campaign not to. That seems particularly true when times do not seem so bad.
The Government reported last week that the unemployment rate in January had reached its lowest level in a year -- 7.1 percent -- and that the main gauge for forecasting economic conditions six to nine months from now, the index of leading economic indicators, had registered its biggest monthly gain in 10 years in December. The economy in the last three months of 1992 grew more than in any calendar quarter since the end of the Reagan years.
Throughout the week, the President tried to focus attention on the economic and social policies that dominated the campaign last year. But practical politics kept colliding with economic reality.
"Since the election," Mr. Clinton told the staff of the Office of Management and Budget at a pep rally Wednesday, "we've learned even more about the difficulty of the budget." The nature of that difficulty, although he did not say so directly, is that the deficit cannot be brought under control as easily as Mr. Clinton had suggested during his campaign -- primarily by raising the taxes of the wealthy and improving the management of Government programs. In fact, to accomplish his goals, ordinary people must pay higher taxes, and popular programs must be cut.
The budget picture led to other clashes of economics and politics. Mr. Clinton told a conference of governors here that he was still serious about his promise to "end welfare as we know it," but behind the scenes, his staff acknowledged that truly changing welfare policy would be more expensive, more difficult technically and more divisive politically than the President let on.
 
Glad Tidings, Mostly
 On Capitol Hill, as Hillary Rodham Clinton was meeting with lawmakers about legislation to overhaul the medical-care system, Robert D. Reischauer, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, was warning others that the kind of health measures the Administration had been talking about would not save money in the short run.
And the President's advisers said his campaign promise to allow college students to work off their student loans by doing community service work would be fulfilled at first basically by a pilot project. Anything more would be too costly.
Mr. Clinton, who takes pride in his knowledge of economics and mastery of politics, assumed the same stance last week that he had during the campaign and the transition. He eagerly offered the good news about the tax cuts and new spending for public works and job training he hopes to put into effect this year to give the economy a quick stimulus. He talked about sacrifice generally, saying the pain of lowering the deficit must be borne evenly, but never mentioning the price to any particular person or group of people.
 
Fear as Motivator
 To most economists, emphasizing the stimulus and playing down deficit reduction is misguided. They see the budget deficit, now about $300 billion, as a crippling condition that left unattended will rob America's next generation of its birthright. By all Keynesian logic, they say, the time to attack the deficit is when times are good -- when tax increases and spending cuts can be weathered without sending the economy into a tailspin. They feel the positive economic news should strengthen the hand of the President, who has promised to try to cut the deficit almost in half by the end of his term.
Politicians see this through a different lens. When the economic picture is bleak, they say, their constituents are ready to do whatever it takes to turn matters around. But when people are back on their feet, it becomes harder to convince them of the need for new unpleasantness, be it higher taxes or lower benefits or cutbacks in favorite programs.
"Tough choices are better politics when the fear is urgent and not just abstract," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat.
James M. Ruvolo, a member of the Democratic National Committee and a former party chairman in Ohio, said Mr. Clinton could "no longer take it for granted that people know things are tough."
Economists and politicians also have different perspectives on the significance of the President's economic stimulus proposal, which could raise the deficit by as much as $30 billion this year before the deficit reduction package would take hold.
Some economists think a stimulus is unnecessary with the economy quite strong already and worry it would make the eventual reduction of the deficit all the more difficult. Others argue that a brief increase in deficit spending this year would give the economy the running start it needs to withstand austerity in the years ahead. But nearly all economists agree that the small stimulus being contemplated is not crucial one way or the other. A $30 billion stimulus in a $6 trillion economy is, after all, of the same magnitude as a $250 bonus for someone with a yearly salary of $50,000.
To politicians, though, it is not trivial at all. To them, stimulating the economy now is essential for two reasons: First, Mr. Clinton promised to do it, and unlike, say, a middle-class tax-cut, this is an easy promise to keep; second, the President can reward important Democratic constituents like mayors and governors by delivering public works projects to their communities and tax cuts to local manufacturers.
The saving grace for Mr. Clinton in reconciling the economic and political viewpoints may be that the jobs picture remains poor, despite the other positive economic data. High unemployment normally lingers after a recession is over. But this time, the economy stopped shrinking in March 1991, almost two years ago. The unemployment rate last month was still over 7 percent, and the number of private payroll jobs rose by only 106,000. That is twice last year's average monthly rate, but far below the normal rate of job growth at this stage of an economic recovery.
Adding to the psychology of the matter, almost every morning's paper brings news of another blue-chip company -- Sears, I.B.M., General Motors -- that is laying off tens of thousands of workers.
Economists may disregard the significance of campaign promises and favors for constituents. Politicians may care little about the new figures on durable goods or housing starts. But the importance of jobs -- more jobs, better jobs -- is something they both understand.
Mr. Clinton is advertising his stimulus program as primarily a way to create new jobs quickly. If he can sell painful deficit reduction measures as the price for guaranteeing jobs in the next century, economists and politicians alike may buy the pitch. And so may the American public.
 
WEEK THREE
Getting Organized, Or Not
 Government did march on last week, sometimes along the same lines that Bill Clinton had drawn in his campaign. Following are a few of the things, in addition to the economic plan, that preoccupied the Administration.
 
AWKWARD TRANSITION
Once more, President Clinton had to say, "I was greatly impressed with her as a lawyer and . . . I wish her well." He was talking about Federal District Judge Kimba M. Wood of Manhattan, who was almost but not quite nominated to be Attorney General. In 1986, Judge Wood hired a baby sitter with an expired entry visa and, while no one said any law was broken -- the prohibition on hiring illegal aliens was not yet in effect -- she stepped aside under White House pressure with a reference to "the current political environment."
 
TRANSITION, CONT.
Another New Yorker, Andrew M. Cuomo, was appointed an assistant secretary at the Department of Housing and Urban Development; Mr. Cuomo, who builds housing for the homeless, was on the Clinton transition team.
R. James Woolsey was confirmed as Director of Central Intelligence.
 
BILLS TO SIGN
The President signed a bill, his first, and the first in what Democrats all around said would be a wave of legislation making up for the last 12 years. It was the long-in-coming, previously vetoed family leave act, guaranteeing workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a newborn or a sick child, spouse or parent. Congress, having passed the measure twice before, did it again by votes of 265 to 163 in the House and 71 to 27 in the Senate. The issue of homosexuals in the military complicated things only briefly, when the Senate appended a statement on the matter.
 
BUDGETS TO CUT
Defense Secretary Les Aspin asked the military to sacrifice, directing the Pentagon to cut $14 billion in next year's spending plan. It was the first step in fulfilling Mr. Clinton's campaign promise to cut $60 billion more than Mr. Bush would by 1997. The Administration said it was also considering scaling back the space station and superconducting super collider.
 
FIGHTS TO SETTLE
The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, William S. Sessions, infuriated senior aides by overruling their decision to put off disciplining agents who broke bureau rules. Most had made personal use of official vehicles, which brings a 30-day suspension; Mr. Sessions, who did the same thing, was ordered to take lessons in proper use of his car. Administration officials, meanwhile, cannot help until they have an Attorney General.
 
NOT JUST VISITING
Hillary Rodham Clinton, in charge of coordinating the Administration's plans on health care, took her concerns to Capitol Hill, by herself. She met with the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, and with Senators Bob Dole, the minority leader, and John H. Chafee.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Social Security Test: Selling Sacrifice to the Elderly

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
The new ethos of Washington is supposed to be "shared sacrifice," but constituent groups are already mounting pre-emptive defenses. Probably none will be as formidable as Social Security recipients.
Selling sacrifice to the elderly, and the politicians who represent them, may be the first crucial test of President Clinton's deficit-reduction plan. 
 What was widely seen as an Administration trial balloon -- a proposal for a one-year freeze in Social Security cost-of-living increases -- has landed with a thud on Capitol Hill. President Clinton was bluntly told by Democratic senators that such a measure would exact an enormous political cost, perhaps even Democratic control of the Senate, Democrats on Capitol Hill say. In the House, early partisan skirmishing saw Republicans rising happily to the defense of a program that they were often accused of trying to plunder during the Reagan-Bush years.
"Social Security is unequivocally the one contract the country is overwhelmingly in favor of," said Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip. "I'm going to do everything I can to keep the Democrats from tampering with it." Recalling the elections of the 1980's when Democrats campaigned on the simple slogan, "Save Social Security, Vote Democratic," Mr. Gingrich added, "Tip O'Neill must think these folks have lost their minds."
 
Turning Up the Pressure
 The groups that lobby for retirees in Washington are talking of jammed switchboards, mass mailings, "800" number hotlines, and of sacrifice unfairly apportioned. "These entitlement programs like Social Security did not cause the deficit and therefore should not be used to resolve it," said Martha McSteen, a former Social Security commissioner who now heads the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.
Despite Ms. McSteen's remarks, retirement benefits account for about a fourth of the Federal budget, and many in the Administration and Congress agree that cutting the deficit will be impossible if those benefits are left untouched.
The American Association of Retired Persons, which was holding its annual legislative meeting in Washington this week, sought and heard reassurances from an array of Congressional and Administration leaders that their concerns were understood. "I am a dues-paying, discount-seeking member of the A.A.R.P.," declared Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, the Maryland Democrat who heads the Subcommittee on Aging of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. "You didn't create the deficit, and I don't know why they look at you all the time to correct the deficit."
 
Who Will be Unscathed?
 But even as the retirees' lobby kicks into gear, and a freeze in benefits seems less likely, there is also a widespread recognition that it will be hard for any big group to emerge unscathed from the coming round of cuts and taxes. This is particularly true for the elderly, whose programs accounted for 28.3 percent of all Federal outlays in 1990, according to the House Ways and Means Committee. By contrast, programs benefiting children accounted for 5.2 percent, according to the House panel.
As a result, opponents of a benefits freeze are looking on another Administration proposal as a fallback position: raising the amount of Social Security benefits subject to taxation for higher-income retirees. "That's a perfectly legitimate subject to talk about," Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a furious opponent of a benefits freeze, said in an interview on Friday. Some on Capitol Hiil even saw the mention of a possible freeze in cost-of-living adjustments as an early softening-up strategy to make the tax increase more attractive.
An analysis released this weekend by Families USA, a Washington advocacy group, said that nearly half of the money raised from a freeze would come from beneficiaries with incomes below $20,000 and an additional 33 percent from beneficiaries with incomes of $20,000 to $40,000. "Cutting the Social Security COLA socks it to the poorest of our grandparents," said Ron Pollack, executive director of the lobbying group.
 
Tax Increase Is Proposed
 The other proposal being circulated would raise taxes on benefits: Under current law, 50 percent of Social Security benefits are subject to income tax for retired individuals whose annual income exceeds $25,000 and for couples whose income exceeds $32,000. Raising that percentage to 85 is one possibility under discussion.
The analysis from Families USA said that 84 percent of the revenues raised from that proposal would come from beneficiaries with incomes over $40,000 a year. "It's a way of asking sacrifice from those who can afford it," Mr. Pollack said.
Still, no one underestimates the difficulty in making any adjustments affecting the Social Security program, which is known on Capitol Hill as the "third rail" of American politics, ready to deliver a lethal shock to the politician who touches it. It is one of the great success stories of American Government, a program credited with largely eliminating poverty among the elderly. It is also seen as an almost sacred covenant between the populace and the Government because, as a former Social Security Commissioner, Robert Ball, put it, "You get the benefits because of the work you do."
 
Political 'Holy Writ'
 Added to the popularity of the program, which crosses generational lines, is the unusual political clout of its beneficiaries. "It's sort of holy writ in politics that seniors carry political weight that far exceeds their numbers," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker. "They pay more attention, they're more involved, and they're more likely to vote."
Twenty-one percent of the voters last November were 60 and older. Americans 65 and older are also more likely to consider themselves Democrats than other age groups.
Not surprisingly, Democrats often use Social Security as their magic bullet in Congressional elections, and the issue has become fiercely partisan. For example, in 1985 Senate Republicans, who were then in the majority, were hammered for advocating reductions in cost-of-living increases to cut the deficit. The Social Security issue in general was an important factor in their loss of Senate control the following year, as it had been in the Republicans' loss of 26 House seats in 1982.
In last year's Presidential campaign, Ross Perot's brisk call for deficit reduction ran into some highly skeptical questioning on the very issue of Social Security benefits for upper-income Americans. And former Senator Paul E. Tsongas, whose economic plan suggested that limiting social security benefits might be necessary because of the deficit, was attacked for that position in leaflets and television commercials across South Florida, where there are many retiree communities.
The attacks came from the Clinton campaign.
 
New Climate in Capital
 Despite all the reflexive politics as usual, senior citizen lobbyists are keenly aware that the climate is different in Washington these days. The deficit is getting a level of public and political attention that it has rarely received. As cuts are contemplated, some analysts argue that the Government has long short-changed its children and continues to do so at its peril; "generational inequities" are part of the quiet debate in policy circles here.
At the same time, there is still some private resentment among lawmakers about the health insurance program meant to protect older Americans from the high costs of catastrophic illnesses. It foundered in 1988, when retirees revolted over a surtax imposed on the most affluent 40 percent to pay for it.
Advocates for the elderly have a big stake in working with the Administration and the Democratic leadership on the new national health care plan.
In the end, many lawmakers say, the challenge for Mr. Clinton will be making every group feel that the sacrifice is really "shared." Representative Bob Wise, Democrat of West Virginia, said, "You've got to see everybody getting a nick taken out of them; everybody's going to have to be able to look at their neighbor and say, he got his hit too."
 
 
 
SOCIAL SECURITY'S BENEFITS AND BOOMERANGS: A CHRONOLOGY
1977: In the first big attempt to deal with potential insolvency in the Social Security program, Congress approves a bill intended to yield $227 billion over 10 years by increasing the payroll tax rate and sharply raising the level of wages that can be taxed.
1981: After the 1977 plan fails to shore up the system, Ronald Reagan's Administration proposes to trim Social Security by reducing benefits for early retirement, delaying the cost-of-living allowance and reducing benefit growth for future retirees. The proposals cause such an uproar that the Administration retreats and appoints a bipartisan study commission.
1982: President Reagan embraces a Senate Republican budget plan calling for $40 billion in unspecified Social Security savings over three years. That plan, too, quickly dies, but the issue rages through the fall elections.
1983: After almost two years of bitter political debate and inaction, Congress acts on the recommendations of the bipartisan commission and agrees to make fundamental changes in Social Security. The package raises the retirement age from 65 to 67 by the year 2027, delays cost-of-living increases for six months and increases payroll taxes for employers and employees.
1985: The Senate's majority Republicans agree with the White House to a broad deficit-reduction plan that includes freezing Social Security benefits for one year. The Senate adopts the proposal, 50 to 49. Two months later, President Reagan backs away after Democrats agree to higher military spending.
1988: Congress approves the Catastrophic Coverage Act intended to protect Medicare beneficiaries from financial ruin because of the high cost of acute illness. To finance it, beneficiaries are required to pay a flat monthly premium, and the wealthiest 40 percent a surtax on their income tax. Angered at having to pay for benefits many already receive as retirees, these beneficiaries inundate Congress with protests. Congress later votes to repeal the act.
January 1993: White House officials say President Clinton is considering a plan to cut back Social Security benefits.

HEADLINE: Looking for an Attorney General: The Search;
In Looking for Attorney General, Clinton Now Wants a Sure Thing

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Amid finger-pointing over their second failed effort at choosing an Attorney General, White House officials said today that they hoped to announce a new nominee quickly, possibly in the next two days.
President Clinton is now seeking an easily confirmable nominee, the officials said, and will not insist that the job go to a woman. 
 They said Mr. Clinton wanted to move fast, both for political reasons and for the practical concern that there is a leadership vacuum at the Justice Department at a critical time. Judicial nominations are at a standstill, major crime legislation is being drafted in Congress and the Federal law-enforcement budget is under attack by some Administration officials who want to cut spending.
 
Back for the Third Time
 Still stunned by the forced withdrawal of Judge Kimba M. Wood, who had employed an illegal alien as a baby sitter, although before it was illegal to do so, officials regrouped at the White House today to review their list of candidates for the third time. They were back where they were two weeks ago, when Zoe Baird, Mr. Clinton's first choice, was ordered to withdraw after it was disclosed that she had employed two illegal aliens for household work at a time when that had become against the law.
Seeking to publicly distance himself from the episode, Mr. Clinton did not mention Judge Wood in a radio address this morning.
George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, said in an interview that there was nothing wrong with the selection process. "It's bad luck and it's unfortunate that it's almost impossible in a competitive environment to proceed with the process in absolute privacy," he said. "But the search and research process did its job."
The President "has not made a decision," Mr. Stephanopoulos said, "and is still considering several people and is going to announce his decision relatively soon."
 
Looking at Former Governor
 White House officials said former Gov. Gerald L. Baliles of Virginia, a friend of Mr. Clinton when the two were members of the Democratic Leadership Council, was still in the running. One advantage of choosing him, they said, was that he had been among the finalists for United States Trade Representative and had already gone through initial background checks.
The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, also said they had not ruled out Judge Patricia M. Wald of the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. She had been Mr. Clinton's first choice for Attorney General but said she was not interested.
Others likely to be considered include Drew S. Days 3d, a law professor at Yale University; Diana Murphy, a Federal judge in Minneapolis, and Jamie S. Gorelick, president of the District of Columbia Bar Association.
 
A Candidate Is Culled
 Charles F. C. Ruff, a Washington lawyer who had once been viewed as a strong alternative, has been ruled out, officials said, because of questions involving his hiring of a maid. Mr. Ruff confirmed in an interview today that he had employed a woman once a week for the last eight or nine years but had not paid her Social Security taxes until the issue came up in Ms. Baird's confirmation hearings.
Asked if his actions were improper, Mr. Ruff, who said he has since paid about $3,300 in back taxes, replied, "That's for others to judge, I'm afraid."
White House officials said they were discouraged that the turn of events with the Attorney General search had put a pall over what had been a largely successful week for Mr. Clinton.
"The frustrating thing was that our legs were really getting underneath us," said one official closely involved in the selection process. "There was a sense we had a great week: the family leave bill, the economy was back in focus, the gays thing was behind us, and then this. To have the week end like this was just a bummer."

HEADLINE: Growth of a New-Age Political Machine

BYLINE: By MARTIN GOTTLIEB

 BODY:
In struggling neighborhoods from the northeast Bronx to southeast Queens, a new sort of political warlord is walking the ground that once belonged to the powerful Democratic county bosses in New York City. And none is more successful than a Brooklyn Assemblyman who is scarcely known outside political circles or his own dilapidated Bushwick neighborhood: Vito J. Lopez.
Over 17 years of near obscurity, Mr. Lopez has built the prototype of the modern inner-city political machine, one capable of generating thousands of votes and armies of volunteers, largely by exploiting its links to a social-service organization that Mr. Lopez founded and that is now the largest employer and economic enterprise in his neighborhood. 
 The machine is potent enough to induce pilgrimages from mayors, senators and, last year, a Presidential candidate named Bill Clinton, who arrived in a 15-car motorcade during last year's New York primary campaign.
The organization, the Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizens Council, employs 1,400 people through more than 50 grants budgeted at more than $33 million annually. Yet at the same time many of those taxpayer dollars -- allocated for pressing human needs -- have been put to work for private, political purposes as well.
They have paid for an agglomeration of power that has stunted the neighborhood's political diversity, rewarded a handful of Mr. Lopez's proteges with well-paying jobs, enriched politically connected contractors and produced programs that in several instances have been criticized for accounting and performance.
Like the social-service groups connected to Representative Floyd H. Flake in Queens, Assemblyman Albert Vann in Bedford-Stuyvesant and Pedro Espada in the Soundview section of the Bronx, the Ridgewood Bushwick council has managed to fill the vacuum left by the dimming influence of county political bosses and the decade-long decline in Federal anti-poverty money. The strongest of the organizations have been able to wrest money from increasingly tight-fisted government agencies.
While several investigations and audits have found nothing illegal in the activities of Ridgewood Bushwick or Mr. Lopez, a look at the agency illustrates the conflicts between governmental and political interests and raises questions about whether well-meaning programs are hurt.
Each day, the council cares for 900 homebound people, provides lunch for more than 600 elderly people and houses several hundred people in $20 million worth of government-subsidized apartments.
Operating far beyond the orb of the standard program for the aged, it counsels tenant organizations, provides legal help in Housing Court, markets private houses, runs youth employment and immigrant rights programs and arranges for people to go to college in Ridgewood Bushwick-sponsored programs. While operating predominantly in Bushwick, it also offers programs in Ridgewood and Glendale in Queens and East New York in Brooklyn.
But politics infuses it from top to bottom: Ridgewood Bushwick's executive director and deputy director serve as a chief fund-raiser and treasurer of Mr. Lopez's political campaigns. The Ridgewood Bushwick official who has run its immigrant assistance program is the co-leader of Mr. Lopez's political club.
Ridgewood Bushwick employees and contractors are asked to pour time and money into Mr. Lopez's races and those of his allies. And his political supporters help the organization secure lucrative grants and then reap political i.o.u.'s.
Making this more extraordinary is the ethnic disparity between Mr. Lopez and the four top Ridgewood Bushwick officials on one hand, who are white, and Bushwick's population, which is 95 percent black and Hispanic. The Assemblyman, who speaks limited Spanish, owes his surname to a paternal grandfather from outside Barcelona.
In an interview, Mr. Lopez described the links between Ridgewood Bushwick and his political endeavors as fundamental to building neighborhood influence in a politically anemic community. He took pride in his political empire, berated detractors, and defended Ridgewood Bushwick's performance and his commitment to Hispanic causes.
"The top social service centers in Bushwick are run by FEGS, Catholic Charities, N.Y.U. in Bushwick High School, the Grand Street Settlement," he said. "They're all from the outside. There has to be an empowerment of local groups. Once you do it, it's called politics, but I'm proud of it, I really am."
 
Finding Bushwick On the Political Map
 When he arrived in Bushwick as a civil servant in the city's Human Resources Administration in the early 1970's, Mr. Lopez was in his words, "wearing flowered shirts and into anything but politics." The son of a wire service photographer, he grew up seven miles away in Bensonhurst, had organized anti-war demonstrations, and "didn't know where Bushwick was" when he was sent to Stanhope Street to convert an empty welfare office to a senior center.
Of predominantly Italian heritage, he found a constituency in the Italian clubs and cafes that still dotted the increasingly Hispanic neighborhood. He built the center's staff and programs by convincing local organizations to lend him 10 workers apportioned under a Federal jobs program.
When the Reagan Administration killed the program, many workers and projects moved to Ridgewood Bushwick, which was incorporated by Mr. Lopez in 1976 though the city prevented him, as a civil servant, from holding an office in it. He has never held a formal position with the council. Among the workers were two who now head the agency -- and also are instrumental in running Mr. Lopez's campaigns -- Christiana Fisher and Angela Battaglia. According to the State Attorney General's office, Ms. Fisher received $75,437 in 1990 as Ridgewood Bushwick's director and head of its home care program, while Ms. Battaglia was paid $61,400 that year as the agency's deputy director and housing director.
In 1982, Mr. Lopez was elected to the Assembly, and he developed friendships with such figures as Mel Miller, who would become Assembly Speaker, Mayor Edward I. Koch and Anthony Genovesi, now an Assemblyman, who is leader of probably the city's most powerful old-fashioned political clubhouse, the Thomas Jefferson Club in Canarsie.
Now, though he remains a fixture at picket lines, he practices modern organization politics that brings in money for the social service agency that he started and turns out votes for his allies. Those outside his loop say their chances of winning government contracts or building political power are often crippled.
"In Brownsville we could do anything as far as raising money -- the politicians would be just as happy as you that you got it," recalled Msgr. John Powis, who worked for more than two decades in Brownsville before becoming pastor of Bushwick's historic St. Barbara's Roman Catholic Church. "In this neighborhood, all government programs come through Vito Lopez."
Richard C. Wade, distinguished professor of urban history at the City University, described it as "post-party politics."
Mr. Wade, referring to the Great Society era of President Lyndon B. Johnson, said, "Unlike the 60's when the feds were running wild, there's not much money around and whoever gets it is a real big shot. These guys are the post-Johnson poverticians."
 
It's Politics, Politics And More Politics
 The interwoven relationship between the social-service goals of Ridgewood Bushwick and the political needs of Mr. Lopez can be seen in ways both blatant and subtle.
For instance, the program printed for Mr. Lopez's fund-raiser of March 2, 1990, carried many advertisements from Ridgewood Bushwick officials and agencies, including its four top officers, board chairman, two lawyers, housing department, education department, home care operation, adult training program and two employment programs whose financing was ended after they repeatedly failed to meet training and job placement goals. Also buying ads in the program were three contractors who built housing for the agency, two architects who designed buildings for it, one of its landlords and the university with which it runs an education program.
The Internal Revenue Service bars nonprofit organizations from "engaging in any political campaign on behalf of, or in opposition to, any candidate for public office." But an I.R.S. spokesman said that it was often difficult to establish violations and that the agency tried to bring not-for-profits into compliance rather than remove their status.
Four past or present Ridgewood Bushwick employees said in interviews that they were asked to help Mr. Lopez's political efforts. The employees, who spoke on the condition that their names not be used, said supervisors asked them to collect nominating signatures for Mr. Lopez and his friends, to buy tickets to a $60-a-seat fund-raiser Mr. Lopez held last year, and to encourage friends to contribute goods and services to events of Mr. Lopez's political club. In an interview, Mr. Lopez adamantly denied that such activity took place.
Ms. Battaglia said: "It's never held against them if they don't do it. When we send letters and notices to our vendors, it's always, 'Would you like to?' If they say, 'No,' no big thing."
The Ridgewood Bushwick senior center at 195 Linden Street offers an example of the overlap of government and politics. The center provides lunch for 100 elderly people each day and is run by an engaging woman named Anna Gonzalez.
She also carries nominating petitions for Mr. Lopez and his allies. Last year she collected more than 100 of the 5,200 signatures that Mr. Lopez amassed, many at a table in the lobby of the senior citizen housing project that includes her center. Ms. Gonzalez said she took vacation days for political work and performed none of it at the center.
On Election Day, those at the center find voting easy. Three polling places are there. Eleven more are in other Ridgewood Bushwick senior centers and housing projects, eight in Mr. Lopez's Assembly district. In the 1989 mayoral primary, when Mr. Koch was losing poor and minority neighborhoods by margins of as much as 10 to 1, he had Mr. Lopez's endorsement in Bushwick and managed to poll 40 percent of the vote.
 
Advantage of Allies In the Highest Places
 When the agency faces a setback from bureaucrats, political influence has never hurt. In the mid-1980's, Ridgewood Bushwick applied to the regional office of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development to build two housing projects for the elderly but was rejected in favor of higher-rated proposals.
But Mr. Lopez had in his corner Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, who had been able to win other grants, including a $1.1 million swimming pool in Island Park, L.I., from personal discretionary funds controlled by Samuel R. Pierce Jr., then the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
Mr. Pierce awarded Ridgewood Bushwick more than $14 million out of his discretionary fund for the two projects. After the award, Ridgewood Bushwick gave the contracts to build the projects to the Jobco Company of Long Island, owned by an important D'Amato fund-raiser, Michael Puntillo.
According to the Housing Department's records, the builder's fee could run as high as $784,621. And when Mr. D'Amato went to Stanhope Street during his tight campaign last year against Robert Abrams, Mr. Lopez sang his praises.
Ms. Battaglia said politics had nothing to do with Jobco's selection. She said that the company had approached the agency and that its offer was the best. Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Mr. D'Amato, said he fought for the Ridgewood Bushwick projects "as hard as we fought for every other project." She said the Senator leaves selection of contractors to sponsoring agencies.
When the projects, one on Himrod Street and the other on Goodwin Place, opened last year, they were fraught with problems. The Goodwin Place project had trouble putting tenants in the rent-subsidized apartment. In fact three months after opening, said Ms. Battaglia, the occupancy rate was "a mere 5 percent," which she attributed to extensive paperwork requirements.
After an inspection of Himrod Street last June, Gerald W. Sheridan of the H.U.D. area office cited 20 violations of varying import and wrote Ms. Battaglia that "procedures were found to be so deficient that we found it necessary to train your staff in the areas covered in this report."
In an interview, H.U.D. officials said the worst problems at the Himrod Street project had been corrected as a result of the training.
As Ridgewood Bushwick was working out these problems, it received H.U.D. approval for a third project for the elderly, which has a projected cost of $9.3 million. One housing official said that after the approval, Mr. Lopez began to seek a site change from the approved location of Troutman Street and Evergreen Avenue. Because of legislative redistricting, the location wound up two blocks outside his district.
Ms. Battaglia said a H.U.D. architect had first suggested the change, but Adam Glantz, a department spokesman, said that the proposal had come from Ridgewood Bushwick and that his agency was considering a new site. The new site happens to be within Mr. Lopez's district.
The Assemblyman denied lobbying for the change. "Show me a letter where I said the site should be moved," he demanded heatedly. But after a moment, more calmly, he added: "I don't mind it coming into my district. I'd love to get more programs in my district, and I'm committed to that. I'd love it. I really would."

HEADLINE: Looking for an Attorney General: The Reaction;
Women Are Frustrated By Failed Nominations

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
Women across the country yesterday reacted with immense frustration at what they perceived as a growing double standard for men and women being considered for the Clinton Cabinet.
Many said they understood and agreed with Mr. Clinton's decision to accept the withdrawal of his first nominee for Attorney General, Zoe Baird, after it was learned that she had broken the law by employing an illegal alien. But they said they were astounded that Kimba M. Wood, a strong candidate who had not violated the law, should also be forced out of competition because she once hired an illegal alien to care for her young son. That hiring was legal, since it occurred before immigration laws were tightened, and Judge Wood insisted in a statement Friday that she "fulfilled every legal requirement" regarding that employee. 
 "Kimba Wood got caught in the wave created by the Zoe Baird situation," said Susan Estrich, a law professor at the University of Southern California and an outspoken feminist. "I didn't have a lot of sympathy for Zoe Baird. She knowingly broke the law though she had the financial resources to do otherwise. But what is disconcerting here is that we seem to have created an atmosphere where someone who did not break the law is nonetheless barred from serving."
 
A Double Standard?
 Although it was impossible yesterday to determine precisely how the majority of Americans felt about Judge Wood and her fate, it was clear that many women in and out of politics felt that the judge was being treated unfairly because of the President's political calculations, even though Mr. Clinton was seen as insistent that a woman be named to the post.
Abby Ginzberg, a lawyer at the American Bar Association's midwinter meeting in Boston, said she fears all female candidates will now be suspect. She said she had wholly supported Judge Wood's candidacy. "If she can't pass the test, nobody can."
Women's distress over the matter seemed to cross party lines. "I've been talking to friends of mine all day long," said Tanya Melich, a Republican political consultant, "and I don't think that there was one of them who thought she was treated fairly. I can only say it's more sexism. We have one standard for the boys and another for the girls."
Many men, however, saw the issue instead as a case of political necessity. Several political strategists said the Baird case had so alarmed the White House that it could not affort a trace of repetition.
"The logical, rational argument is that these situations were entirely different," said William A. Carrick, a Democratic strategist who worked with Senator Dianne Feinstein's campaign in California. "But on a political level, I think it would have been almost impossible to differentiate."
Yet he may have been wrong. Joann Sanicola, a sales clerk who was shoveling snow outside the east Bronx jewelry store where she works, said she did not believe that Judge Wood's nomination should have been sidetracked. "She should have continued pursuit of the office," said Ms. Sanicola, who described herself as a member of the "overworked, hard-working, average middle-class." Ms. Sanicola said her own understanding was that "She was paying taxes. There was nothing that she did that was illegal."
It was precisely that point that so angered many professional women around the country. Scores stressed their general sense that women were being held to a higher standard than men in the appointment process and were subject to an additional layer of questioning that men have never had to endure.
"For every man who has ever been confirmed to a Cabinet position there has never been the notion of disclosure of his housekeeping arrangement, much less how much time he spent with his child," said Kathleen Brown, the treasurer of the State of California. "It has never been on anyone's mind. It just doesn't come up for male nominees to think about their pattern of child care as a matter for political disclosure or an F.B.I. search."
 
More Problems for Clinton
 That is already changing. Sources within the Clinton Administration said Friday that Charles F. C. Ruff, one of two other potential nominees for Attorney General, was out of the running because of questions about whether he had employed an illegal alien. That seemed to mark the first time that the issue had been raised about a man.
Despite the apparent rejection of Mr. Ruff, many women hammered their contention that a potential cabinet appointee who was also a father is far less likely to stumble on the same minefield. Many said they were also angered that the White House had publicized what Clinton officials perceived as Judge Wood's second liability, that she had trained -- for five days two decades ago -- to work at a Playboy club in London while attending the London School of Economics. They said they were outraged by suggestions that that brief stint could have subjected her to ridicule.
Stressing that the work would have involved nothing illegal, they pointed out that women in the 1960's often had to take demeaning jobs to finance their higher education.
"How old is this woman?" asked Marika Caruana, 32, of Riverdale. "You're talking about something that was done 28 years ago? I think it's ridiculous."
 
'Brought It Upon Herself'
 Gloria Steinem, who once worked as a Playboy bunny and has written of her experiences, said she believed some of the reaction to both candidates is simply a caustic backlash against powerful women. "Having been a bunny," she said, "I can tell you that it is incredibly hard work and very underpaid and very exploitative."
Men and women interviewed yesterday consistently saw the issue differently. At the entrance to the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, a husband and wife fell into immediate disagreement when asked about the case. "I don't see a double standard," said a man who would not identify himself.
"That's because you're not a woman," his wife retorted. "If it were a man they never would have asked."
Not far away, Mike Benson, another museum visitor, disputed the notion of a double standard. "Zoe Baird brought it upon herself," he said. "If a male had done the same thing, they would have asked him the same questions."
 
 
Problems Facing Women
 Representative Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat, said she empathized with women who had to juggle careers and family life. Noting that both Ms. Baird and Judge Wood had significant financial resources, Ms. Schroeder said their back-to-back withdrawals should clarify the need for better child care.
"We have a tremendous problem in this country," she said. "This shows how deeply we need the family leave act and other legislation."
That reaction was heard across the New York metropolitan area yesterday. At the Pretty Please Hair Salon in Riverdale, the Bronx, Ruth Hass, who manages a New York City tour guide agency, wondered: "Is it only the mother responsible for hiring an illegal alien? I have a feeling Clinton is not going to be able to get any Attorney General in this country who has young children, male or female, if that is the criteria."
In Manhattan, Felicity Frisbie, 41, a mother who was chasing her son around the dinosaur exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History, said: "This is a problem that society denies we have. There are women who need child care and there are immigrant women who need work."
Ann F. Lewis, a Democratic analyst, agreed. "If a car breaks down you have no trouble saying to your boss that you will be in late," Ms. Lewis said. "But if your child gets sick it is seen as a problem. In this society it is O.K. to worry about your car, but it is not O.K. to worry about your child."
By late yesterday afternoon, some groups were already preparing organized objections to the way the two candidates for Attorney General were treated.
In Memphis, where leaders of the National Organization for Women were holding a board meeting, they agreed to begin an orchestrated fax, telephone and mailgram campaign to highlight the different treatment during the confirmation process, said Patricia Ireland, the group's president. "What we want to know is what arrangements all the men in the cabinet have made for their child care," she said.
Some men couldn't have agreed more. "I'm pro-women's-lib," said Anthony Serrano, a taxi driver in New York. "I don't think this subject would have come up if it were men. There are guys sitting there with their butts in those chairs asking questions who don't know what's going on at home. Be honest, how many men that applied for this position have ever been asked this question."

It wasn't just Zoe. She's just one of the parents. Is it only the mother responsible for hiring an illegal alien?" (Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: As Ethnic Wars Multiply, U.S. Strives for a Policy

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER with BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
At the height of World War I, Woodrow Wilson argued that self-determination for Europe's myriad ethnic minorities, suddenly freed by the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires, would provide stability in the postwar environment. But even as the concept of self-determination was being born, President Wilson's own Secretary of State, Robert Lansing, worried that the idea might make the world more dangerous.
"Will it not breed discontent, disorder and rebellion?" Lansing wrote. "The phrase is simply loaded with dynamite. It will raise hopes which can never be realized. It will, I fear, cost thousands of lives. 
 "What a calamity that the phrase was ever uttered! What misery it will cause!"
Now as the cold war gives way to dozens of smaller wars over ethnic dominance, diplomats, scholars and world leaders alike are coping with the legacy Lansing cautioned against in the second decade of the century.
Policy makers say that the current ethnic conflicts are actually the third wave of this century, with the first two having taken place after World War I and the explosion of anticolonial movements in Africa and Asia after World War II. But the newest wave is seen as even more complex, potentially more threatening to international peace and almost certain to grow in the years ahead.
Indeed, diplomats and scholars inside and outside the Clinton Administration have begun studying options to deal with the new kinds of conflicts that range from enhancing the role of the United Nations to establishing a new international tribunal to listen to grievances by ethnic minorities in various countries.
Citing what he called "the surfacing of long-suppressed ethnic, religious and sectional conflicts" in the world, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said before taking office that the task of heading off such rivalries would be a primary objective for the United States.
"If we don't find some way that the different ethnic groups can live together in a country, how many countries will we have?" Mr. Christopher said at confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "We'll have 5,000 countries rather than the hundred plus we now have."
Mr. Christopher called for "preventive diplomacy" to keep the conflicts from spreading. He also endorsed "new dispute resolution techniques," including some form of international arbitration, and increased use of United Nations forces to monitor and enforce agreements.
"We can't afford to careen from crisis to crisis," Mr. Christopher said. "We must have a new diplomacy that can anticipate and prevent crises, like those in Iraq and Bosnia and Somalia, rather than simply manage them."
The Secretary's testimony might be seen by some as contradicting one Administration policy -- namely, its refusal to endorse the plan put forward by a joint mediation effort led by Cyrus R. Vance, the United Nations negotiator, and Lord Owen, the European Community envoy, to end the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Clinton Administration is concerned that the negotiators' peace plan to divide Bosnia into 10 regions might reward the Serbian side for its campaign of "ethnic cleansing" against Muslims and Croats.
 
Enshrined in U.N. Charter
 President Wilson's original proposals for self-determination have influenced American policy for generations and were eventually enshrined after World War II in the United Nations Charter. Many diplomats say that the concept is unlikely to be discarded even though there are rising fears that it may be carried to extremes.
"The defining mode of conflict in the era ahead is ethnic conflict," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat. "It promises to be savage. Get ready for 50 new countries in the world in the next 50 years. Most of them will be born in bloodshed."
The biggest factor in unleashing the conflicts has been the end of the cold war, in which the superpowers mostly succeeded in suppressing ethnic rivalries within their spheres of influence.
"The nation-state as a European concept has brought together all kinds of elements of diversity, kept in check by state power and hooked into global structures," said Francis M. Deng, a former Foreign Minister in Sudan and now a senior associate at the Brookings Insitution.
"Once you remove the cold war factionalism, there is the euphoria of freedom, everyone asserting the identities that were previously suppressed," he said. "We are now witnessing the desire of people to fall back on that which is authentic to them."
 
Old Grievances at Issue
 In many of the conflicts today, Muslims are under attack by other groups -- like Serbs in the former Yugoslavia or Hindu militants in India -- who assert a sense of grievance nursed after Muslim conquests many centuries ago. But at the same time Islamic fundamentalists are on the attack in Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa, where last week Pope John Paul II appealed to Muslims not to use force to press their doctrines on non-believers.
The question facing policy makers in light of the tensions is how the United States decides where its interests lie. Scholars and others say that little work has been done to try to assign priorities of where to intervene and where not to.
"I don't think we have a doctrine for the complicated set of circumstances we face," said Michael Krepon, president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, which conducts policy research on arms control and peacemaking. In some cases, he said, warring parties in such conflicts would welcome the presence of an American or other outside intermediary, but in other cases they would oppose such a force.
A new idea is evolving among diplomats to the effect that the international community may have a right to intervene in the affairs of a country simply because that country is mistreating its minority groups. At the very least, some say, nations should withhold diplomatic recognition of such countries.
"The international system is at a crossroads on the concept of what is a nation state," Madeleine K. Albright, the United States representative to the United Nations, said in an interview before her appointment. "We need to make sure that when a country declares independence, individual as well as minority rights are guaranteed before granting recognition."
 
U.N. Activities Mushroom
 The United Nations is certain to be the focus of stepped-up efforts to deal with international conflicts. Since 1988, 14 new United Nations peacekeeping operations have been established, more than in the previous 40 years of its history. The number of soldiers wearing the United Nations blue berets has risen fourfold this year and the budget for peacekeeping operations jumped from $700 million in 1991 to $2.8 billion in 1992.
In the early years of its activities, the United Nations' main function was to send observer missions or forces to monitor cease-fires. On the new world stage, the United Nations has begun deploying forces as part of political settlements, in some cases helping to disarm the parties in conflict and organize elections to try to bring stability to the war-torn nations. It has carried out such activities in El Salvador, Namibia, Mozambique, Western Sahara, Angola and, in its biggest operation, Cambodia.
"It is fairly clear in some parts of the world that the nation-state is not an adequate expression of the political framework when minorities are automatically disenfranchised," said a senior State Department official involved in such operations. "To a large degree, we have to get away from the the idea of total respect for sovereignty that was once sacrosanct."
This official said that Cambodia, Bosnia and Somalia were "states not capable of governing themselves," and that in each, the United States and other United Nations members had begun to "take government powers out of the hands of indigenous peoples."
In all past situations, though, the United Nations or outside forces went in with the full consent of the parties in conflict. What is facing it now is whether to go into cases where it might forcefully have to disarm one side.
 
An Old Idea Is Revived
 Others suggest that the United Nations should go even further and in effect run countries that have failed to control their disparate forces from within. Such a role would revive the concept of United Nations trusteeships, an instrument employed after World War II to administer former colonies until they were ready for independence.
Some diplomats say that Bosnia and Somalia might be early candidates for United Nations trusteeships, but no move in that direction has begun. And many experts worry about the precedent of the United Nations or any other instrument of the international community intervening where it may not be wanted, turning the United Nations into the new world's colonial power.
"We are at the point of claiming that the larger community has more rights of intervention," Senator Moynihan said. But he added: "I don't want a proposition that has the U.N. General Assembly deciding how we are handling our affairs in Elmira, N.Y."
The modes of possible future cooperation between the United States and the United Nations are only in the earliest stages of discussion.
For example, last summer, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali proposed a separate and permanent United Nations military force to intervene on behalf of the international community, either to prevent or stop ethnic conflicts within member states.
 
U.S. to Study 3 Options
 Mr. Boutros-Ghali's idea was quietly rebuffed by the Bush Administration, but the Clinton Administration may be more receptive. At his own confirmation hearings, Defense Secretary Les Aspin said the new Administration would be studying three possibilities of some new kind of force with the United Nations.
In one option, he said there could be a permanent force assigned to the United Nations to intervene in other countries. In the second, various different countries might designate their own forces as available when needed by the United Nations.
The third option, he said, would be to establish a voluntary force for which Americans or individuals from any country could volunteer "like you could sign to join up in the French Foreign Legion." Mr. Aspin said he found all these ideas "interesting" and worth exploring.
On the other hand, Mr. Aspin ruled out allowing American troops to take part in a force under the command of the United Nations, saying such an arrangement would create "very serious and obvious constitutional problems" because the American units would be under the Secretary General.
 
New Institutions Suggested
 Beyond the United Nations, some experts urge the creation of new institutions altogether to deal with ethnic conflict. Such an institution might be an outgrowth of existing units, including the United Nations, the European Community, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Mr. Christopher proposed consideration be given to setting up some kind of "international tribunal" to listen to claims on aggrieved minorities in countries. The tribunal's work would go beyond that of the International Court of Justice, which is confined to adjudicating claims between countries.
Mr. Moynihan asserts that the two dominant philosophical views of the century blinded officials into not recognizing that ethnic identity was going to be one of the most powerful historical forces of the century.
The first philosophical view was Marxism, which predicted that ethnic identity would give way to conflict over ownership and production among economic classes. The second view was what Mr. Moynihan calls "the liberal expectancy" -- the view of liberals from the time of Adam Smith in the 18th century that nations would get bigger for economic reasons and that ethnic factors would fade in significance.
"Both were wrong, and yet we have lived through the century seeing the world in these two perspectives," Mr. Moynihan said.

Europe
1. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: Serbian forces have captured about 70 percent of the country and carried out an "ethnic cleansing" campaign that has expelled and killed Muslims and Croats and brought widespread condemnation. Tens of thousands of people have been estimated as killed -- perhaps as many as 150,000 killed or missing -- and 1.5 million uprooted from their homes.
2. CROATIA: Serbian separatists control about a third of Croatia's territory. An estimated 25,000 have been killed since Croatia declared independence in 1991.
3. SPAIN: Nationalists saying they represent three million Basques seek an independent state on the border of Spain and France. Since 1968, 717 people have been killed in Spain and 49 in France.
4. BRITAIN: The Protestant majority in Northern Ireland favors continued union with Britain while the Catholic minority wants to join with the rest of Ireland. More than 3,000 people have been killed in fighting between British troops, Protestant paramilitary groups and the Irish Republican Army since 1969.
Britain has also seen a surge in attacks by whites on black and Asian immigrants.
5. GERMANY: An influx of 650,000 foreigners seeking asylum from Bulgaria, Romania, the Balkans and other areas has stirred anger in the last two years among right-wing groups. According to German authorities, right-wing and neo-Nazi groups carried out more than 2,000 attacks last year on asylum-seekers, resulting in 17 deaths and nearly 600 injuries.
6. ROMANIA: Romania's ethnic Hungarians, mostly in Transylvania, want greater autonomy and the right to educate children in their language. There have been sporadic attacks on Gypsies.
7. RUSSIA: Chechenya and Ingushetia have broken apart and seek greater autonomy within Russia. But Ingushetia and Northern Ossetia are fighting over territory in clashes that have killed more than 300 people.
8. MOLDOVA: Moldova's mainly Romanian population seeks economic, political and cultural ties with Romania. The Dniester region in eastern Moldova, where most of the population is of Russian and Ukrainian origin, declared independence in 1990, fearing that Moldova will unite with Romania. About 800 people have been killed and 4,000 others have been displaced by fighting.
9. GEORGIA: Abkhazia, dominated by Muslims, seeks independence or union with Russia. From 700 to 1,500 people are estimated to have been killed and 80,000 displaced in the fighting. Southern Ossetia, also dominated by Muslims, seeks union with Northern Ossetia, an autonomous republic in Russia. About 1,500 are estimated to have died in the fighting.
 
Middle East and North Africa:
10. AZERBAIJAN: Troops from Muslim-dominated Azerbaijan, aided by Russian forces, are fighting to end a rebellion by Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave within Azerbaijan populated largely by Christian Armenians, who favor independence or affiliation with Armenia. An estimated 3,000 people on both sides have been killed since 1989, and 350,000 Armenians and 500,000 Azerbaijanis have been displaced.
In addition, Kurds in western Azerbaijan are demanding autonomy and have fought Azerbaijani forces.
11. TURKEY: Kurdish separatists represented by the Marxist Kurdish Workers Party have sought a separate Kurdish state in fighting that has killed 2,500 since 1984.
12. IRAQ: In the north, two major Kurdish parties rule in an enclave protected militarily by the United States and its allies. Several hundred have died in clashes with Iraqi forces since the 1991 Persian Gulf war. In the south, leaders of a rebellion by Shiite Muslims say that tens of thousands of Shiites have been killed by forces of the Sunni-dominated Baghdad Government since the end of the Persian Gulf war.
13. ISRAEL: The intifada, a popular uprising of Palestinians against Israeli occupation of the West Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip, erupted in 1987. About 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers, 500 have been killed by fellow Palestinians, and about 100 Israelis have been killed in Palestinian attacks.
14. ALGERIA: A revolt by Islamic militants has led to about 150 deaths in clashes with Government forces since the military canceled the second round of elections a year ago when Islamic parties were on the brink of winning a majority.
15. EGYPT: More than 70 people have been killed in clashes between Islamic militants and Government security forces and in attacks by militants on foreigners and Coptic Christians.
16. SUDAN: The Government, dominated by Arab Muslims from the north, is fighting a longstanding insurgency by black Christians and animists in south. Thousands have been reported killed and millions displaced.
 
Africa South of the Sahara:
17. MAURITANIA: Government security forces under the Arab-dominated regime of Col. Maawiya Ould Sid Ahmed Taya have clashed with opposition groups angry over expulsions and oppression of the black minority.
18. MALI: A demand for sovereignty by ethnic Tuaregs, a light-skinned nomadic people living in both Mali and neighboring Niger, has led to fighting in both Mali and Niger.
19. CHAD: President Idriss Deby, who ousted President Hissen Habre in 1990, has faced sporadic rebellions in the west and south of Chad. Some have reportedly involved clashes between Mr. Deby's Zakawa tribe and members of Mr. Habre's Gourane tribe.
20. SOMALIA: Clan fighting escalated into full-scale civil war in which 300,000 died and a million were made homeless from war or starvation. An American-led military force has intervened and tried to establish stability.
21. SENEGAL: In Casamance, a coastal region mostly populated by the Diola tribe, there is opposition to Muslim domination in the government. Hundreds have been killed and thousands have been displaced in clashes with Government forces.
22. LIBERIA: At least 20,000 have been killed and hundreds of thousands have been uprooted in a civil war. Drawing support from the Gio and Mano ethnic groups, the guerrilla leader Charles Taylor controls most of the country. President Samuel K. Doe, from the Krahn ethnic group, was killed in 1990, and Monrovia is held by an interim government installed by West African nations as part of a regional peace effort.
23. TOGO: Scores were killed last year as Government forces loyal to Togo's leader, Gen. Gnassingbe Eyadema, of the Kabiye tribe, are battling opposition forces, including those from the rival Ewe tribe.
24. NIGERIA: Nigeria, with about 200 ethnic groups, has many conflicts, but violence has been the sharpest in fighting between the Hausas, a predominantly Muslim group in the north, and the mostly Christian Yorubas in the south. Strife involving the Ibos in the east has been dormant in recent years.
25. UGANDA: The army under President Yoweri K. Museveni, composed principally of members of the Baganda and Banyarwanda tribes, continues to wage sporadic warfare with northern rebels, mainly from the Acholi and Langi tribes.
26. RWANDA: Fighting is continuing between the Government, dominated by Hutu tribes, and an invading force led by the minority Tutsi tribe, despite an agreement between the Government and the rebels in July 1992. Tens of thousands have died in ethnic fighting in the last 30 years.
27. BURUNDI: Ethnic clashes between the majority ethnic group, the Hutus, and the minority Tutsis have led to thousands of deaths in recent years.
28. KENYA: Clashes among tribes in 1991 and 1992 have reportedly killed 1,000 people and uprooted 50,000 and led to charges that the Government of President Daniel arap Moi was fomenting such conflict to discredit moves toward democracy.
29. ZAIRE: Thousands have died in the last year in a civil war between forces opposing and loyal to President Mobutu Sese Seko, and the fighting has ethnic overtones because various forces are from competing ethnic groups or tribes.
30. ANGOLA: Renewed fighting between the Government and guerrilla forces led by Jonas Savimbi of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or Unita, has left thousands dead and forced large numbers from their homes in the last few weeks. The struggle is ideological and political in nature, with ethnic overtones because Mr. Savimbi's strongest support comes from ethnic groups that have long felt disenfranchised by the leftist Luanda Government. There is also a violent secessionist movement in Cabinda, an oil-producing area that is geographically separated from the rest of Angola.
31. SOUTH AFRICA: Since 1984, about 15,000 have been killed in political violence related to a black insurrection against the white South African Government. About 3,000 were killed in 1992, many in clashes between Zulus and rival black groups.
 
Asia:
32. TAJIKISTAN: Tens of thousands of Tajik Muslims have been driven from their land by resurgent Communist armies seeking to suppress Islamic political power. More than 25,000 have been killed and 500,000 displaced since 1991.
33. AFGHANISTAN: After the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the overthrow of the Soviet-installed leader, Najibullah, last year, the country has collapsed into civil war among competing ethnic factions. The Hazars control central and western areas near Iran, the Pathans are largely in control in the east and the Tajiks largely control the north. Thousands are estimated to have been killed in recent fighting, and millions of Afghans remain in refugee camps in Pakistan and in Iran.
34. PAKISTAN: Thousands have died in conflicts between government forces and groups of secessionists and dissidents in Sindh and the Northwest Frontier Province. There has also been rioting in Karachi involving descendants of Muslims who emigrated from India at the time of partition with Pakistan in 1947.
35. INDIA: Tensions between Hindus and Muslims exploded in December when Hindu militants razed a mosque in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Rioting that followed in many places across India led to 2,000 killings by official count, and many more by unofficial estimates. Killings by Muslims and Hindus continue. In Kashmir, 5,000 militants, civilians and Indian troops have been killed since a rebellion by the largely Muslim population began in 1990. An estimated 120,000 people, mostly Hindus, have fled Kashmir for other parts of India. In Punjab, about 20,000 Hindus and Sikhs are estimated to have been killed since a rebellion by Sikh militants erupted in 1982. In Assam, more than 200 have been reported killed as an insurgency by secessionists erupted in 1990. In Nagaland, insurgent Bodos have been fighting for a separate state; about 300 people have been killed.
36. BHUTAN: A revolt by ethnic Nepalese against the Government and reprisals by Government forces have led to thousands of Nepalese fleeing the country in the last two years.
37. SRI LANKA: An insurgency by mostly Hindu Tamils in the north and east has been carried out against the Government, which is dominated by the mostly Buddhist Sinhalese. Since 1983, an estimated 28,000 people have been killed in the Tamil rebellion, and another 50,000 in the Government's crackdown on Sinhalese militants.
38. BANGLADESH: A migration by members of the country's Muslim majority into the thinly populated Chittagong Hill Tracts region in the south has led to an insurgency by the area's Chakmas, a mainly Buddhist people, leaving hundreds dead and tens of thousands displaced.
39. MYANMAR: In the last two years, more than 250,000 Muslims, charging harassment, have fled across the western border to Bangladesh. Hundreds are also believed to have died in clashes between Burmese soldiers and separatist Karen and other rebels along the Thai-Burmese border in the last two years.
40. CHINA: Tibetans rebelled against Chinese rule in 1959, with an estimated 87,000 Tibetans killed. After an easing of Chinese rule, Beijing cracked down in 1987. Several dozen people are believed to have been killed in various incidents. In Xinjiang, China suppressed a rebellion among Muslims of Turkic descent in 1990 in which an estimated 50 people died.
41. CAMBODIA: Rebel factions signed a peace accord ending a 13-year civil war. A Supreme National Council made up of the rebel factions and the Cambodian Government is to advise the United Nations, which administers the country's affairs until a new government can be formed after elections this year. Various sides are constantly threatening to walk away from the agreement.
Khmer Rouge soldiers, who blame Vietnam for many of Cambodia's problems, have been carrying out attacks on 100,000 Vietnamese living in Cambodia.
42. INDONESIA: A civil war broke out in East Timor in 1975 after Portugal withdrew, and Indonesia crushed the pro-independence rebellion. Human rights groups charge that 100,000 to 200,000 of the 600,000 mostly Roman Catholic East Timorese have died of starvation, disease or execution since Indonesia annexed the area.
A separatist movement also exists in northern Sumatra, where Indonesian forces are said by Amnesty International to have killed 2,000.
43. PAPUA NEW GUINEA: Rebels on the island of Bougainville declared independence in 1990. The Papua New Guinea Government subdued the rebellion in 1991 after fighting in which 3,000 died.
44. FIJI: Violence erupted after the Indian-dominated Government was elected in 1987. The Government was overthrown and the current Government consolidates ethnic Fijian dominance.
 
Latin America:
45. GUATEMALA: An essentially political conflict between the Guatemalan Government and leftist guerrillas has had ethnic overtones because of the long history of repression of Indians in Guatemala. At least 43,000 Guatemalan refugees have fled into Mexico, but some are beginning to return.
46. COLOMBIA: A group representing rights of Indians, Quintin Lamee, suspended an armed rebellion in 1991, but other Marxist groups claiming to represent peasants are continuing guerrilla attacks on the government.
47. PERU: Since 1980, a Maoist guerrilla group known as Shining Path has waged war and won control of about a third of Peruvian territory, drawing support from largely Indian or mixed-race populations resisting the control of the mostly Hispanic elite in Lima. About 26,000 people have been killed in the war and an estimated 600,000 have fled their homes to other parts of the country. Thousands more have emigrated.
48. BRAZIL: Indian tribes in the Amazon region are pressing the Government in Brasilia to recognize their traditional homelands. In the northern Amazon state of Roraima, the federal Government is campaigning to expel gold miners from the lands of the Yanomami tribes. (pg. 14)

HEADLINE: Looking for an Attorney General: White House Memo;
Setting Up Direct Line To Country

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Guided by polls, focus groups and a keen sense of pop culture, President Clinton is executing a plan to put a distinctive stamp on his Presidency instead of allowing others to define it for him.
Rather than mount White House news conferences or rely solely on sober televised speeches, Mr. Clinton is attempting to forge a direct path -- by satellite and by jet aircraft -- into the minds of the Americans who are willing to give their President more time to prove himself. 
 But by week's end, the President's efforts had become overshadowed yet again by the collapse of another potential Cabinet nomination. Judge Kimba M. Wood, the Federal District judge in New York he had chosen to be Attorney General, was forced to withdraw from consideration after admitting that she, like Zoe Baird before her, had hired an illegal alien to care for her children.
This was not the debacle of the Baird nomination, but White House officials were chagrined that a carefully orchestrated week of positive messages about domestic policy and the economy was obscured by another weekend spent mulling over poor timing and clumsy execution.
 
Shaping the Evening News
 The problem was worsened when Judge Wood resisted requests from the White House that she delay announcing her withdrawal until after the Friday evening newscasts. By releasing a statement with her side of the story in time for the network news, she made it possible for the story of her withdrawal to replace the signing of the family leave act as the White House story of the day.
Nevertheless, the Administration intends to carry on with its program. Said one senior adviser to the President, "We'll just put our heads down and plow ahead."
George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, asserted, "The family leave bill matters a lot more to millions of Americans than the timing of the President's Attorney General announcement."
In the first days of his Presidency, Mr. Clinton has sought to mount a different campaign from the one that allowed him to win election. This time his eventual goal has been to build long-term popular support rather than short-term popular votes.
The approach was test-marketed this week in a speech to employees of the White House Office of Management and Budget in which he promised to cut his staff and asked others to share in the sacrifice.
Mr. Clinton delivered a more focused version of this message in his first weekly radio address today, which was designed in part to play down reports that he was considering raising taxes on energy and limiting Social Security benefits -- two approaches that could hurt the middle class he had vowed to protect.
"I'm going to cut the cost of our government and get rid of windfalls for the wealthy before I ask any of the rest of the American people to make a contribution that is fair and essential to grow our economy," Mr. Clinton said.
 
No Questions Asked
 The radio speech was a case study in how Mr. Clinton plans to sell his programs. By making a one-way address, he was not forced to answer informed questions about what taxes would be raised, how Government would be shrunk or how the deficit would be reduced.
"The problem was, leaks were driving the process until this week," said one adviser to the President. "And all the leaks were focused on the middle class. What we decided to do was drive the process ourselves."
In the five-minute radio address, Mr. Clinton spoke only of his plans for improving the economy and scaling back Government. Saying that his first weeks in the Oval Office had convinced him that "the economic situation has some greater problems than we thought," Mr. Clinton sought to lay the groundwork for the economic speech he will deliver to a joint session of Congress on Feb. 17, which is expected to make the case for higher taxes.
Clinton advisers they hoped to use the radio addresses as a "weekly news event" in the way President Ronald Reagan did and President Bush did not.
 
Focusing on 'Real People'
 The strategy will continue this Wednesday when the President flies to Detroit to participate in a televised "town meeting" in which he fields questions from audiences gathered at stations there and in Atlanta, Seattle and Miami.
In the real America, the President's advisers argue, the political pratfalls that loom so large in Washington matter little.
"I think it's important to get outside the Beltway to talk to real people with real problems and real concerns," said David Wilhelm, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
The town meeting is a media planner's gift from heaven. It will appear on the local stations and on C-Span, the cable network. Each local anchor has been granted a one-on-one taped interview with the President in advance, and the ABC News program "Nightline" will broadcast that night from the set of the meeting in Detroit.
 
Letting Children Speak
 And to top it off, the program will run in each of the four selected markets during prime time in the February "sweeps" period, when the networks typically show their most competitive programming.
Mr. Clinton does have his uses for the conventional methods of communication. On Feb. 20, he will answer questions for 90 minutes in a program to be shown by ABC-TV and moderated by Peter Jennings. But the questions the President answers will come exclusively from children around the country.
"There is no conscious effort to go over the heads of the White House press corps or to bypass the White House press corps," said Jeff Eller, the media affairs director at the White House. "We just want to speak to the people. There is a misconception that it is an either-or."

HEADLINE: For Sears Houses, a Catalogue Like No Other

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CARLINVILLE, Ill., Feb. 6

 BODY:
Millions of American households are filled with items ordered from the Sears catalogue. But this central Illinois town goes one better: it has an entire neighborhood where the houses themselves came from the Big Book.
As far as anyone knows, the 152 houses on nine blocks, an area known as Standard Addition, make up the largest cluster of homes ordered straight out of the Sears catalogue anywhere. So the announcement by Sears, Roebuck & Company last month that it would close its catalogue operation after the spring edition has stirred a particular wistfulness in Carlinville. 
 "Everybody feels sad this institution and part of America is going to be gone," said Linda McGill, who is acting director of the Economic Development Corporation in this town of 5,400 and who lives in a Sears house.
From 1908 to 1940, Sears sold about 100,000 mail-order houses, primarily in the Midwest and East. For a few thousand dollars, buyers got floor plans, precut lumber, nails, paint, doors, light fixtures, everything they needed, all delivered to the nearest railroad station. Sears even provided mortgages.
"It provided us an outlet for everything we offered," said Greg Rossiter, a Sears spokesman. "If we could sell them a home, we could probably sell them everything that goes in it."
Disdained by architects as vulgar jumbles of style, mail-order houses filled the need of thousands who could not afford an architect or builder, says Alan Gowans, a writer who examined the suburban housing boom from 1890 to 1930 in his book "The Comfortable House."
Sears had competitors in the mail-order house business. The Aladdin Company of Bay City, Mich., became one of the biggest suppliers of homes by mail, selling 3,600 in its best year, 1926. Montgomery Ward & Company also sold mail-order houses. The Ladies Home Journal became the best-known supplier of housing plans by mail.
When the Standard Oil Company opened two coal mines near Carlinville 75 years ago, it suddenly needed houses for its workers. The company ordered what it needed from the 1918 Sears catalogue. Standard Oil put the houses together and rented them to its workers.
Today, the neighborhood still has a mass-produced uniformity to it, right down to the standard-issue two trees in the front yards. Owners of the boxy houses have made changes -- an extra room here, an enclosed porch there, some aluminum siding, a red, yellow or blue paint job -- but most of the structures still have "character that will long retain popular favor," as the catalogue put it.
Rooms are small, basements sometimes leak and most second floors are unheated, owners say. But the houses, which go for $20,000 to $40,000 today, are sturdy and require few repairs.
"They're good starter homes," said Jean Goodman, who moved with her husband into a three-bedroom house 12 years ago with a baby; they now have a 13-year-old and an 11-year-old. These days, though, she said, "It would be nice if the house was a little bigger."

HEADLINE: Street Vendors Wary of Council Effort to Create More Licenses

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
While the music throbbed from a large cassette player under a table filled with an assortment of homemade pies and body oils, Morris Powell was quietly seething. Mr. Powell, who has sold his wares for a decade on the broad corridor of street vendors along 125th Street, was angry about a measure now before the City Council that would issue more licenses for vendors, but would cause those permits to expire after five years.
"They act like they're doing us a favor," said Mr. Powell, 50, an unlicensed vendor with a graying beard and buttons reading "Buy Black" and "Marcus Garvey" pinned to his heavy brown coat. "But they're really trying to squeeze us out." 
 Requiring vendors to reapply for a new license after five years, he reasoned, "is like throwing a businessman out of his job after five years." He added, "It's not fair."
Mr. Powell is president of the Universal Black Business People's Association, an organization of about 450 street vendors, most of them unlicensed. He said that his members -- sellers of everything from Afrocentric books and clothing to compact disks and posters -- could not afford the rents of Manhattan stores. Street vending, he said, is a respectable way to earn a living that should be available to anyone, licensed or otherwise.
 
2,000 More Licenses
 At the moment, the city has a limit of about 850 licenses for all street vendors, but officials estimate that as many as 15,000 are operating illegally throughout the city. The proposal before the City Council that so angers Mr. Powell would raise the number of licenses by 2,000 -- an effort to make it easier for vendors to operate legally -- but at the same time discourage them from remaining on street corners for the bulk of their careers. The cost of the licenses would remain $200 a year.
Another measure would prohibit any of the new licensees from operating south of 96th Street in Manhattan.
"The intention here is to make vending an acceptable and accessible, but temporary, way of earning a living," said Councilwoman Susan D. Alter, who represents East Flatbush, Brooklyn. "It should only be a way of getting started, to get your business off the ground," she said.
 
Number Increasing
 City officials say that the number of unlicensed vendors has grown steadily in the last decade as the recession's grip caused New York's economy to shrink and many people to turn to nontaxable pursuits. Moreover, city officials say, many immigrants to the city have found vending an accessible means of earning a living, joining extensive networks of family vending businesses with established supply patterns.
That the ranks of unlicensed vendors can operate so freely is a result of scant enforcement by the police, who regard illegal vending as insignificant, members of the Council and business owners contend. Police officials say they do not have enough officers to crack down more strongly.
Not surprisingly, city officials see the chance to raise the number of licenses as a way to increase revenue. The state Finance and Taxation Department estimated the losses to the city and state from unlicensed vendors, who do not pay taxes on their sales, to be as high as $300 million a year.
 
Proposal Draws Complaints
 The proposal before the City Council seems to have aroused bitterness from a host of quarters.
One example is Khalid Nazir, who owns a women's clothing store on 125th Street, a few doors from Mr. Powell's table of oils and pies. "They don't pay rent, they have no responsibility, they pay no taxes and they block the streets," he said. "The City Council should not be making more licenses available. They should get these people off the street."
Leaders of some associations of small businesses complain that by restricting the new licenses geographically, the city will encourage street vending outside Manhattan.
"Some areas in the outer boroughs are already nearly impassable at lunchtime as it is," said Jerome C. Haggarty, president and chief executive of the Atlantic Avenue Association Local Development Corporation, which represents about 200 retail businesses in Brooklyn.
"We don't think the solution to the problem of illegal vendors is to give out 2,000 more licenses," he said. "The answer is more enforcement of the existing laws."
Sung Soo Kim, chairman of the Small Business Congress of the City of New York and president of the Korean American Small Business Service Center of New York, agreed. "The city is hurting the small business owners -- who are taxpayers -- by not keeping the illegal vendors off the street," he said.
 
Only Slightly Easier
 Vendors operating illegally say that raising the cap by 2,000 will merely convert the task of obtaining a license from an impossible one to a painfully difficult one. "That will still leave at least 8,000 people with no licenses," Mr. Powell said.
"We bring business to the areas where we operate," he said. "They're trying to make it hard for us. And getting a license and operating legally is already hard enough."
In fact, obtaining a license is now virtually impossible. The licenses are seldom given up by vendors, but often passed among relatives. "The waiting list has been closed for several years," said Patricia B. Cohen, a spokeswoman for the Department of Consumer Affairs. "And there is really very little turnover."
Frank T. W. New, the Mayor's director of legislative affairs, said that the Dinkins administration was now developing proposals on how to deal with vendors, and should have them ready within the next two months. The number of licenses should be increased, Mr. New said, although the total has not been determined.
He added that the plan "will have stringent enforcement of the vending laws as an important component."
 
'Stringent Enforcement'
 The issue of enforcing the vending laws -- a polite phrasing for pulling street merchants off the street -- is in fact the centerpiece of many of the complaints of small business owners.
"The police see the street peddlers as just people out there trying to make a living," said Mr. Kim. "They don't realize that they're choking the small business owner."
Ms. Alter said the matter should be voted on by the Council within the next three months or so. But she added that the Dinkins administration would have to provide assurances that it would vigorously enforce the vendor laws. "I can't see how my bill would have much impact without that commitment to having strong enforcement," she said.
For the time being, Mr. Powell said that he and other unlicensed vendors believe they are in for more difficult days, no matter whether Ms. Alter's measure is enacted or if another plan offered by the Mayor goes into effect.
"Things have always been tough for the street vendor," he complained. "With all the drugs and vices out here in the streets, we think the police should have enough to do and leave us alone. We just don't want to be treated like criminals."

HEADLINE: Lawyers Face Rise in Claims of Corruption

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Tempted by the economic expectations of the high-octane 1980's but hindered by the sluggish reality of the 1990's, more and more lawyers in New York State are stealing larger sums of money from their clients, according to officials who monitor lawyer misconduct.
"What has happened since the recession began a few years ago would knock your socks off," said Frederick Miller, executive director of the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection, an agency created by New York State in 1982 to compensate people who have been robbed by their lawyers. He said the fund, which is supported by licensing fees paid by all lawyers, is "stretched to the breaking point." 
 In 1992, the agency received 626 complaints from people claiming that their lawyers had pirated a total of $25.2 million, up from from 311 complaints alleging $5.7 million in thefts in 1987. The agency upheld 288 complaints last year and awarded the victims $13.5 million, compared with 159 valid complaints and $2 million awarded in 1987.
The number of lawyers found to have misused client funds remains small, at fewer than 50 a year out of about 125,000 lawyers in the state, Mr. Miller said. But he stressed that those few who are cited do disproportionate harm to their clients and to public trust in the legal profession.
 
Impact of Recession
 Officials of the American Bar Association and legal ethicists say they do not know whether the trend in New York applies to the entire country. Later this year, the association will compile a report on lawyer misconduct nationwide over the last three years, but different reporting and enforcement practices in each state make it difficult to draw broad conclusions, said Gilbert Webb, the assistant client protection counsel for the bar association.
Like several others who deal with lawyer thefts, Mr. Miller attributed the increase in New York to the recession, which he said "has had a disastrous impact on the practice of law." He noted that the economic slump in the metropolitan region dated to 1987, three years before the national downturn.
Law is also a more crowded field in New York than elsewhere, he noted, and despite shrunken economic opportunity, "we keep adding a huge population of lawyers each year."
Michael G. Cherkasky, chief of the investigations division of the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, said many thefts occurred because lawyers got used to a lucrative way of life in the last decade. "In the '80's, I think a lot of successful lawyers got used to a certain life style that they can't sustain any more," he said. He also speculated that in many cases, lawyers take money to cover some immediate needs, "thinking they're going to pay it back."
A few recent cases have gained widespread attention because of the extraordinary amounts of money involved. On Jan. 22, Jarrett Glantz of Manhattan pleaded guilty in State Supreme Court to stealing more than $1 million from two client accounts. Prosecutors said Mr. Glantz, who is awaiting sentencing, misappropriated as much as $10 million over three years, mostly by shuffling it from one account to another to cover his thefts.
In 1991, Manhattan prosecutors charged another lawyer, Steven J. Romer, with making off with more than $14 million, the largest case in New York State history involving a lawyer's mishandling of client funds, though much of the money was later recovered. Mr. Romer was convicted of grand larceny and other charges, and sentenced to 7 1/2 to 22 1/2 years in prison.
Frank R. Rosiny, chairman of the State Bar Association's Committee on Professional Discipline, said his panel has seen a marked growth in drug-related misconduct by lawyers. He said it was impossible to tell whether those lawyers steal from clients to cover drug debts, or whether "it's part of a general breakdown of a person's character."
Lawyers who handle estates and long-term trusts, like Mr. Glantz, face particular temptations because they control sums of money for months or years for people who often pay little attention to the way it is handled, regulators say.
 
More Lawyers Disbarred
 The State Bar Association does not track theft reports specifically, but its annual reports show that complaints against lawyers referred to the appellate courts, which handle only the most serious cases, jumped to 433 in 1991 from 224 in 1989. The number of lawyers disbarred rose to 70 from 48, and the number who resigned from the bar before their cases could be resolved went to 43 from 15.
"While we're not ready to release numbers for '92, every indication is that the trend continued upwards," Mr. Rosiny said.
Of the four appellate court divisions in New York State, the two that comprise New York City, Long Island and Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess, Orange and Rockland counties accounted for 75 percent of the cases from 1989 to 1991, and 86 percent of disbarments.
 
Increased Enforcement
 Mr. Rosiny cautioned that figures showing a dramatic increase in lawyer misconduct could be misleading. "The stats may be going up not because there's an incredible number of miscreants out there but because the system is better at catching up with them."
Bar associations have become more aggressive in pursuing dishonest lawyers, Mr. Rosiny said, but there remains room for improvement. He described the current complex systems for evaluating and judging complaints, which is the province of bar associations and the courts, as needlessly intricate, and inconsistent from one part of the state to another.
Others in the field contend that enforcement has improved, though they admit it is difficult to prove legal misconduct. "There was a time not that long ago when lawyers who stole did not go to prison, and that's no longer true," Mr. Miller said. "That's a start."

 BODY:
With only three weeks left in the 81st annual campaign, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund is facing a shortfall that could cripple efforts to rescue thousands of people who desperately want help and have nowhere to turn.
The current Neediest Cases campaign passed the $4 million mark yesterday, but it has received about $625,000 less than it had by this date in 1992. Officials at the seven charities supported by the fund now have to consider what was once unthinkable: reducing or eliminating vital programs. 
 Executives at the Children's Aid Society, a Neediest Cases charity, fear that if contributions do not pick up, they will have to cancel health services for 4,000 children and emergency food programs that serve 2,000 meals in some of New York City's poorest neighborhoods.
Such cutbacks would come at a time when many social-service agencies already feel overwhelmed. With the unemployment rate in New York City at 13.4 percent, more and more people are spending this winter without even necessities.
 
Solving Problems at Home
 "It would be very discouraging for us to have fewer available dollars to give to an increasingly needy population," said Philip Coltoff, executive director of the Children's Aid Society. "New Yorkers have been extremely generous and forthcoming with the problems that we face abroad, but we hope that they won't forget the needy and the poor who remain with us at home."
Dozens of contributors from across the country have responded to news that the Neediest Cases appeal is down from last year's record campaign. The fund now stands at $4,020,482.62; by this time last year, it had $4,648,927.76.
"We were all very distressed to learn that this year's revenues have been far behind those of last year," Dr. Bernard M. Aaron of Ocean, N.J., wrote in a letter to the fund with his $500 check. "My family and I wish to send this money in the hope that no programs will go without proper funding this year."
Leo and Georgine Vroman of Brooklyn gave $50. "It would be a shame if your fund would fall short at this time," they wrote. "The cases demonstrate that help does not need to be indefinite and very costly to make a difference."
 
Second Donations
 Virginia Miles of Englewood, N.J., has been giving to the Neediest Cases since the 1920's. She recently sent her second contribution for this year's appeal -- $100. "I couldn't stand the idea that the fund was falling behind when the need is even greater," she wrote.
Donald L. Bartlett of Chazy, N.Y., gave $20. "I can only hope that all who have previously contributed this year read of your 1993 shortfall," he wrote. "Here is my additional check to help out."
Since the early years of this century, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund has been aiding people whose lives are in crisis. The Times pays the expenses of the Neediest Cases campaign, so all contributions go directly to the charities. This year's appeal ends on Feb. 28, so there is still time to give.
"This is my second contribution this year since there is, it seems to me, more suffering and more destitution," wrote Alexandra Werner of Manhattan, who sent $50 to the fund.
And Dr. Babette B. Weksler of Tenafly, N.J., donated $200. "I sent you one check in December as is our family custom for four generations," she wrote. "But reading that your receipts are less than expected, here is a supplement for those less fortunate who are helped by your wonderful fund."

HEADLINE: NOTEBOOK;
The Major League Cases of Minor League Jitters

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
The roster includes a two-time National League most valuable player, a pitcher with 287 career victories, the National League 1989 rookie of the year, the career leader in saves, the relief pitcher who is No. 5 on the career list in saves, the National League 1987 Cy Young Award winner, an eight-time All-Star catcher and an infielder who batted .320 in the first of the two successive seasons the Atlanta Braves have won the National League pennant.
Dale Murphy, Bert Blyleven, Jerome Walton, Jeff Reardon, Rich Gossage, Steve Bedrosian, Lance Parrish and Jeff Treadway are not on the same team, but they are teammates in what has become an increasingly popular game played by major league clubs. 
 The veterans are among 98 players with three or more years in the majors who have signed minor league contracts this winter. At least 20 other players who have played in the majors also have signed minor league contracts. Of the 129 players who have signed since declaring themselves free agents last November, 39, or 30 percent, are among the group of 98.
"There absolutely are more of these signings than ever before," Richard Moss, a veteran player agent, said. "They're coming down on a whole group of players."
 
Sometimes, No Room
 In some instances, a small minority, clubs sign players to minor league contracts because their 40-man major league rosters are full. Moss, for example, recently reached agreement with the Atlanta Braves on a minor league deal for Jay Howell, a free-agent relief pitcher, but "only after they convinced us that they did have a roster problem."
"There's no question that he would be part of the team," Moss said. "Still, it's difficult for a player to do that: come into camp with a minor league contract. Other guys look at him funny."
In most instances, clubs sign players to these contracts to save money. The Oakland Athletics lead the unofficial signing standings with eight, and Sandy Alderson, their general manager, explained the strategy.
"We have, we think, a strong nucleus of players, but we have a need to fill out the rest of our roster with players who will be complementary," Alderson said. "The problem is we have very little money to spend on those players, so we're hoping these guys will come into camp and compete for jobs. Some will earn positions, some won't. Meanwhile, we've preserved an option through camp, and when they make the major league roster, their salaries will be modest compared with some others. It is the only basis on which we would take some of these players."
 
Often, No Severance
 If a player with a nonguaranteed major league contract is released in spring training, he receives 30 days' or 45 days' pay, based on his salary. A player with a minor league contract receives nothing if he is released, unless his contract provides specifically for some payment.
Bedrosian, who will try to win a job after not pitching last year, will receive $50,000 if the Braves release him during spring training. Treadway, who signed with Cleveland, will receive $70,000 if released.
Treadway, released by the Braves after last season, earned $1,262,000 last year. His new contract calls for him to earn $10,000 a month in the minors, but if he wins a job with the Indians, he could make a maximum of $425,000 -- $300,000 in salary and an additional $125,000 in bonuses based on number of games and plate appearances.
In most cases, the minor league salary has no relevance because the player won't be playing in the minors.
"A lot of players sign these contracts with the understanding if they don't win a major league job, they're released," said Alan Meersand, an agent. "Most have no interest in playing minor league baseball. Most are under the assumption if they don't make the team, they get released and try somewhere else. Both sides are obligation free."
 
46 Pitchers Involved
 Although clubs like to be free of financial obligation, Moss sees the mushrooming system as potentially detrimental for some players.
"It's crazy for veteran pitchers," Moss said. "They know they have to make the team, so they're going to try to be impressive every time out in spring training, which isn't necessarily consistent with how they always have prepared for the season. There's a danger of doing too much too soon, throwing pitches you're not ready to throw, not resting the usual amount of time. It's destructive in some cases with veterans."
Yet 46 pitchers who have worked in the majors for three or more years have signed minor league contracts hoping to regain or maintain the status they have enjoyed.
"This is not all necessarily club motivated," Alderson said. "Some of these guys are coming to us looking for an opportunity and we're providing an opportunity on terms acceptable to us. The opportunity wouldn't be available if we had to give a guy a major league salary."
 
'Minor League' Roll Call
 The Athletics have signed pitchers Gossage, Bob Milacki, Curt Young and Jeff Ballard; catcher Rich Gedman, infielders Rafael Ramirez and Dale Sveum, and outfielder Gary Pettis.
Cincinnati has signed pitchers Reardon, Tim Burke and Bill Landrum; catcher Jamie Quirk, infielders Junior Noboa and Jeff Kunkel, and outfielder Tracy Jones.
Hubie Brooks has signed with Kansas City, Mike Bielecki with Cleveland, Dickie Thon with Milwaukee, Billy Ripken with Texas, Dick Schofield and Alfredo Griffin with Toronto, Charlie Hough with Florida, Wally Backman with Atlanta, Dave Smith with the Cubs, Bryn Smith with Colorado, and Parrish, Kevin Elster and Lee Guetterman with Los Angeles.
Alderson was asked if clubs, by making such widespread use of minor league contracts, were sending a message to players about the need to change the salary system.
"It's not a message so much as a practical response to the financial and roster situations that some clubs face," he said.
 
Have Mitt, Will Travel
 With spring training about to start, next week, some players are still seeking jobs. Jeff Russell, Mike Scioscia, Scott Sanderson, Walt Terrell, Pedro Guerrero and Willie Randolph are among the unemployed.
"I don't have anything at all for Pete now," said Tony Attanasio, agent for Guerrero, a 14-year major leaguer. "He was supposed to play in the off season in the Dominican, but there was some confusion over who had rights to him. It wasn't settled in a timely fashion and he never played."
Meersand, Terrell's agent, said the California Angels have expressed mild interest in the veteran pitcher, "but they're putting me off some more -- they're thinking about bringing him to camp on a minor league contract."
Sanderson is in a similar plight. A 15-year major leaguer, the 36-year-old right-hander is a free agent because the Yankees bought out the $2.5 million option year in his contract for $250,000. They shed him despite his status as their most successful pitcher (28-21) over the last two years. But Sanderson has become accustomed to such developments. The Athletics jettisoned him two years ago after he won 17 games for them.
 
From Boom to Bust
 From 1989 to '91, Kevin Mitchell hit more home runs (109) than any other player in the major leagues. Last season, 110 players hit more home runs than Mitchell.
Among the group that hit more than Mitchell's 9 home runs were two Davises, two Martinezes and two Vaughns; Mark Carreon, Chad Curtis and Jeff Blauser; Ron Karkovice, Damon Berryhill and nine other catchers, plus three members of the Kansas City Royals (Gregg Jefferies, Mike Macfarlane and Kevin McReynolds), the team with the fewest home runs in the American League.
In acquiring Mitchell a year ago, the Seattle Mariners departed from their penurious payroll policy, figuring Mitchell's prodigious power would enhance their offense and attract fans. Some people in baseball projected 50 home runs for him, because he would play 81 games at the Kingdome.
Mitchell, however, did not hit a home run in the first month of the season and wound up with only 5 home runs at the Kingdome and 4 on the road. Rib cage and foot injuries restricted his playing time in the last two months, but he already had become one of the major disappoinments of the season.
Now he has been traded to Cincinnati. But before making the deal, the Reds, like the Mariners a year ago, considered Mitchell's off-field performance.
When the Mariners acquired him, they said they were not concerned about his reputation for off-field trouble because Roger Jongewaard, a club vice president, signed Mitchell for the Mets a decade earlier and knew him well.
Jim Bowden, the Reds' general manager, said the club checked with players who have played with Mitchell and coaches and managers who have had him.
"We're satisfied with the kind of person Kevin Mitchell is," Bowden said.

HEADLINE: Secessionist Turmoil

 BODY:
Will the five boroughs of New York become four? The very idea once seemed inconceivable, but the Staten Island secessionist movement is accelerating so quickly that only a late dose of common sense is likely to stop it.
Blame Gov. Mario Cuomo and the Legislature for irresponsibly authorizing this misguided secession process in 1989. If Staten Island insists on going ahead, only they can overrule it. 
 At first, it seemed likely that economic realities would dampen secessionist fervor. But that argument is harder to make now that a state panel has called secession viable.
A report by the Staten Island Charter Commission reiterates that the borough contributes about $170 million less to New York City than it gets back in services. But the report also makes clear that in the view of expert consultants, an independent Staten Island would survive.
What kind of place would this new city be? The report, while useful as far as it goes, is so ambiguous and limited that it's impossible to tell. Staten Islanders, who vote next November on secession, are in the position of a spouse planning a divorce without knowing the terms. They don't even know whether property taxes would increase.
Yet polls show that Staten Islanders want out, because they feel left out. The borough once had the same single vote on the Board of Estimate as the more populous boroughs. But now, after charter reform, it has only 3 of 51 Council members. That translates into unjust treatment, say people in what they call "the forgotten borough."
The commission report shows otherwise -- that the Island still gets more than its fair share of services. What services would an independent Staten Island provide? The commission will never be able to determine that with certainty because there is no way to know now how the new city would choose to govern itself or, therefore, at what cost.
Would it cost more than the borough now contributes to the city, or less, to run a separate school system? Fire department? Sanitation department? Planning commission? Would Staten Island need a police department as sophisticated as New York City's? Or a bureaucracy as dense?
And what about the costs of building facilities like a city jail? What would it cost to create a new 911 system? To run water through New York City pipes? Who would own and operate the hated Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island, the last dump site in the city? Could an independent Staten Island afford the new elementary school the borough wants from the city's Board of Education?
The Charter Commission, a majority of whose members are Staten Islanders supporting secession, called most of those questions too speculative to answer. The commission can probe deeper during hearings over the next few months. But studies will not solve the quandary of secession because ultimately it is a matter of governance and social policy, not balance sheets.
Secession is fundamentally a bad idea. Not just because the unknowns make it risky for Staten Island. But primarily because it would tear the social and political fabric of the metropolis. It would be disruptive socially to New York City for a predominantly white borough to bow out based on emotion and unsubstantiated fears that it will be neglected. And it would be disruptive politically to undo the intricate balance of infrastructure, finances and services set in place over the years.
Staten Island joined with the other boroughs to form New York City in 1898. The experiment that is New York has worked ever since, however imperfectly. The union should not be splintered simply because one part, reacting to the political currents of the moment, hopes it would benefit by fleeing.

Justice Is Blind

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
Three things to begin with:
The first is that I know Kimba Wood, which is my good fortune.
The second is that if I had to choose three words to describe her, they would be these: integrity, decency, and intelligence. 
 And the third thing is that she does not have what is now known as a Zoe Baird problem, although she has been made to pay for Zoe Baird's sins.
Insiders predicted that Judge Wood, who sits on the Federal bench in New York and is best known for sentencing Michael Milken, would be named the first female Attorney General of the United States.
She went down to Washington and talked to the President and his wife, who were very impressed. Most people are. Three lawyers referred to her Thursday as a perfect choice in the space of a half-hour. She is married to a journalist, but this happens in the best of families.
The judge made a second trip to Washington, and leaks from Administration sources had it that the job was hers if the security check was clean. She took with her meticulous records of her tax payments and immigration documents for the person who has helped care for her son since his birth nearly seven years ago.
When she was asked whether she had a Zoe Baird problem, she answered no. She defined this as complying with the laws, the immigration laws and the tax laws -- doing those things Ms. Baird was lambasted for not doing.
She had hired a sitter who was not an American citizen in March 1986, when the law did not prohibit the hiring of undocumented workers. When the Immigration Reform and Control Act passed later that year, her sitter was one of thousands who were permitted to continue working and who became eligible for amnesty under its provisions. And with her help the sitter became a legal resident in 1987. Taxes had been paid on her salary from day one.
I consulted three immigration lawyers about that scenario. All said it was proper and legal.
But obeying the law was not what the Clinton people meant by a Zoe Baird problem. What they meant was a public relations problem, another week of people opining on radio call-in shows that the streets were crawling with American citizens dying to have the jobs we Yuppie Witches From Hell were handing over to exploited foreigners.
Three things to think about:
The streets are not crawling with American citizens who want child care jobs. This is said to be because we all pay slave wages.
Judge Wood paid her sitter about the same salary as a starting New York City schoolteacher, as well as providing room and board, which in New York is roughly equivalent to a trillion dollars.
One reason the employment pool may include so many foreign workers is that in many other countries the care of children is an honorable profession. In America, it is treated like scut work.
The Clinton people had a candidate of superb character who was proud that she had complied with the law in a world in which many professionals do not. But in seeking an Attorney General in the post-Baird atmosphere, the law was not the first concern.
Spin was.
Maybe Judge Wood should have volunteered the fact that her sitter had once been an illegal alien. Maybe the fact that she saw this as a matter of law and not as talk-show fodder attests to the difficulty she would have had playing politics. Maybe she should have anticipated that the Administration would think the American people were too stupid to make distinctions.
Maybe it is better that she not work with people who further justified their decision to cut her loose by adding their cheap-shot concerns that she had once spent five days training as a Playboy bunny when she was at the London School of Economics, a lifetime ago, around the time the young Bill Clinton was smoking dope at Oxford.
Live by Larry King, die by Larry King. Only the wrong person got killed off. This is our loss.
Three things to end with.
The next Attorney General will likely be a man.
When he is asked who took care of his children and he says "my wife," first member of the Judiciary Committee who makes a smart remark should be hammered.
No matter who the nominee is, it will be difficult for me to believe that his character is superior to that of Judge Wood.

HEADLINE: Car Import Duty Can Only Hurt U.S. Economy;
No to Gas Tax Hike

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Reading Mr. Clinton's Lips" (editorial, Jan. 28), on the Federal budget deficit and taxation, incorrectly asserts that there is a "sudden enthusiasm" by the American Petroleum Institute "for a national sales tax rather than a gasoline tax increase." 
 We have consistently opposed an increase in the gasoline tax to solve the deficit problem. We have consistently argued that insufficient restraint on Federal spending is the principal cause of the deficit, not a lack of revenue. Between 1989 and 1992, Federal spending rose more than twice as fast as revenues, which have remained relatively constant over the last 20 years. And we have consistently stated that if, after all feasible cuts are made, it is determined that more revenue is essential, then a European-style, value-added tax is the best approach. That has been our position since 1986, so our enthusiasm is anything but sudden.
A value-added tax, used in virtually every industrial country except the United States, would be the least harmful tax to our economy. This broad-based consumption tax -- applied to energy, as well as other commodities, goods and services -- would spread the burden uniformly and not penalize particular businesses or regions of the country. It can be adjusted to address regressivity by exempting necessities such as food, medical care or prescription drugs.
Unlike an energy tax, a value-added tax is well designed to accommodate trade because it is rebated on exports and levied on imports. Consequently, it won't destroy jobs. The United States has become the world's largest trading nation by value of exports and imports, meaning that trade consideration must play a central role in our national tax system.
As we've argued all along, gasoline taxes are rightly used to pay for the road and highway infrastructure, and spending restraint is an important part of solving the budget deficit problem. If taxes still are needed, then a European-style, value-added tax is the fairest and most efficient way to go.

Attention Shoppers: No More Parking Lot Tax Snoopers

 BODY:
When New York State's Commissioner of Taxation and Finance sent employees to northern New Jersey in December to write down the license plate numbers of New Yorkers shopping there and then sent them letters, he said the purpose was "educating people about their tax responsibility."
But many outraged consumers saw the snooping as a Big Brother-like invasion of privacy. Surprised but chastened, Commissioner James W. Wetzler now is calling the mission "an experiment that hasn't worked." He promises not to do it again. 
 While hardly anyone does, a New Yorker who makes a purchase in a state with a lower sales tax than New York's is supposed to pay New York the difference.
New Jersey allows stores in economically depressed places to charge a 3 percent sales tax, or half the normal rate, whichalso exempts clothing. By contrast,the combined state and local sales tax in Manhattan is 8.25 percent and in Suffolk and Nassau counties, 8.5 percent.
The missions were failures in terms of the taxes they generated. "The last time I asked, we had about $300 in response to these letters, which is my idea of insignificant," Mr. Wetzler said.

HEADLINE: Looking for an Attorney General: The Law;
NO LAW VIOLATED BY JUDGE IN 1986

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Judge Kimba M. Wood was right when she said she had violated no law in hiring an illegal immigrant to work as her baby sitter in March 1986.
It was not until eight months later, on Nov. 6, 1986, that Congress outlawed the hiring of illegal aliens, when President Ronald Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act. 
 Under the immigration law until that date, illegal aliens had no right to be in the United States but it was not illegal for Americans to employ them.
The prohibition on hiring illegal aliens took effect when the bill was signed. The law applied only to hiring that occurred after that date, and did not penalize people who continued to employ illegal aliens hired before it went into effect.
The 1986 law was passed after a bipartisan majority in Congress concluded that it was inconsistent, perhaps even hypocritical, to treat employer and employee so differently. The main purpose of the law was to curb the influx of illegal aliens, but recent studies by the Census Bureau show that the law has not achieved its goal.
 
Judge Defends Acts
 On Friday night, Judge Wood, who sits on the bench in Federal District Court in Manhattan, withdrew her name from consideration for Attorney General, declaring, "All of my acts were lawful." But she acknowledged that her baby sitter had been in the United States unlawfully from 1980 to December 1987, when she gained legal status under the amnesty provisions of the 1986 law.
Even under the old immigration law, it was forbidden to bring an illegal alien into the United States or to conceal or harbor an illegal alien. For such offense, the law authorized a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $2,000 fine.
But a provision of the old law, known informally as the Texas proviso, stipulated that the employment of illegal aliens "shall not be deemed to constitute harboring."
This section was called the Texas proviso because many Texans had taken advantage of it by hiring illegal aliens from Mexico and other countries south of the border.
Judge Wood said her baby sitter's visa was expired when she was hired in March 1986. Most aliens with expired visas had entered the United States legally but fell into illegal status when they stayed here longer than allowed by the Federal Government.
 
Concern About Practice
 Although Judge Wood's action in hiring an illegal alien was not prohibited in early 1986, there was a growing consensus in the mid-1980's, expressed by members of Congress, that the employment of illegal aliens was an undesirable part of the underground economy. Jobs were seen as a magnet that drew illegal aliens to the United States.
Given this consensus, as well as the strong public reaction to the case of Zoe Baird, President Clinton's first nominee for Attorney General who also withdrew after a firestorm over her employing two illegal aliens, it would have been politically awkward for Judge Wood to defend her hiring of an illegal alien at a confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The 1986 law was known by the names of its sponsors, Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, and Representative Romano L. Mazzoli, Democrat of Kentucky.
Charles Gordon, who was general counsel of the Immigration and Naturalization Service from 1966 to 1974, said that before passage of that law "there was no prohibition at all on employment of illegal aliens as household workers."
 
'This Is an Outrage'
 Commenting on Judge Wood's fate, Mr. Gordon said in an interview: "This is an outrage. It was never contemplated that the law would be used to penalize career people who needed assistance to help them in the care of children."
In a letter to the editor of The New York Times last month, Mr. Gordon said the 1986 law and its employer sanctions should be reconsidered because they were ineffective.
David Carliner, an immigration lawyer who has written a book on the rights of aliens, also said that Judge Wood had done nothing illegal.
"It was made quite clear by the Justice Department that employers hiring undocumented workers before that date were not in violation of the statute, which was a criminal statute," Mr. Carliner said in an interview. "The department made clear that employers would be able to continue employment of people in illegal status who were hired before Nov. 6."
Mr. Carliner said Judge Wood was being treated too harshly. "She is being penalized for an action that was not illegal or improper at the time she employed the baby sitter," he said. "She didn't violate the law. I don't understand why she should have any adverse judgment relating to her because of this situation. It was done by many employers, and none of them were prosecuted or penalized."

 CORRECTION:
A headline on Sunday about the relationship of the 1986 immigration law to the situation of Judge Kimba M. Wood referred imprecisely to the law's sanctions. Before it took effect, there was no legal bar to hiring an illegal immigrant. Afterward, such hiring, on a small scale, became a civil violation, not a crime.

HEADLINE: Crying Wolf Over Elephants

BYLINE: By Raymond Bonner; Raymond Bonner has lived in Africa for the past four years. This article is adapted from "At the Hand of Man: Peril and Hope for Africa's Wildlife," to be published in April by Alfred A. Knopf.

 BODY:
With great sadness I find I must write to tell you that the plight of Africa's wild elephants is far more desperate than I could have ever imagined." So began an "urgent memorandum" from the African Wildlife Foundation, a nonprofit conservation organization, to its members and potential donors on Feb. 10, 1988. Signed by Paul Schindler, the group's president, the appeal had been prepared by a California company skilled in direct-mail solicitation. It was designed to shock and raise money. It succeeded in both.
"In Kenya, there were 165,000 elephants just 15 years ago," the memorandum said. "Today only 20,000 remain." Of the 30,000 elephants that had roamed Tsavo National Park in Kenya in the 1970's, "the remaining 5,000 will be dead in 17 months." In Tanzania, half the 50,000 elephants in the Selous Reserve had been killed in the last eight years. In Uganda, 90 percent "of these beautiful animals have been wiped out." This "slaughter" was caused by the "insatiable greed of the ivory hunters." The memorandum concluded by declaring 1988 the "Year of the Elephant." 
 Three months later, at a Washington news conference at the National Zoo and in the yard of the zoo's African elephant, Nancy, Diana McMeekin, the organization's vice president, issued an appeal to American consumers: "Don't Buy Ivory."
The mailing and news conference were the beginning of one of the most intense conservation campaigns ever. The crusade to ban ivory was marked by increasing hyperbole and gruesome pictures of mutilated elephants and by public emotion and politics. It was a campaign in which conservation organizations paid homage to fund raising and membership. Groups that endorsed a ban found that there was money in elephants -- big money -- and, conversely, that failing to join the crusade might cost them members.
Only a few months before the news conference, McMeekin herself had been wearing ivory bracelets. The organization saw nothing wrong with it, and even now was proceeding with caution: it did not ask for a ban on ivory trading. Rather, the memo urged, "Don't buy ivory until the situation is brought under control!" The goal was to educate Americans that ivory products come from elephants. To have gone beyond that educational purpose, McMeekin said later, would have put the wildlife foundation on "the slippery slope to an extreme position." The extreme position was a total ban. "We felt that it would be arrogant and inappropriate for outsiders to tell Africa what to do about a natural resource of theirs."
In the spring of 1988, it would have been hard to find a scientist or conservationist with experience in Africa who did believe in a total ban as the solution to elephant poaching. "Outright bans would not solve the problem," one of Africa's pre-eminent conservationists, David Western, said at the time of the news conference. Western, who has a doctorate in ecology and was director from 1986 to 1990 of Wildlife Conservation International, the field research arm of the New York Zoological Society, went even further. A ban, he said "would exaggerate the problems with wildlife in Africa, because African nations use the revenue from ivory to help finance their conservation programs."
Even the most respected elephant researchers were not calling for a total ban in 1988. A ban, even a moratorium for 5 to 10 years, would be far from a solution to the problem, many thought. It might even "endanger elephants," Iain Douglas-Hamilton said in November 1988 at a meeting of representatives of African wildlife departments and Western conservationists, called to discuss the escalating problem of poaching. The African governments unanimously rejected the idea of a ban -- they didn't even like the foundation's call for a consumer boycott -- and Douglas-Hamilton's views were influential. He was "Mr. Elephant," a dashing Scotsman who had engaged in elephant research since the 1960's. In support of his argument, Douglas-Hamilton noted that in Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe, elephant populations were "well managed and well protected" and that those countries made money from the sale of ivory.
Nor did Cynthia Moss see the need for a total ban. Moss, who had begun her elephant research under Douglas-Hamilton's tutelage, had gone on to acquire well-earned fame for her work with elephants in the Amboseli National Park in Kenya. She had named the elephants -- Slit Ear and Torn Ear, Teddy, Tonie and Tilly -- watched them frolic, mate, become parents and die. Wanting other people "to know them, enjoy them and care about them," she wrote "Elephant Memories: Thirteen Years in the Life of an Elephant Family," which was published in 1988. Moss ended her book with a look to "future generations." It was grim. Poaching was going on at a far greater rate than anyone had realized. Still, she wrote, "The situation is depressing but it may not be irreversible." What was needed to reverse it was a "worldwide campaign to reduce the demand for ivory." Notably, she too stopped short of calling for a complete ban on trading.
In spite of all these reservations, a mere 17 months after the wildlife foundation asked Americans to refrain from buying ivory, the decision was no longer a matter of individual choice and conscience. In October 1989 at Lausanne, Switzerland, by a vote of more than two-thirds of the governments that are signatories to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, known as Cites, the elephant was declared an endangered species, joining, among others, the leopard, rhinoceros, gorilla, the California condor and the blue and fin whales. As a result of the designation, ivory trading became illegal.
The African Wildlife Foundation, which had overcome its professed concerns about appearing arrogant, had lobbied hard for the complete ban. But it wasn't the only organization or individual that had done a conservation flip-flop. By the time of the Cites vote, it was hard to find a conservationist who was willing to speak out publicly against a ban: Douglas-Hamilton and Cynthia Moss were on board, as was David Western, though he sought a compromise that would have allowed Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa, where poaching was not a serious problem, to trade in ivory after a moratorium of a couple of years.
What explains the dramatic shift? The short answer: public emotion and money.
All the organizations that called for a ban deny that they were motivated by anything other than the best interests of the African elephant, that if ivory trading were not made illegal it would be impossible to control poaching. Others demur.
"All groups that have used the elephant as a P.R. gimmick have made bundles, I mean bundles." Craig Van Note, executive vice president of Monitor, a Washington-based consortium of conservation and animal-welfare groups, told me during the Cites meeting in Lausanne. "Elephants are sexy," he said, adding that when it came to raising money, they were more alluring than dolphins or pandas and as popular as whales. From the moment the wildlife foundation started its elephant campaign, McMeekin says, the group was under pressure from the public relations company that did its fund raising to adopt a tougher line. She says the organization resisted, and when it did finally call for a complete ban in May 1989, it was only after "considerable soul-searching."
AT THE BEGINNING OF 1989, the African Wildlife Foundation was still of the view that a voluntary boycott was the only appropriate approach. But 1989 was the year of the environment. Time magazine's "Man of the Year" was the "Endangered Earth." There were fears about global warming, the greenhouse effect and a hole in the ozone. There were appeals to save Brazil's rain forests, outrage at an oil spill off the coast of Alaska and questions about what to do with the world's hazardous wastes. But no issue reached the public -- its heart and pocketbook -- as deeply as the African elephant. And as Western passions rose, so did the sums of money available to organizations that pandered to them.
The foundation escalated its "Don't Buy Ivory" campaign on Feb. 12, 1989, with a full-page Sunday ad in The New York Times. "Today, in America, Someone Will Slaughter an Elephant for a Bracelet," the ad declared over a picture of an elephant carcass. "In the past 10 years, the population has been sliced almost in half. In 1979 the total elephant population of Africa was estimated at 1,300,000. Today, less than 750,000 remain. Some 70,000 elephants are killed each year to meet the worldwide demand for ivory." At that rate, the elephant would disappear in Africa by 1999, the ad asserted. "It's a sickening thought. In 10 short years we could have to explain to children why there are no more elephants." The foundation asked readers to help stop "the slaughter" of African elephants by sending in a tax-deductible donation of $25, $50, $100 or more. It provided a coupon for the reader to clip or a toll-free number to call.
The response was staggering, beyond anything that the foundation, or Saatchi & Saatchi, the international advertising giant that provided its services without charge, had anticipated. It is unusual that an ad raises enough money to pay its cost; organizations place them anyway, to get their message across and their names before the public and in the hope of expanding their mailing lists with the names of people who write in. The Times ad cost $40,000. Twelve hundred people responded, and the organization received $42,526.
When the foundation had begun its elephant campaign in 1988, it was a small organization with 23,600 members, not very well known outside of a small circle of African wildlife aficionados; its budget was $1.8 million. By the end of 1989, it had 43,000 members, its donations had increased from $1.5 million to $2.5 million and it was established as a major force in the African conservation game. There is no doubt that the elephant campaign was a major factor in the organization's growth, McMeekin says, although the group also engaged in a membership drive during this period.
The International Wildlife Coalition was the next to get into what was becoming a very lucrative game, with an ad in The Times headlined "African Chainsaw Massacre," This organization claimed the elephant would be extinct by 1997, and it went on: "The last elephant to die will likely be a baby. . . . The last thing this baby will see before it dies will be its mother being killed and mutilated with a chainsaw." Founded in 1983, out of the growing popularity of animal rights, the organization hadn't paid much attention to elephants; it concentrated instead on saving whales, in 1988 spending more than $120,000 on that cause and only $11,000 on elephants (it even spent more on kangaroos and sea turtles than on elephants). The "Chainsaw Massacre" ad cost $22,000 and brought in $25,000, a phenomenal amount given the organization's size and its previous lack of devotion to elephants. In the following year, the organization says, it spent $170,000 on elephants.
It was not only in the United States that the elephant was loved and lucrative. In South Africa, the Endangered Wildlife Trust, one of the country's major conservation organizations with its headquarters in Johannesburg, raised nearly $150,000 from selling original elephant prints drawn and signed by the wildlife artist David Shepherd. That made it one of the most successful conservation appeals in South Africa, which has a strong and active environmental movement and consciousness. "We rode on the backs of elephants, and rhinos, for years," the trust's director, John Ledger, told me.
In Britain, the World Wide Fund for Nature, part of the international group known as W.W.F., sent out a four-page letter on behalf of the elephant in late 1988. Bland by the standards of the hyperbole being employed by the African Wildlife Foundation and other United States organizations, it used the word "slaughter" only once while noting the alarming decline of elephants in Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia. The mailing went to 50,000 people and raised 300,000 (more than $500,000). Seven months later, in July 1989, the fund sent out another elephant appeal. An additional 200,000 came in. That was twice as much as people sent in response to pleas for sea turtles and gorillas.
The British group initially had been opposed to the ban. But elephant poaching was the stuff of British tabloids, and The Daily Mail ran tear-jerking stories about baby elephants orphaned when their mothers were killed by poachers, providing coupons for readers to cut out and send to the organization, urging it to call for a ban on ivory imports. No less than 60,000 readers inundated the group with letters and telephone calls -- and 7,000 in donations.
At last, public pressure for a ban became too great and, worried about losing members, the group capitulated and voted to support a ban.
NO PLACE WAS THE conflict between good conservation and the mammon of fund raising more bitterly joined than at the World Wildlife Fund in Washington, also part of the international group known as W.W.F. (Probably best known by its panda logo, the Swiss-based group has national organizations in sometwo dozen countries.) Over a period of more than a year, in what seemed to be never-ending "blood and guts" meetings, the American group debated the ivory ban. Those individuals whose job it was to bring in money and members argued that the organization had to support a ban or else lose members, perhaps a large number. The conservationists opposed it. Among them were Rick Weyerhaeuser, who had studied elephants in Uganda and Tanzania and was the first program officer for Africa at the wildlife fund in Washington; Tom McShane, who had been a Peace Corps volunteer in Niger and had worked in Malawi, and Michael Wright, a vice president whose responsibility was the development of conservation policies that considered the needs of rural people.
Weyerhaeuser, McShane and Wright argued that a ban was bad conservation and bad for Africans, especially southern Africans. And they asked how the wildlife fund could endorse a ban and at the same time continue to support the doctrine of sustainable utilization. This doctrine, which had been incorporated into the landmark World Conservation Strategy of 1980, says in essence that the use of resources is permissible -- wise and rational use, but use nonetheless. They argued that it would be inconsistent and hypocritical for the fund, which had been one of the doctrine's sponsors, now to endorse a ban on ivory when it wasn't even clear that the species was endangered.
Though "conservation" has become a generic term embracing all efforts to save the environment and resources, initially it meant the careful and planned use of resources. Opposing the "conservationists" were the "preservationists," who argued on esthetic and ethical grounds that nature should be left undisturbed by man. Most conservationists are probably preservationists at heart: the principle of sustainable utilization was adopted not out of any philosophical commitment but out of the reality of the third world. As the World Conservation Strategy puts it, "Hundreds of millions of rural people in developing countries, including 500 million malnourished and 800 million destitute, are compelled to destroy the resources necessary to free them from starvation and poverty." The drafters of the World Conservation Strategy recognized that the poor of the world were going to use the resources around them to survive, notwithstanding philosophical and ethical appeals by wealthy Westerners. Therefore, they should be encouraged to use them in a sustainable way.
The most valuable resource in Kenya and many African countries is wildlife. One obvious way to "utilize" wildlife, to make money from it, is through tourism. But more directly profitable forms of sustainable utilization include killing crocodiles, leopards and zebras for their skins; impala, elands and wildebeests for their meat, and lions and buffalos for hunting trophies. Sustainable utilization also permits the killing of elephants for their ivory. In many rural districts of Africa, the sale of ivory from just 1 or 2 percent of the elephant population could generate substantial revenues, at least in comparison with the district's few other revenues, and in many cases would take the districts off the international dole. And allowing rural people to make money from elephants gives them a powerful incentive to protect the species from poachers.
In spite of its longtime commitment to the principle of sustainable utilization, however, the World Wildlife Fund in Washington was concerned that the concept was "not understood by the vast majority" of its members. "Most of these members are more traditionally orientated toward species 'preservation,' and there is little understanding of the complexities of conservation in Africa in the 1980's," two senior conservationists in Washington wrote in a 1988 memo. Failure to endorse a ban, they added, would have "a seriously detrimental effect on our membership." As Russell Train, the group's chairman, told me in 1991: "We're trying to bring our members along on utilization, but our development people, the fund-raisers, are very nervous because there is no question that the great majority of our membership are animal lovers and have difficulty making the evolution to a more sophisticated understanding of conservation."
It is indeed difficult to explain sustainable utilization in catchy slogans like "Only Elephants Should Wear Ivory" and "Ban the Bloody Ivory Trade" -- with "Bloody" in dripping red. A slogan like "Buy Ivory, Save Elephants" might not bring in major contributions but it would be honest -- by giving elephants an economic value, Africans would not only have an incentive to protect them but money with which to do it. Funds from the sale of ivory could be used for antipoaching measures and other conservation programs.
In the end, the fund-raisers at W.W.F. prevailed over the conservationists, and on June 1, 1989, the American branch announced that it "strongly endorsed" the proposal to ban the trade. The international reluctantly joined in. "We caved," Robert SanGeorge, the international spokesman, says simply, explaining the international's decision to endorse a ban. (A few days later, President Bush announced a unilateral ban on the importation of ivory.)
In calling for a ban, the fund not only sacrificed its principles but, it can be argued, abandoned most Africans as well. Zimbabwe, Botswana and a half dozen other African countries, which together have over half of the continent's elephants, never wavered in their opposition to a ban. In announcing its endorsement, the group said it was doing so "based on new scientific findings." The "findings" were the work of something called the Ivory Trade Review Group, which consisted of scientists, economists and conservationists. The group had been formed in mid-1988 by a variety of conservation groups, including W.W.F., to investigate the ivory trade and determine what effect it had on the declining elephant populations. On June 1, the trade review group called for a ban on ivory trading in a nine-page statement; eventually they would release a 700-page report. This report was the basis on which many conservationists who were originally opposed to a ban endorsed one. The recommendation for a ban, however, did not accurately reflect the views of all members of the group. The group's economists, for instance, opposed a ban. Four days before the release of the statement, David Pearce, a professor of environmental economics in London, had protested on behalf of his colleagues that depriving the African countries of ivory sales was the equivalent of a $50 million tax on their governments. Domestic ivory-carving industries would also be severely hurt. Pearce suggested the affected countries should be compensated by the West with $100 million a year. These views did not appear in the public statement.
The most serious reservation about the trade review group report, however, derives from the makeup of its contributors. When the group released its statement on June 1, it listed 25 contributors and two co-chairmen. All 27 were white. Fourteen were affiliated with British universities. And only one was a citizen of an African country -- David Western of Kenya. The final report listed 36 contributors, of whom four were African; none of these four had his name on any of the papers in the report.
AN ELEPHANT SPENDS 16 HOURS A DAY eating, and an average adult bull of six tons consumes 300 pounds of trees and grass and 50 gallons of water every day. A herd of elephants goes through an area like a slow tornado, snapping off branches and uprooting trees, leaving devastation behind. It is not just a matter of esthetics; the destruction of the woodlands by the elephants has meant the destruction of the habitat for other species.
From the perspective of giving people who are concerned about wildlife in Africa an accurate and honest basis on which to act, however, the most egregious omission from arguments made by advocates of a ban was recognition of the situation in other parts of Africa, particularly southern Africa. What was happening in East Africa -- particularly Kenya and Tanzania -- where poaching was out of control and the elephant numbers were declining, was not representative of all of Africa.
In Botswana, in Zimbabwe and in South Africa, the elephant, far from being endangered, has been increasing in numbers. World attention focused on Kenya, but the greatest concentration of elephants in East or southern Africa today is in Botswana -- around 56,000, which is double the number of elephants that existed there a decade ago. Zimbabwe's elephant population, according to the Government, has increased from 30,000 in 1979 to 52,000 today, which is more than double Kenya's elephant population, and Zimbabwe is considerably smaller in area. In South Africa, which has the best-run wildlife department on the continent, the elephant population has remained stable and poaching has been negligible.
Even in parts of Kenya there are too many elephants. It is true that Kenya's elephant population has declined sharply, to about 20,000. But given the country's growing human population and its need for land on which to grow food, that is the maximum number of elephants the country can tolerate. Richard Leakey, the head of the Kenya Wildlife Service, has said their number will have to be kept between 16,000 and 18,000.
In Amboseli National Park, where Cynthia Moss does her research, there are only 800 elephants, but that is more than the park can handle. The park has been ravaged by the elephants; it looks like someone has dropped napalm on it, the trees dead or dying. Because of the loss of their habitat to the elephants, there are fewer impala, giraffes, bushbabies and monkeys; kudus, bushbuck and genet have disappeared. Everyone agrees, including Moss and Leakey, that the number of elephants must be reduced or at least controlled. Leakey is hoping that some method of birth control for elephants will be developed. But if it isn't, he is prepared to take a more radical step than selling ivory from a few elephants. "If we cannot control the numbers by any other method, we will have to cull," he told me in August. That would be far more controversial than selling ivory, because it involves killing entire elephant families.
The ivory-ban advocates in the yearlong debate prior to the decision at Lausanne conveniently neglected to mention these facts about the situation in southern Africa and about there being too many elephants in Kenya, and they weren't generally known to the public during the ivory-ban crusade. Paul Schindler, president of the African Wildlife Foundation, wrote to officials from W.W.F. who were criticizing the "urgent memorandum" as being emotional and misleading: "None of us may like the hyperbole that has insinuated itself into the direct-mail business, but Americans are all too familiar with it. A random sampling of U.S. direct-mail appeals will inform you that the last rhinos alive now are headed toward extinction, or that your children's children will have to learn about whales, pandas, etc. from books, because none will exist unless you send in some dollars."
Schindler noted that when he had come on as the African Wildlife Foundation's president, he had been given some friendly and collegial advice by Russell Train, who had founded the group and later, after serving as head of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, became the president of the World Wildlife Fund in Washington, where he is currently chairman. The direct mail fund-raisers at the fund had advised Train that although he wrote very well, it would be best if he let the fund-raising specialists write the letters and he would just sign them, Schindler said.
"He complied," he added, "and those ghostwritten letters have raised millions."
In essence, Schindler's argument was: Yes, we may be guilty of using hyperbole to raise money, but everyone does it. It was the only defense he had, and it was revealing, unintentionally, about the conservation game, where raising money is often more important than the truth or good conservation.

 CORRECTION:
An article in The Times Magazine on Feb. 7 about efforts to protect elephants misstated amounts spent by the International Wildlife Coalition for preservation in 1988. In the fiscal year that began on May 1, 1988, it spent $52,370 on elephants, $34,757 on kangaroos, $40,841 on sea turtles, $72,727 on large whales and $1,233,932 on its whale adoption project, according to the group's financial statement. (The figures were not $11,000 for elephants and $120,000 for whales.)

GRAPHIC: Photos: Paul Schindler, president of the African Wildlife Foundation, and Diana McMeekin, the group's vice president, demonstrated the validity of an old fund-raising maxim: Hyperbole gets results.

 BODY:
DEAR I.R.S.:
 In all this flap over Zoe Baird and her illegal Peruvian couple, a few facts about what we parents owe the I.R.S. got clarified. It turns out -- gosh, I really had no idea -- that I should have been filing a tax return for anyone who works in my house who earns more than $50 a quarter. That doesn't include what you call Independent Contractors -- recognizable because they bring their own tools. So I can skip the plumber, the exterminator and the guys from the Christian Brothers Cleaning Company, who shampoo the wall-to-wall carpet. (Christian, as in Born Again. They take prayer breaks.) But there are a lot of others. Not because I'm in the big time, domestically speaking. I'm no Zoe Baird with two full-time helpers. Rather, like lots of Americans, I use a patchwork of sitters. I just can't quite get this child-care thing streamlined. 
I realize I've been shirking my responsibilities, and I'd like to set about rectifying that immediately by confessing and filing.
 So here goes. Up to the start of 1992 I always had an au pair to take care of my two children, now ages 6 and 9, while my husband and I were at work. The au pairs were legal, part of an I.R.S.-and-Immigration-approved program. Unfortunately, we moved last year and lost our extra bedroom. Our fifth and final au pair returned to Ireland at the end of 1991.
 In January I hired Earleen, an American citizen, to pick up my children at school at 3 and baby-sit till 6:30. At $7.50 an hour, she earned $131.25 a week. She had children of her own and was eligible for Medicaid, which she would have lost if she declared the income from the job with me. On March 10, after Earleen failed to show up for the third time, I fired her. Actually, I had also begun to suspect, from the number of phone calls from men that inundated our house every afternoon, that she was running another business on the side. Andy, the carpenter who was trying to make a closet into a bedroom for our son -- he brought lots of tools, believe me -- was of the same opinion. Maybe she could have afforded health insurance after all.
 I was pretty frantic after dismissing Earleen, and so when a friend suggested that a young woman she knew named Alecksandra could fill in for a couple of months, I said yes. Alecksandra, I have to admit, was an illegal alien -- from Croatia. She'd come as a legal au pair a few years earlier when her country was still Yugoslavia, and now although she wanted to go home, she agreed to stay here, at her parents' urging, until summer, when they hoped things might be calmer. She'd most recently been working for a family from 8 to 6, including housecleaning, for $60 a week. Alecksandra was nice -- and available -- and really needed a job, so I hired her. On Memorial Day weekend, she and her boyfriend went to Niagara Falls. She decided it would be fun to cross the bridge into Canada. Needless to say, Immigration would not permit her to return. You can reach her in Zagreb, or possibly in Berlin, where I think she has since emigrated.
 In some desperation, I turned to Barnard College, which has a baby-sitting service. There I found Gail, who was looking for a short-term job. I paid her a total of $495 for three weeks' part-time work.
 Before I forget, I should mention Margaret, who comes once a week to clean. She is an American citizen married to the Sardinian super in the building up the street. She works around her children's school schedules, which means not during the summer, Christmas or spring vacations. At $60 a week, her total comes to $2,160 for the year.
 On June 15, the kids began attending the summer day program run by a nearby church, tax ID number 13-2870343. I was completely legal for two and a half months.
 Every once in a while, we go out at night, and then we hire Yvette, at $7.50 an hour. For a five-hour evening out, that comes to $37.50. Yvette, also an illegal alien, from Paris, is applying for a student visa. She comes for Christmas and birthdays, as a guest -- no pay, I promise. I'll have to go over my calendar to add up her total hours of baby-sitting.
 In July a friend lent us his house on Cape Cod, and when we left we hired the wife of the motel owner down the road to clean. We paid her $60. I can't remember her name but the motel was called something like the Sea Pines, in Truro. Or maybe it was the Whispering Pines. Well, she had red hair. I wish I could say she brought her own rag mop, but she didn't.
 For September and the beginning of the new school year, I decided to really get organized. I hired two baby sitters from Barnard, one to work Monday, Tuesday and Friday afternoons, one to work Wednesday and Thursday. For three afternoons, Lydia gets paid $90. For two, Amanda gets $55. So that's a total of $1,530 for Lydia, $990 for Amanda.
 Lydia was out sick for a week in December and her roommate Bob filled in, so that's $90 for Bob. I don't know his last name but he lives in the East Village.
 Let me see. That's Earleen, Alecksandra, Gail, Margaret, Yvette, the Motel-Keeper's Wife, Lydia, Amanda and Bob.
 I called Jim Weikart of Weikart Tax Associates, who tells me I need the following forms. To start with, an SS-4, to apply for an Employer Identification Number. I also need -- one for each employee -- I.R.S. Form 942 to be filed quarterly with payments totaling 15.3 percent of wages in Social Security and Medicare taxes. Four copies per employee of the W-2 form. The W-3 Form, which is the cover for the W-2. I only need one W-3 for all the W-2's. And I need a Federal Unemployment Form 940-EZ.
 Now -- whoops, I guess it's a little late for this -- but Jim says I was also required by law to have Earleen, Alecksandra, Gail, Margaret, Yvette, the Motel-Keeper's Wife, Lydia, Amanda and Bob fill out W-4 forms before they began work, as well as a Form I-9, stating that they're American citizens. And of course they should have been filing their 1040's. Let me know what I owe.
 This doesn't concern you, but Jim says we also have to file New York State Unemployment IA 5 quarterly, and WT-4-A and 4-B annually, to report how much, if any, I'm withholding in New York State and City taxes (does that mean I don't have to do this?). I may also have to file New York State Workers' Compensation and Disability Insurance forms, depending on the number of hours an employee works. Jim isn't sure, since this isn't taxes.
 I know I'm late getting to this, but I really want to come clean. As of March 30, 1993, you'll be getting my quarterly forms. Assuming all remains stable in my house, I'll be filing for Lydia, Amanda, Margaret, Yvette, Bob and the Motel-Keeper's Wife, since we plan to go back to Cape Cod for a week in July. That's at least five Federal forms per worker, one filed quarterly and one sent to four different places, and three state forms for each filed quarterly, adding up to 138 forms total for the year. For me.
 Lydia, Amanda, Margaret, Yvette, Bob and the Motel-Keeper's Wife will also be filing. By my calculation, you and the state will be getting 42 forms from them.
 Gee, it strikes me that I may have to hire somebody full time before I get to this. And you all at the I.R.S. will probably need to do some hiring to handle the paper work too.
 Just think what we both will be contributing to combating unemployment.
